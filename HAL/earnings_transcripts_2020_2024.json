Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Abu Zeya, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nAbu Zeya: Good morning and welcome to the Halliburton fourth quarter 2020 conference call. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton\u2019s website for 7 days. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President, and CEO and Lance Loeffler, CFO. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton\u2019s views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton\u2019s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019; Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2020; recent current reports on Form 8-K; and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of impairments and other charges. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our fourth quarter earnings release and can also be found in the quarterly results and presentation section of our website. After our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow time for others who maybe in the queue. Now, I will turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Thank you, Abu, and good morning everyone. Let me start by looking back at the year that just ended. 2020 was a year like no other. We faced a global pandemic, record oil demand destruction, and an unprecedented downturn in the energy industry. Despite these turbulent times, Halliburton demonstrated resilience and performed consistently with our execution culture. Before we get to our results, I want to address our outstanding employees. I thank you for your hard work and execution throughout the entire year. You answered the call for safety, collaboration, and service quality and delivered for Halliburton\u2019s customers and our shareholders. Now, I want to highlight a few of our 2020 accomplishments. We delivered historic bests in all of our key safety and service quality metrics, recordable injury rate, lost time injury rate, vehicle incident rate, environmental recordable rate, and non-productive time. Each of these key metrics improved by over 20% and most did so for the second year in a row. This was a result of our employees\u2019 continued commitment to safety and process execution despite the year\u2019s distractions. Total company revenue of $14.4 billion outperformed the global rig count decline of 38% demonstrating the strength and diversity of our business. Our swift and decisive cost actions and service delivery improvements reset our earnings power, allowing us to deliver resilient margin performance. Our completion and production division finished the year with close to 16% operating margins, exiting the year higher than where they started. These results highlight the success of our structural cost reductions and process improvements. Our drilling and evaluation division had a strong, full-year margin performance despite the rig count declines experienced in all regions. We delivered over $1.1 billion of free cash flow for the year, demonstrating our ability to generate strong free cash flow throughout different business environments. We increased the breadth and depth of our digital offerings and delivered best-in-class performance across the spectrum of digital technologies, and we successfully launched Halliburton Labs, a collaborative environment where entrepreneurs, academics, investors, and industrial labs come together to advance cleaner, affordable energy. Now, let me share a few points about our fourth quarter performance. We finished the quarter with total company revenue of $3.2 billion, a 9% sequential increase and adjusted operating income of $350 million, an increase of 27% sequentially. This marks the first quarterly revenue increase since the activity declines began last March. Our completion and production division revenue increased 15% sequentially, while operating income improved 33% resulting in an operating margin improvement of 2% over the prior quarter. Our drilling and evaluation division revenue and operating income grew 2% and 11% respectively. Higher rig activity in the Western Hemisphere was offset by rig count declines in the Eastern Hemisphere. International revenue remained flat sequentially. Activity in Latin America improved for the second quarter in a row. Activity declines continued in other regions, but at a slower pace compared to the prior quarters. And lastly, our North America revenue increased 26% sequentially, driven primarily by increases in both drilling and completions activity in U.S. lands. Our overall strong performance was a direct result of our focus on the key strategic priorities that define Halliburton\u2019s path now and into the future. We are focused on profitable growth in our strong international franchise, and we are driving strategic changes in North America and building a leaner and more profitable business. We are accelerating the deployment and integration of digital technologies both internally and with our customers. We are driving capital efficiency by advancing our technologies and making strategic choices that lower our CapEx profile, and we are an active participant in advancing a sustainable energy future. As we start the new year, we believe that the worst is behind us and look to the future with optimism. Oil prices are back to pre-pandemic levels driven by global vaccine distribution and unfolding demand recovery, OPEC+ discipline, and a declining production base. However, some caution is appropriate due to the surge in COVID-19 infections globally and the expected gradual return of spare production capacity. Our five strategic priorities will continue to drive Halliburton\u2019s success as markets around the world stabilize and start to grow. We believe that aligning our actions with these priorities will boost our returns and free cash flow generation both today and as the recovery unfolds. We set these priorities according to our long-term view of the market. As oil demand recovers, we expect to see favorable market dynamics and the beginning of a multiyear energy up-cycle. However, we believe this recovery will look different than prior cycles. International short cycle producers will have an opportunity to gain share. North American E&Ps will increase spending from current levels that will take a more disciplined approach to growing production in the future. We believe that the overall cost and environmental impact of producing oil and gas will continue to decline due to innovation and technology adoption. As a result, oil and gas will remain a critical and significant component of the energy mix. I expect that our gains achieved in 2020, including service delivery improvements, structural cost reductions, and capital efficiency are firmly in place and sustainable. Halliburton is uniquely positioned in all markets and is prepared to deliver on both our customer expectations and our shareholder objectives. Our strong international business outperformed the market. Our full year international revenue declined 17%, while rig counts and customer spending were down more than 20%. All regions except Latin America declined in the fourth quarter, but at a slower pace. In the first quarter, we expect international activity to be impacted by typical weather-related seasonality and the absence of year-end product sales. Activity should bottom during the first quarter and improve as the year unfolds. For the full year, we expect activity recover very widely across regions. Latin America will continue with upward momentum off a very low bottom both onshore and offshore. Asia-Pacific is also showing signs of activity improvement. We believe parts of Europe and West Africa will remain slow, especially in the deepwater areas. As for the Middle East and Russia, we believe they will manage activity based on expectations of the economic and demand recovery. While the pace of recovery depends on the trajectory of demand improvement, we believe the second half of this year could see a low double-digit increase in international activity year-on-year. Halliburton is well positioned to benefit from this increase. Let me be clear, our target is profitable growth. Against a tough activity backdrop in 2020, we remained focused on increasing profitability and our actions resulted in overall international margin improvement. In 2021, we expect that several factors will continue to drive Halliburton\u2019s profitable international growth, Halliburton will benefit from our improved position in the international market cycle. We are stronger, technically, geographically and organizationally. We have exposure to mature fields, completions and interventions work, a deck of resilient integrated contracts around the world, leveraged to unconventional developments in Latin America and the Middle East and a leading position in key active offshore areas. While the international sales cycle tends to be longer, we now have line of sight to activity increases in the coming quarters. Tender activity has picked up recently led by the NOCs in the Middle East and Latin America and new opportunities are emerging with operators in other regions. Our customers have also pulled forward mobilization plans for various contracts awarded to Halliburton that were put on hold due to the pandemic. Our new drilling technologies are penetrating the market and gaining customer confidence. For example, we exited the year with a threefold increase in our EarthStar deep resistivity sensor revenue. As activity recovers, our technology provides us with a tremendous opportunity to profitably grow revenue. We see significant growth potential in the continued international expansion of our production businesses, especially in mature fields around the world. For example, the international artificial lift market tends to be more resilient and as longer cycle. Once an operator puts its field on the specific form of lift, it typically stays on it for many years. We are currently mobilizing for our first multiyear electric submersible pump contract in the Middle East and are excited about the opportunities artificial lift opens for us in the region. The construction of our specialty chemicals plant in Saudi Arabia continues to progress towards final completion. When it is complete, Halliburton will have a differentiated value chain in the region that maximizes local content, delivers customized solutions more quickly and shortens customer lead times. I am excited about these two new additions to our international portfolio that provide us with unique growth opportunities. Finally, adoption of Halliburton\u2019s digital solutions helps our customers to reduce cost per barrel, improve project economics and increase efficiencies. Our Halliburton 4.0 digital offerings in subsurface, well construction and reservoir and production create differentiation and margin growth opportunities for Halliburton. We are pleased that in 2021 several international oil companies are deploying DecisionSpace 365 cloud applications to streamline and automate their well construction activities. I believe that digital and other technology advances, geographic expansion of our products and services, along with continued discipline in cost management and capital efficiency should allow Halliburton to continue delivering profitable returns driven growth in the international markets. Turning to North America, the strategic actions we took last year reset Halliburton\u2019s earnings power in this critical, but structurally smaller market. We are the leader in North America and the only integrated oilfield services companies still active in the hydraulic fracturing market. In the fourth quarter, our North America business took advantage of the recovery in completions and drilling activity and delivered continued margin improvement even without improved pricing. Completion stage counts increased in the oil basins, but declined modestly in the gas plays. While the U.S. land rig count recovered from its August 2020 low of 230 rigs, it is still 60% below the pre-pandemic levels. Private and small operators added the most rigs, while large E&Ps and majors moved more slowly. We expect completions activity in North America to continue improving in the first half of 2021 as commodity prices remained supportive and customers complete their backlog of DUCs. Customer consolidation will likely continue and we expect most operators will remain committed to a disciplined capital program. For the full year, provided that the impact of the pandemic moderates, economic activity continues to increase and oil price remains solid. I am optimistic that our customers will sustain activity in order to hold their production flat to 2020 exit levels with completion spend outpacing drilling. I am excited about Halliburton\u2019s future in North America and here is why. We completed the most aggressive set of structural cost reductions in our history, giving us meaningful operating leverage in a recovering market. We also made significant changes to our processes that drive higher contribution margin, for example, how we perform equipment maintenance and provide engineering support. We believe the benefits of these changes will have a meaningful impact on our margins as activity picks up. The hydraulic fracturing market structure continues to improve. Utilization of our active equipment is higher than it was at the beginning of last year. The market has continued to rationalize and consolidate. We are seeing competitors either cannibalize idle equipment for parts or use it to beef up working fleets thus increasing average horsepower per fleet. This will make equipment reactivation to meet growing demand a lot harder for capital constrained companies and should only accelerate supply and demand balancing. As activity starts to increase, Halliburton has a unique competitive advantage and sufficient capacity to respond without adding incremental capital. Our in-house engineering capabilities to refurbish maintain and continuously improve our fracturing and perforating equipment minimize the cost and time to deliver the necessary equipment to our customers and take advantage of the market recovery. We are also well positioned to profitably grow in our competitive non-hydraulic fracturing businesses in North America. For example, in 2020, our artificial lift business developed and implemented new digital capabilities, increased remote operations jobs, and solidified its strong market position in North America. We also expect our well construction technology investments to best position Halliburton to outperform as drilling rigs return. Using the Halliburton 4.0 digital framework, we continue to collaborate and engineer solutions that maximize our customer\u2019s asset value. Last quarter, we launched our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing system and successfully completed a customer engagement in West Texas. SmartFleet is an industry first, where intelligent automation manages and executes live treatment decisions to optimize subsurface fracture outcomes. By using SmartFleet, the operator was able to consistently visualize and measure fracture propagation and control fracture placement through automation. Importantly, the system provided a level of subsurface control that was previously not possible and enabled the customer to actively drive their completion outcomes in real time. We are building on this success with multiple customer commitments across different basins. I believe this is the biggest step forward in fracturing technology in a long time. Let me give you a few more examples of how we are accelerating Halliburton 4.0 digital adoption. In the North Sea, we have successfully delivered the first fully automated cement job for the offshore cementing unit executed the work without human intervention. This is an important milestone in reaching the vision of fully autonomous offshore well construction that has significant implications for efficiency, safety and operating costs. In 2020, we more than tripled the number of DecisionSpace 365 users on the iEnergy cloud platform. Our customers also increased adoption of the DecisionSpace 365 asset simulator. Operators in Europe, Latin America and Asia ran over 3,000 reservoir simulation scenarios on the iEnergy cloud with speeds of up to 7x faster than with conventional on-premise simulators. Finally, we are teaming up with Accenture to drive the digital transformation of our supply chain. This will result in process efficiencies across large volumes of transactional activities, lower our overall cost, and free up resources to drive strategic decision-making and support of our operational requirements. Next, I want to discuss capital efficiency, a key enabler of our other strategic priorities, leveraging new materials and design approaches as well as digital innovation. We have been able to significantly reduce CapEx requirements and extend the life of our equipment. We are continuing our iCruise drilling system deployment and are reaping the benefits of a reduced CapEx profile and higher asset velocity. Technology advancements in multiple product service lines in both divisions are allowing us to improve design and service configuration to save time and money both for our customers and Halliburton. Finally, I would like to highlight several important actions we took in alignment with our strategic priority to participate in advancing a sustainable energy future. We are working to reduce the carbon footprint and environmental impact of our own operations and have committed to setting targets through the science-based targets initiative to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. With this commitment, Halliburton joins over 1,000 global companies taking science-based climate action. This is important in our journey to align with the latest climate science and contribute to sustainable energy advancement. We are also collaborating with our customers to produce oil and gas more efficiently, while reducing their emissions. We are currently performing the first electric grid powered fracturing operation for Cimarex Energy in the Permian Basin. With over 300 stages on multiple wells already completed, Halliburton\u2019s electric-powered equipment has allowed the customer to achieve pump rates that were 30% to 40% higher than conventional pumps by utilizing the maximum grid power potential. Grid-powered electric spreads require substantially less capital, a smaller footprint and are more efficient compared to turbine power. When demand for emission reduction solutions translates to better pricing, I expect we will replace within our planned capital budget some of our conventional fracturing capacity with electric over the course of a normal equipment replacement cycle. Halliburton is starting the new year with a clear sense of purpose. We believe that our strategic priorities are the right ones and our margins in the fourth quarter demonstrated that. We are confident that the actions we have taken are sustainable and we are well-positioned both internationally and in North America for the unfolding market recovery. I will now turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our financial results. Lance?\nLance Loeffler: Thank you, Jeff. Let\u2019s begin this morning with an overview of our fourth quarter results compared to the third quarter of 2020. Total company revenue for the quarter was $3.2 billion, an increase of 9% and adjusted operating income was $350 million, an increase of 27%. During the fourth quarter, we recognized approximately $450 million of pre-tax impairments and other charges primarily related to the fair value adjustment of our real estate assets in North America. As part of our 2020 structural cost reduction initiatives, we reduced the amount of real estate required to run our business. In the second quarter, we decreased our real estate use in North America by roughly 50% by closing, selling, consolidating and reducing the size of many facilities. Subsequently, we conducted a detailed analysis on how we own, lease and operate our remaining real estate footprint. As a result, we concluded that a structured transaction is likely to be advantageous in managing the majority of our North American real estate, which led to the fair value adjustment I just discussed. This initiative is consistent with our strategic priority to achieve capital efficiency in our business, while allowing us to retain flexibility and drive future operating benefits. Let me take a moment to discuss our divisional results in more detail. In our completion and production division, revenue increased $236 million or 15%, while operating income increased $70 million, an increase of 33%. These increases were driven by higher activity in multiple product service lines in North America, increased stimulation activity in Argentina and Kuwait, higher completion tool sales in Africa, Southeast Asia and Norway, and increased well intervention services internationally. These increases were partially offset by lower pressure pumping activity in Saudi Arabia and lower completion tool sales in Eurasia and Australia. Our drilling and evaluation revenue increased $26 million or 2%, while operating income grew by $12 million, or an 11% increase. These increases were primarily due to higher drilling related services in North America and Brazil, increased wireline activity in North America and Latin America as well as higher fluid sales in Asia-Pacific and Guyana and increased software sales across all regions. Partially offsetting these increases were lower drilling-related services and project management activity in Europe/Africa/CIS, the Middle East and Mexico as well as reduced wireline activity in Asia-Pacific and Saudi Arabia. Moving on to our geographical results, in North America, revenue increased $254 million, a 26% increase. These results were driven by higher activity in stimulation and artificial lift in U.S. land as well as higher well construction and wireline services activity and year end completion tools and software sales. Latin America revenue grew $46 million or 12%, resulting primarily from increased pressure pumping and wireline activity in Argentina and activity increases in multiple product service lines in Colombia and Ecuador as well as higher fluid sales in Guyana and drilling services in Brazil. These increases were partially offset by reduced activity across multiple product service lines in Mexico. Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue was modestly down by $7 million or a decrease of 1%, resulting primarily from reduced drilling related services and completion tool sales in Eurasia, coupled with lower drilling related activity in Norway. These results were partially offset by higher completion tool sales in Africa, Norway and Continental Europe as well as increased stimulation and well intervention services in Algeria and Continental Europe. Middle East Asia revenue declined $31 million, or 3%, largely attributed to lower activity in multiple product service lines in Saudi Arabia, reduced drilling activity in United Arab Emirates and decreased project management activity in India. These decreases were partially offset by higher drilling-related services in China, Australia and Malaysia, increased stimulation activity in Kuwait, and higher software sales across the region. In the fourth quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $49 million and we expect it to be approximately the same in the first quarter of 2021. Net interest expense for the quarter was $125 million and should remain essentially flat in the first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 19%. Based on the market environment and our expected geographic earnings mix, we expect our 2021 first quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 25%. We generated approximately $638 million of cash from operations during the fourth quarter and delivered over $1.1 billion of free cash flow for the full year. As a result, we ended the year with approximately $2.6 billion in cash. We will continue to prioritize reducing leverage in the near-term and intend to pay down $685 million of debt coming due this year with cash on hand. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $218 million with our 2020 full year CapEx totaling approximately $730 million. In 2021, we intend to keep our capital expenditures relatively flat at $750 million. We believe that with this level of spend we will be well-equipped to take advantage of the unfolding recovery. Finally, let me provide you with some comments on how we see the first quarter playing out. As is typical, our results for the first quarter of 2021 will be subject to weather-related seasonality and the roll-off of year-end product sales, which primarily impact our international and Gulf of Mexico businesses. While we anticipate a slower than normal start to the year in some international regions, we also expect activity momentum in North America to continue with completions activity outpacing drilling activity. As such, in our completion and production division, we expect revenue to increase 3% to 5% sequentially and operating margins to decline 150 to 200 basis points largely due to a different business mix. In our drilling and evaluation division, we anticipate a low single-digit revenue increase sequentially, with operating margins expected to increase by 50 to 75 basis points. I will now turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff?\nJeff Miller: Thanks, Lance. To sum up, Halliburton is focused on executing our key strategic priorities to deliver industry leading returns and solid free cash flow for our shareholders. Our strong international business is expected to continue its profitable growth and market outperformance as the international activity ramps up throughout the year. In the critical North American market, our business is recovering and demonstrating margin improvement. Digital is gaining traction, growing our revenue and helping us and our customers increase operational efficiency and reduce costs. Our capital efficiency enabled by technology and service delivery improvements is expected to contribute to solid free cash flow generation and our commitment to a sustainable energy future will ensure we play a role in advancing cleaner and more affordable energy solutions. I am optimistic about the future. While the 2020 downturn was deeper and more widespread than anything we have seen before, I am encouraged by the changes we implemented to solidify Halliburton\u2019s role in the unfolding economic recovery for oil and gas remains vital. Strong execution on our strategic priorities will allow Halliburton to continue to power into and win this recovery. And now, let\u2019s open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nJames West: Hey, good morning, Jeff, Lance, Abu.\nJeff Miller: Good morning, James.\nLance Loeffler: Good morning.\nJames West: And well done in North America in reinventing yourself there and creating a much more valuable asset, and while it\u2019s a structurally lower market or smaller market, you have created a nice cash flow machine there. Is it the \u2013 the question in my mind and you gave some color around this, Jeff, but I wanted to dig in a little further is the outlook for the full year \u201821. With North America, I know you mentioned -- you feel like the momentum is still good, but I guess first is there some peak that we are going to see or some stabilization of activity as the companies remain capital disciplined which should get back to kind of this maintenance level? And then on the international side, it sounds like you have called the bottom in 1Q, some pick up in 2Q, but the magnitude of the pickup in the second half, what\u2019s your confidence level on that pickup?\nJeff Miller: Yes, thanks, James. Let me start with North America and then start with \u2013 I am more optimistic today than I certainly was 90 days ago, and 2021 will feel better than the second half of 2020 annualized.\nJames West: Okay.\nJeff Miller: So what\u2019s important is we see momentum coming into the year and it looks steady for the remainder and that\u2019s predicated on customers, I think will be certainly rationale and capital disciplined, but I think there is also pressure to hold production flat in 2021, which creates a bit of a floor as we look at the full year.\nJames West: Okay.\nJeff Miller: From an international perspective, I feel confident around the international recovery. And I think in terms of magnitude into the second half of 2021, we believe or I believe we will be up low-double digits. So, that\u2019s fairly solid and that\u2019s based on the tender pipeline that we are seeing and the types of barrels that are produced shorter cycle, I think, will lend themselves to that type of uptick. And maybe one last word on international outlook, I mean, I think we view 2021 as a bit of a transition year. I mean, 2020 was the worst in our history, and we view 2022 as when we see the global rebalancing of supply and demand, which creates the sort of underpinning of a multi-year upcycle, and so that we see Q1 as a bottom and then steadily building from there. That\u2019s the kind of momentum that we really like to see going into that supply and demand sort of coming into balance.\nJames West: Okay, okay. And then the tendering process internationally that\u2019s occurring. Are these chunky projects with big rooms or is it more smaller or is it kind of ramping of projects that had maybe ramped downwards, ramping back up, what\u2019s the kind of the nature of those tenders?\nJeff Miller: We are seeing some tenders, some big ones, also seeing some extensions of existing work. So, it\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag at this point, but visibility we have are of not all chunky though. Again, I think the extensions are important also to create sort of that steady momentum that we are talking about.\nJames West: Right, okay. Thanks, Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Thank you, James.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Angie Sedita with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nAngie Sedita: Thanks. Good morning guys.\nJeff Miller: Good morning, Angie.\nLance Loeffler: Good morning, Angie.\nAngie Sedita: Good morning. So Lance, maybe we can start with you and flesh out a little bit more commentary around the margin outlook for \u201821 for both C&P and D&E, and maybe you could start with 150 to 200 basis point decline on mix for Q1, flush that out for us and just talk about the full year? And then D&E, 8.2% in Q4, you set up slightly in Q1, can you talk about the margin outlook for the full year and the potential to return to a double-digit margin?\nLance Loeffler: Sure, sure, Angie. Look, I think it\u2019s simply as it relates to the guide that we gave, it\u2019s simply a business mix for C&P. So, we have got completion tool sales that are falling off and are being replaced. That revenue is being replaced by an improving North America market activity, but not the same level of profitability. But look, we are encouraged about some of the backlog that we see building in our completion tool business, and I think that also gives us the confidence that Jeff just outlined in terms of the back half of the year, particularly in the international markets. As you think about C&P margin progression in 2021, I mean, I would remind you and others on the call that we are starting from a much higher point in 2021 than we did even in 2020 before the impact of the pandemic, and that\u2019s on a much lower activity level. On a full year basis, I would say, Angie, that our expectations are that we still drive mid-teens margins for our C&P division. And look, if we are able to get some pricing momentum, it could go higher than that. But we are happy with what we have done, particularly creating the operating leverage in the business. Jeff has mentioned several times that it\u2019s sustainable. And I think it fundamentally drives higher incrementals, at least that\u2019s what the management team here is focused on for this next upcycle. On D&E margins, again, I think we are starting 2021 higher sequentially, which is typically not the case for our business as we go through some of the seasonality issues that we have mentioned and year end software sales falling off. So, I am encouraged to see the momentum and margin progression across the end of the year and into the beginning of 2021. And that\u2019s coming off again a largest rig drop in history for our business and our industry. Our expectation is to get to double-digit margins by the end of the year, end of the year 2021. And I think that we are ready to do that through capitalizing on obviously a recovering market that Jeff talked about in the back half of the year, but also on the technology and digital investments that we have made into the business throughout the course of 2020 and reaping the benefits in 2021. But I think the overall point, particularly for our D&E business as you think about the international markets is a real focus on profitable growth.\nAngie Sedita: Yes, fair color. That\u2019s great color, Lance. Very much appreciated. So, maybe one more separate follow-up on deep leads, maybe Jeff, you could talk about the technology that you have, how it differs from the peers the contract you have with Cimarex and then thoughts around additional construction and could electric fleets become a larger part of the operations over time?\nJeff Miller: Well, thanks, Angie. Look, I think that was \u2013 it\u2019s an elegant and differentiated solution, but clearly a premium solution. We have been working on the electric technology for a number of years and have always described some of the challenges around electric also being the cost and the upfront capital associated with it. The grid solution actually eliminates the requirement for turbines, which have come with a range of either operating problems or emissions. And so \u2013 and it\u2019s important to give a shout out to the Cimarex management team here, because a lot of innovation and collaboration together in order to bring together a very efficient solution and also one with the absolute lowest emissions, I mean, because now it\u2019s tapped into the grid and consuming sort of a variety of different energy sources. So, the customer commitment was very important. I think customer interest will be high. But it\u2019s also over time, but it\u2019s also going to require pricing and different types of contract terms and I view this though as part of our normal reinvestment cycle. Clearly, there is interest, but we have a planned reinvestment cycle that\u2019s inside of our capital budget and our outlook on capital efficiency and certainly see electric having a place in that, but that\u2019s where it will sit.\nAngie Sedita: Great. Thanks. I will turn it over.\nJeff Miller: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nScott Gruber: Guys, good morning.\nJeff Miller: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Gruber: So Jeff, just staying on that same line of questioning, the demand for emission reduction solutions and frac appears pretty robust these days, with crude climbing above $50, do you think customers are going to be willing to pay up this year to begin a more material expansion of these solutions?\nJeff Miller: Well, we will have to see. Like I said, we have seen \u2013 haven\u2019t seen it necessarily at this point, but I think that it\u2019s part of an evolution. By that I mean, emissions are part of the cost of operating today. And in my prepared remarks, I indicated that I thought technology would lower operating costs and also emissions. And I think viewing it that way is going to be important. And beyond that, from a Halliburton perspective, we think about nutrition labels in effect, which help us work with our customers to lower the emissions not just for us, but in the services that we provide so that we can make choice and drive R&D towards what we think will be a lower emissions sort of footprint on location?\nScott Gruber: Got it. I mean, Lance just coming back to C&P margins, big question on Halliburton these days is just how C&P margins trend here given the recovery domestically, but have come in at a lower margin profile than international. Are you able to provide just a bit more color on the incrementals that you are seeing on the domestic side of C&P? You are not asking for the absolute level, but just in terms of the rate of change as activity comes back here, are you seeing that incrementals say in 4Q that approach there the segment average and those types of incremental sustainable into the first half of \u201821?\nLance Loeffler: Yes. I think look, incrementals will start off naturally slower when you are just working on activity ramp. Clearly, there is a lot more punch to incrementals when you start to get pricing as well. We are not there yet as you have heard us say on the pricing side, but I think our incrementals have been very healthy as it relates to just the activity improvement in North America. And again, it goes back to the things that we were doing around the structural cost initiatives to get the cost structure right in this market and to watch that business improve on activity alone has been good to see.\nScott Gruber: Got it. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nLance Loeffler: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nSean Meakim: Thanks. Hey, good morning.\nJeff Miller: Good morning, Sean.\nSean Meakim: You hit your $1 billion free cash flow bogey for 2020 I am just curious how you think 2021 current flows who got moving parts as well as improving cash from operations as you go through the year, but also working capital needs shift as revenue is going to improve sequentially. CapEx you are expecting flat year-on-year, just how do we think about sending that mark for \u201821 in terms of what you all can achieve from a free cash flow perspective?\nJeff Miller: Well, Sean, let me take the first part of that, because it\u2019s maximizing free cash flow is a priority of mine. And the strategic priorities that I have laid out are designed to deliver and maximize free cash flow, but as you say, I think the profile may look different this year. Lance, why don\u2019t you go?\nLance Loeffler: Sure, sure. You are right, you are right, Sean. Yes, I think the free cash flow profile for 2021 versus 2020 will be much more from an operating profit perspective, right. So the full year of cost cut benefits will be rolling through 2021. We will also have the increased activity that you have heard us reference so far on the call. Yes, you are right, capital discipline and our philosophy around that remains in place, but as the business begins to grow, working capital will require investment, right as activity picks up. And so think about it outside of some of the noise that\u2019s created from working capital movements. So excluding working capital for a second, I would expect free cash flow to more than double in 2021. Is that helpful?\nSean Meakim: Very helpful. Yes, thank you for that. And then on international markets, you talked about shorter cycle maybe taking back some share, I think that makes sense. And you noticed that tendering activity is picking up, can you just talk about expectations for bidding behavior between you and your competitors, how that may compare and contrast to what we saw in the most recent cycle? What should give investors confidence that tendering rounds may look different than what they did in the most recent round we saw, let\u2019s say prior to the pandemic?\nJeff Miller: Yes. Look, Sean, I am not going to comment on the strategic and the competitive issues that you brought up. But what I can speak from our perspective is our focus is on profitable growth and profitable growth that maximizes free cash flow and drives returns. And I would say that, that\u2019s been something that is important and we were making progress on that in the first quarter of 2020 in terms of improving margins and cash flow and returns and then we took a COVID pause internationally. Now, I don\u2019t think dynamics have not changed in terms of available equipment for the international markets during the COVID period of time. So, with activity and our focus on profitable growth, I am encouraged by what I see, clearly, it\u2019s always competitive. Certainly, it\u2019s always competitive. But that focus on profitable growth is front and center with me.\nSean Meakim: I understand. Thanks very much for that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nChase Mulvehill: Hey, good morning, everyone. I guess so I wanted to come back to the conversation around kind of your E&P spending and then kind of your outlook for 2021. I don\u2019t know if you can maybe just take a minute and talk to which your expectations are for North American E&P spending this year and then also on the international side, I know you said kind of activity up low double-digits in the back half of this year for international, but I don\u2019t know if that means that we can actually kind of get more flattish spending this year by E&Ps or is that still going to be down?\nJeff Miller: Look, from an international standpoint, I mean, I think that\u2019s a fairly tight range around flat. But I also think what\u2019s more important is the improvement that we are seeing into what we believe is supply and demand balancing in 2022 and that\u2019s the right kind of trajectory to have going into that. And so if we have got double-digit growth in the second half of the year, we have called the bottom in the first quarter of the year, we used to kind of work through that. And like I said, I believe that the tighter range around flat, but I think that\u2019s going to be, it\u2019s got to be the path to solid improvement. And I am pretty optimistic about how all of that plays out. In North America, again, I think Q1 last year creates a lot of noise in that comparison, but the important thing is I do believe customers will be capital disciplined, but we have got a lot of road to go just to get back to where we were, even pre-pandemic when the first quarter of \u201820. And so I think that and we saw production come off pretty hard in 2020. So, just to keep things flat in 2021, from a production perspective, requires a reasonable amount of activity and actually more activity than we even see today based on kind of our calculation and outlook, which gives me good confidence that while we have got good momentum in the first quarter and we have got pretty good visibility for the year. So, I think that our outlook that, that momentum it builds in the first quarter, but it doesn\u2019t fall off at the pace that it has in the past certainly, I think that just because the drivers will be different. And I think capital discipline and flat production coexist in the market and that\u2019s what gives me confidence.\nChase Mulvehill: Okay. One quick follow-up, if you think about international pricing, we have heard some anecdotes from some people about some competitive pricing with some larger projects out there, but we don\u2019t see all the data points. So I don\u2019t know if you can maybe just take a second and just kind of talk about what you are seeing out there in the international pricing trend?\nJeff Miller: Well, what I would say is that it\u2019s always competitive on big projects. We will see different behavior at different times. Yes, I think the under the most important thing is I think we are going into a multiyear cycle internationally and building profitable roads is what will be most important and certainly most important to Halliburton. And I say it that way, because the equipment availability hasn\u2019t changed. Certainly, we do capital efficiency as one of our strategic priorities, which also means we want to put it to work where in the places where it\u2019s going to make the best returns and that\u2019s not going to be everywhere. That\u2019s going to be in the best returning opportunities, but I think there is enough growth there. And again, it\u2019s this multiyear cycle, it\u2019s the balancing in \u201822 and the progression through \u201821 gives me confidence in certainly taking that approach.\nChase Mulvehill: Okay, perfect. I will turn it back over. Thanks, Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nKurt Hallead: Hey, good morning everybody.\nJeff Miller: Good morning, Kurt.\nLance Loeffler: Good morning, Kurt.\nKurt Hallead: Hey, thanks for that. Thanks for that great detail. Really appreciate it and always good to start the year on a positive tone and positive note, especially after what we have been through right over the last few years. So, it\u2019s good to hear. Hey, just I wanted to follow-up with you in the context right on the international front since that\u2019s been a point of focus on your messaging, you kind of gave the dynamics for the second half of the year, but when you talk about short cycle opportunity sets and short cycle projects kind of what regions and areas would that be geared to?\nJeff Miller: Yes, Kurt. I mean, I think that you look around the world and where are there either intervention opportunities or onshore type opportunities and offshore tiebacks, which that starts to lead us to, I would think, through the Middle East, that could certainly have application in Asia, the North Sea as well as another sort of important market that demonstrates those characteristics. So, I think it\u2019s going to be fairly widespread in terms of where I think it\u2019s the type of work and again, the short cycle type barrels of what require less capital upfront, they yield production more quickly, they demonstrate better returns for operators. And so \u2013 and I think that that\u2019s where we will see more activity.\nKurt Hallead: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Appreciate that. And then I want to follow-up on your experience using highline power to run frac in the Permian. We have outlined some benefits of that highline power relative to turbine-driven e-frac. So, how do you see this evolving, right, Jeff? And what are some of the near-term opportunities for highline driven e-frac to accelerate and then what do you see as some of the roadblocks potentially to the adoption?\nJeff Miller: Well, the highline certainly, our grid-powered frac certainly is the lowest emission solution. Look, we learned a lot through the first project and so early days and still learning, but we have always said about electric that the capital upfront around power was going to be the sticky wicket and one that we were not willing to dive off and invest in, because from one day to the next, it\u2019s not clear what\u2019s most efficient. We actually knew all along that ultimately there would be a better both market for availability for power and also ultimately grid power. So, I think that there is a lot of collaboration that\u2019s required. There is a fair amount of technology involved in solving for how to get power of where it needs to be. But I can \u2013 as I said in my remarks, it\u2019s a very good solution to both a capital efficiency problem and an emissions problem. And I will look forward to seeing it catch on, so I don\u2019t think it will be immediate, because it takes quite a bit of work upfront to get that all put in place and very much a commitment by the operator to stay the course.\nKurt Hallead: Got it. That\u2019s great. I appreciate that color. I will leave it there. Thanks for the info.\nJeff Miller: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from George O\u2019Leary with Tudor Pickering Holt. Your line is now open.\nGeorge O\u2019Leary: Good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Lance.\nJeff Miller: Good morning, George.\nGeorge O\u2019Leary: Yes. Just to get insight into the North American completion services space and just curious clearly thus far, the increase in profitability has mostly been driven by top down actions on your part and then utilization increases. I wonder if you could speak to the supply demand dynamics, which you see in the market today and if there is any alignments made to greatly increases in midpoint this year or any frac spread count level that you guys are looking at that would you think the market may actually start to tighten up a bit and pricing can increase?\nJeff Miller: Yes, thanks, George. Look, I think attrition has taken its toll. We certainly saw a lot of it visibly in 2020. And I think our view is or my view is that the supply and demand gap continues to tighten. I also think the market structure is improving. And so \u2013 and as we look forward from here just normal attrition or normal replacement probably runs 10% to 12%. So we have got that at a minimum in front of us. I also think that capital constraints are \u2013 the current market for capital and capital investment makes us a lot tougher for companies. And so harvesting and cannibalization of equipment that we saw in 2020, we also saw entire transactions predicated to a degree on harvesting equipment as part of that cycle, but all of those things are taking equipment out of the market. And so, could we see some tightening towards the end of 2021? I think so, particularly with kind of how our outlook on activity for the balance of the year, but I think this is \u2013 it will continue to tighten is our outlook.\nGeorge O\u2019Leary: Okay, great. Very helpful color, Jeff. And then just digging through the game plan regarding the specialty chemicals business and you highlighted the plant [ph] inside clearly is a key part of the strategy, but just thinking bigger picture and longer term, what all do you guys need to execute on to dethrone one of the larger two players in that space, what\u2019s left to do from here for you guys strategically to really grow that business?\nJeff Miller: Well, look, our view of that is we stay the course and we have got the infrastructure in place in the U.S., we have got what we are progressing to completion, the plant in the Middle East. But we are certainly encouraged about what we have done and our outlook, I am not going to try to predict market shares and those sorts of things. Look I like what we are doing and I am confident that what we are doing continues to improve and grow that business over time take a very long view of the chemicals business, has long sort of cycle times around tenders and awards and those sorts of things. So, but certainly all of the plumbing is getting in place now. And I am very encouraged about the outlook for that business particularly as it applies to mature fields and the kind of sustainable throughout the cycle type activity that it brings. George?\nGeorge O\u2019Leary: Great. Thanks, guys. You have both my questions. Thank you very much.\nJeff Miller: Alright. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Miller for closing remarks.\nJeff Miller: Thank you, Liz. Before we end the call, I would like to make a few closing comments. Halliburton\u2019s five strategic priorities are designed to deliver industry leading returns and to maximize free cash flow. Our strong international business is well-positioned with the right geographies, technologies and people to deliver profitable growth, while our North American business is recovering and demonstrating margin improvement. Halliburton\u2019s market outlook, strategic priorities and execution culture make me optimistic about our future. I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Liz, please close out the call.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for joining and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeff Miller",
            "content": "Thank you, Abu, and good morning everyone. Let me start by looking back at the year that just ended. 2020 was a year like no other. We faced a global pandemic, record oil demand destruction, and an unprecedented downturn in the energy industry. Despite these turbulent times, Halliburton demonstrated resilience and performed consistently with our execution culture. Before we get to our results, I want to address our outstanding employees. I thank you for your hard work and execution throughout the entire year. You answered the call for safety, collaboration, and service quality and delivered for Halliburton's customers and our shareholders. Now, I want to highlight a few of our 2020 accomplishments. We delivered historic bests in all of our key safety and service quality metrics, recordable injury rate, lost time injury rate, vehicle incident rate, environmental recordable rate, and non-productive time. Each of these key metrics improved by over 20% and most did so for the second year in a row. This was a result of our employees' continued commitment to safety and process execution despite the year's distractions. Total company revenue of $14.4 billion outperformed the global rig count decline of 38% demonstrating the strength and diversity of our business. Our swift and decisive cost actions and service delivery improvements reset our earnings power, allowing us to deliver resilient margin performance. Our completion and production division finished the year with close to 16% operating margins, exiting the year higher than where they started. These results highlight the success of our structural cost reductions and process improvements. Our drilling and evaluation division had a strong, full-year margin performance despite the rig count declines experienced in all regions. We delivered over $1.1 billion of free cash flow for the year, demonstrating our ability to generate strong free cash flow throughout different business environments. We increased the breadth and depth of our digital offerings and delivered best-in-class performance across the spectrum of digital technologies, and we successfully launched Halliburton Labs, a collaborative environment where entrepreneurs, academics, investors, and industrial labs come together to advance cleaner, affordable energy. Now, let me share a few points about our fourth quarter performance. We finished the quarter with total company revenue of $3.2 billion, a 9% sequential increase and adjusted operating income of $350 million, an increase of 27% sequentially. This marks the first quarterly revenue increase since the activity declines began last March. Our completion and production division revenue increased 15% sequentially, while operating income improved 33% resulting in an operating margin improvement of 2% over the prior quarter. Our drilling and evaluation division revenue and operating income grew 2% and 11% respectively. Higher rig activity in the Western Hemisphere was offset by rig count declines in the Eastern Hemisphere. International revenue remained flat sequentially. Activity in Latin America improved for the second quarter in a row. Activity declines continued in other regions, but at a slower pace compared to the prior quarters. And lastly, our North America revenue increased 26% sequentially, driven primarily by increases in both drilling and completions activity in U.S. lands. Our overall strong performance was a direct result of our focus on the key strategic priorities that define Halliburton's path now and into the future. We are focused on profitable growth in our strong international franchise, and we are driving strategic changes in North America and building a leaner and more profitable business. We are accelerating the deployment and integration of digital technologies both internally and with our customers. We are driving capital efficiency by advancing our technologies and making strategic choices that lower our CapEx profile, and we are an active participant in advancing a sustainable energy future. As we start the new year, we believe that the worst is behind us and look to the future with optimism. Oil prices are back to pre-pandemic levels driven by global vaccine distribution and unfolding demand recovery, OPEC+ discipline, and a declining production base. However, some caution is appropriate due to the surge in COVID-19 infections globally and the expected gradual return of spare production capacity. Our five strategic priorities will continue to drive Halliburton's success as markets around the world stabilize and start to grow. We believe that aligning our actions with these priorities will boost our returns and free cash flow generation both today and as the recovery unfolds. We set these priorities according to our long-term view of the market. As oil demand recovers, we expect to see favorable market dynamics and the beginning of a multiyear energy up-cycle. However, we believe this recovery will look different than prior cycles. International short cycle producers will have an opportunity to gain share. North American E&Ps will increase spending from current levels that will take a more disciplined approach to growing production in the future. We believe that the overall cost and environmental impact of producing oil and gas will continue to decline due to innovation and technology adoption. As a result, oil and gas will remain a critical and significant component of the energy mix. I expect that our gains achieved in 2020, including service delivery improvements, structural cost reductions, and capital efficiency are firmly in place and sustainable. Halliburton is uniquely positioned in all markets and is prepared to deliver on both our customer expectations and our shareholder objectives. Our strong international business outperformed the market. Our full year international revenue declined 17%, while rig counts and customer spending were down more than 20%. All regions except Latin America declined in the fourth quarter, but at a slower pace. In the first quarter, we expect international activity to be impacted by typical weather-related seasonality and the absence of year-end product sales. Activity should bottom during the first quarter and improve as the year unfolds. For the full year, we expect activity recover very widely across regions. Latin America will continue with upward momentum off a very low bottom both onshore and offshore. Asia-Pacific is also showing signs of activity improvement. We believe parts of Europe and West Africa will remain slow, especially in the deepwater areas. As for the Middle East and Russia, we believe they will manage activity based on expectations of the economic and demand recovery. While the pace of recovery depends on the trajectory of demand improvement, we believe the second half of this year could see a low double-digit increase in international activity year-on-year. Halliburton is well positioned to benefit from this increase. Let me be clear, our target is profitable growth. Against a tough activity backdrop in 2020, we remained focused on increasing profitability and our actions resulted in overall international margin improvement. In 2021, we expect that several factors will continue to drive Halliburton's profitable international growth, Halliburton will benefit from our improved position in the international market cycle. We are stronger, technically, geographically and organizationally. We have exposure to mature fields, completions and interventions work, a deck of resilient integrated contracts around the world, leveraged to unconventional developments in Latin America and the Middle East and a leading position in key active offshore areas. While the international sales cycle tends to be longer, we now have line of sight to activity increases in the coming quarters. Tender activity has picked up recently led by the NOCs in the Middle East and Latin America and new opportunities are emerging with operators in other regions. Our customers have also pulled forward mobilization plans for various contracts awarded to Halliburton that were put on hold due to the pandemic. Our new drilling technologies are penetrating the market and gaining customer confidence. For example, we exited the year with a threefold increase in our EarthStar deep resistivity sensor revenue. As activity recovers, our technology provides us with a tremendous opportunity to profitably grow revenue. We see significant growth potential in the continued international expansion of our production businesses, especially in mature fields around the world. For example, the international artificial lift market tends to be more resilient and as longer cycle. Once an operator puts its field on the specific form of lift, it typically stays on it for many years. We are currently mobilizing for our first multiyear electric submersible pump contract in the Middle East and are excited about the opportunities artificial lift opens for us in the region. The construction of our specialty chemicals plant in Saudi Arabia continues to progress towards final completion. When it is complete, Halliburton will have a differentiated value chain in the region that maximizes local content, delivers customized solutions more quickly and shortens customer lead times. I am excited about these two new additions to our international portfolio that provide us with unique growth opportunities. Finally, adoption of Halliburton's digital solutions helps our customers to reduce cost per barrel, improve project economics and increase efficiencies. Our Halliburton 4.0 digital offerings in subsurface, well construction and reservoir and production create differentiation and margin growth opportunities for Halliburton. We are pleased that in 2021 several international oil companies are deploying DecisionSpace 365 cloud applications to streamline and automate their well construction activities. I believe that digital and other technology advances, geographic expansion of our products and services, along with continued discipline in cost management and capital efficiency should allow Halliburton to continue delivering profitable returns driven growth in the international markets. Turning to North America, the strategic actions we took last year reset Halliburton's earnings power in this critical, but structurally smaller market. We are the leader in North America and the only integrated oilfield services companies still active in the hydraulic fracturing market. In the fourth quarter, our North America business took advantage of the recovery in completions and drilling activity and delivered continued margin improvement even without improved pricing. Completion stage counts increased in the oil basins, but declined modestly in the gas plays. While the U.S. land rig count recovered from its August 2020 low of 230 rigs, it is still 60% below the pre-pandemic levels. Private and small operators added the most rigs, while large E&Ps and majors moved more slowly. We expect completions activity in North America to continue improving in the first half of 2021 as commodity prices remained supportive and customers complete their backlog of DUCs. Customer consolidation will likely continue and we expect most operators will remain committed to a disciplined capital program. For the full year, provided that the impact of the pandemic moderates, economic activity continues to increase and oil price remains solid. I am optimistic that our customers will sustain activity in order to hold their production flat to 2020 exit levels with completion spend outpacing drilling. I am excited about Halliburton's future in North America and here is why. We completed the most aggressive set of structural cost reductions in our history, giving us meaningful operating leverage in a recovering market. We also made significant changes to our processes that drive higher contribution margin, for example, how we perform equipment maintenance and provide engineering support. We believe the benefits of these changes will have a meaningful impact on our margins as activity picks up. The hydraulic fracturing market structure continues to improve. Utilization of our active equipment is higher than it was at the beginning of last year. The market has continued to rationalize and consolidate. We are seeing competitors either cannibalize idle equipment for parts or use it to beef up working fleets thus increasing average horsepower per fleet. This will make equipment reactivation to meet growing demand a lot harder for capital constrained companies and should only accelerate supply and demand balancing. As activity starts to increase, Halliburton has a unique competitive advantage and sufficient capacity to respond without adding incremental capital. Our in-house engineering capabilities to refurbish maintain and continuously improve our fracturing and perforating equipment minimize the cost and time to deliver the necessary equipment to our customers and take advantage of the market recovery. We are also well positioned to profitably grow in our competitive non-hydraulic fracturing businesses in North America. For example, in 2020, our artificial lift business developed and implemented new digital capabilities, increased remote operations jobs, and solidified its strong market position in North America. We also expect our well construction technology investments to best position Halliburton to outperform as drilling rigs return. Using the Halliburton 4.0 digital framework, we continue to collaborate and engineer solutions that maximize our customer's asset value. Last quarter, we launched our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing system and successfully completed a customer engagement in West Texas. SmartFleet is an industry first, where intelligent automation manages and executes live treatment decisions to optimize subsurface fracture outcomes. By using SmartFleet, the operator was able to consistently visualize and measure fracture propagation and control fracture placement through automation. Importantly, the system provided a level of subsurface control that was previously not possible and enabled the customer to actively drive their completion outcomes in real time. We are building on this success with multiple customer commitments across different basins. I believe this is the biggest step forward in fracturing technology in a long time. Let me give you a few more examples of how we are accelerating Halliburton 4.0 digital adoption. In the North Sea, we have successfully delivered the first fully automated cement job for the offshore cementing unit executed the work without human intervention. This is an important milestone in reaching the vision of fully autonomous offshore well construction that has significant implications for efficiency, safety and operating costs. In 2020, we more than tripled the number of DecisionSpace 365 users on the iEnergy cloud platform. Our customers also increased adoption of the DecisionSpace 365 asset simulator. Operators in Europe, Latin America and Asia ran over 3,000 reservoir simulation scenarios on the iEnergy cloud with speeds of up to 7x faster than with conventional on-premise simulators. Finally, we are teaming up with Accenture to drive the digital transformation of our supply chain. This will result in process efficiencies across large volumes of transactional activities, lower our overall cost, and free up resources to drive strategic decision-making and support of our operational requirements. Next, I want to discuss capital efficiency, a key enabler of our other strategic priorities, leveraging new materials and design approaches as well as digital innovation. We have been able to significantly reduce CapEx requirements and extend the life of our equipment. We are continuing our iCruise drilling system deployment and are reaping the benefits of a reduced CapEx profile and higher asset velocity. Technology advancements in multiple product service lines in both divisions are allowing us to improve design and service configuration to save time and money both for our customers and Halliburton. Finally, I would like to highlight several important actions we took in alignment with our strategic priority to participate in advancing a sustainable energy future. We are working to reduce the carbon footprint and environmental impact of our own operations and have committed to setting targets through the science-based targets initiative to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. With this commitment, Halliburton joins over 1,000 global companies taking science-based climate action. This is important in our journey to align with the latest climate science and contribute to sustainable energy advancement. We are also collaborating with our customers to produce oil and gas more efficiently, while reducing their emissions. We are currently performing the first electric grid powered fracturing operation for Cimarex Energy in the Permian Basin. With over 300 stages on multiple wells already completed, Halliburton's electric-powered equipment has allowed the customer to achieve pump rates that were 30% to 40% higher than conventional pumps by utilizing the maximum grid power potential. Grid-powered electric spreads require substantially less capital, a smaller footprint and are more efficient compared to turbine power. When demand for emission reduction solutions translates to better pricing, I expect we will replace within our planned capital budget some of our conventional fracturing capacity with electric over the course of a normal equipment replacement cycle. Halliburton is starting the new year with a clear sense of purpose. We believe that our strategic priorities are the right ones and our margins in the fourth quarter demonstrated that. We are confident that the actions we have taken are sustainable and we are well-positioned both internationally and in North America for the unfolding market recovery. I will now turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our financial results. Lance? Thanks, Lance. To sum up, Halliburton is focused on executing our key strategic priorities to deliver industry leading returns and solid free cash flow for our shareholders. Our strong international business is expected to continue its profitable growth and market outperformance as the international activity ramps up throughout the year. In the critical North American market, our business is recovering and demonstrating margin improvement. Digital is gaining traction, growing our revenue and helping us and our customers increase operational efficiency and reduce costs. Our capital efficiency enabled by technology and service delivery improvements is expected to contribute to solid free cash flow generation and our commitment to a sustainable energy future will ensure we play a role in advancing cleaner and more affordable energy solutions. I am optimistic about the future. While the 2020 downturn was deeper and more widespread than anything we have seen before, I am encouraged by the changes we implemented to solidify Halliburton's role in the unfolding economic recovery for oil and gas remains vital. Strong execution on our strategic priorities will allow Halliburton to continue to power into and win this recovery. And now, let's open it up for questions. Good morning, James. Yes, thanks, James. Let me start with North America and then start with \u2013 I am more optimistic today than I certainly was 90 days ago, and 2021 will feel better than the second half of 2020 annualized. So what's important is we see momentum coming into the year and it looks steady for the remainder and that's predicated on customers, I think will be certainly rationale and capital disciplined, but I think there is also pressure to hold production flat in 2021, which creates a bit of a floor as we look at the full year. From an international perspective, I feel confident around the international recovery. And I think in terms of magnitude into the second half of 2021, we believe or I believe we will be up low-double digits. So, that's fairly solid and that's based on the tender pipeline that we are seeing and the types of barrels that are produced shorter cycle, I think, will lend themselves to that type of uptick. And maybe one last word on international outlook, I mean, I think we view 2021 as a bit of a transition year. I mean, 2020 was the worst in our history, and we view 2022 as when we see the global rebalancing of supply and demand, which creates the sort of underpinning of a multi-year upcycle, and so that we see Q1 as a bottom and then steadily building from there. That's the kind of momentum that we really like to see going into that supply and demand sort of coming into balance. We are seeing some tenders, some big ones, also seeing some extensions of existing work. So, it's a bit of a mixed bag at this point, but visibility we have are of not all chunky though. Again, I think the extensions are important also to create sort of that steady momentum that we are talking about. Thank you, James. Good morning, Angie. Well, thanks, Angie. Look, I think that was \u2013 it's an elegant and differentiated solution, but clearly a premium solution. We have been working on the electric technology for a number of years and have always described some of the challenges around electric also being the cost and the upfront capital associated with it. The grid solution actually eliminates the requirement for turbines, which have come with a range of either operating problems or emissions. And so \u2013 and it's important to give a shout out to the Cimarex management team here, because a lot of innovation and collaboration together in order to bring together a very efficient solution and also one with the absolute lowest emissions, I mean, because now it's tapped into the grid and consuming sort of a variety of different energy sources. So, the customer commitment was very important. I think customer interest will be high. But it's also over time, but it's also going to require pricing and different types of contract terms and I view this though as part of our normal reinvestment cycle. Clearly, there is interest, but we have a planned reinvestment cycle that's inside of our capital budget and our outlook on capital efficiency and certainly see electric having a place in that, but that's where it will sit. Thank you. Good morning, Scott. Well, we will have to see. Like I said, we have seen \u2013 haven't seen it necessarily at this point, but I think that it's part of an evolution. By that I mean, emissions are part of the cost of operating today. And in my prepared remarks, I indicated that I thought technology would lower operating costs and also emissions. And I think viewing it that way is going to be important. And beyond that, from a Halliburton perspective, we think about nutrition labels in effect, which help us work with our customers to lower the emissions not just for us, but in the services that we provide so that we can make choice and drive R&D towards what we think will be a lower emissions sort of footprint on location? Good morning, Sean. Well, Sean, let me take the first part of that, because it's maximizing free cash flow is a priority of mine. And the strategic priorities that I have laid out are designed to deliver and maximize free cash flow, but as you say, I think the profile may look different this year. Lance, why don't you go? Yes. Look, Sean, I am not going to comment on the strategic and the competitive issues that you brought up. But what I can speak from our perspective is our focus is on profitable growth and profitable growth that maximizes free cash flow and drives returns. And I would say that, that's been something that is important and we were making progress on that in the first quarter of 2020 in terms of improving margins and cash flow and returns and then we took a COVID pause internationally. Now, I don't think dynamics have not changed in terms of available equipment for the international markets during the COVID period of time. So, with activity and our focus on profitable growth, I am encouraged by what I see, clearly, it's always competitive. Certainly, it's always competitive. But that focus on profitable growth is front and center with me. Look, from an international standpoint, I mean, I think that's a fairly tight range around flat. But I also think what's more important is the improvement that we are seeing into what we believe is supply and demand balancing in 2022 and that's the right kind of trajectory to have going into that. And so if we have got double-digit growth in the second half of the year, we have called the bottom in the first quarter of the year, we used to kind of work through that. And like I said, I believe that the tighter range around flat, but I think that's going to be, it's got to be the path to solid improvement. And I am pretty optimistic about how all of that plays out. In North America, again, I think Q1 last year creates a lot of noise in that comparison, but the important thing is I do believe customers will be capital disciplined, but we have got a lot of road to go just to get back to where we were, even pre-pandemic when the first quarter of \u201820. And so I think that and we saw production come off pretty hard in 2020. So, just to keep things flat in 2021, from a production perspective, requires a reasonable amount of activity and actually more activity than we even see today based on kind of our calculation and outlook, which gives me good confidence that while we have got good momentum in the first quarter and we have got pretty good visibility for the year. So, I think that our outlook that, that momentum it builds in the first quarter, but it doesn't fall off at the pace that it has in the past certainly, I think that just because the drivers will be different. And I think capital discipline and flat production coexist in the market and that's what gives me confidence. Well, what I would say is that it's always competitive on big projects. We will see different behavior at different times. Yes, I think the under the most important thing is I think we are going into a multiyear cycle internationally and building profitable roads is what will be most important and certainly most important to Halliburton. And I say it that way, because the equipment availability hasn't changed. Certainly, we do capital efficiency as one of our strategic priorities, which also means we want to put it to work where in the places where it's going to make the best returns and that's not going to be everywhere. That's going to be in the best returning opportunities, but I think there is enough growth there. And again, it's this multiyear cycle, it's the balancing in \u201822 and the progression through \u201821 gives me confidence in certainly taking that approach. Thank you. Good morning, Kurt. Yes, Kurt. I mean, I think that you look around the world and where are there either intervention opportunities or onshore type opportunities and offshore tiebacks, which that starts to lead us to, I would think, through the Middle East, that could certainly have application in Asia, the North Sea as well as another sort of important market that demonstrates those characteristics. So, I think it's going to be fairly widespread in terms of where I think it's the type of work and again, the short cycle type barrels of what require less capital upfront, they yield production more quickly, they demonstrate better returns for operators. And so \u2013 and I think that that's where we will see more activity. Well, the highline certainly, our grid-powered frac certainly is the lowest emission solution. Look, we learned a lot through the first project and so early days and still learning, but we have always said about electric that the capital upfront around power was going to be the sticky wicket and one that we were not willing to dive off and invest in, because from one day to the next, it's not clear what's most efficient. We actually knew all along that ultimately there would be a better both market for availability for power and also ultimately grid power. So, I think that there is a lot of collaboration that's required. There is a fair amount of technology involved in solving for how to get power of where it needs to be. But I can \u2013 as I said in my remarks, it's a very good solution to both a capital efficiency problem and an emissions problem. And I will look forward to seeing it catch on, so I don't think it will be immediate, because it takes quite a bit of work upfront to get that all put in place and very much a commitment by the operator to stay the course. Thank you. Good morning, George. Yes, thanks, George. Look, I think attrition has taken its toll. We certainly saw a lot of it visibly in 2020. And I think our view is or my view is that the supply and demand gap continues to tighten. I also think the market structure is improving. And so \u2013 and as we look forward from here just normal attrition or normal replacement probably runs 10% to 12%. So we have got that at a minimum in front of us. I also think that capital constraints are \u2013 the current market for capital and capital investment makes us a lot tougher for companies. And so harvesting and cannibalization of equipment that we saw in 2020, we also saw entire transactions predicated to a degree on harvesting equipment as part of that cycle, but all of those things are taking equipment out of the market. And so, could we see some tightening towards the end of 2021? I think so, particularly with kind of how our outlook on activity for the balance of the year, but I think this is \u2013 it will continue to tighten is our outlook. Well, look, our view of that is we stay the course and we have got the infrastructure in place in the U.S., we have got what we are progressing to completion, the plant in the Middle East. But we are certainly encouraged about what we have done and our outlook, I am not going to try to predict market shares and those sorts of things. Look I like what we are doing and I am confident that what we are doing continues to improve and grow that business over time take a very long view of the chemicals business, has long sort of cycle times around tenders and awards and those sorts of things. So, but certainly all of the plumbing is getting in place now. And I am very encouraged about the outlook for that business particularly as it applies to mature fields and the kind of sustainable throughout the cycle type activity that it brings. George? Alright. Thank you. Thank you, Liz. Before we end the call, I would like to make a few closing comments. Halliburton's five strategic priorities are designed to deliver industry leading returns and to maximize free cash flow. Our strong international business is well-positioned with the right geographies, technologies and people to deliver profitable growth, while our North American business is recovering and demonstrating margin improvement. Halliburton's market outlook, strategic priorities and execution culture make me optimistic about our future. I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Liz, please close out the call."

            "name": "Lance Loeffler",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff. Let's begin this morning with an overview of our fourth quarter results compared to the third quarter of 2020. Total company revenue for the quarter was $3.2 billion, an increase of 9% and adjusted operating income was $350 million, an increase of 27%. During the fourth quarter, we recognized approximately $450 million of pre-tax impairments and other charges primarily related to the fair value adjustment of our real estate assets in North America. As part of our 2020 structural cost reduction initiatives, we reduced the amount of real estate required to run our business. In the second quarter, we decreased our real estate use in North America by roughly 50% by closing, selling, consolidating and reducing the size of many facilities. Subsequently, we conducted a detailed analysis on how we own, lease and operate our remaining real estate footprint. As a result, we concluded that a structured transaction is likely to be advantageous in managing the majority of our North American real estate, which led to the fair value adjustment I just discussed. This initiative is consistent with our strategic priority to achieve capital efficiency in our business, while allowing us to retain flexibility and drive future operating benefits. Let me take a moment to discuss our divisional results in more detail. In our completion and production division, revenue increased $236 million or 15%, while operating income increased $70 million, an increase of 33%. These increases were driven by higher activity in multiple product service lines in North America, increased stimulation activity in Argentina and Kuwait, higher completion tool sales in Africa, Southeast Asia and Norway, and increased well intervention services internationally. These increases were partially offset by lower pressure pumping activity in Saudi Arabia and lower completion tool sales in Eurasia and Australia. Our drilling and evaluation revenue increased $26 million or 2%, while operating income grew by $12 million, or an 11% increase. These increases were primarily due to higher drilling related services in North America and Brazil, increased wireline activity in North America and Latin America as well as higher fluid sales in Asia-Pacific and Guyana and increased software sales across all regions. Partially offsetting these increases were lower drilling-related services and project management activity in Europe/Africa/CIS, the Middle East and Mexico as well as reduced wireline activity in Asia-Pacific and Saudi Arabia. Moving on to our geographical results, in North America, revenue increased $254 million, a 26% increase. These results were driven by higher activity in stimulation and artificial lift in U.S. land as well as higher well construction and wireline services activity and year end completion tools and software sales. Latin America revenue grew $46 million or 12%, resulting primarily from increased pressure pumping and wireline activity in Argentina and activity increases in multiple product service lines in Colombia and Ecuador as well as higher fluid sales in Guyana and drilling services in Brazil. These increases were partially offset by reduced activity across multiple product service lines in Mexico. Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue was modestly down by $7 million or a decrease of 1%, resulting primarily from reduced drilling related services and completion tool sales in Eurasia, coupled with lower drilling related activity in Norway. These results were partially offset by higher completion tool sales in Africa, Norway and Continental Europe as well as increased stimulation and well intervention services in Algeria and Continental Europe. Middle East Asia revenue declined $31 million, or 3%, largely attributed to lower activity in multiple product service lines in Saudi Arabia, reduced drilling activity in United Arab Emirates and decreased project management activity in India. These decreases were partially offset by higher drilling-related services in China, Australia and Malaysia, increased stimulation activity in Kuwait, and higher software sales across the region. In the fourth quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $49 million and we expect it to be approximately the same in the first quarter of 2021. Net interest expense for the quarter was $125 million and should remain essentially flat in the first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 19%. Based on the market environment and our expected geographic earnings mix, we expect our 2021 first quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 25%. We generated approximately $638 million of cash from operations during the fourth quarter and delivered over $1.1 billion of free cash flow for the full year. As a result, we ended the year with approximately $2.6 billion in cash. We will continue to prioritize reducing leverage in the near-term and intend to pay down $685 million of debt coming due this year with cash on hand. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $218 million with our 2020 full year CapEx totaling approximately $730 million. In 2021, we intend to keep our capital expenditures relatively flat at $750 million. We believe that with this level of spend we will be well-equipped to take advantage of the unfolding recovery. Finally, let me provide you with some comments on how we see the first quarter playing out. As is typical, our results for the first quarter of 2021 will be subject to weather-related seasonality and the roll-off of year-end product sales, which primarily impact our international and Gulf of Mexico businesses. While we anticipate a slower than normal start to the year in some international regions, we also expect activity momentum in North America to continue with completions activity outpacing drilling activity. As such, in our completion and production division, we expect revenue to increase 3% to 5% sequentially and operating margins to decline 150 to 200 basis points largely due to a different business mix. In our drilling and evaluation division, we anticipate a low single-digit revenue increase sequentially, with operating margins expected to increase by 50 to 75 basis points. I will now turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff? Good morning. Good morning, Angie. Sure, sure, Angie. Look, I think it's simply as it relates to the guide that we gave, it's simply a business mix for C&P. So, we have got completion tool sales that are falling off and are being replaced. That revenue is being replaced by an improving North America market activity, but not the same level of profitability. But look, we are encouraged about some of the backlog that we see building in our completion tool business, and I think that also gives us the confidence that Jeff just outlined in terms of the back half of the year, particularly in the international markets. As you think about C&P margin progression in 2021, I mean, I would remind you and others on the call that we are starting from a much higher point in 2021 than we did even in 2020 before the impact of the pandemic, and that's on a much lower activity level. On a full year basis, I would say, Angie, that our expectations are that we still drive mid-teens margins for our C&P division. And look, if we are able to get some pricing momentum, it could go higher than that. But we are happy with what we have done, particularly creating the operating leverage in the business. Jeff has mentioned several times that it's sustainable. And I think it fundamentally drives higher incrementals, at least that's what the management team here is focused on for this next upcycle. On D&E margins, again, I think we are starting 2021 higher sequentially, which is typically not the case for our business as we go through some of the seasonality issues that we have mentioned and year end software sales falling off. So, I am encouraged to see the momentum and margin progression across the end of the year and into the beginning of 2021. And that's coming off again a largest rig drop in history for our business and our industry. Our expectation is to get to double-digit margins by the end of the year, end of the year 2021. And I think that we are ready to do that through capitalizing on obviously a recovering market that Jeff talked about in the back half of the year, but also on the technology and digital investments that we have made into the business throughout the course of 2020 and reaping the benefits in 2021. But I think the overall point, particularly for our D&E business as you think about the international markets is a real focus on profitable growth. Yes. I think look, incrementals will start off naturally slower when you are just working on activity ramp. Clearly, there is a lot more punch to incrementals when you start to get pricing as well. We are not there yet as you have heard us say on the pricing side, but I think our incrementals have been very healthy as it relates to just the activity improvement in North America. And again, it goes back to the things that we were doing around the structural cost initiatives to get the cost structure right in this market and to watch that business improve on activity alone has been good to see. Yes. Sure, sure. You are right, you are right, Sean. Yes, I think the free cash flow profile for 2021 versus 2020 will be much more from an operating profit perspective, right. So the full year of cost cut benefits will be rolling through 2021. We will also have the increased activity that you have heard us reference so far on the call. Yes, you are right, capital discipline and our philosophy around that remains in place, but as the business begins to grow, working capital will require investment, right as activity picks up. And so think about it outside of some of the noise that's created from working capital movements. So excluding working capital for a second, I would expect free cash flow to more than double in 2021. Is that helpful? Good morning, Kurt."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to Halliburton's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Abu Zeya, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nAbu Zeya: Good morning and welcome to the Halliburton third quarter 2020 conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO, and Lance Loeffler, CFO. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of severance and other charges. Additional details and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our third quarter press release and can also be found in the quarterly results and presentation section of our website. After our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow time for others who may be in the queue. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Thank you, Abu. And Good morning, everyone. The third quarter saw world economy slowly emerge from lockdowns, oil prices move off their lows and the return of shut in production. Demand recovery is starting to unfold while under investment in global oil production capacity, OPEC+ actions and expectations for effective COVID-19 treatments are providing support to commodity prices. However, the pace and magnitude of recovery going forward will vary greatly by geography and customer type, with resurgence of COVID-19 in certain economies presenting near term risks.  Despite these challenges, we continue to execute on our value proposition both for our customers and our company. Every day, our employees collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers, and they're doing it with the best service quality and safety in our history.  Our third quarter financial performance reflects the results of this execution. Let me share some highlights. Total company revenue was about $3 billion, down 7%, and adjusted operating income was $275 million, an improvement of 17% compared to the second quarter of 2020.  Our Completion and Production division revenue declined 6% sequentially, while operating income improved 33%, delivering an operating margin improvement of 4% compared to the second quarter. These results demonstrate the impact of our structural cost reductions and improved utilization in North America land. Our Drilling and Evaluation division revenue and operating income were down 8% and 17% respectively compared to the second quarter of 2020. D&E's top line outperformed rig count declines both internationally and in the US. International revenue was down 7% sequentially as international rig count trended lower by 12%, highlighting the diversity and strength of our international franchise. North America revenue decreased 6% sequentially. Completions activity increases in North America land were more than offset by lower activity in the Gulf of Mexico and lower overall drilling activity as US rig counts declined 35% sequentially.  I'm pleased to report that our $1 billion in structural cost reductions are complete.  And lastly, we generated approximately $730 million of free cash flow through the first three quarters of this year and are on track to generate over $1 billion in free cash flow for the full year.  Before we discuss the details of our third quarter performance, I'd like to say something to our outstanding employees. I appreciate that the last several months have been far from easy. You have experienced disruption and uncertainty both in your personal and work lives. More than ever, you've had to balance taking care of yourselves and your families with your work duties. Through it all, you have performed admirably. You have continued to deliver outstanding products and services to our customers, breaking service quality and safety records along the way.  In April, no one would have predicted the operational and financial success that Halliburton has achieved over the last six months. You should realize these results are your results. They're due to your hard work and perseverance in very challenging times. I'm very proud of you all.  Halliburton is charting a fundamentally different course. We will continue to take strategic actions designed to boost our earnings power and free cash flow generation both today and as we power into and when the eventual recovery.  As markets around the world begin to stabilize, our five strategic priorities will drive Halliburton's future success. First, we continue to focus on our strong international business. We're outperforming in the international markets and plan to balance future growth with the objective of improving margins and returns.  Second, our strategic priority for a leaner, more profitable North American business is well underway as demonstrated by the last two quarters. We will continue to focus on profit, not share, in this more consolidated market, which will remain a key component of the global supply stack.  Third, digital drives everything we do. Our digital framework, Halliburton 4.0, permeates all aspects of our business and enables the success of our other strategic priorities. As digital deployment and integration across the value chain accelerates, we believe that we'll continue to grow our current business, create new revenue opportunities and drive better returns for Halliburton.  Fourth, our capital intensity is structurally lower, with future CapEx expected to be 5% to 6% of revenue. This provides a tailwind to our strong free cash flow generation.  Lastly, Halliburton is committed to a sustainable energy future in which oil and gas continues to play a critical role. On today's call, I will discuss how our third quarter financial performance reflects the impact of these strategic priorities and how our future actions align with them.  Our third quarter demonstrated again that we have a strong international business. It is delivering margin expansion now and we expect it to drive higher returns in the eventual recovery.  For the second quarter in a row, nearly two-thirds of our revenue came from international operations. And both our Drilling and Evaluation and Completion and Production divisions now earn the majority of their revenue in the international markets.  Our business mix and footprint in specific geographies, along with exposure to long-term integrated projects, support our comparative revenue outperformance and more constructive international outlook for 2020. We outperformed the 12% sequential international rig count declines in the third quarter and are trending significantly better than the 20% reported rig count reductions year to date.  Despite the well-known activity slowdowns, our international margins improved sequentially, with several key end markets demonstrating margin improvement year-on-year.  As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we see the pace of activity declines in the international markets slowing and believe we are getting closer to an activity bottom. In the meantime, service companies are being prudent with their capital, which results in limited access equipment. This should lead to a tighter market even without an increase in new activity.  While we believe a broader recovery across all regions will still take time, Halliburton is well positioned to outperform the market.  Here are a few examples. Over the last few years, we've made significant investments in our directional drilling and open hole wireline technologies that are critical to our success in the international markets. These investments are paying off. For example, this year in the eastern hemisphere, we've drilled 5.5 times more footage with our iCruise tools compared to last year despite the decline in rig activity.  Adding to our existing business lines, another important component of Halliburton's strength in the international markets is the ongoing expansion of our production businesses. Today, we have a small international market share in the service segment, which gives us plenty of room to grow. And we are growing.  I'm pleased to announce that, earlier this month, Halliburton was awarded a seven-year contract for electric submersible pumps by a Middle Eastern NOC. We also completed our first ESB installations in a growing geothermal market in Europe.  Halliburton 4.0 supercharges our already strong international business. We use open architecture and digital technologies that drive connectivity and deliver performance to collaborate with our customers and partners, pioneering new approaches to subsurface understanding, well construction and reservoir and production. Our digital innovation and its adoption by our customers are reframing operator project economics through greater efficiencies and improved decision-making. We believe this creates technological differentiation for us, and we expect it will drive higher returns.  Today, as more customers contract for integrated services packages, we continue to benefit from our strong project management capabilities that deliver efficiencies and reduce total cost of ownership for our customers.  Going forward, Halliburton Well Construction 4.0 will enable our project management business to deliver more efficient wells by reducing planning time, improving drilling performance, and lowering well construction costs and risks.  Well Construction 4.0 provides a singular interface for wellsite performance management. Its open architecture environment enables seamless integration and collaboration of our premium technologies, like Cerebro intelligent bits, LOGIX automated drilling software, and BaraLogix real time density and rheology with any third-party service or application. As part of Halliburton Production 4.0, we have formed a new alliance with Honeywell to use our digital technologies to optimize our customers assets like a manufacturing plant, fundamentally changing the way surface and subsurface are simultaneously managed. This helps our customers optimize their production. Halliburton delivers reservoir modeling, well and field surveillance, ESB optimization and well intervention. Honeywell brings its expertise and topside automation, surface equipment performance monitoring and productivity solutions. This is not simply an expectation for tomorrow. This is digital in action today for customers like PTTEP in Thailand.  Our current strengths and new capabilities in the international markets are critical to our future success. The international short cycle producers have an opportunity to regain market share as a result of declining US oil production. As demand starts to improve and outgrow supply, it should encourage international investments in both oil and gas. And our strong international business that now delivers the majority of our revenues is ready to power into the eventual recovery.  The next strategic priority I want to discuss today is driving a leaner, more profitable North America. Last quarter, I described to you in detail the actions we took to reset our earnings power in this key market. To recap, we now have 50% less structural headcount and a 50% smaller real estate footprint in North America compared to last year.  These and other changes to how we're organized and how we execute every day are sustainable and independent of market activity levels. I believe our efficient, disciplined execution in the North American market, together with these structural changes, will drive margin improvements and free cash flow.  Halliburton executed exceptionally well in North America this quarter. Our D&E division outperformed the sequential rig count declines and our C&P division grew and drove overall margin improvement for North America, despite the hurricane season negatively impacting Gulf of Mexico activity. This proves that our cost actions and service delivery process improvements are delivering the intended results.  As the leading completions provider in North America, Halliburton has exposure to every basin and every customer group. The month-on-month land completions activity improvement in the third quarter was a welcome sign. But September stage counts were still below April activity levels, and overall stages completed in US land showed a modest sequential increase for the full quarter. We intend to stay disciplined in how we deploy our fracturing fleets into the recovering market.  Looking ahead to the fourth quarter. We expect North America land completions activity to increase by double digit percentage as operators deplete their DUC inventory. We expect rig counts to lag completions and not step up materially before year-end.  As we predicted, the North America market structure is improving, with both consolidation and rationalization. We've seen a steady flow of consolidation announcements from operators as well as service companies. As I see it, the US shale industry will continue to slim down and, as a result, emerge healthier in a relatively more sustainable growth environment in the future. And this plays to Halliburton strength and our disciplined strategy.  The supply/demand balance for US fracturing capacity is also improving. We estimate that close to 30% of hydraulic fracturing equipment has been permanently retired this year. We expect more will follow as demand remains structurally lower.  Insufficient returns and a lack of reinvestment by service companies should accelerate the cannibalization of idle equipment for parts and the use of sideline pumps to beef up working fleets. We anticipate a tighter balance between horsepower supply and demand as the US achieves more stable production levels.  As we look ahead, we expect pricing to work its way through a couple of predictable steps. The first step, which we're starting to see now, is a recovering demand for active capacity. The first warm stack fleet reactivations are unlikely to see meaningful pricing improvement, but they will increase utilization and revenue on a lower cost base and make a positive contribution to earnings.  The second step will happen when activity recovers enough to call on cold stacked equipment to return to the market. I expect that higher pricing will be necessary to justify incremental investments.  As with our International business, Halliburton 4.0 is driving innovation in North America. Last week, for example, we announced an industry first, the launch of our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing system. SmartFleet marries our digital capabilities and fracturing expertise to do what was not possible until now, give customers control over frac performance in real time. The decisions our customers make about well spacing and multiple pad development have a big impact on their unconventional asset economics. With service efficiencies plateauing and capital remaining constrained, operators strive to make every stage as productive as possible.  Before SmartFleet, however, they faced a high level of uncertainty related to fracture placement and performance. SmartFleet changes this. Its intelligent automation integrates real time fracture measurements, live 3D visualization, and real time fracture commands to give operators control over fracture outcomes while pumping. It sets us apart from the rest of the hydraulic fracturing market and solidifies our industry leadership in intelligent fracturing.  SmartFleet and other Halliburton 4.0 digital offerings will continue to address our customers toughest reservoir challenges and improve the efficiency of our service delivery.  In the near term, I expect the divergence of rig and completions activity will create choppiness as balance sheets are repaired and reinvestment rates continue to adjust. However, we believe that our strategic priority for a leaner and more profitable North America will enable us to successfully navigate through this market contraction and power into the eventual recovery.  Let me now discuss capital efficiency, a key enabler of all our strategic priorities. We believe we can maintain our reduced CapEx at 5% to 6% of revenue, and that it will contribute to sustainable free cash flow generation for our business.  We will keep investing in the development of new technologies and strategically fund international growth as the market recovery unfolds. This includes digitalization of our tools and processes that together with material science and design advancements drive down cost and extend the life of our equipment. At the same time, we will continue to exercise thoughtful capital allocation to the best returns opportunities.  The last strategic priority I will discuss today is Halliburton's commitment to a sustainable energy future. We recognize that the energy landscape is evolving, and alternative energy sources are growing. We're executing our strategies to meet these changes.  First, oil and gas will play a key role in providing the world with affordable and reliable energy long into the future. And we will continue to deploy innovative solutions, including our full digital portfolio to meet that demand.  We will also invest in the future directly through innovation and our recently launched Halliburton Labs. Today, our digital and other technologies help our customers decarbonize their legacy production base and reach their emissions reduction goals.  For example, our digitally enabled iCruise rotary steerable system allows customers to drill wells faster and reduce the number of days a diesel powered rig is on their location, which helps cut down on emissions.  We also help our customers achieve their carbon neutral goals through carbon capture and storage. We provide a variety of services in this space, from subsurface assessment and characterization to well construction and fiber optics monitoring and verification solutions. Our current technology portfolio support CCS projects all around the world \u2013 in Australia, Europe and North America.  We also have decades of experience in providing geothermal drilling services. Halliburton delivers a full range of innovative technologies to address the ultra-high temperature environments, from directional drilling, cementing, fluids, pumping services, logging and casing inspection and project management led developments of geothermal fields. To date, we have participated in operations in all the key geothermal producing areas of the world.  For our own portfolio of services and equipment, we continue to do what we do best \u2013 innovate, collaborate and invest in lowering the emissions profile of our technologies. We have shown steady improvement over the years reducing our scope one and two emissions. In the coming months, we are committed to establishing and sharing our greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets and reporting on our progress.  Finally, I'm excited about the formation of Halliburton Labs, which we announced in the third quarter. It is a collaborative environment where entrepreneurs, academics, investors, and industrial labs come together to advance cleaner, affordable energy. Halliburton receives a minor equity stake in early stage clean energy companies in exchange for their access to our early stage clean energy companies in exchange for their access to our world class facilities, technical expertise, and business network.  But more importantly, Halliburton labs provides us with a wealth of knowledge and an opportunity to play an important role in developing sustainable affordable energy solutions.  Were excited about Halliburton Labs advisory board consisting of leading academics and thought leaders, whose first members include Rice University's Reggie des Roches, Caltech's John Grotzinger and Tulane's Walter Isaacson.  I will now turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our financial results. Lance?\nLance Loeffler : Thank you, Jeff. Let's begin this morning with an overview of our third quarter results compared to the second quarter of 2020. Total company revenue for the quarter was about $3 billion, representing a 7% decrease, and adjusted operating income was $275 million, or an increase of 17%. These results were primarily driven by continuing rig count declines across multiple regions, partially offset by increased activity in Latin America and higher completions activity in North America land as well as the continued impact of our global cost savings.  In the third quarter, we recognized $133 million of pretax severance and other charges to further adjust our cost structure to current market conditions. The cash component of this charge was approximately $80 million.  Let me cover some of the details related to our divisional results. In our Completion and Production division, revenue decreased $98 million or 6%, while operating income increased $53 million or 33%. The revenue decline was driven by reduced completion tool sales across Europe/Africa/CIS, the Gulf of Mexico, and Latin America, coupled with lower cementing activity in the Middle East, Asia and North America land. It was partially offset by higher stimulation activity and artificial lift sales in North America land, higher activity across multiple product service lines in Argentina, as well as increased pipeline services in Europe/Africa/CIS. Improvements related to stimulation activity in North America land and the impact of our cost reductions drove the overall margin increase.  In our Drilling and Evaluation, revenue decreased $123 million or 8%, while operating income decreased $22 million or 17%. These declines were primarily due to reduced drilling related and wireline services activity in North America and eastern hemisphere, coupled with lower project management activity in the Middle East Asia. They were partially offset by improved drilling activity in Latin America.  Moving on to our geographical results. In North America, revenue decreased $65 million, or 6%. This decline was primarily driven by decreased well construction activity in US land, coupled with reduced activity across multiple product service lines in the Gulf of Mexico, partially offset by higher stimulation activity and artificial lift sales in US land.  In Latin America, revenue increased $34 million or 10%, resulting primarily from increased activity across multiple product service lines in Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico, partially offset by reduced activity in Ecuador and lower completion tool sales in Guyana.  Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue decreased $42 million or 6%. This decline was primarily driven by lower completion tool sales across the region, reduced drilling related services in Norway, and a decline in fluids and cementing activity in Russia.  These reductions were partially offset by increased activity across multiple product service lines in Azerbaijan and a seasonal increase in pipeline services in Europe. In Middle East/Asia, revenue decreased $148 million or 13%, largely resulting from reduced well construction activity across the region, lower project management and wireline activity in the Middle East and decreased project management activity in India. These declines were partially offset by higher completion tool sales in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.  In the third quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $42 million, which was positively impacted by an insurance reimbursement. For the fourth quarter, we estimate that our corporate expense will return to previously announced run rate of $50 million.  Net interest expense for the quarter was $122 million, which included higher interest income from our international subsidiaries. We expect net interest expense closer to $128 million in the fourth quarter.  Our adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 24%. We expect our fourth quarter tax rate to be approximately 15% based on the market environment and our expected geographic earnings mix. Our full year adjusted effective tax rate should be approximately 21%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $155 million and we now expect full-year 2020 CapEx to be less than $800 million. Turning to cash flow, we generated $265 million in free cash flow during the third quarter, primarily driven by our increased operating income and continued working capital improvements. As a result, we improved our cash position during the third quarter ending the period with $2.1 billion in cash. We expect to continue generating positive cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter and expect to deliver full-year free cash flow of over $1b. Now, turning to our short-term operational outlook, let me provide you with our thoughts on the fourth quarter. For our Completion and Production division, we expect higher North America completions activity and traditional year-end completion tool sales which are more muted than in prior years. With that said, we expect revenue to be up approximately 10% and margins to remain flat sequentially. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate a slight sequential increase in our drilling related activity and expect to see typical year-end software sales. As such, revenue for the division should be up mid-single digits with operating margins moving modestly higher by 25 to 50 basis points. I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff?\nJeff Miller : Thanks, Lance. To sum up, we're charting a fundamentally different course. I believe our execution of the five key strategic priorities will deliver success for Halliburton now and into the future.  Our strong international business is already delivering returns and margin expansion and I expect that will continue in the next upcycle. Our leaner North America business will enable us to successfully navigate through the market contraction and will be more profitable as the market recovers. Halliburton 4.0 is part of everything we do and enables the success of the other strategic priorities. It will grow our current business, create new revenue opportunities and drive better returns. Our lower capital intensity is expected to contribute to strong free cash flow in the future. Our commitment to a sustainable energy future in which reliable and affordable oil and gas continues to play a critical role will help us and our customers lower emissions. Our creation of Halliburton Labs will accelerate the sustainable affordable energy future.  Halliburton's strategic actions boost our earnings power reset and free cash flow generation today and as we power into and win the eventual recovery. And now, let's open it up for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Angie Sedita with Goldman Sachs. \nAngeline Sedita: Just on the pace of activity, maybe some thoughts around 2021. In the past, for the US markets, you talked about a strong start early 2021. And so, thoughts if that's really driven by the DUC cleanup or do you think we could see a pickup of drilling activity and additional wells? And then along with that, on the international side, you noted that the pace of decline is slowing. Do you think that we've seen the bottom in most of these countries? Is there some reason to believe that we have not even ignoring the seasonality and thoughts around the pace of the international activity in 2021?\nJeff Miller: Just broadly, both your questions, 2021 feels better from here. I think the second half of 2020, thinking about that as the bottom, we see progressive improvement in 2021. Separating that a little bit, North America, we're seeing DUC activity now. We'll see DUC activity I suspect into next year. And then, the drilling activity would follow that. But again, if we step back and think about North America, to maintain steady production, whatever the exit rate ends up being, implies the number of wells that need to be drilled. And so, if drilling is below that, then we start to see production drift lower, which then would have a positive impact on commodity price and an impact on \u2013 more so on international activity. From an international perspective, again, we see improvement in 2021 from where we are certainly now and we see that strengthening more so in the back half of 2021 or the second half of 2021 because we do work through seasonality and some other things.  But in either case, we see improving activity.\nAngeline Sedita: And then if you could talk about operating margins in 2021, giving you all the full year benefit of the $1 billion in structural cost cutting and the activity outlook you just outlined, thoughts around the pace of C&P and D&E margins and even the potential exit rate for 2021?\nJeff Miller: Obviously, the earnings reset or the earnings power reset is a critical part of our strategy. So, those cost cuts are permanent. I expect when activity moves up, we'll see margin improvement follow. We'd see D&E margin start moving upwards when we see broader international drilling activity recover. As I've described, how we might see that next year. C&P is going to benefit from stronger completions activity recovery in North America and also internationally. So, I think C&P probably sees recovery more so first. And margins in D&E improves, gets into the double digit range as we see more sustained recovery internationally. So, again, really like where we are strategically. I think our strategy addresses that and would expect to see the margin progression follow along with the activity.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James West with Evercore ISI.\nJames West: International, Jeff, and I know that \u2013 you spent most of your career working international. The business has contracted, of course, but sounds like you're seeing a bottoming here. What type of or what level of recovery would you expect in 2021 and are there geographies that stand out as more robust than others?\nJeff Miller: James, look, I think we went into the first part of this year very active. In fact, we were seeing a lot of good things happening in Q1 and it tailed off in Q2. So, I don't think the full year of 2021 eclipses 2020. But trajectory I think is really important because that leads to the eventual recovery that I believe happens. And so, I think we get on that pace starting in 2021? Does it overcome 2020 immediately? Not necessarily. But it's going to just be slightly below. I think we're on a pace because of the sort of under investment that we're seeing. And we're seeing it in the US today and we'll see it \u2013 we've seen it really internationally. And this is just too important to too many governments, to too many people in the world to see it under invested for that long.\nJames West: And as we think about the US market which is kind of an impaired market, but the structure is getting better with some of the M&A that's happening. Are you guys comfortable that you see a more profitable future as we kind of pull out of this downturn in North America than we've seen for the last almost a decade? \nJeff Miller: Yes, I do. I think what we're seeing, service company consolidations is great for Halliburton. It's happening as we expected it would happen. And our approach to this market, which is a different playbook, we wouldn't be doing it if we weren't convinced that it drives better free cash flow and a more profitable market. And so, there are a lot of things that we're doing that are different that will allow us to make more free cash flow in this type of market. And so, I think all of these things are positive. And I would say whether it's consolidation and attrition and rationalization, all of those things are conspiring to create tightness. But even in spite of not having the tightness today, we're seeing the improving margins and returns. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Herbert with Simmons. \nWilliam Herbert: Lance, free cash flow, and I'm just looking at the relationship between Street expectations for next year, EBITDA down 5%, 7%, but free cash flow down close to 40%. Does that make sense, given the fact that you're not going to have the restructuring and severance cash expense that you had this year. Maybe working capital is not the tailwind in 2021 that it was in 2020, but if revenues are flat to down, it's hardly a huge consumer of cash in your margins, and so I'm just curious, how do we think how should we think about free cash flow for 2021 at this stage. Your capital intensity, 5% to 6%. It would seem that your free cash flow would be actually up year-over-year. \nLance Loeffler: I agree with a lot of the commentary in the questions, meaning that, yes, working capital will be less of a tailwind for our free cash flow next year, but that's replaced by healthier operating profit led by increased activity in the markets that you heard Jeff describe, also a full year benefit of the cost cutting activity that we've been through this year rippling through our operating margins. And so, it'll be much more of an operating-led free cash flow draw and in relationship to the capital intensity that we've talked about, as opposed to working capital unwind next year. \nWilliam Herbert: In the event that EBITDA is relatively flat, do you think \u2013 flat, flat to down, flat to up, do you think that free cash flow is in the vicinity of this year or higher next year?  Look, I think it's a little early to call, Bill. But I think we've been pretty clear on what the levers are the drive it, and we'll be more prescriptive about it when we get into the course of next year. \nWilliam Herbert: Jeff, I'm just curious as to your perspective here with regard to the consolidation that we're seeing, first Noble goes to Chevron, WPX goes to Devon, Concho goes to Conoco. And these are basically at stock prices that are 20% to 30% of recent peak. And I'm just curious, in your discussions with your clients and your customers, is the sense that this is a fundamentally disrupted industry and that basically, with regard to the lower 48 market opportunity, it's been fundamentally redefined, and at this juncture, the best alternative is define a relatively safe piece of paper in the form of a consolidator. What are you hearing from your customers? \nJeff Miller: I think it's what you see when market efficiency start to come into play, in the sense that these larger operations allow for better application of D&A for all. There's just a lot of costs associated with operating all these different companies. And so, I suspect at some level there's the opportunity to better leverage and make more cash flow by bigger operators. I think the value you're seeing, obviously, the stock price is depressed, but nevertheless the outlook, the long-term outlook and the importance of that production is still very relevant. And so, in the discussions, I think that's more of what I hear, is around how to be more efficient. Obviously, this is one way to be more efficient. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America.\nChase Mulvehill: I guess the first question I wanted to ask is about C&P guide. Lance, I think you guided up revenues 10% on a sequential basis. I guess, one, can you tell us how much benefit is coming from kind of year-end completion tool sales? And then number two, I would expect that margins would have been up given the strong sequential improvement in revenues. So, kind of help us connect the dots on why margins will be flat? \nLance Loeffler: Well, I think, one, Chase, on your question about completion tools, I think we were clear even in the guidance language that completion tools will be more muted than they have been in recent fourth quarter just given the size of the market and level of activity.  In terms of the guide, I think you have a lots of puts and takes. We have an improving North America structure. But we also have, again, the sort of the muted impact of completion tools that have traditionally led to accretive margins impact in the fourth quarter. \nChase Mulvehill: And if I can just talk more specifically about North America, I think Angie kind of asked about E&P CapEx. And obviously, it will be up from here. I don't think it was quite clear if you thought it would be up on a year-over-year basis. But maybe if we can just talk to kind of frac fleets and kind of where you think the active frac fleet count is today and when we'd get to that kind of 200 level that you guys talked about being kind of required to hold production flat. And then, any thoughts on when you think that rig activity will begin to meaningfully recover? \nJeff Miller: I think with the activity in Q1, and offset by Q2, I think, overall, 2021 will be slightly down from 2020 in terms of overall. But, again, that's sort of factoring out Q1 and Q2 offsetting. So, let's take the second half of this year and project that forward. I think it feels better from here and we see sequential recovery.  I think it really comes down to where does production exit in 2021 will drive then how much activity in 2021. So, we can see a path to that in 2021 in terms of the 200 fleet sort of level. Again, it's going to depend on what is the appetite for producing barrels in North America inside of that time frame.  I think from an overall \u2013 when I think about the frac fleet, I also think about the health of the frac fleet for all of the market. And I think the pace of attrition is going to weigh on that, which means it could create more tightness sooner, even if we were somewhat below that. \nChase Mulvehill: And then, what about rig activity, when do you think that starts to pick up meaningfully? \nJeff Miller: Look, I think that follows the frac activity. So, I would expect we would see rig activity picking up middle of next year, probably middle of 2021 just because that sort of will follow probably the most frac intensity. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JP Morgan. \nSean Meakim: So, Jeff, thinking about normalized margins, you reset the cost base this year. You've indicated you think both segments can generate normalized margins in the mid-teens in the next cycle. So, in 2015 through 2019, normalized margins were maybe 10%, 11%. But you're able to get to that mid-teens level in 2008 to 2014. So, it would be great if you could walk through the building blocks to those normalized expectations, particularly in D&E which I think seems to be a little more of a heavier lift from here.\nJeff Miller: I always talked about a lot of what we're doing in D&E in terms of our iCruise cruise technology, what we've done around other service lines in that business, whether it be wireline and even testing. And so, I think that the building blocks are around, A, getting that technology footprint implemented, which we're doing. I've described sort of the uptake that we've seen in that even in the current market. So then, sort of the next step from that is getting any amount of improved activity, which I believe we will see.  And then, in the international markets, the capital over supply is much less. In fact, capital was getting tight in Q1 of this year, and it remains tight. And so, I don't think it's \u2013 in fact, I think it's quite realistic to expect to see some pricing improvement, which is another key component of how we step those margins up. \nSean Meakim: And that dovetails into \u2013 can you talk a little bit more about the international cycle? So, some of your IOC customers are committing to divert capital away from upstream oil and gas. Your independent customers are being forced by financial markets to commit more cash flow to their balance sheets. Seems like the next international cycle is going to be shorter cycle and more NOC focused. Is that fair, that long cycle maybe falls more out of favor in terms of mix of spend? And just how you think Halliburton is positioned for that type of environment.\nJeff Miller: Well, look, I think we're very well positioned for that kind of environment. A, we're in all of the right locations, we've got relationships with all of the customers you're describing. I think that what we're doing with project management and our investment in lift and chemicals, and those sort of things all play to that type of market even more so. And so, I think that's a place where we've been very successful in the past, and I think that that will ultimately be even a more stable market.  I think oil and gas is so important on so many dimensions that I believe that we'll see more investment, even by NOCs as we move forward into certain of these geographies anyway. But from a positioning perspective in the international markets, really like where we are and really like our technology footprint, and particularly for the kind of outlook you describe that informs our strategy actually, key elements of our five strategic pillars. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. \nScott Gruber: Jeff, a couple of times in the call you highlighted your improving position abroad. Obviously, a number of interesting initiatives there and some good momentum. As we look out into 2021, if we think about things on an exit to exit basis, when the market is hopefully starting to grow again, not asking for your market growth outlook, but how much of a delta do you think you'll be able to deliver versus whatever the underlying market delivers next year, just given your initiatives? \nJeff Miller: Look, I think if that's a top line question, I think we've had a history of outgrowing the market over the last several years, so we know how to grow. We're very much focused on driving profitable growth out of that market. And again, that's precisely what our strategy is intended to do. So, I'm certainly comfortable with our ability to outperform the market and from a growth perspective. Equally comfortable with our ability to drive profitable growth. But I think what you'll see us doing is driving those things that drive a capital efficiency. So, whether it's iCruise or it's digital or it's elements of our business that allow us to make more free cash flow out of that growth going forward. Again, like I said, very excited about how that all shapes up and what the team is working on. \nScott Gruber: And then, a question on Hal Labs, a very interesting initiative. You highlighted several areas of additional expertise we have exposure to, energy transition theme, and where you have some ability to generate revenues. But as we step back and kind of look at the overall revenue opportunity for both you and peers, it seems somewhat small over the next 5 or 10 years with without a material investment and potentially opening some new revenue channels, how do you think about that potential balance? How do you think about allocating R&D dollars and CapEx dollars and potentially some M&A dollars to the transition theme while also trying to deliver better returns next cycle? And how do you think about when it's potentially time to ramp those investments up a little more aggressively? \nJeff Miller: Yeah, I'm going to be really clear. We're an oilfield services company. And we believe the world needs a lot of oil and gas for a very long time. And really, to the extent capital is shifted away by certain customers, more capital will be invested by others.  But with that as a backdrop, clearly, Halliburton Labs is exciting for us. Let's be really clear how we're doing that. We are, in effect, exchanging our expertise and access to our labs and business network for an equity investment in early stage companies. So, our intent is not to invest capital dollars into that process today beyond what little support \u2013 in fact, not capital dollars. They're engaging in our \u2013 in effect, taking advantage of invested capital that we already have that we know we can take better advantage of doing this.  So, we'll have a front row seat in this space. We'll watch it closely. We have a lot of skills that are applicable to helping companies be successful in this space, and we'll learn a whole lot about this over time.  But I want to be clear, oilfield services is where we're spending our capital today. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC.\nKurt Hallead: I do want to actually extend the conversation a little bit more on that last topic, Jeff. I think as is painfully aware for everybody on this call, investors are definitely shifting their focus, at least in the very near term, toward more the renewable dynamic and clean energy dynamics. And it's good to see that you're going to have that front row seat through Halliburton Innovation Labs. I think we've also seen a number of the major oil companies that are customers of yours start to pivot their budget, some more so than others, like BP, for example, into more the renewable space. And then, I heard you quite clearly that you're an oil services company, and that's kind of where your capital is going to go.  But I'm kind of interested on kind of delving beyond those dynamics and getting into how you may be looking longer term through this process. Do you think the shift on renewable energy is just going to fizzle out, like it has been prior cycles, or do you actually see Halliburton playing a meaningful role in that dynamic and having it be a meaningful piece of the business and maybe having a third business line with Completion and Production and Drilling and Evaluation as part of the Halliburton portfolio in the future? \nJeff Miller: I think that there will be the different forms of energy, renewable energy, alternative energy, they will all compete for space. And I believe oil and gas is very affordable and very effective. And it will be for a very long time. But that's not to say there won't be competitors in the space. Nuclear has been in the space a long time. And so, what I think from a Halliburton Labs perspective, it's looking at the disruption that happens, of which there will be much. But oil and gas remains very competitive in that kind of environment. So, I won't try to call, does it fizzle, does it make it. What it will have to do over the long term is compete and feel very good about oil and gas as a competitor. \nKurt Hallead: And my follow-up then is just along the lines of more the traditional business dynamics. So, you guys referenced a tighter market for both North America and International going forward, the prospect to get margin improvement on the heels of higher activity, even without pricing. So, I was just wondering if you could help us frame that dynamic. In the context of prior cycles, you typically would get maybe incremental margins anywhere around 35% to maybe 50% with pricing power. Without the pricing power, with the cost savings and higher activity, how are you guys thinking about the prospect for incremental margins as we as we move off the second half of 2020 and go into 2021?\nLance Loeffler: Kurt, this is Lance. Look, I think everything that we've done around sort of the structural cost cutting exercise that we've been through this year in major form will also continue on the edges as we move forward. But it was all built to reset our cost structure in order to drive better incrementals going forward.  Now, look, clearly, activity helps on a lower fixed cost base. You'll see improvement, so I expect that just activity alone will help bolster or incrementals. But, clearly, if you add pricing on top of that, they are supercharged. I think a lot of what this management team on is looking to deliver outside incrementals even in this market in a recovery versus a historical. \nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Miller for closing remarks. \nJeff Miller: Thank you, Shannon. Before we wrap up today's call, I would like to leave you with a few closing comments. Our third quarter performance demonstrates tangible results of Halliburton's execution from our five strategic priorities and the early impact of our earnings power reset. Our strong international business is already delivering returns and margin expansion and I expect it will continue in the next up cycle.  Our leaner North America strategy will enable us to both navigate through the current market conditions and be more profitable as the market recovers.  Finally, our strategic actions boost our earnings power reset and free cash flow generation today and as we power into and win the eventual recovery.  I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Shannon, please close out the call. \nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeff Miller",
            "content": "Thank you, Abu. And Good morning, everyone. The third quarter saw world economy slowly emerge from lockdowns, oil prices move off their lows and the return of shut in production. Demand recovery is starting to unfold while under investment in global oil production capacity, OPEC+ actions and expectations for effective COVID-19 treatments are providing support to commodity prices. However, the pace and magnitude of recovery going forward will vary greatly by geography and customer type, with resurgence of COVID-19 in certain economies presenting near term risks.  Despite these challenges, we continue to execute on our value proposition both for our customers and our company. Every day, our employees collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers, and they're doing it with the best service quality and safety in our history.  Our third quarter financial performance reflects the results of this execution. Let me share some highlights. Total company revenue was about $3 billion, down 7%, and adjusted operating income was $275 million, an improvement of 17% compared to the second quarter of 2020.  Our Completion and Production division revenue declined 6% sequentially, while operating income improved 33%, delivering an operating margin improvement of 4% compared to the second quarter. These results demonstrate the impact of our structural cost reductions and improved utilization in North America land. Our Drilling and Evaluation division revenue and operating income were down 8% and 17% respectively compared to the second quarter of 2020. D&E's top line outperformed rig count declines both internationally and in the US. International revenue was down 7% sequentially as international rig count trended lower by 12%, highlighting the diversity and strength of our international franchise. North America revenue decreased 6% sequentially. Completions activity increases in North America land were more than offset by lower activity in the Gulf of Mexico and lower overall drilling activity as US rig counts declined 35% sequentially.  I'm pleased to report that our $1 billion in structural cost reductions are complete.  And lastly, we generated approximately $730 million of free cash flow through the first three quarters of this year and are on track to generate over $1 billion in free cash flow for the full year.  Before we discuss the details of our third quarter performance, I'd like to say something to our outstanding employees. I appreciate that the last several months have been far from easy. You have experienced disruption and uncertainty both in your personal and work lives. More than ever, you've had to balance taking care of yourselves and your families with your work duties. Through it all, you have performed admirably. You have continued to deliver outstanding products and services to our customers, breaking service quality and safety records along the way.  In April, no one would have predicted the operational and financial success that Halliburton has achieved over the last six months. You should realize these results are your results. They're due to your hard work and perseverance in very challenging times. I'm very proud of you all.  Halliburton is charting a fundamentally different course. We will continue to take strategic actions designed to boost our earnings power and free cash flow generation both today and as we power into and when the eventual recovery.  As markets around the world begin to stabilize, our five strategic priorities will drive Halliburton's future success. First, we continue to focus on our strong international business. We're outperforming in the international markets and plan to balance future growth with the objective of improving margins and returns.  Second, our strategic priority for a leaner, more profitable North American business is well underway as demonstrated by the last two quarters. We will continue to focus on profit, not share, in this more consolidated market, which will remain a key component of the global supply stack.  Third, digital drives everything we do. Our digital framework, Halliburton 4.0, permeates all aspects of our business and enables the success of our other strategic priorities. As digital deployment and integration across the value chain accelerates, we believe that we'll continue to grow our current business, create new revenue opportunities and drive better returns for Halliburton.  Fourth, our capital intensity is structurally lower, with future CapEx expected to be 5% to 6% of revenue. This provides a tailwind to our strong free cash flow generation.  Lastly, Halliburton is committed to a sustainable energy future in which oil and gas continues to play a critical role. On today's call, I will discuss how our third quarter financial performance reflects the impact of these strategic priorities and how our future actions align with them.  Our third quarter demonstrated again that we have a strong international business. It is delivering margin expansion now and we expect it to drive higher returns in the eventual recovery.  For the second quarter in a row, nearly two-thirds of our revenue came from international operations. And both our Drilling and Evaluation and Completion and Production divisions now earn the majority of their revenue in the international markets.  Our business mix and footprint in specific geographies, along with exposure to long-term integrated projects, support our comparative revenue outperformance and more constructive international outlook for 2020. We outperformed the 12% sequential international rig count declines in the third quarter and are trending significantly better than the 20% reported rig count reductions year to date.  Despite the well-known activity slowdowns, our international margins improved sequentially, with several key end markets demonstrating margin improvement year-on-year.  As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we see the pace of activity declines in the international markets slowing and believe we are getting closer to an activity bottom. In the meantime, service companies are being prudent with their capital, which results in limited access equipment. This should lead to a tighter market even without an increase in new activity.  While we believe a broader recovery across all regions will still take time, Halliburton is well positioned to outperform the market.  Here are a few examples. Over the last few years, we've made significant investments in our directional drilling and open hole wireline technologies that are critical to our success in the international markets. These investments are paying off. For example, this year in the eastern hemisphere, we've drilled 5.5 times more footage with our iCruise tools compared to last year despite the decline in rig activity.  Adding to our existing business lines, another important component of Halliburton's strength in the international markets is the ongoing expansion of our production businesses. Today, we have a small international market share in the service segment, which gives us plenty of room to grow. And we are growing.  I'm pleased to announce that, earlier this month, Halliburton was awarded a seven-year contract for electric submersible pumps by a Middle Eastern NOC. We also completed our first ESB installations in a growing geothermal market in Europe.  Halliburton 4.0 supercharges our already strong international business. We use open architecture and digital technologies that drive connectivity and deliver performance to collaborate with our customers and partners, pioneering new approaches to subsurface understanding, well construction and reservoir and production. Our digital innovation and its adoption by our customers are reframing operator project economics through greater efficiencies and improved decision-making. We believe this creates technological differentiation for us, and we expect it will drive higher returns.  Today, as more customers contract for integrated services packages, we continue to benefit from our strong project management capabilities that deliver efficiencies and reduce total cost of ownership for our customers.  Going forward, Halliburton Well Construction 4.0 will enable our project management business to deliver more efficient wells by reducing planning time, improving drilling performance, and lowering well construction costs and risks.  Well Construction 4.0 provides a singular interface for wellsite performance management. Its open architecture environment enables seamless integration and collaboration of our premium technologies, like Cerebro intelligent bits, LOGIX automated drilling software, and BaraLogix real time density and rheology with any third-party service or application. As part of Halliburton Production 4.0, we have formed a new alliance with Honeywell to use our digital technologies to optimize our customers assets like a manufacturing plant, fundamentally changing the way surface and subsurface are simultaneously managed. This helps our customers optimize their production. Halliburton delivers reservoir modeling, well and field surveillance, ESB optimization and well intervention. Honeywell brings its expertise and topside automation, surface equipment performance monitoring and productivity solutions. This is not simply an expectation for tomorrow. This is digital in action today for customers like PTTEP in Thailand.  Our current strengths and new capabilities in the international markets are critical to our future success. The international short cycle producers have an opportunity to regain market share as a result of declining US oil production. As demand starts to improve and outgrow supply, it should encourage international investments in both oil and gas. And our strong international business that now delivers the majority of our revenues is ready to power into the eventual recovery.  The next strategic priority I want to discuss today is driving a leaner, more profitable North America. Last quarter, I described to you in detail the actions we took to reset our earnings power in this key market. To recap, we now have 50% less structural headcount and a 50% smaller real estate footprint in North America compared to last year.  These and other changes to how we're organized and how we execute every day are sustainable and independent of market activity levels. I believe our efficient, disciplined execution in the North American market, together with these structural changes, will drive margin improvements and free cash flow.  Halliburton executed exceptionally well in North America this quarter. Our D&E division outperformed the sequential rig count declines and our C&P division grew and drove overall margin improvement for North America, despite the hurricane season negatively impacting Gulf of Mexico activity. This proves that our cost actions and service delivery process improvements are delivering the intended results.  As the leading completions provider in North America, Halliburton has exposure to every basin and every customer group. The month-on-month land completions activity improvement in the third quarter was a welcome sign. But September stage counts were still below April activity levels, and overall stages completed in US land showed a modest sequential increase for the full quarter. We intend to stay disciplined in how we deploy our fracturing fleets into the recovering market.  Looking ahead to the fourth quarter. We expect North America land completions activity to increase by double digit percentage as operators deplete their DUC inventory. We expect rig counts to lag completions and not step up materially before year-end.  As we predicted, the North America market structure is improving, with both consolidation and rationalization. We've seen a steady flow of consolidation announcements from operators as well as service companies. As I see it, the US shale industry will continue to slim down and, as a result, emerge healthier in a relatively more sustainable growth environment in the future. And this plays to Halliburton strength and our disciplined strategy.  The supply/demand balance for US fracturing capacity is also improving. We estimate that close to 30% of hydraulic fracturing equipment has been permanently retired this year. We expect more will follow as demand remains structurally lower.  Insufficient returns and a lack of reinvestment by service companies should accelerate the cannibalization of idle equipment for parts and the use of sideline pumps to beef up working fleets. We anticipate a tighter balance between horsepower supply and demand as the US achieves more stable production levels.  As we look ahead, we expect pricing to work its way through a couple of predictable steps. The first step, which we're starting to see now, is a recovering demand for active capacity. The first warm stack fleet reactivations are unlikely to see meaningful pricing improvement, but they will increase utilization and revenue on a lower cost base and make a positive contribution to earnings.  The second step will happen when activity recovers enough to call on cold stacked equipment to return to the market. I expect that higher pricing will be necessary to justify incremental investments.  As with our International business, Halliburton 4.0 is driving innovation in North America. Last week, for example, we announced an industry first, the launch of our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing system. SmartFleet marries our digital capabilities and fracturing expertise to do what was not possible until now, give customers control over frac performance in real time. The decisions our customers make about well spacing and multiple pad development have a big impact on their unconventional asset economics. With service efficiencies plateauing and capital remaining constrained, operators strive to make every stage as productive as possible.  Before SmartFleet, however, they faced a high level of uncertainty related to fracture placement and performance. SmartFleet changes this. Its intelligent automation integrates real time fracture measurements, live 3D visualization, and real time fracture commands to give operators control over fracture outcomes while pumping. It sets us apart from the rest of the hydraulic fracturing market and solidifies our industry leadership in intelligent fracturing.  SmartFleet and other Halliburton 4.0 digital offerings will continue to address our customers toughest reservoir challenges and improve the efficiency of our service delivery.  In the near term, I expect the divergence of rig and completions activity will create choppiness as balance sheets are repaired and reinvestment rates continue to adjust. However, we believe that our strategic priority for a leaner and more profitable North America will enable us to successfully navigate through this market contraction and power into the eventual recovery.  Let me now discuss capital efficiency, a key enabler of all our strategic priorities. We believe we can maintain our reduced CapEx at 5% to 6% of revenue, and that it will contribute to sustainable free cash flow generation for our business.  We will keep investing in the development of new technologies and strategically fund international growth as the market recovery unfolds. This includes digitalization of our tools and processes that together with material science and design advancements drive down cost and extend the life of our equipment. At the same time, we will continue to exercise thoughtful capital allocation to the best returns opportunities.  The last strategic priority I will discuss today is Halliburton's commitment to a sustainable energy future. We recognize that the energy landscape is evolving, and alternative energy sources are growing. We're executing our strategies to meet these changes.  First, oil and gas will play a key role in providing the world with affordable and reliable energy long into the future. And we will continue to deploy innovative solutions, including our full digital portfolio to meet that demand.  We will also invest in the future directly through innovation and our recently launched Halliburton Labs. Today, our digital and other technologies help our customers decarbonize their legacy production base and reach their emissions reduction goals.  For example, our digitally enabled iCruise rotary steerable system allows customers to drill wells faster and reduce the number of days a diesel powered rig is on their location, which helps cut down on emissions.  We also help our customers achieve their carbon neutral goals through carbon capture and storage. We provide a variety of services in this space, from subsurface assessment and characterization to well construction and fiber optics monitoring and verification solutions. Our current technology portfolio support CCS projects all around the world \u2013 in Australia, Europe and North America.  We also have decades of experience in providing geothermal drilling services. Halliburton delivers a full range of innovative technologies to address the ultra-high temperature environments, from directional drilling, cementing, fluids, pumping services, logging and casing inspection and project management led developments of geothermal fields. To date, we have participated in operations in all the key geothermal producing areas of the world.  For our own portfolio of services and equipment, we continue to do what we do best \u2013 innovate, collaborate and invest in lowering the emissions profile of our technologies. We have shown steady improvement over the years reducing our scope one and two emissions. In the coming months, we are committed to establishing and sharing our greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets and reporting on our progress.  Finally, I'm excited about the formation of Halliburton Labs, which we announced in the third quarter. It is a collaborative environment where entrepreneurs, academics, investors, and industrial labs come together to advance cleaner, affordable energy. Halliburton receives a minor equity stake in early stage clean energy companies in exchange for their access to our early stage clean energy companies in exchange for their access to our world class facilities, technical expertise, and business network.  But more importantly, Halliburton labs provides us with a wealth of knowledge and an opportunity to play an important role in developing sustainable affordable energy solutions.  Were excited about Halliburton Labs advisory board consisting of leading academics and thought leaders, whose first members include Rice University's Reggie des Roches, Caltech's John Grotzinger and Tulane's Walter Isaacson.  I will now turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our financial results. Lance? Thanks, Lance. To sum up, we're charting a fundamentally different course. I believe our execution of the five key strategic priorities will deliver success for Halliburton now and into the future.  Our strong international business is already delivering returns and margin expansion and I expect that will continue in the next upcycle. Our leaner North America business will enable us to successfully navigate through the market contraction and will be more profitable as the market recovers. Halliburton 4.0 is part of everything we do and enables the success of the other strategic priorities. It will grow our current business, create new revenue opportunities and drive better returns. Our lower capital intensity is expected to contribute to strong free cash flow in the future. Our commitment to a sustainable energy future in which reliable and affordable oil and gas continues to play a critical role will help us and our customers lower emissions. Our creation of Halliburton Labs will accelerate the sustainable affordable energy future.  Halliburton's strategic actions boost our earnings power reset and free cash flow generation today and as we power into and win the eventual recovery. And now, let's open it up for questions. Just broadly, both your questions, 2021 feels better from here. I think the second half of 2020, thinking about that as the bottom, we see progressive improvement in 2021. Separating that a little bit, North America, we're seeing DUC activity now. We'll see DUC activity I suspect into next year. And then, the drilling activity would follow that. But again, if we step back and think about North America, to maintain steady production, whatever the exit rate ends up being, implies the number of wells that need to be drilled. And so, if drilling is below that, then we start to see production drift lower, which then would have a positive impact on commodity price and an impact on \u2013 more so on international activity. From an international perspective, again, we see improvement in 2021 from where we are certainly now and we see that strengthening more so in the back half of 2021 or the second half of 2021 because we do work through seasonality and some other things.  But in either case, we see improving activity. Obviously, the earnings reset or the earnings power reset is a critical part of our strategy. So, those cost cuts are permanent. I expect when activity moves up, we'll see margin improvement follow. We'd see D&E margin start moving upwards when we see broader international drilling activity recover. As I've described, how we might see that next year. C&P is going to benefit from stronger completions activity recovery in North America and also internationally. So, I think C&P probably sees recovery more so first. And margins in D&E improves, gets into the double digit range as we see more sustained recovery internationally. So, again, really like where we are strategically. I think our strategy addresses that and would expect to see the margin progression follow along with the activity. James, look, I think we went into the first part of this year very active. In fact, we were seeing a lot of good things happening in Q1 and it tailed off in Q2. So, I don't think the full year of 2021 eclipses 2020. But trajectory I think is really important because that leads to the eventual recovery that I believe happens. And so, I think we get on that pace starting in 2021? Does it overcome 2020 immediately? Not necessarily. But it's going to just be slightly below. I think we're on a pace because of the sort of under investment that we're seeing. And we're seeing it in the US today and we'll see it \u2013 we've seen it really internationally. And this is just too important to too many governments, to too many people in the world to see it under invested for that long. Yes, I do. I think what we're seeing, service company consolidations is great for Halliburton. It's happening as we expected it would happen. And our approach to this market, which is a different playbook, we wouldn't be doing it if we weren't convinced that it drives better free cash flow and a more profitable market. And so, there are a lot of things that we're doing that are different that will allow us to make more free cash flow in this type of market. And so, I think all of these things are positive. And I would say whether it's consolidation and attrition and rationalization, all of those things are conspiring to create tightness. But even in spite of not having the tightness today, we're seeing the improving margins and returns. I think it's what you see when market efficiency start to come into play, in the sense that these larger operations allow for better application of D&A for all. There's just a lot of costs associated with operating all these different companies. And so, I suspect at some level there's the opportunity to better leverage and make more cash flow by bigger operators. I think the value you're seeing, obviously, the stock price is depressed, but nevertheless the outlook, the long-term outlook and the importance of that production is still very relevant. And so, in the discussions, I think that's more of what I hear, is around how to be more efficient. Obviously, this is one way to be more efficient. I think with the activity in Q1, and offset by Q2, I think, overall, 2021 will be slightly down from 2020 in terms of overall. But, again, that's sort of factoring out Q1 and Q2 offsetting. So, let's take the second half of this year and project that forward. I think it feels better from here and we see sequential recovery.  I think it really comes down to where does production exit in 2021 will drive then how much activity in 2021. So, we can see a path to that in 2021 in terms of the 200 fleet sort of level. Again, it's going to depend on what is the appetite for producing barrels in North America inside of that time frame.  I think from an overall \u2013 when I think about the frac fleet, I also think about the health of the frac fleet for all of the market. And I think the pace of attrition is going to weigh on that, which means it could create more tightness sooner, even if we were somewhat below that. Look, I think that follows the frac activity. So, I would expect we would see rig activity picking up middle of next year, probably middle of 2021 just because that sort of will follow probably the most frac intensity. I always talked about a lot of what we're doing in D&E in terms of our iCruise cruise technology, what we've done around other service lines in that business, whether it be wireline and even testing. And so, I think that the building blocks are around, A, getting that technology footprint implemented, which we're doing. I've described sort of the uptake that we've seen in that even in the current market. So then, sort of the next step from that is getting any amount of improved activity, which I believe we will see.  And then, in the international markets, the capital over supply is much less. In fact, capital was getting tight in Q1 of this year, and it remains tight. And so, I don't think it's \u2013 in fact, I think it's quite realistic to expect to see some pricing improvement, which is another key component of how we step those margins up. Well, look, I think we're very well positioned for that kind of environment. A, we're in all of the right locations, we've got relationships with all of the customers you're describing. I think that what we're doing with project management and our investment in lift and chemicals, and those sort of things all play to that type of market even more so. And so, I think that's a place where we've been very successful in the past, and I think that that will ultimately be even a more stable market.  I think oil and gas is so important on so many dimensions that I believe that we'll see more investment, even by NOCs as we move forward into certain of these geographies anyway. But from a positioning perspective in the international markets, really like where we are and really like our technology footprint, and particularly for the kind of outlook you describe that informs our strategy actually, key elements of our five strategic pillars. Look, I think if that's a top line question, I think we've had a history of outgrowing the market over the last several years, so we know how to grow. We're very much focused on driving profitable growth out of that market. And again, that's precisely what our strategy is intended to do. So, I'm certainly comfortable with our ability to outperform the market and from a growth perspective. Equally comfortable with our ability to drive profitable growth. But I think what you'll see us doing is driving those things that drive a capital efficiency. So, whether it's iCruise or it's digital or it's elements of our business that allow us to make more free cash flow out of that growth going forward. Again, like I said, very excited about how that all shapes up and what the team is working on. Yeah, I'm going to be really clear. We're an oilfield services company. And we believe the world needs a lot of oil and gas for a very long time. And really, to the extent capital is shifted away by certain customers, more capital will be invested by others.  But with that as a backdrop, clearly, Halliburton Labs is exciting for us. Let's be really clear how we're doing that. We are, in effect, exchanging our expertise and access to our labs and business network for an equity investment in early stage companies. So, our intent is not to invest capital dollars into that process today beyond what little support \u2013 in fact, not capital dollars. They're engaging in our \u2013 in effect, taking advantage of invested capital that we already have that we know we can take better advantage of doing this.  So, we'll have a front row seat in this space. We'll watch it closely. We have a lot of skills that are applicable to helping companies be successful in this space, and we'll learn a whole lot about this over time.  But I want to be clear, oilfield services is where we're spending our capital today. I think that there will be the different forms of energy, renewable energy, alternative energy, they will all compete for space. And I believe oil and gas is very affordable and very effective. And it will be for a very long time. But that's not to say there won't be competitors in the space. Nuclear has been in the space a long time. And so, what I think from a Halliburton Labs perspective, it's looking at the disruption that happens, of which there will be much. But oil and gas remains very competitive in that kind of environment. So, I won't try to call, does it fizzle, does it make it. What it will have to do over the long term is compete and feel very good about oil and gas as a competitor. Thank you, Shannon. Before we wrap up today's call, I would like to leave you with a few closing comments. Our third quarter performance demonstrates tangible results of Halliburton's execution from our five strategic priorities and the early impact of our earnings power reset. Our strong international business is already delivering returns and margin expansion and I expect it will continue in the next up cycle.  Our leaner North America strategy will enable us to both navigate through the current market conditions and be more profitable as the market recovers.  Finally, our strategic actions boost our earnings power reset and free cash flow generation today and as we power into and win the eventual recovery.  I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Shannon, please close out the call."

            "name": "Lance Loeffler",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff. Let's begin this morning with an overview of our third quarter results compared to the second quarter of 2020. Total company revenue for the quarter was about $3 billion, representing a 7% decrease, and adjusted operating income was $275 million, or an increase of 17%. These results were primarily driven by continuing rig count declines across multiple regions, partially offset by increased activity in Latin America and higher completions activity in North America land as well as the continued impact of our global cost savings.  In the third quarter, we recognized $133 million of pretax severance and other charges to further adjust our cost structure to current market conditions. The cash component of this charge was approximately $80 million.  Let me cover some of the details related to our divisional results. In our Completion and Production division, revenue decreased $98 million or 6%, while operating income increased $53 million or 33%. The revenue decline was driven by reduced completion tool sales across Europe/Africa/CIS, the Gulf of Mexico, and Latin America, coupled with lower cementing activity in the Middle East, Asia and North America land. It was partially offset by higher stimulation activity and artificial lift sales in North America land, higher activity across multiple product service lines in Argentina, as well as increased pipeline services in Europe/Africa/CIS. Improvements related to stimulation activity in North America land and the impact of our cost reductions drove the overall margin increase.  In our Drilling and Evaluation, revenue decreased $123 million or 8%, while operating income decreased $22 million or 17%. These declines were primarily due to reduced drilling related and wireline services activity in North America and eastern hemisphere, coupled with lower project management activity in the Middle East Asia. They were partially offset by improved drilling activity in Latin America.  Moving on to our geographical results. In North America, revenue decreased $65 million, or 6%. This decline was primarily driven by decreased well construction activity in US land, coupled with reduced activity across multiple product service lines in the Gulf of Mexico, partially offset by higher stimulation activity and artificial lift sales in US land.  In Latin America, revenue increased $34 million or 10%, resulting primarily from increased activity across multiple product service lines in Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico, partially offset by reduced activity in Ecuador and lower completion tool sales in Guyana.  Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue decreased $42 million or 6%. This decline was primarily driven by lower completion tool sales across the region, reduced drilling related services in Norway, and a decline in fluids and cementing activity in Russia.  These reductions were partially offset by increased activity across multiple product service lines in Azerbaijan and a seasonal increase in pipeline services in Europe. In Middle East/Asia, revenue decreased $148 million or 13%, largely resulting from reduced well construction activity across the region, lower project management and wireline activity in the Middle East and decreased project management activity in India. These declines were partially offset by higher completion tool sales in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.  In the third quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $42 million, which was positively impacted by an insurance reimbursement. For the fourth quarter, we estimate that our corporate expense will return to previously announced run rate of $50 million.  Net interest expense for the quarter was $122 million, which included higher interest income from our international subsidiaries. We expect net interest expense closer to $128 million in the fourth quarter.  Our adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 24%. We expect our fourth quarter tax rate to be approximately 15% based on the market environment and our expected geographic earnings mix. Our full year adjusted effective tax rate should be approximately 21%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $155 million and we now expect full-year 2020 CapEx to be less than $800 million. Turning to cash flow, we generated $265 million in free cash flow during the third quarter, primarily driven by our increased operating income and continued working capital improvements. As a result, we improved our cash position during the third quarter ending the period with $2.1 billion in cash. We expect to continue generating positive cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter and expect to deliver full-year free cash flow of over $1b. Now, turning to our short-term operational outlook, let me provide you with our thoughts on the fourth quarter. For our Completion and Production division, we expect higher North America completions activity and traditional year-end completion tool sales which are more muted than in prior years. With that said, we expect revenue to be up approximately 10% and margins to remain flat sequentially. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate a slight sequential increase in our drilling related activity and expect to see typical year-end software sales. As such, revenue for the division should be up mid-single digits with operating margins moving modestly higher by 25 to 50 basis points. I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff? I agree with a lot of the commentary in the questions, meaning that, yes, working capital will be less of a tailwind for our free cash flow next year, but that's replaced by healthier operating profit led by increased activity in the markets that you heard Jeff describe, also a full year benefit of the cost cutting activity that we've been through this year rippling through our operating margins. And so, it'll be much more of an operating-led free cash flow draw and in relationship to the capital intensity that we've talked about, as opposed to working capital unwind next year. Well, I think, one, Chase, on your question about completion tools, I think we were clear even in the guidance language that completion tools will be more muted than they have been in recent fourth quarter just given the size of the market and level of activity.  In terms of the guide, I think you have a lots of puts and takes. We have an improving North America structure. But we also have, again, the sort of the muted impact of completion tools that have traditionally led to accretive margins impact in the fourth quarter. Kurt, this is Lance. Look, I think everything that we've done around sort of the structural cost cutting exercise that we've been through this year in major form will also continue on the edges as we move forward. But it was all built to reset our cost structure in order to drive better incrementals going forward.  Now, look, clearly, activity helps on a lower fixed cost base. You'll see improvement, so I expect that just activity alone will help bolster or incrementals. But, clearly, if you add pricing on top of that, they are supercharged. I think a lot of what this management team on is looking to deliver outside incrementals even in this market in a recovery versus a historical."

Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Thank you Abu, and good morning everyone. The second quarter of 2020 is now behind us. It was a tough one for many industries, including the oil and gas sector. A global pandemic and the resulting collapse in demand have upended many businesses, and as economies around the world emerge from lockdowns, the path forward remains uneven and uncertain.  I am grateful for our employees\u2019 focus, dedication and perseverance during these difficult times. Employee safety is our top priority and we continue our efforts to take the appropriate measures to provide a safe working environment for everyone. COVID-19 is altering our everyday live and business operations, and it is important that we do not let our guard down. Despite this distraction, our safety performance is the best it has ever been with our total recordable incident rate improving more than 20% since the end of last year.  There are three key areas I will address on the call today: first, our solid second quarter performance, demonstrating a significant reset that improves the earnings power of our business despite the severity of the activity collapse; second, the market and business outlook for the second half and full year of 2020; and finally, what we are doing today to make sure that Halliburton powers into and wins the eventual recovery. The global activity collapse in the second quarter was swift and severe, much worse than anticipated. U.S. average rig count for the quarter declined 50% sequentially while international rigs dropped 22% with absolute global rig count sinking to the lowest level in recent history. Halliburton\u2019s response to the market disruption was equally swift and aggressive. As I\u2019ll discuss in a few minutes, our organization responded with a tremendous sense of urgency. Let me cover a few headlines related to our financial performance. Total company revenue was $3.2 billion and adjusted operating income was $236 million. Our completion and production division revenue of $1.7 billion was impacted by a drop in market activity in the low teens in international markets and about 70% in U.S. land completions. Despite these headwinds, C&P delivered a solid operating margin of 9.5% in the second quarter.  Our drilling and evaluation division revenue of $1.5 billion was down largely in line with lower rig count activity globally, delivering operating margin of 8.3% in the second quarter. The speed and effectiveness of the cost actions that we have executed helped minimize the sequential decremental margins to 14% in C&P and 16% in D&E.  Revenue for North America declined 57% sequentially with our C&P and D&E divisions outperforming the completions and drilling activity declines respectively. International revenue was down 17% sequentially, outperforming the rig count decline. Finally, we generated over $450 million in positive free cash flow in the second quarter. As reflected in these results, our aggressive cost actions are an important part of our earnings power reset. As you recall, we removed $300 million in costs over the prior two quarters. In April, we announced an additional $1 billion in annualized cost reductions. I\u2019m pleased to report today that these actions, which are largely permanent changes to our business, are 75% done. I expect the remaining cost reductions, which are mostly aimed at our international business and real estate rationalization, to be completed by the end of the third quarter. Let\u2019s now discuss our expectations for the second half of 2020. Internationally, we anticipate drilling activity to continue to decline modestly while completions stay resilient into year end. The activity changes have not been and will not be uniform across all international markets. On a full year basis, we expect activity in the OPEC countries in the Middle East and the Norwegian sector of the North Sea to be more resilient while Latin America and Africa decline sharply. Some customers are deferring new projects, most notably in the offshore exploration markets. Due to the deeper and longer pull back in Latin America, we now anticipate a mid-teens decline in international customer activity and spend for the full year.  In North America land, some green shoots of completion activity are emerging, but I would not characterize this as the start of a meaningful recovery. After customers bring back shut-in production and as WTI remains range bound around $40, we expect to see a modest uptick in completions activity during the third quarter followed by the usual seasonal deceleration at the end of the year. Drilling activity declines have slowed and we believe the rig count should find a bottom sometime in the third quarter, but a meaningful inflection point in drilling seems further out. Our full year customer spend outlook for North America remains unchanged at approximately 50% down compared to 2019, with gassier basins outperforming the oilier ones.  Further demand weakness from a slower economic recovery or multiple waves of COVID-19 related activity shutdowns present downside risks to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Though we believe we\u2019re positioning our company to ride out those events should they occur, it is not possible to predict the impact that they may have. Regardless, as demonstrated this quarter, I expect Halliburton to outperform the market under any conditions. As we look into the future, I believe the international and North America markets will present opportunities for Halliburton. Although the timing of commodity price recovery remains uncertain, we are taking the necessary actions to thrive in the current market and to prepare Halliburton to win the eventual recovery. International producers have the opportunity to regain market share as a result of declining U.S. production. This should translate into healthy activity levels internationally as oil demand recovers. International shorter cycle barrels will likely fill a higher proportion of future incremental demand requirements. As economic growth returns, we expect the key producing regions to maintain productive spare capacity so they can quickly meet demand. Offshore, longer cycle barrels and new exploration activity will likely be the farthest out in terms of incremental contribution to the supply stack.  Today, we have an excellent international business both in terms of geographic footprint and technology portfolio. Pre-coronavirus, our international business grew revenue every quarter for almost three years, outperforming our largest competitor, and was on the road to meaningful margin improvement. International regions contributed nearly half of our revenue in 2019. They are also historically more resilient on margins, demonstrating the strength of our diverse business. Here\u2019s how we are preparing to win the recovery internationally. We\u2019re driving adoption and expansion of our latest technologies in the international markets. Our EarthStar logging-while-drilling tool has seen a 2.5 times increase in its adoption over the last year, even though it is one of our premium offerings. Our Cerebro in-bit sensor package provides a high speed look at data captured directly from the bit. Its international adoption has doubled this year compared to the first half of 2019. We\u2019ve successfully completed customer qualifications and are currently deploying the latest wire line tractors and ESP pumps in the Middle East.  We are growing and monetizing our digital offerings. They improve performance and efficiency and allow us to introduce new commercial models where all parties share in the benefits of our digital technologies. The Aker BP project in Norway is a demonstration of a customer successfully adopting digital technology to achieve best-in-class performance. We have collaborated with our alliance partners to deploy digitally enabled new technologies and innovative ways of working. Our contract structure, where all alliance partners benefit from these successes, fosters a collaborative culture and drives further performance improvement. We increased rate of penetration by 88% over the course of the well campaign and a third of the wells we drilled on a specific prospect were in the top decile of the industry benchmark for drilling speed. We made great strides in the digital transformation of the well planning cycle, rapidly working towards the goal of planning a well in a day. We applied digital 3D inversion, helping the customer improve their reservoir understanding. This led to re-planning of a whole reservoir section and potential incremental reserves for the customer.  We are also advancing alliances with key industry players both within and outside of the oil and gas sector. We recently announced Halliburton and TechnipFMC collaborated to create Odyssey, the world\u2019s first distributed acoustic sensing solution for subsea wells. This collaboration strengthens our digital capabilities in subsea reservoir monitoring and production optimization. We recently signed a five-year strategic agreement with Microsoft and Accenture to advance Halliburton\u2019s digital capabilities in Microsoft Azure. This is an important step in our adoption of new technology and applications to enhance our digital capabilities and customer offerings, drive additional business agility, and reduce capital expenditures.  We are also taking actions not only to thrive in the current market but to best position our business in the future. Streamlining our cost structure is part of a continuing effort to reduce our fixed costs and improving components of our working capital through a strong focus on managing collections, deploying digital inventory planning solutions, and extending vendor payment terms.  As oil demand recovers, I expect the international business will continue to be a more meaningful contributor to our revenue going forward. I believe that the actions we are taking provide the basis for margin expansion and higher free cash flow conversion internationally in the next up cycle. Turning to North America, we believe that North America production is likely to remain structurally lower in the foreseeable future and have slower growth going forward. With shrinking demand for shale oil and limited access to capital markets, the inevitable rationalization will continue and we expect to see a more disciplined market with stronger operators and service companies. The activity declines and intra-year cyclicality over the last two years led us to change our approach to this market, but what has not changed is our commitment to the single largest oilfield services market and to our leadership position in it. While the North America market will be structurally smaller, we believe that it will be more profitable for us. Our service delivery improvement strategy lowers our fixed and services costs and will drive higher contribution margin with the goal to make Halliburton the most competitive from a cost structure perspective. This strategy has resulted in sustainable changes to how we organize and execute every day in the business and positions us to deliver higher profitability and free cash flow in North America. Our playbook is clear - returns in cash generation matter more than ever, and growth for the sake of market share is a thing of the past. We believe that our size and scale combined with our ability to quickly respond to changing market conditions are strong advantages for us, helping to drive the unit costs down and enabling us to capture work across multiple basins and resource types. The $1.3 billion in cost cuts, a combination of the $300 million in prior cuts and the $1 billion in further reductions, are largely aimed at North America. Let me remind you what we have done to reset the earnings power in this key market. We are changing the fundamentals of how we deliver our services and I expect this will drive a higher contribution margin and lower our fixed costs. We reduced our maintenance cost per horsepower hour by over a third compared to the 2019 run rate by redesigning our maintenance and value engineering processes. This has been scale tested as a permanent change in how we execute our operations and is independent of the market activity levels.  We\u2019ve also made permanent reductions to our workforce. We have flattened our North America organization, removing layers of management. We are using digital and remote operations to reduce the number of frack engineers required to monitor jobs by establishing real-time operations centers and using cloud-based solutions to modernize data flow between the rig site and the back office. We are reducing our real estate footprint by over 100 facilities, which not only removes costs but fits with our digital and remote operations strategy.  In addition to these strategic changes, we will continue to take advantage of our unique competitive strengths. We offer a full suite of oilfield services through 13 product service lines in North America, and we will continue to emphasize our non-frack revenue streams, resulting in a more balanced business portfolio. We continue to deliver differentiated technologies across our product lines, many of them using advances in automation and digitalization. These technologies either lower our costs or improve production results for our customers.  Finally and critically, none of the improvements internationally and in North America happen without our fantastic competitive and committed team focused on achieving all of these objectives and protecting the gains we make over time.  Turning to capital spending, 2020 will be the second year in a row that we have significantly reduced our capex, which will largely be directed towards our international business. Because we size our capital budget based on a committed project pipeline and anticipate returns, we believe that this year, just like in 2019, this capex reduction will not hamper our ability to outperform the market. We will continue to exercise thoughtful capital allocation to the best returning opportunities. The capital intensity of our business has come down and as we think about the future, we project that capex spend as a percentage of revenue will be closer to 5 to 6% versus the historical norms of 10 to 11%.  There are several reasons why we were able to drive this change and positively impact our free cash flow going forward. We now build our equipment cheaper and it lasts longer. Advances in sensing technologies and material sciences are lowering the total cost of ownership for our tools. Design improvements such as component modularity make asset velocity better than ever. This means we need to build fewer tools to support the same level of business. For example, the iCruise drilling system has modular components and standardized electronic inserts for all tool sizes, allowing for 20% better asset velocity.  Digitalization reduces our capital footprint. We\u2019re removing equipment from location and replacing costly hardware with software solutions. We do not anticipate large technology recapitalization programs similar to the build-out of our leading Q10 pumps and the iCruise drilling systems. Finally, the North America business now has structurally lower capital requirements. It is a mature market and frack job intensity is plateauing.  The Halliburton I have just described to you is charting a fundamentally different course. The growth in digital technologies, the position of strength in the international markets, the sharper approach to North America, and a lower capex profile, all of that comes from the hard work that we have been doing over the last few years. We are not waiting for an up cycle to drive significant free cash flow and returns for our shareholders. We believe that the strategic actions we are taking today will further boost our earnings power and free cash flow generation ability as we power into and win the eventual recovery. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our second quarter financial results. Lance?\nLance Loeffler: Thank you Jeff, and good morning. Let\u2019s start with a summary of our second quarter results compared to the first quarter of 2020. Total company revenue for the quarter was $3.2 billion and adjusted operating income was $236 million, representing decreases of 37% and 53% respectively. In the second quarter, we recognized $2.1 billion of pre-tax impairments and other charges to further adjust our cost structure to current market conditions. These charges consisted primarily of non-cash asset impairments mainly associated with pressure pumping equipment and real estate, as well as inventory write-offs, severance, and other costs.  As a result of this charge, we realized a $49 million reduction in depreciation and amortization expense in the second quarter. This impact is reflected in our division results with approximately two-thirds associated with our C&P division and the remainder related to our D&E division. We expect our third quarter depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $225 million, reflecting one month of additional impact. As Jeff mentioned, by the end of the second quarter we also accomplished approximately 75% of the annualized $1 billion in cost reductions, and we intend to complete most of the remaining actions by the end of the third quarter. The cash cost associated with the various cost actions in the second quarter was approximately $180 million. We anticipate that we will incur an additional cash cost of approximately $60 million in the third quarter as we continue to make further structural adjustments.  Moving to our division results, our completion and production revenue was $1.7 billion, a decrease of 44%, while operating income was $159 million, a decrease of 54%. These declines were largely a result of a decrease in pressure pumping activity globally primarily driven by U.S. land and Latin America, coupled with lower artificial lift activity in U.S. land. These were partially offset by improved completion tool sales internationally. Our drilling and evaluation revenue was $1.5 billion, a decrease of 27%, while operating income was $127 million, a decrease of 41%. These declines were primarily due to a global reduction in drilling-related services and lower software sales internationally.  In North America, revenue was $1 billion, a 57% decrease. This decline was driven by reduced activity in U.S. land primarily associated with pressure pumping, well construction, artificial lift, and wire line activity coupled with reduced activity across multiple product service lines in the Gulf of Mexico. Latin America revenue was $346 million, a 33% decrease resulting primarily from decreased activity across multiple product service lines in Argentina, Colombia and Brazil, and lower software sales in Mexico.  Turning to Europe-Africa-CIS, revenue was $691 million, a 17% decrease resulting primarily from reduced well construction and pressure pumping activity and lower software sales across the region. This was partially offset by increased fluids activity and completion tool sales in Norway and improved cementing activity and completion tool sales in Russia.  In the Middle East-Asia region, revenue was $1.1 billion, a 10% decrease largely resulting from reduced activity across the majority of product service lines in the Middle East, Malaysia and India, partially offset by improved drilling activity and completion tool sales in China and Kuwait.  In the second quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $50 million, and this amount should serve as the new quarterly run rate for the rest of the year.  Our interest expense for the quarter was $124 million. For the third quarter, we expect it will be closer to $130 million.  Other expense for the quarter was $48 million, primarily driven by our foreign exchange exposure and currency weakness in Argentina. Looking ahead, we expect it will be approximately $30 million for the third quarter.  Our normalized effective tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 25%, driven by certain discrete tax items and a lower earnings base. For the third quarter and full year, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 24% and 20% respectively.  Capital expenditures for the quarter were $142 million and our full year 2020 capex estimate of $800 million remains unchanged.  Turning to cash flow, we generated $598 million of cash from operations during the second quarter. As anticipated, working capital was a source of cash. As activity declines globally, working capital has historically been a strong source of cash and we expect to see continued benefits from working capital for the rest of this year.  Free cash flow generation for the quarter was $456 million. Our year-to-date and expected earnings performance for the remainder of the year combined with working capital benefits and lower capex should result in full year free cash flow of over $1 billion. Finally, while we remain cautious about the forecasted pace of economic recovery and the potential for additional COVID-related shutdowns, let me provide you with some comments on how we see the third quarter playing out based on our outlook. Sequentially, we expect overall company revenue to decline low single digits in the third quarter. Lower average rig activity across most regions will impact our D&E division while modest completions activity improvements should drive C&P division revenue to be flat to slightly up. The full quarter benefit and continued execution of our cost reductions should offset the impact of lower activity on our profitability. As a result, we expect to deliver higher sequential operating income and modestly higher margin.  Let me now turn the call back over to Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Thanks Lance. To sum up our discussion today, our second quarter performance in a touch market demonstrates our organization\u2019s ability to execute swiftly and aggressively, and we expect to complete our remaining cost actions in the third quarter. We have an excellent international business and it is ready to deliver margin expansion and higher free cash flow conversion in the next up cycle. The actions we have taken in North America, including our service delivery improvement strategy, we believe will enable us to have higher profitability and free cash flow even in a structurally lower environment.  We are moving full steam ahead with the deployment of digital technologies for our customers and internally, and finally Halliburton is charting a fundamentally different course. I believe the strategic actions we are taking today will further boost our earnings power and free cash flow generation ability as we power into and win the eventual recovery. Now let\u2019s open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nJames West: Hey, good morning guys. \nJeff Miller: Morning James.\nJames West: Congrats on the execution in a really [indiscernible] quarter here. Jeff, you talk about this--you\u2019re charting a fundamentally different course, and I think it\u2019s definitely appropriate. We have a vision of the oilfield that I think aligns with your vision for the future of the oilfield - of course digital, lower capital intensity, higher returns are all part of that strategy. Could you maybe talk about where you are in the various parts of that journey, both the digital side, obviously the cost structure in North America - you\u2019re pretty far along in that and you talked about that, maybe the international and the technology delivery?\nJeff Miller: Yes, thanks James, and again when I look through the noise of the COVID disruption and industry consolidation and rationalization, clearly we do focus on what is that new course, and we are working on those things right now. I talked about a number of them in my commentary, but we are focused on doubling down on the technology that\u2019s important, drilling, iCruise, EarthStar, Cerebro, digital, growing our lift in chemicals businesses, which I described in the commentary, and then feeding that technology into our fantastic international business, finally delivering on North America service delivery improvement strategy while at the same time demonstrating structurally lower capex built on capital efficiency in an organization that executes under any conditions. So yes, we are charting a different course.  Progress along digital, we\u2019d talk about each quarter different things that we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re making terrific progress around Halliburton 4.0, feel very good about the kinds of contracts we\u2019re signing today and the work that\u2019s being done behind the scenes to continue to advance that, and obviously you saw some of our announcements with partners this quarter. \nJames West: Okay, so you feel good about the path you\u2019re charting here. What about on the customer side? It seems to me it\u2019s a fundamentally different mindset from the customers as well. What\u2019s their approach or their adoption of these new technologies, particularly on the digital side, and how is that progressing? Are they impediments to change now, or are they really aligning with your view and others views?\nJeff Miller: Look, I\u2019ve always said that digital has to evolve. It\u2019s something that\u2019s built out over time, and it\u2019s done often with partners, so we\u2019ve talked about our partners, but yes, there is appetite for it, absolutely. I think that--when I think about it in terms of reservoir drilling and production, those are the bites that can digested today, and so that\u2019s why when we talk about progress and the things that we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re doing them in those sort of silos not because we view them long term as silos, but because that\u2019s the way that they can be digested right now. \nJames West: I see, okay. Thanks Jeff.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Angie Sedita with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nAngie Sedita: Thanks, good morning. Really impressive quarter. It\u2019s almost unbelievable, the numbers are so good, so kudos to you guys.  International markets, as you touched on Jeff, really important for growth, and you highlighted some of the initiatives there. But can you talk a little bit about cost cutting opportunities and the opportunity to further improve margins? Obviously D&E margins had a nice move in Q1, but can you talk about additional efforts there on the cost cutting side, and then I know there\u2019s a focus on generating more free cash flow out of the international markets, so maybe--and it is over 50% of your revenue, so maybe talk a little bit further about international.\nJeff Miller: Yes, thanks Angie. Look, I think we are positioned in the right markets, the strong markets. We\u2019ve got the technology uptake that\u2019s so important in those markets, and then what we\u2019re doing around lower capital efficiency, or improving capital efficiency, plays straight into that. I expect that we will continue to see progress in those markets, and they will be stronger over time.\nAngie Sedita: Okay, so maybe you can talk a little bit about the evolution here in your capex profile. I think that\u2019s really shone through here in \u201919 and \u201920 in becoming a lower capital intensive company, and really re-thinking the U.S. land market. Maybe can you talk a little further about that capex profile, how you\u2019re looking at the market differently particularly in the U.S., and the long term ability to generate more cash flow, free cash flow?\nJeff Miller: Yes, thank you. When I think about the type of equipment we\u2019re building and actually using equipment more efficiently, lowering the cost of that equipment, those are all the kinds of things that we look at. Obviously we\u2019re focused on improving returns, using our digital capabilities to eliminate costs. We\u2019ve removed roughly 100 facilities, but we only removed 100 facilities by changing the way we work dramatically so that it just takes less capital, and that plays into everything from maintenance to where people work, etc. That\u2019s sort of a North America view.  Now, those same skills and capabilities are applicable everywhere in the world, and so I expect us to continue to drive cost out of our business. That\u2019s really--so when I talk about charting a different course, digital international strength and then a leaner organization that drives technology and efficiency, I think leaner and efficiency and the technology applications will be driving cost out all of the time, including internationally.\nAngie Sedita: Great, thanks Jeff. I\u2019ll turn it over.\nJeff Miller: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Herbert with Simmons. Your line is now open.\nBill Herbert: Good morning, and thank you. Lance, a couple questions for you on cash flow. First of all, do you expect the working capital harvest in the second half of the year to be as substantial as it was in Q2? And then also, difficult to be precise in [indiscernible] with regard to--\nLance Loeffler: Bill, you\u2019re breaking up on me. I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t get all of your question. \nBill Herbert: Sorry, can you hear me now?\nLance Loeffler: It\u2019s a little muffled. \nBill Herbert: Yes, okay. The question was, one, working capital as a source of cash, is it as substantial in the second half of the year as it was in the second quarter? Then with regard to your cash cost saves, difficult to answer, but in the event of a change in regime in November, how do you think about it with regard to your cash costs, as in do you have enough cash--do you have enough tax shield to offset a rise in the corporate tax rate? Thanks.\nLance Loeffler: Yes, so let me address the first part of your question, which is, I think, the working capital unwind and the momentum in the second half of the year. Clearly we had a strong cash flow associated with the unwind in working capital in Q2. I suspect that that momentum continues into Q3 and Q4. It may not be as strong just because we had such--you know, with the revenue declines just in the course of Q2 and the unwind around receivables, and then offset by payables, it was good to see. The organization continues to be really efficient on how we continue to wring out the cash flow generated for working capital. It may not be as strong as the third quarter but I still expect momentum to--excuse me, the second quarter, but I still expect momentum from the unwind to continue to occur in Q3 and Q4. Can you repeat the second question? I think you were talking about administrative expenses, but again, Bill, it\u2019s kind of hard to pick you up.\nBill Herbert: Yes, sorry about this. [Indiscernible] in the event that we have a change in regime in early November, I guess what Biden\u2019s talking about is a 28% corporate tax rate. I\u2019m just curious as to whether with your tax shield, net operating losses, losses etc., do you expect to be [indiscernible] in 2021?\nLance Loeffler: No, we don\u2019t, Bill. We\u2019ve got--certainly we do have the NOLs associated--I mean, look, there\u2019s always other ways that Halliburton continues to pay tax, cash taxes, but at the federal tax level we expect that we\u2019ll have tax shields from NOLs.\nBill Herbert: Thank you very much.\nLance Loeffler: Thanks Bill.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.\nSean Meakim: Thank you, good morning.\nLance Loeffler: Good morning, Sean.\nSean Meakim: So the decrementals were very impressive - you know, a huge difference compared to what we saw in 2015 and 2016. I was hoping we could just get a better sense of the run rate for C&P going forward. Impairments helped with lower D&A, I appreciate you quantifying that for 3Q. It looks like a 400 basis point assistance from 1Q to 3Q. Were there margin benefits from the inventory write-downs? I\u2019m just curious if completions activity gets a little better in 3Q, does the margin follow at the EBITDA line, so looking past EBIT to the EBITDA line?\nLance Loeffler: Yes, look - I think the changes that we\u2019ve described, and based on the guidance we\u2019ve given, I think this has been a--you know, the margins that we\u2019ve reset today clearly have been helped by some of the accounting changes and the impairments that we\u2019ve taken over the first part of the year. But look, it\u2019s not to say that we haven\u2019t done a significant amount of work around the cost cuts, which we believe are permanent. It goes across everything that we\u2019re doing, whether it\u2019s drilling, digital, production, frack in North America as Jeff has described, and so I think in terms of our margin progression, we\u2019re going to continue to work that as hard as we can. We\u2019ve still got some room to continue to improve on that cost cutting journey, as we described in our remarks, and I think it sets us up ultimately that when activity moves up, all of this is done with the expectation that we ultimately have stronger incrementals with these permanent cost cuts and changes. \nJeff Miller: Let me just follow that up with--I mean, the way to look at things in my view is what\u2019s that new course look like, and that new course looks like substantially lower costs, like a reset around costs, where we\u2019re directing our energies towards digital being much sharper in North America around how we invest, what we do, and how we manage that cost structure, internationally continuing to protect and pour technology in that market, and then the structurally lower capex. That all comes from changing things that we\u2019re doing, and so we are changing many businesses processes and just the way we view things, which ultimately drives substantially lower costs and resets margins and cash flow higher.\nSean Meakim: Right, got it. I appreciate that. So then just as a follow-up, if we think that EBIT will be higher quarter over quarter, modestly higher margins as a percentage, does that follow same for EBITDA? Do you think EBITDA can grow quarter over quarter?\nLance Loeffler: Well, I think the implications with everything that we\u2019ve described, Sean, on our prepared remarks will tell you that EBITDA is relatively flat, even though the top line is coming down. \nSean Meakim: Got it. Very helpful, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nDavid Anderson: Hey, good morning Jeff. Obviously international is a bigger part of your business now going forward. Just wondering, in your outlook as you think about international markets, how they\u2019re trending, how you\u2019ve thought about pricing in that outlook, and in particular in the second half of the year. Hearing some reports about pricing concessions being asked for the NOCs, particularly in the Middle East, so I was just wondering if you could talk about that and whether you think that\u2019s a concern or risk for the industry. I know you have a lot of other contracts, LSTK contracts and whatnot, so maybe you can just talk about both sets, if you wouldn\u2019t mind, please?\nJeff Miller: Yes, I think the fact is pricing never recovered internationally, and at this point we haven\u2019t seen many tenders so we don\u2019t have much of a view of that. But bottom line is there\u2019s much less capital internationally - I mean, the excess capital just isn\u2019t there maybe the way that it is in the U.S., so that\u2019s probably getting sorted out in the U.S. as well.  Most of the dialog has been more around working on efficiencies, how to drive more efficient operations both for our customers and for us, and less so around pricing. It doesn\u2019t mean that they don\u2019t get asked about, but at the same time the only effective path forward is to drive better efficiency, utilization of technology, and that sort of thing internationally. I\u2019d say that applies to NOCs and IOCs.\nDavid Anderson: So you\u2019re not being asked to cut your--I didn\u2019t mean on new tenders, I meant on existing work, you\u2019re not being asked to cut price on existing work?\nJeff Miller: Yes, I understand, and I would say that certainly the first response is let\u2019s look for ways to drive better efficiency, not address pricing, because most of these contracts that are in place today were lit arguably at the bottom international cycle, which was in 2016.\nDavid Anderson: Fair point. You mentioned digital quite a bit on today\u2019s call. Just curious about something as you\u2019re looking forward. In terms of where you want to be, let\u2019s just think two or three years down the road here, do you think you can pull all the technology out internally; in other words, can you create all this organically, or do you need to look outside? I guess if I look back in the past, looking back in the mid-90s, technology acquisitions were critical obviously to you and some of your biggest competitors - I\u2019m thinking about Landmark, or course. How are you thinking about that going forward? Is that something you\u2019re going to have look outside of Halliburton? Is it a combination? Just your broader views on that, please.\nJeff Miller: Yes, broadly I treat that the same as we do most of our M&A, in the sense that when we see opportunities to accelerate R&D or we see things that are important adds, we make them, and we\u2019ve continued to do smaller transactions around our digital offerings, so we\u2019re very thoughtful around the build versus buy approach, and that\u2019s a lot of the valuation. We feel like we can, through partners and others, get into all of the things we need to do and deliver platform solutions, and so there\u2019s not a big transformational thing that\u2019s in our minds. More importantly in my view is continuing to advance the R&D around digital.\nDavid Anderson: Thanks Jeff.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nChase Mulvehill: Hey, good morning everybody. I guess we\u2019ll kind of stick on this digital and remote operations that you guys have been talking about through the quarter, the past couple quarters. I guess first, how should we think about the structural margin improvement from these cost savings initiatives on the remote operations and automation side, and how much benefit did you see in 2Q? Then the second part of the question is really how easily can competitors replicate this strategy over time?\nJeff Miller: Yes, thanks Chase. Q2, I mean, the digital technology and the digital approach that we are taking is what enables the cost reductions that we are--a large part of the cost reductions that we\u2019re seeing in Q2. I wouldn\u2019t describe it as enough activity to actually drive the kind of incremental--I mean, it will drive terrific incrementals as we see any activity grow, but the ability--I\u2019m going to stick with real estate rationalization just as a proxy for the kind of things that can be removed when we use the digital solutions that we have internally. For our customers, I think I described in my remarks at least one example around how digital solutions are driving much better performance, both for our customers and for ourselves, and so I think that we will continue to see that play a role.  Replicating digital at scale is very difficult. I mean, I think that will prove to be--I know what\u2019s involved in it for us, and I know that we\u2019re working with some of the very best partners in the industry, and it\u2019s not--it takes a lot of work on our part and a lot of discipline around platform outcomes that are scalable and reliable all the time, so I think that I\u2019m quite confident about where we\u2019re going.\nChase Mulvehill: Okay, great. Appreciate the color. One quick follow-up on the capex side. You mentioned 5 to 6% of revenues being spent on capex. Can you confirm that that\u2019s a long-term capex number and maybe how much of that is maintenance versus growth, and then if this implies that maybe on the international side that the market share gain strategy is less of a focus over the medium to longer term?\nJeff Miller: Yes, I think that the 5 to 6% versus the 10 to 11 is a longer term outlook that\u2019s based on capital efficiency, just to how we build things and how we take them to market, how fast we move them around, all of the things that drive lower capital requirements. I believe those changes are largely permanent also.  When I think about how that plays out internationally, I think that same efficiency, a lot of the technology and tools that I described particularly around capital efficiency, whether it\u2019s iCruise or Cerebro or some of those technologies, are inherently lower capital requirements when they\u2019re being used. Obviously we went through a period of building that out over the last year, but operationally they operate at probably 20% less--you know, more efficient, better velocity. I think we have that to reap internationally over time.\nChase Mulvehill: Perfect. All right, I\u2019ll turn it back over. Thanks Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nScott Gruber: Yes, good morning.\nLance Loeffler: Good morning Scott.\nScott Gruber: The big question for you and peers has been how to make a profit in a smaller U.S. market, and you guys obviously took a great stride here in Q2 to proving that\u2019s very possible. Lance, you mentioned strong incrementals during the recovery here, and I realize we\u2019re just starting to poke out heads out of the bunker from one of the worst downturns we\u2019ve ever seen, but if we do get back to 500 or 600 rigs operating in the U.S., which is more or less consensus I think, what\u2019s a reasonable range to think about where C&P margins could rise to?\nLance Loeffler: Scott, I\u2019ll talk to that. Look, I think as you look into the future and to what the recovery may look like in North America, and the picture that you painted around activity, I think this is going to continue to be a good business that delivers mid-teens margins and produce a heck of a lot of free cash flow. Given the things that we\u2019ve talked about on this call today operationally and the way that we\u2019re becoming sharper in North America with our service delivery improvement initiatives, on top of just structurally lower capex requirements to achieve that business, drives a really nice free cash flow profile, we believe.\nJeff Miller: Yes, and I think in North America--go ahead? Sorry.\nScott Gruber: No, go ahead, Jeff.\nJeff Miller: I\u2019ll only add one thing to that, because as we look at North America, if we just sort of assumed a flat level of production in \u201921 and then we moved that forward into \u201822, we see all of the attrition and tightening that is happening. I think we were well on this path at the end of last year coming into this year, and we saw solid performance in Q1. We expect we get back to a market that\u2019s probably size and shape, at least from the supply and demand of equipment standpoint, something that looks like Q1 2020 sometime further out, and the approach that we\u2019re taking, I think will work very well for us.\nScott Gruber: Got it. Then just given your technology investments on the D&E side and given the cost reset on that side of the business as well, kind of just where you stand in terms of the market share gains internationally, do you think when we\u2019re at mid cycle in the next cycle, is the gap between C&P margin and D&E margins much smaller than what we\u2019ve seen in the last few cycles?\nJeff Miller: Yes, I would expect so. I mean, again we have expectations that that business continues to improve also, and we were well on the way to doing that really up until we got into the pandemic situation and where we are today, but none of the fundamentals have changed around what we\u2019re doing other than, I think, a sharper cost structure around these things. \nScott Gruber: Appreciate it, thank you. \nJeff Miller: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Your line is now open.\nMarc Bianchi: Thank you. I wanted to ask first on the third quarter outlook for completions. I think you mentioned up for your North America C&P business. Do you see that outperforming the market; in other words, do you think that the market could be flat to down but Halliburton\u2019s up, or do you also see the market up in the third quarter?\nJeff Miller: For completions, I think we\u2019re off the bottom in May and I think you\u2019ll see a little bit of an uptick in Q3 as DUCs get completed. Drilling, we think will be down a little bit, and I think that will be many of our customers managing decline rates into the end of the year. But you know, our view of the market is it stays with making returns and taking on the work that we believe we can execute well, so I think that\u2019s what the overall market will do and I think we\u2019ll be in around that.\nMarc Bianchi: Great, thanks for that, Jeff. Then you guys had mentioned in the press release and then a few times on this call about winning the recovery. Maybe if you could offer for us a little bit more color on what that means, what are the metrics we should be looking for from you guys in terms of claiming victory on that front?\nJeff Miller: I think that\u2019s returns and cash flows. We spent a lot of time talking about free cash flow and returns, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re setting up for today. I think we get well through whatever this period of time is until we see commodity prices tighten. I think we do well through this near term, but then when we start to see tightening, we\u2019re going to have the right cost structure that scales very efficiently with strong incrementals, and it delivers a lot of free cash flow and very, very good returns. That\u2019s what winning the recovery looks like to me. \nMarc Bianchi: Is there a threshold? Is there a target that we should be looking for, percentage of revenue in terms of free cash--\nJeff Miller: I think we ought to get closer to that point before we start setting targets around that, but my expectations are that it\u2019s a very strong performance by Halliburton. But it\u2019s out there a ways.\nMarc Bianchi: Great, thank you.\nJeff Miller: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nKurt Hallead: Hey, good morning. \nJeff Miller: Morning Kurt.\nKurt Hallead: Jeff, I was just kind of curious, when you provided the outlook here for the second half of 2020, you indicated an uptick in completion activity in the third quarter and then a seasonal decline in the fourth quarter. I\u2019m just curious on that, just given how rapid the decline in that overall activity was and how sharp the decline in overall spending has been for 2020, so I guess you\u2019re picking up that dynamic from your discussions with customers, so they\u2019re going to get a little more active in the third quarter and just pull back again in the fourth? It seems a little bit counterintuitive, just given how sharply spend and activity has already been cut.\nJeff Miller: Yes, look - I think it\u2019s going to rest more around DUC activity as we go into the second half of the year, so on a relative basis, more pronounced Q3, less pronounced Q4 would be my impression. I think every customer is working their own strategy around what do they need to do as they go into 2021, which will be obviously a time where some stability needs to return to productive capacity and those sorts of things. So is it more modest in Q4? It may be, but my overall outlook is it will be relatively biased even if you just take into account holidays and all the sorts of things that happen in Q4, along with weather. This isn\u2019t the kind of market where you power through terrible weather in an effort to try to get to some point, I don\u2019t think, in Q4. \nKurt Hallead: Okay, that\u2019s good color. Just maybe one quick follow-up here. It looks like the run rate on capex will be a little bit higher in the second half than it was in the first half. You indicated that your capex is project pipeline driven, so is it safe to assume here that you\u2019re starting to see an increase in potential project activity going out into 2021?\nJeff Miller: No, I think what we see are some long lead time items that we do. We talked about projects being deferred but not necessarily cancelled, so we have to manage all of that together, so precisely where those things fall in the calendar is where they fall. I think what\u2019s most important to think about around capital really is the overall efficiency that we\u2019ve driven into both the tools, the process, the asset velocity which will structurally help us keep that at a much lower point than it has been in the past.\nKurt Hallead: Okay, great. Appreciate that follow-up. Thanks.\nJeff Miller: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our question and answer session for today. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Miller for closing remarks.\nOperator:\nJeff Miller: Thank you Liz. Before we wrap up today\u2019s call, I\u2019d like to leave you with a few closing comments. Our second quarter performance demonstrates Halliburton\u2019s ability to execute swiftly and aggressively. The actions we have taken in North America we believe will enable higher profitability and free cash flow, even in a structurally lower environment. We have an excellent international business and are moving full steam ahead with the deployment of digital technologies, both for our customers and internally. Most importantly, Halliburton is charting a fundamentally different course. I believe the strategic actions we are taking today will meaningfully reset our earnings power and free cash flow ability as we power into and win the eventual recovery. I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Liz, please close out the call.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for joining, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeff Miller",
            "content": "Thank you Abu, and good morning everyone. The second quarter of 2020 is now behind us. It was a tough one for many industries, including the oil and gas sector. A global pandemic and the resulting collapse in demand have upended many businesses, and as economies around the world emerge from lockdowns, the path forward remains uneven and uncertain.  I am grateful for our employees' focus, dedication and perseverance during these difficult times. Employee safety is our top priority and we continue our efforts to take the appropriate measures to provide a safe working environment for everyone. COVID-19 is altering our everyday live and business operations, and it is important that we do not let our guard down. Despite this distraction, our safety performance is the best it has ever been with our total recordable incident rate improving more than 20% since the end of last year.  There are three key areas I will address on the call today: first, our solid second quarter performance, demonstrating a significant reset that improves the earnings power of our business despite the severity of the activity collapse; second, the market and business outlook for the second half and full year of 2020; and finally, what we are doing today to make sure that Halliburton powers into and wins the eventual recovery. The global activity collapse in the second quarter was swift and severe, much worse than anticipated. U.S. average rig count for the quarter declined 50% sequentially while international rigs dropped 22% with absolute global rig count sinking to the lowest level in recent history. Halliburton's response to the market disruption was equally swift and aggressive. As I'll discuss in a few minutes, our organization responded with a tremendous sense of urgency. Let me cover a few headlines related to our financial performance. Total company revenue was $3.2 billion and adjusted operating income was $236 million. Our completion and production division revenue of $1.7 billion was impacted by a drop in market activity in the low teens in international markets and about 70% in U.S. land completions. Despite these headwinds, C&P delivered a solid operating margin of 9.5% in the second quarter.  Our drilling and evaluation division revenue of $1.5 billion was down largely in line with lower rig count activity globally, delivering operating margin of 8.3% in the second quarter. The speed and effectiveness of the cost actions that we have executed helped minimize the sequential decremental margins to 14% in C&P and 16% in D&E.  Revenue for North America declined 57% sequentially with our C&P and D&E divisions outperforming the completions and drilling activity declines respectively. International revenue was down 17% sequentially, outperforming the rig count decline. Finally, we generated over $450 million in positive free cash flow in the second quarter. As reflected in these results, our aggressive cost actions are an important part of our earnings power reset. As you recall, we removed $300 million in costs over the prior two quarters. In April, we announced an additional $1 billion in annualized cost reductions. I'm pleased to report today that these actions, which are largely permanent changes to our business, are 75% done. I expect the remaining cost reductions, which are mostly aimed at our international business and real estate rationalization, to be completed by the end of the third quarter. Let's now discuss our expectations for the second half of 2020. Internationally, we anticipate drilling activity to continue to decline modestly while completions stay resilient into year end. The activity changes have not been and will not be uniform across all international markets. On a full year basis, we expect activity in the OPEC countries in the Middle East and the Norwegian sector of the North Sea to be more resilient while Latin America and Africa decline sharply. Some customers are deferring new projects, most notably in the offshore exploration markets. Due to the deeper and longer pull back in Latin America, we now anticipate a mid-teens decline in international customer activity and spend for the full year.  In North America land, some green shoots of completion activity are emerging, but I would not characterize this as the start of a meaningful recovery. After customers bring back shut-in production and as WTI remains range bound around $40, we expect to see a modest uptick in completions activity during the third quarter followed by the usual seasonal deceleration at the end of the year. Drilling activity declines have slowed and we believe the rig count should find a bottom sometime in the third quarter, but a meaningful inflection point in drilling seems further out. Our full year customer spend outlook for North America remains unchanged at approximately 50% down compared to 2019, with gassier basins outperforming the oilier ones.  Further demand weakness from a slower economic recovery or multiple waves of COVID-19 related activity shutdowns present downside risks to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Though we believe we're positioning our company to ride out those events should they occur, it is not possible to predict the impact that they may have. Regardless, as demonstrated this quarter, I expect Halliburton to outperform the market under any conditions. As we look into the future, I believe the international and North America markets will present opportunities for Halliburton. Although the timing of commodity price recovery remains uncertain, we are taking the necessary actions to thrive in the current market and to prepare Halliburton to win the eventual recovery. International producers have the opportunity to regain market share as a result of declining U.S. production. This should translate into healthy activity levels internationally as oil demand recovers. International shorter cycle barrels will likely fill a higher proportion of future incremental demand requirements. As economic growth returns, we expect the key producing regions to maintain productive spare capacity so they can quickly meet demand. Offshore, longer cycle barrels and new exploration activity will likely be the farthest out in terms of incremental contribution to the supply stack.  Today, we have an excellent international business both in terms of geographic footprint and technology portfolio. Pre-coronavirus, our international business grew revenue every quarter for almost three years, outperforming our largest competitor, and was on the road to meaningful margin improvement. International regions contributed nearly half of our revenue in 2019. They are also historically more resilient on margins, demonstrating the strength of our diverse business. Here's how we are preparing to win the recovery internationally. We're driving adoption and expansion of our latest technologies in the international markets. Our EarthStar logging-while-drilling tool has seen a 2.5 times increase in its adoption over the last year, even though it is one of our premium offerings. Our Cerebro in-bit sensor package provides a high speed look at data captured directly from the bit. Its international adoption has doubled this year compared to the first half of 2019. We've successfully completed customer qualifications and are currently deploying the latest wire line tractors and ESP pumps in the Middle East.  We are growing and monetizing our digital offerings. They improve performance and efficiency and allow us to introduce new commercial models where all parties share in the benefits of our digital technologies. The Aker BP project in Norway is a demonstration of a customer successfully adopting digital technology to achieve best-in-class performance. We have collaborated with our alliance partners to deploy digitally enabled new technologies and innovative ways of working. Our contract structure, where all alliance partners benefit from these successes, fosters a collaborative culture and drives further performance improvement. We increased rate of penetration by 88% over the course of the well campaign and a third of the wells we drilled on a specific prospect were in the top decile of the industry benchmark for drilling speed. We made great strides in the digital transformation of the well planning cycle, rapidly working towards the goal of planning a well in a day. We applied digital 3D inversion, helping the customer improve their reservoir understanding. This led to re-planning of a whole reservoir section and potential incremental reserves for the customer.  We are also advancing alliances with key industry players both within and outside of the oil and gas sector. We recently announced Halliburton and TechnipFMC collaborated to create Odyssey, the world's first distributed acoustic sensing solution for subsea wells. This collaboration strengthens our digital capabilities in subsea reservoir monitoring and production optimization. We recently signed a five-year strategic agreement with Microsoft and Accenture to advance Halliburton's digital capabilities in Microsoft Azure. This is an important step in our adoption of new technology and applications to enhance our digital capabilities and customer offerings, drive additional business agility, and reduce capital expenditures.  We are also taking actions not only to thrive in the current market but to best position our business in the future. Streamlining our cost structure is part of a continuing effort to reduce our fixed costs and improving components of our working capital through a strong focus on managing collections, deploying digital inventory planning solutions, and extending vendor payment terms.  As oil demand recovers, I expect the international business will continue to be a more meaningful contributor to our revenue going forward. I believe that the actions we are taking provide the basis for margin expansion and higher free cash flow conversion internationally in the next up cycle. Turning to North America, we believe that North America production is likely to remain structurally lower in the foreseeable future and have slower growth going forward. With shrinking demand for shale oil and limited access to capital markets, the inevitable rationalization will continue and we expect to see a more disciplined market with stronger operators and service companies. The activity declines and intra-year cyclicality over the last two years led us to change our approach to this market, but what has not changed is our commitment to the single largest oilfield services market and to our leadership position in it. While the North America market will be structurally smaller, we believe that it will be more profitable for us. Our service delivery improvement strategy lowers our fixed and services costs and will drive higher contribution margin with the goal to make Halliburton the most competitive from a cost structure perspective. This strategy has resulted in sustainable changes to how we organize and execute every day in the business and positions us to deliver higher profitability and free cash flow in North America. Our playbook is clear - returns in cash generation matter more than ever, and growth for the sake of market share is a thing of the past. We believe that our size and scale combined with our ability to quickly respond to changing market conditions are strong advantages for us, helping to drive the unit costs down and enabling us to capture work across multiple basins and resource types. The $1.3 billion in cost cuts, a combination of the $300 million in prior cuts and the $1 billion in further reductions, are largely aimed at North America. Let me remind you what we have done to reset the earnings power in this key market. We are changing the fundamentals of how we deliver our services and I expect this will drive a higher contribution margin and lower our fixed costs. We reduced our maintenance cost per horsepower hour by over a third compared to the 2019 run rate by redesigning our maintenance and value engineering processes. This has been scale tested as a permanent change in how we execute our operations and is independent of the market activity levels.  We've also made permanent reductions to our workforce. We have flattened our North America organization, removing layers of management. We are using digital and remote operations to reduce the number of frack engineers required to monitor jobs by establishing real-time operations centers and using cloud-based solutions to modernize data flow between the rig site and the back office. We are reducing our real estate footprint by over 100 facilities, which not only removes costs but fits with our digital and remote operations strategy.  In addition to these strategic changes, we will continue to take advantage of our unique competitive strengths. We offer a full suite of oilfield services through 13 product service lines in North America, and we will continue to emphasize our non-frack revenue streams, resulting in a more balanced business portfolio. We continue to deliver differentiated technologies across our product lines, many of them using advances in automation and digitalization. These technologies either lower our costs or improve production results for our customers.  Finally and critically, none of the improvements internationally and in North America happen without our fantastic competitive and committed team focused on achieving all of these objectives and protecting the gains we make over time.  Turning to capital spending, 2020 will be the second year in a row that we have significantly reduced our capex, which will largely be directed towards our international business. Because we size our capital budget based on a committed project pipeline and anticipate returns, we believe that this year, just like in 2019, this capex reduction will not hamper our ability to outperform the market. We will continue to exercise thoughtful capital allocation to the best returning opportunities. The capital intensity of our business has come down and as we think about the future, we project that capex spend as a percentage of revenue will be closer to 5 to 6% versus the historical norms of 10 to 11%.  There are several reasons why we were able to drive this change and positively impact our free cash flow going forward. We now build our equipment cheaper and it lasts longer. Advances in sensing technologies and material sciences are lowering the total cost of ownership for our tools. Design improvements such as component modularity make asset velocity better than ever. This means we need to build fewer tools to support the same level of business. For example, the iCruise drilling system has modular components and standardized electronic inserts for all tool sizes, allowing for 20% better asset velocity.  Digitalization reduces our capital footprint. We're removing equipment from location and replacing costly hardware with software solutions. We do not anticipate large technology recapitalization programs similar to the build-out of our leading Q10 pumps and the iCruise drilling systems. Finally, the North America business now has structurally lower capital requirements. It is a mature market and frack job intensity is plateauing.  The Halliburton I have just described to you is charting a fundamentally different course. The growth in digital technologies, the position of strength in the international markets, the sharper approach to North America, and a lower capex profile, all of that comes from the hard work that we have been doing over the last few years. We are not waiting for an up cycle to drive significant free cash flow and returns for our shareholders. We believe that the strategic actions we are taking today will further boost our earnings power and free cash flow generation ability as we power into and win the eventual recovery. Now I'll turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our second quarter financial results. Lance? Thanks Lance. To sum up our discussion today, our second quarter performance in a touch market demonstrates our organization's ability to execute swiftly and aggressively, and we expect to complete our remaining cost actions in the third quarter. We have an excellent international business and it is ready to deliver margin expansion and higher free cash flow conversion in the next up cycle. The actions we have taken in North America, including our service delivery improvement strategy, we believe will enable us to have higher profitability and free cash flow even in a structurally lower environment.  We are moving full steam ahead with the deployment of digital technologies for our customers and internally, and finally Halliburton is charting a fundamentally different course. I believe the strategic actions we are taking today will further boost our earnings power and free cash flow generation ability as we power into and win the eventual recovery. Now let's open it up for questions. Morning James. Yes, thanks James, and again when I look through the noise of the COVID disruption and industry consolidation and rationalization, clearly we do focus on what is that new course, and we are working on those things right now. I talked about a number of them in my commentary, but we are focused on doubling down on the technology that's important, drilling, iCruise, EarthStar, Cerebro, digital, growing our lift in chemicals businesses, which I described in the commentary, and then feeding that technology into our fantastic international business, finally delivering on North America service delivery improvement strategy while at the same time demonstrating structurally lower capex built on capital efficiency in an organization that executes under any conditions. So yes, we are charting a different course.  Progress along digital, we'd talk about each quarter different things that we're doing. We're making terrific progress around Halliburton 4.0, feel very good about the kinds of contracts we're signing today and the work that's being done behind the scenes to continue to advance that, and obviously you saw some of our announcements with partners this quarter. Look, I've always said that digital has to evolve. It's something that's built out over time, and it's done often with partners, so we've talked about our partners, but yes, there is appetite for it, absolutely. I think that--when I think about it in terms of reservoir drilling and production, those are the bites that can digested today, and so that's why when we talk about progress and the things that we're doing, we're doing them in those sort of silos not because we view them long term as silos, but because that's the way that they can be digested right now. Yes, thanks Angie. Look, I think we are positioned in the right markets, the strong markets. We've got the technology uptake that's so important in those markets, and then what we're doing around lower capital efficiency, or improving capital efficiency, plays straight into that. I expect that we will continue to see progress in those markets, and they will be stronger over time. Yes, thank you. When I think about the type of equipment we're building and actually using equipment more efficiently, lowering the cost of that equipment, those are all the kinds of things that we look at. Obviously we're focused on improving returns, using our digital capabilities to eliminate costs. We've removed roughly 100 facilities, but we only removed 100 facilities by changing the way we work dramatically so that it just takes less capital, and that plays into everything from maintenance to where people work, etc. That's sort of a North America view.  Now, those same skills and capabilities are applicable everywhere in the world, and so I expect us to continue to drive cost out of our business. That's really--so when I talk about charting a different course, digital international strength and then a leaner organization that drives technology and efficiency, I think leaner and efficiency and the technology applications will be driving cost out all of the time, including internationally. Thank you. Let me just follow that up with--I mean, the way to look at things in my view is what's that new course look like, and that new course looks like substantially lower costs, like a reset around costs, where we're directing our energies towards digital being much sharper in North America around how we invest, what we do, and how we manage that cost structure, internationally continuing to protect and pour technology in that market, and then the structurally lower capex. That all comes from changing things that we're doing, and so we are changing many businesses processes and just the way we view things, which ultimately drives substantially lower costs and resets margins and cash flow higher. Yes, I think the fact is pricing never recovered internationally, and at this point we haven't seen many tenders so we don't have much of a view of that. But bottom line is there's much less capital internationally - I mean, the excess capital just isn't there maybe the way that it is in the U.S., so that's probably getting sorted out in the U.S. as well.  Most of the dialog has been more around working on efficiencies, how to drive more efficient operations both for our customers and for us, and less so around pricing. It doesn't mean that they don't get asked about, but at the same time the only effective path forward is to drive better efficiency, utilization of technology, and that sort of thing internationally. I'd say that applies to NOCs and IOCs. Yes, I understand, and I would say that certainly the first response is let's look for ways to drive better efficiency, not address pricing, because most of these contracts that are in place today were lit arguably at the bottom international cycle, which was in 2016. Yes, broadly I treat that the same as we do most of our M&A, in the sense that when we see opportunities to accelerate R&D or we see things that are important adds, we make them, and we've continued to do smaller transactions around our digital offerings, so we're very thoughtful around the build versus buy approach, and that's a lot of the valuation. We feel like we can, through partners and others, get into all of the things we need to do and deliver platform solutions, and so there's not a big transformational thing that's in our minds. More importantly in my view is continuing to advance the R&D around digital. Yes, thanks Chase. Q2, I mean, the digital technology and the digital approach that we are taking is what enables the cost reductions that we are--a large part of the cost reductions that we're seeing in Q2. I wouldn't describe it as enough activity to actually drive the kind of incremental--I mean, it will drive terrific incrementals as we see any activity grow, but the ability--I'm going to stick with real estate rationalization just as a proxy for the kind of things that can be removed when we use the digital solutions that we have internally. For our customers, I think I described in my remarks at least one example around how digital solutions are driving much better performance, both for our customers and for ourselves, and so I think that we will continue to see that play a role.  Replicating digital at scale is very difficult. I mean, I think that will prove to be--I know what's involved in it for us, and I know that we're working with some of the very best partners in the industry, and it's not--it takes a lot of work on our part and a lot of discipline around platform outcomes that are scalable and reliable all the time, so I think that I'm quite confident about where we're going. Yes, I think that the 5 to 6% versus the 10 to 11 is a longer term outlook that's based on capital efficiency, just to how we build things and how we take them to market, how fast we move them around, all of the things that drive lower capital requirements. I believe those changes are largely permanent also.  When I think about how that plays out internationally, I think that same efficiency, a lot of the technology and tools that I described particularly around capital efficiency, whether it's iCruise or Cerebro or some of those technologies, are inherently lower capital requirements when they're being used. Obviously we went through a period of building that out over the last year, but operationally they operate at probably 20% less--you know, more efficient, better velocity. I think we have that to reap internationally over time. Thank you. Yes, and I think in North America--go ahead? Sorry. I'll only add one thing to that, because as we look at North America, if we just sort of assumed a flat level of production in '21 and then we moved that forward into \u201822, we see all of the attrition and tightening that is happening. I think we were well on this path at the end of last year coming into this year, and we saw solid performance in Q1. We expect we get back to a market that's probably size and shape, at least from the supply and demand of equipment standpoint, something that looks like Q1 2020 sometime further out, and the approach that we're taking, I think will work very well for us. Yes, I would expect so. I mean, again we have expectations that that business continues to improve also, and we were well on the way to doing that really up until we got into the pandemic situation and where we are today, but none of the fundamentals have changed around what we're doing other than, I think, a sharper cost structure around these things. Thank you. For completions, I think we're off the bottom in May and I think you'll see a little bit of an uptick in Q3 as DUCs get completed. Drilling, we think will be down a little bit, and I think that will be many of our customers managing decline rates into the end of the year. But you know, our view of the market is it stays with making returns and taking on the work that we believe we can execute well, so I think that's what the overall market will do and I think we'll be in around that. I think that's returns and cash flows. We spent a lot of time talking about free cash flow and returns, and that's what we're setting up for today. I think we get well through whatever this period of time is until we see commodity prices tighten. I think we do well through this near term, but then when we start to see tightening, we're going to have the right cost structure that scales very efficiently with strong incrementals, and it delivers a lot of free cash flow and very, very good returns. That's what winning the recovery looks like to me. I think we ought to get closer to that point before we start setting targets around that, but my expectations are that it's a very strong performance by Halliburton. But it's out there a ways. Thank you. Morning Kurt. Yes, look - I think it's going to rest more around DUC activity as we go into the second half of the year, so on a relative basis, more pronounced Q3, less pronounced Q4 would be my impression. I think every customer is working their own strategy around what do they need to do as they go into 2021, which will be obviously a time where some stability needs to return to productive capacity and those sorts of things. So is it more modest in Q4? It may be, but my overall outlook is it will be relatively biased even if you just take into account holidays and all the sorts of things that happen in Q4, along with weather. This isn't the kind of market where you power through terrible weather in an effort to try to get to some point, I don't think, in Q4. No, I think what we see are some long lead time items that we do. We talked about projects being deferred but not necessarily cancelled, so we have to manage all of that together, so precisely where those things fall in the calendar is where they fall. I think what's most important to think about around capital really is the overall efficiency that we've driven into both the tools, the process, the asset velocity which will structurally help us keep that at a much lower point than it has been in the past. Thank you."

            "name": "Lance Loeffler",
            "content": "Thank you Jeff, and good morning. Let's start with a summary of our second quarter results compared to the first quarter of 2020. Total company revenue for the quarter was $3.2 billion and adjusted operating income was $236 million, representing decreases of 37% and 53% respectively. In the second quarter, we recognized $2.1 billion of pre-tax impairments and other charges to further adjust our cost structure to current market conditions. These charges consisted primarily of non-cash asset impairments mainly associated with pressure pumping equipment and real estate, as well as inventory write-offs, severance, and other costs.  As a result of this charge, we realized a $49 million reduction in depreciation and amortization expense in the second quarter. This impact is reflected in our division results with approximately two-thirds associated with our C&P division and the remainder related to our D&E division. We expect our third quarter depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $225 million, reflecting one month of additional impact. As Jeff mentioned, by the end of the second quarter we also accomplished approximately 75% of the annualized $1 billion in cost reductions, and we intend to complete most of the remaining actions by the end of the third quarter. The cash cost associated with the various cost actions in the second quarter was approximately $180 million. We anticipate that we will incur an additional cash cost of approximately $60 million in the third quarter as we continue to make further structural adjustments.  Moving to our division results, our completion and production revenue was $1.7 billion, a decrease of 44%, while operating income was $159 million, a decrease of 54%. These declines were largely a result of a decrease in pressure pumping activity globally primarily driven by U.S. land and Latin America, coupled with lower artificial lift activity in U.S. land. These were partially offset by improved completion tool sales internationally. Our drilling and evaluation revenue was $1.5 billion, a decrease of 27%, while operating income was $127 million, a decrease of 41%. These declines were primarily due to a global reduction in drilling-related services and lower software sales internationally.  In North America, revenue was $1 billion, a 57% decrease. This decline was driven by reduced activity in U.S. land primarily associated with pressure pumping, well construction, artificial lift, and wire line activity coupled with reduced activity across multiple product service lines in the Gulf of Mexico. Latin America revenue was $346 million, a 33% decrease resulting primarily from decreased activity across multiple product service lines in Argentina, Colombia and Brazil, and lower software sales in Mexico.  Turning to Europe-Africa-CIS, revenue was $691 million, a 17% decrease resulting primarily from reduced well construction and pressure pumping activity and lower software sales across the region. This was partially offset by increased fluids activity and completion tool sales in Norway and improved cementing activity and completion tool sales in Russia.  In the Middle East-Asia region, revenue was $1.1 billion, a 10% decrease largely resulting from reduced activity across the majority of product service lines in the Middle East, Malaysia and India, partially offset by improved drilling activity and completion tool sales in China and Kuwait.  In the second quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $50 million, and this amount should serve as the new quarterly run rate for the rest of the year.  Our interest expense for the quarter was $124 million. For the third quarter, we expect it will be closer to $130 million.  Other expense for the quarter was $48 million, primarily driven by our foreign exchange exposure and currency weakness in Argentina. Looking ahead, we expect it will be approximately $30 million for the third quarter.  Our normalized effective tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 25%, driven by certain discrete tax items and a lower earnings base. For the third quarter and full year, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 24% and 20% respectively.  Capital expenditures for the quarter were $142 million and our full year 2020 capex estimate of $800 million remains unchanged.  Turning to cash flow, we generated $598 million of cash from operations during the second quarter. As anticipated, working capital was a source of cash. As activity declines globally, working capital has historically been a strong source of cash and we expect to see continued benefits from working capital for the rest of this year.  Free cash flow generation for the quarter was $456 million. Our year-to-date and expected earnings performance for the remainder of the year combined with working capital benefits and lower capex should result in full year free cash flow of over $1 billion. Finally, while we remain cautious about the forecasted pace of economic recovery and the potential for additional COVID-related shutdowns, let me provide you with some comments on how we see the third quarter playing out based on our outlook. Sequentially, we expect overall company revenue to decline low single digits in the third quarter. Lower average rig activity across most regions will impact our D&E division while modest completions activity improvements should drive C&P division revenue to be flat to slightly up. The full quarter benefit and continued execution of our cost reductions should offset the impact of lower activity on our profitability. As a result, we expect to deliver higher sequential operating income and modestly higher margin.  Let me now turn the call back over to Jeff. Bill, you're breaking up on me. I'm sorry, I didn't get all of your question. It's a little muffled. Yes, so let me address the first part of your question, which is, I think, the working capital unwind and the momentum in the second half of the year. Clearly we had a strong cash flow associated with the unwind in working capital in Q2. I suspect that that momentum continues into Q3 and Q4. It may not be as strong just because we had such--you know, with the revenue declines just in the course of Q2 and the unwind around receivables, and then offset by payables, it was good to see. The organization continues to be really efficient on how we continue to wring out the cash flow generated for working capital. It may not be as strong as the third quarter but I still expect momentum to--excuse me, the second quarter, but I still expect momentum from the unwind to continue to occur in Q3 and Q4. Can you repeat the second question? I think you were talking about administrative expenses, but again, Bill, it's kind of hard to pick you up. No, we don't, Bill. We've got--certainly we do have the NOLs associated--I mean, look, there's always other ways that Halliburton continues to pay tax, cash taxes, but at the federal tax level we expect that we'll have tax shields from NOLs. Thanks Bill. Good morning, Sean. Yes, look - I think the changes that we've described, and based on the guidance we've given, I think this has been a--you know, the margins that we've reset today clearly have been helped by some of the accounting changes and the impairments that we've taken over the first part of the year. But look, it's not to say that we haven't done a significant amount of work around the cost cuts, which we believe are permanent. It goes across everything that we're doing, whether it's drilling, digital, production, frack in North America as Jeff has described, and so I think in terms of our margin progression, we're going to continue to work that as hard as we can. We've still got some room to continue to improve on that cost cutting journey, as we described in our remarks, and I think it sets us up ultimately that when activity moves up, all of this is done with the expectation that we ultimately have stronger incrementals with these permanent cost cuts and changes. Well, I think the implications with everything that we've described, Sean, on our prepared remarks will tell you that EBITDA is relatively flat, even though the top line is coming down. Good morning Scott. Scott, I'll talk to that. Look, I think as you look into the future and to what the recovery may look like in North America, and the picture that you painted around activity, I think this is going to continue to be a good business that delivers mid-teens margins and produce a heck of a lot of free cash flow. Given the things that we've talked about on this call today operationally and the way that we're becoming sharper in North America with our service delivery improvement initiatives, on top of just structurally lower capex requirements to achieve that business, drives a really nice free cash flow profile, we believe."

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.  I'd now like to hand the conference over to Abu Zeya, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nAbu Zeya: Thank you, Gigi. Good morning and welcome to the Halliburton first quarter 2020 conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton\u2019s website for seven days. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President, and CEO; and Lance Loeffler, CFO. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019; recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of impairments and other charges as well as expenses related to the early extinguishment of debt. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our first quarter press release and can also be found in the Quarterly Results & Presentation section of our website. After our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow time for others who may be in the queue. Now, I will turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Well. Thank you, Abu, and good morning, everyone. We're speaking with you today as billions of people are under some form of quarantine in their homes. Businesses and schools are disrupted and worldwide travel has generally come to a halt. The human and economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic is being felt globally. At the same time, our industry is facing the dual shock of a massive drop in global oil demand, coupled with a resulting oversupply.  As the world is battling the pandemic, I thank our employees for their continued focus during these difficult times. We are a critical part of the global energy infrastructure and an essential service to satisfy both immediate and long-term energy needs. On our customers' work sites and within our facilities, Halliburton people are getting the job done, while taking the appropriate steps to protect themselves and others. Our tiered crisis response model has been road tested in the past through hurricanes and other catastrophic events and it is working well in the current circumstances. Globally, our corporate crisis team monitors the evolving situation across all of our core functions from health and safety to IT infrastructure to supply chain, and provides guidance to support our local response plans. Locally, every country has reviewed their emergency response plans, assessed them for business continuity and activated them in alignment with local authorities. To ensure the safety for all, who must go to a work location, we've provided specific direction about how to work in a COVID-19 world and elevated cleaning protocols for our facilities and equipment.  We've adjusted shifts and rotations to maximize social distancing, as well as implemented varying levels of medical screenings as appropriate. We are maximizing remote work where possible and are encouraging our employees and customers to collaborate virtually using information sharing tools.  Now, let me cover some headlines for what was a solid first quarter of 2020. We finished the quarter with total company revenue of $5.0 billion, a 12% decrease year-over-year; and adjusted operating income of $502 million, an increase of 18% from the first quarter of 2019. Our Completion and Production division revenue declined 19% compared to the first quarter of 2019 and operating margin expanded 170 basis points.  Our Drilling and Evaluation division delivered a strong quarter. Revenue was flat year-over-year and operating margin grew 450 basis points. Our North America revenue declined 25% due to lower activity and pricing in U.S. land. Internationally, we delivered 5% growth this quarter. This marked the 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue increases for our international business.  Finally, free cash flow was effectively neutral for the quarter, which is a significant improvement compared to the first quarter of 2019 and reflects our focus on driving more working capital efficiencies. The first quarter seems like a long time ago, but it is an important demonstration of some key facts. Here's what it tells me.  We make commitments and execute on them quickly. We completed the previously announced $300 million in cost savings. We demonstrated the ability to improve our margins and lower our costs of service delivery. And the Halliburton team is well prepared to adjust and deliver under any market conditions.  Although we came into 2020 with improving expectations for our financial performance in the North America and international markets, the dislocations resulting from the pandemic and the precipitous decline in oil prices have significantly altered those expectations. Let me describe to you what I see ahead of us, recognizing that the market is still in motion.  Activity is in free fall in North America and is slowing down internationally. We cannot predict the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic impact on demand or the pace of any subsequent recovery. At a minimum, we expect the decline in activity to continue through year end. Though we have not experienced anything like the impact of COVID-19 pandemic before, under adverse market conditions, we know what buttons to push and what levers to pull. And we are doing so with swiftness and resolve. Today's market calls for deeper immediate actions. We're significantly reducing costs, cutting CapEx and managing working capital. I will give more detail on each of these actions in a few minutes.  We are unwavering on our commitment to safety and service quality for our customers and our focus on cash flow generation and industry leading returns for our shareholders. And we believe our near term actions will not only temper the impact of activity declines on our financial performance, but also ensure that we are in a strong position financially and structurally to take advantage of the market\u2019s eventual recovery. Before we get into the operational discussion, let me address a few topics I deem critically important in the near term.  First, I believe Halliburton has sufficient liquidity, approximately $5 billion including cash on hand and our undrawn credit facility. Second, in the first quarter, we successfully executed both a tender offer for some of our bonds and a debt offering. As a result, we retired $500 million in total debt and extended the maturity for our $1 billion of senior notes out to 2030. We have focused on debt reduction over the last few years, and we enter this downturn with $2.6 billion less debt than in 2016. We also have a very manageable debt maturity profile with only $1.3 billion coming due through 2024. De-leveraging remains a key priority. We believe our free cash flow generation will be sufficient to pay down upcoming debt maturities in the normal course of business.  Finally, our dividend is a lever we can pull, based on our market outlook and valuations. Our Board and management review the dividend quarterly, and will act prudently to make adjustments for the long-term success of our business. Let me be clear. We have no intentions to increase leverage to maintain the dividend. We also do not intend to allow the dividend to prevent us from being structurally and financially positioned to take advantage of the eventual market recovery.  Now let me describe in more detail what I see unfolding in the markets globally; how we are prepared today compared to the most recent downturn and the actions we are taking to adjust our business to today's market.  The market in North America is experiencing the most dramatic and rapid activity decline in recent history. Our customers continue to revise their capital budgets downwards as they swiftly adjust spending levels in response to the lower commodity price. Right now, North American E&P CapEx is trending towards a 50% reduction year-on-year in 2020.  Since mid-March U.S. land rig count has fallen 34% and is expected to continue declining from here. With prices at the wellhead near cash breakeven levels, we expect activity in North America land to further deteriorate during the second quarter and remain depressed through year-end impacting all basins.  Our outlook for the international markets has also changed. In addition to the collapse of oil prices, the industry is dealing with activity interruptions due to the coronavirus pandemic. COVID-19 had minimal impact on our international operations in the first quarter, but the second quarter will be different. We're seeing restricted movements within countries, quarantine requirements for rotational staff, logistics delay due to third-party personnel reductions, and in some cases, entire country closures. Different markets are impacted differently and this will lead to significant operational disruptions at least through the second quarter.  Beyond these near-term headwinds, certain international customers are also fundamentally reducing capital spending, deferring exploration and appraisal activity and looking to cut costs on their major ongoing projects. We expect international spending to be down in the range of 10% on a full year basis.  OPEC+ production decisions and the duration of the pandemic related demand and activity disruptions will ultimately determine how much the international spending declines this year. International projects and contract structures tend to be longer term oriented. However, in the face of these unprecedented circumstances, our customers, IOCs, NOCs and independents alike, are all reassessing their priorities, with some reacting more swiftly than others. We believe the activity changes internationally will not be uniform across all markets. We anticipate that the least effected markets will be the OPEC countries in the Middle East, while offshore Africa and Latin America may see double-digit declines this year.  As operators in North America and international markets look for ways to cut spending, pricing is a lever they're seeking to pull. We continue to make pricing decisions based on our overall returns expectations for the business. Given the oversupply of fracturing equipment in North America, pricing levels in this market were already at historical lows coming into 2020. Internationally, the pricing increases we were starting to see will take a pause. We will work to improve efficiencies as a means to optimize costs for both our customers and Halliburton. It is important to remember, we were coming into this downturn from a very different place than in 2014, and we believe these differences prepare us better for what lies ahead. Spending in the North America market was down in 2019. In response, we introduced a new playbook to prioritize returns over market share. We restructured our North America organization, rationalized our real estate footprint, completed a cost out program and started addressing our fixed costs through the service delivery improvement strategy.  We clearly had momentum from these efforts coming into 2020. Our more efficient Q10 pumps now represent 100% of our fracturing fleet. We also have the largest number of dual fuel and Tier 4 diesel fuel engines in the market. This fleet composition delivers differentiated service quality and efficiency and will ultimately drive the flight to quality when the market stabilizes in North America. We closed key technology gaps in drilling and openhole wireline, added new artificial lift and specialty chemicals capabilities to our portfolio, and continue to lower our costs across various product offerings. This has taken significant technology spend, which is now largely behind us. Our CapEx in 2019 was down year-over-year and we further reduced CapEx coming into 2020 to drive capital discipline across all of our business segments. As a result, we do not have the significant oversupply of tools and equipment in the international markets. We have built an operating machine to be effective and successful across cycles. Unfortunately, as we enter this downturn, we will need to make some painful decisions, and I am aware that this will cause great difficulty for our impacted employees.  We are implementing the following set of measures that will further reduce our costs and improve our cash generation ability as our customers continue to reduce their spending levels.  We were reducing our capital expenditures for 2020 to about $800 million, roughly 50% from 2019 levels. We believe this level of spend will allow us to invest in our key strategic areas, while continuing to support our business in the active markets. We will take out about $1 billion of annualized overhead and other costs across our entire business, with most of it happening in the next two quarters. To accomplish this, we are streamlining our global and regional headcount, consolidating multiple facilities, and removing another layer of operations management in North America. We're accelerating our service delivery improvement strategy in North America, redesigning the way we deliver our fracturing services to lower our unit cost and improved margins and returns in the long run. We are cutting our technology budget by 25%. We have stopped discretionary spend across the business and we have eliminated salary increases for all personnel this year, and I and other members of the executive committee have taken pay cuts.  Additionally, we will make variable headcount adjustments and rationalize our assets to be in line with the activity reductions we anticipate. As we look to reduce our own input costs, we're also renegotiating prices and terms with our suppliers. Finally, we will continue our efforts on working capital improvements across all three of its components. We believe these actions are necessary given the current environment and will help protect our balance sheet and drive cash flow and returns for our shareholders. As we steer the company through this downturn, we remain focused on the underlying drivers of success and our long-term strategic objectives. We will continue to execute our value proposition, deliver value and efficiency across our product offerings and remain focused on safety and service quality.  We remain committed to being leaders in North America by delivering on our low-cost service improvement strategy. We continue to closely collaborate with our customers and partners on leveraging digital solutions to reduce non-productive time and improve labor and asset efficiency. As I've stated on prior calls, we are in the early innings of our artificial lift and specialty chemicals growth internationally and we plan to continue down this path. We believe these businesses give us exposure to a later cycle market with long-term growth potential. We will continue to spend on technology that reduces our operating costs. We believe this is necessary for the future success of our business. We've been through downturns before. As the market unfolds from here, we believe we have the people, the technology and the depth of experience to outperform our competitors. If required, we will take further actions to adjust to the evolving market.  If I've learned something from all of the downturns I've been through in my career, it is that the industry always bounces back. This downturn, although the most severe we have seen in a generation, will be no different. I believe it will reshape our industry and position it better for the next cycle. At some point, returning global economic and oil demand growth, market balancing supply actions by key producing countries and declining non-OPEC production, will likely lead to a new reinvestment cycle. And I believe Halliburton will emerge stronger on the other side like we always have. Now, I will turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our first quarter financial results. Lance?\nLance Loeffler: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Let's begin with an overview of our first quarter results compared to the first quarter of 2019. Today, our total company revenue for the quarter was $5 billion, a decrease of 12% year-over-year, while adjusted operating income was $502 million, an 18% increase. As Jeff mentioned, during the quarter, we accomplished the remaining $100 million of the announced $300 million in annualized cost reductions. In the first quarter, we recognized approximately $1.1 billion of pre-tax impairments and other charges to further adjust our cost structure to current market conditions. These charges consisted primarily of non-cash asset impairments, mostly associated with pressure pumping equipment, as well as severance and other costs.  In addition, based on the current market environment and its expected impact on our business outlook, we recognized a $310 million non-cash tax adjustment to our deferred tax assets.  Now let me take a moment to discuss our divisional results in more detail. In our Completion and Production division, revenue was $3 billion, a decrease of $700 million or 19% when compared to the first quarter of 2019. Operating income was $345 million, a decrease of $23 million or 6%. These results were primarily due to the lower pressure pumping activity and pricing and reduced completion tool sales in North America partially offset by increased cementing activity and completion tool sales in the Eastern Hemisphere.  In our Drilling and Evaluation division revenue was $2.1 billion which was flat from the first quarter of 2019, while operating income was $217 million, an increase of $94 million or 76%. Higher activity for drilling related services in the North Sea and Asia more than offset reduced activity and pricing for multiple product service lines in North America land and lower fluids activity in Latin America.  Moving on to our geographical results: In North America, revenue was $2.5 billion, a 25% decrease when compared to the first quarter of 2019. This decline was mainly due to reduced activity and pricing in North America land, primarily associated with pressure pumping, well construction and completion tool sales. This decline was partially offset by increased artificial lift activity and specialty chemical sales in North America land and stimulation activity in the Gulf of Mexico.  In Latin America, revenue was $516 million, a 12% decrease year-over-year, resulting primarily from reduced fluids activity and stimulation services across the region, particularly in Argentina. This was coupled with decreased activity in multiple product service lines in Brazil, Ecuador, and Colombia. These declines were partially offset by increased activity across multiple product service lines in Mexico and Guyana.  Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue was $831 million, an 11% increase year-over-year resulting primarily from increased drilling related activity in the North Sea, improved well construction activity in Russia and increased completions activity in Algeria, partially offset by reduced activity in multiple product service lines in Ghana.  In Middle East/Asia, revenue was $1.2 billion, a 9% increase year-over-year, largely resulting from increased activity in the majority of product service lines in the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia and Malaysia, which was partially offset by lower project management activity in India.  In the first quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $60 million and net interest expense was $134 million. Our normalized effective tax rate for the quarter was 21%.  We generated $225 million of cash from operations during the quarter. As anticipated, working capital was seasonally a use of cash but significantly lower than the draw we experienced in the first quarter of 2019. As activity declines globally, working capital has historically been a strong source of cash and I expect a similar pattern this year. We have a heightened focus on improving working capital metrics and are working hard to prudently manage customer credit risk in light of the current market conditions.  Capital expenditures during the quarter were $213 million. As Jeff mentioned, we have reduced our full year CapEx budget to approximately $800 million. These cuts are geared towards both our North America business and uncommitted projects internationally. We believe our capital allocation decisions are consistent with our focus on generating cash flow regardless of the market environment.  Our free cash flow generation for the quarter was $12 million. A significant improvement compared to the first quarter of 2019. During the quarter, we took actions to manage our debt and maturity profile. We executed two transactions, a debt issuance and a subsequent tender, which lowered our total debt by $500 million. But more importantly, it also reduced our 2023 and 2025 maturities by $1.5 billion.  As a result of these transactions, we incurred a net cost of $168 million related to early debt extinguishment. Our total outstanding debt was $9.8 billion as of March 31st. We have no current borrowings under our revolver and no financial covenants in our borrowing facilities for our debt agreements. Now, looking forward, our second quarter results will be impacted by the severity of the continuing activity declines in North America, customer project suspensions and delays internationally, and the uncertain duration of the pandemic-related disruptions, as well as actions related to the OPEC+ production cuts. These uncertainties and the exact timing of our cost reductions impacting our division results preclude us from providing specific guidance for the second quarter. We will continue to execute the measures that Jeff outlined. In addition to the activity-related variable cost adjustments, we plan to reduce annualized overhead and other costs by about $1 billion. To achieve that, we will have an associated cash cost of approximately $200 million. These reductions will target all of our business lines and support functions globally, and we expect to complete most of these actions within the next few quarters. I will now turn the call back over to Jeff for closing comments. Jeff?\nJeff Miller : Thanks, Lance. Before we close, there are two important themes that I see accelerating in the depths of this downturn. Both will be helpful today, but more importantly, they will create strong competitive advantages for us in the future. First, we are fast-tracking the implementation of our service delivery improvement strategy in North America, as we restructure our overall North America business. We launched the strategy to lower the cost -- the overall cost of service delivery in the U.S. last year, and we will accelerate these efforts in the current market. Next, this downturn accelerates the adoption of digital technologies by our customers and by Halliburton internally. We are far along the road to delivering the next frontier of digital solutions that will help drive efficiencies in our workforce and reduce capital investments through automation and self-learning processes. In this environment, digitalization will unlock the potential to structurally lower costs and enhance performance across the entire value chain. I have never been more convinced that digital is the future and Halliburton is leading the way. With that, let me summarize our discussion today. To the Halliburton team, the path ahead will be challenging, but I have the utmost confidence in our ability to maintain focus and execute on our value proposition in this extremely difficult environment. Our balance sheet and liquidity positions are solid, and we plan to continue taking actions to strengthen them. We know what buttons to push and what levers to pull, and we will do so quickly around cost, CapEx and working capital, and we will continue to proactively adjust our business to current market conditions. We know that the industry will recover. It may look different when it does, but we believe the actions we are taking will ensure that we are in a strong position, financially and structurally, to take advantage of the market\u2019s eventual recovery. And now, let\u2019s open it up for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Sean Meakim from JP Morgan. Your line is now open.\nSean Meakim: So, Jeff, I hope we could start with capital allocation and the dividend. Given the forward outlook, the uncertainties, $600 million a year staying on the balance sheet seems pretty useful. I appreciate you have no intention to take on leverage to fund the dividend. You probably have pretty decent free cash this year to cover the dividend, I think especially with working capital benefit. But on a run rate basis, maybe that looks a lot harder exiting 2020. Just I appreciate any additional comments you have about the Board\u2019s decision making on the dividend. And with respect to timing, how to think about that?\nJeff Miller: Well, look -- thank you, Sean. Yes, I've described how we think about the dividend in the prepared remarks. And so, look, we will review the dividend with our Board, we do that quarterly. We have a Board meeting coming up in May and we'll update you on any decisions, when we get to that point.\nSean Meakim: Okay. Fair enough. And then on the $1 billion cost out plan, maybe could you just compare and contrast this initiative relative to the prior $300 million program? I'm just thinking about variable versus fixed costs that you referenced that I think largely this is an overhead cost reduction so perhaps that's more fixed -- maybe the split between North America and international. It would be great to get any more detail you can offer us on that program please?\nJeff Miller: Yes. Look, quite -- it's fixed costs that are coming out. I guess to compare and contrast, we took out $300 million in the fourth quarter of last year. That was largely -- that was fixed cost as we approached the business. I described this cost reduction similarly, because it is not the variable item. So I guess it's overhead and it\u2019s things that are fixed, it\u2019s things that take big steps down when you take them out, you don't necessarily add them back, in contrast to crews and the equipment on location and the supplies and all of the things that go with that. So a lot of that -- a lot of our strategy around North America really had been to accelerate our ability to make those decisions and take costs out quickly. These types of fixed costs, again, it's a layer of management, it's a lot of the discretionary things that we take out that we don't -- that aren't required to add back at any point. \nLance Loeffler: And I would add, Sean, that these costs, as you asked about the split between sort of North America and international, I think these are predominantly aimed at North America, but they also include international cost-cutting as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James West from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nJames West: Hey, Jeff, I wanted to touch on more of a bigger picture question and it relates to something you said right at the end of your prepared comments. And I certainly agree with you that the industry is going to look a whole lot different as you get through this downturn in the next couple of quarters. While that\u2019ll be interesting to watch, are going to cause a major shakeout, which will be a net winner of. I think there are two things and maybe we touched on a little bit in prepared comments but I would like to explore a little more is your deceleration of your delivery strategy in North America and the digital transformation of the industry. Because those things I think are the most important for Halliburton and for the industry quite frankly going forward on what the industry looks like, whether it's a couple quarters or more from today's levels and then?\nJeff Miller: Thanks, James. A fantastic question. And the current environment really accelerates or allows us to really test the art of the possible with respect to how we work and digital is front and center. And I can see, when we embrace that wholeheartedly as opposed to incrementally, we're able to do things quite differently in terms of less people, less footprint, actually working more effectively in my view. But it really does require divorcing the mind of what a lot of us grew up doing to make that step to, wow, this is all possible without you fill in the blank. All of the things we thought were required to actually execute this work. And so, look, this whole period is awful on a lot of different fronts. But I am an optimist and I think we take advantage of an -- time like this and say \u201cOkay, forget everything you thought you knew.\u201d First and foremost, service quality and safety. Everything else, let's go relook at given the robust set of tools that we have. And a lot of these are tools that we've invented at Halliburton or they're built off of our own native cloud platforms. And so from that respect, that makes it very, very sticky as it -- we come out of this. \nJames West: And Jeff, are you seeing a embrace from the -- I mean I know it\u2019s early days in the downturn but are inbounds from customers around the digital offerings you have, have they already started to show an increase as they look to lower their costs or embrace this new paradigm? Or is it happening yet? \nJeff Miller: Actually it is. We've seen a meaningful uptick just in the last 30 days in demand for native cloud services and apps and things that would allow not just working remotely but take the same kind of cost removal that I'm describing, our customers do that when they adopt cloud technology, a lot of what Landmark and our digital organization has been building and has on the shelf. And so it's really -- it's accelerated the demand for that. And obviously necessity is the mother of demand creation in that regard. But quite encouraging to me and actually as I said in my remarks, I'm actually more convinced today than ever that digitalization and the Landmark and then the broader digital platform we have will just serve us better in the future. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons. Your line is now open. \nBill Herbert: Hey Lance, with regard to working capital, if I looked at the last couple of downturns or actually the last downturn, 2015, a huge source of cash with regard to working capital, harvest about a $1 billion, it was front and loaded. 2016 was another $1.2 billion backend loaded. Question is, is that order of magnitude expected to be this time around in 2020? And when does -- and walk us through in terms of the sort of evolution of the working capital harvest this year. Is it second half weighted or does it start to inflect in the second quarter? \nLance Loeffler: Yes, Bill. Thanks for the question. You're right. Historically we have generated cash from working capital during the last three downturns. I would say on the absolute amounts probably a little bit different profile than particularly the 2015 comparison that you were referencing, just given the fact that on an absolute basis our receivables and inventory are at levels that they were coming off of 2014 record level of revenue. So that's a little bit different, but I still expect the relative behavior to be the same. We should continue to see as the business shrinks over the next three quarters that we continue to generate a cash from working capital in the unwind. \nBill Herbert: And then Jeff with regard to pulling forward the art of the possible in terms of digital automation, remote operations, what percentage reduction do you think that would result in with regard to your average crew size? \nJeff Miller: Well, I think it could be in the range of half. I mean it is meaningful. But it's not the crews, it's partly crew size, but it's really all of the things that are in between the crew and sort of the overhead of the company. There are a lot of steps that involve designing work and how work gets actually prepared for delivery, the delivery of products and materials. The ability to embrace the automation of all of that is pretty meaningful. I think crew size can come down as well because there are a few things around the crew that are required to deliver all of that input. But I think the more impactful part will be all of the sort of transaction friction between sort of the top of the organization in there. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nAngie Sedita: So Lance, maybe I'll start with you. I -- it\u2019s impressive the debt reduction and I know it's a focus of both you and Jeff, so maybe you could talk a little bit further about the steps that you're taking around showing up your balance sheet? Obviously you've reduced the $500 million, you pushed out maturities. I think you have another $685 million due in '21. So maybe you can talk about tendering maturities and just talk about free cash flow? \nLance Loeffler: Yes, Angie. As we said sort of on the prepared remarks, our expectation is that we retire the $685 million that comes due next year through the free cash flow generation that we would expect to achieve this year, but roughly a $200 million coming due in February of next year and the remainder in November. And so we think that we've got ample capacity to pay debt down. And the focus philosophically for Jeff and I is to continue to reduce debt at this company and that's what we're going to continue to chase. \nAngie Sedita: And then maybe Jeff, I mean you made a remark in your prepared comments around flight to quality and clearly we've seen this bifurcation in the market. So maybe you could talk a little bit about the flight to quality in North America and what you're seeing so far? Are you seeing that actually playing out in Q2 or is that a bigger factor there when you see a recovery? And just incremental color around C&P and D&E with regard to Q2 and Q3 in the case of the downturn as we go through the rest of the year? \nJeff Miller: Yes, Angie, look, I fully expect we see a flight to quality, but at this very moment there's just not a lot of thought going into anything other than reducing capital spend right now. And so in that kind of environment, there isn't much flight because there's not a lot of new things being added. I\u2019m fully confident and our operating capability and the quality of the service we deliver and we maintain that front and center and fully expect the sort of after the industry is able to take a collective breath, we will be extremely well positioned and see the same flight to quality that we've always seen. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber from Citi. Your line is now open.\nScott Gruber: How should we think about your strategic initiatives in expanding international share in lifts, chemicals, directional and information evaluation in light of the CapEx cuts and market conditions? \nJeff Miller: Well, we -- look, we think that's an important avenue of growth about those businesses to do that. The early work around trials in a number of countries continues on. It doesn't take much capital to get that going and continue that strategic push into those markets albeit I don't think we'll see the same growth that we had anticipated. It's more a matter of pushing those services or delivering those services through the existing infrastructure that we have. So, to continue that strategic initiative is one that we bought those businesses in order to do that. Obviously, we'd like to see better market for those services as we do this. But it doesn't change the fundamental interest and actually opportunity to continue to do the things required to grow those businesses. It takes many steps to grow those businesses internationally and we don't have to stop those.\nScott Gruber: And just circling back to Angie's question, I know the outlook internationally is very opaque, but could you see the vast majority of that annual activity hit in 2Q, and then the second half maybe be more flattish just given a fading impact from COVID offset by the growing impact from the customer CapEx reductions where we\u2019re likely to see activity continue to step down in the second half of the year?\nJeff Miller: Yes. I mean, I think we will see most of the U.S. impact in Q2. I mean that's just -- it's moving so quickly that our view on the U.S. is that we see dramatic reduction in Q2, though not able to call a precise number or timing and then likely kind of works off the rest of the year, the -- flattish. The international market reacts a little differently and I just say that because taking a frac holiday is a lot different than taking a deepwater rig holiday. They just happen at different paces. And so, we've got a view of slowing activity internationally. It doesn't necessarily slow at the same pace that we see it, just because they pick a day, it's like we're going to stop on X date, but it's not today. It's at a point in time. And so, I think that unwind is over more than just Q2, albeit the COVID-19 disruption part should get behind us quickly. It's the same operators that are conserving capital in the U.S., in many cases are the operators that will look to conserve capital internationally. NOCs, if we had a grade level of how effective or impactful, NOCs would be less impacted, probably IOCs more so internationally over the balance of the year. But all of that, we'll have better visibility of that as we go through Q2.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chase Mulvehill from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nChase Mulvehill: So, I guess if we can kind of come back to the U.S. a little bit, obviously 2Q is -- you\u2019re going to take a significant step down. But if we think about your overall strategy for U.S. onshore during this downturn, do you think that you may be focused a little bit more or a little bit less on market share this downturn relative to kind of how you were thinking a couple of months ago?\nJeff Miller: Look, our playbook doesn't change going into this current environment. By that I mean, returns are front and center, albeit challenged, but we're not chasing market share, don't intend to. I don't think that the dynamics have changed. The things that form our view on our strategy for North America haven't changed, the bigger full cycle type things. And so therefore, we're going to manage our costs. We're going to look at the returns on equipment, the best utilization of equipment, whether that's to stack it or work at. But we don't believe that anyone working below EBIT or EBITDA is not going to be successful in the long-term and we plan to be very successful in the long-term. And so, we haven't changed our view there. Flight to quality may result in more market share at some point, but trust me that is not -- and we don't go-to-market thinking about that. \nChase Mulvehill: If I can kind of a switch over to international a little bit, and this has kind of been touched on throughout the Q&A session. But you talked about international CapEx, E&P CapEx being down about 10% year-over-year. OPEC+ members are talking about actually holding 6 million barrels a day of production offline through basically April 2022. So, if they end up doing this, can you talk about the medium term activity outlook for international? Last cycle we were down kind of 40%, it seemed like on international Drilling and Completion spending. Do you think that it will be better or worse, all set and done if OPEC+ does hold this amount of production offline through 2022?\nJeff Miller: Chase, look, I think that's the kind of clarity we will likely get as we work through Q2. But we just don't -- with respect to OPEC+, I think overall they will be more resilient than the rest of the market, almost independent of what impact the recent agreements have or don't have on activity. The market never really recovered from \u201816 other than nominally. So if it would be hard to follow the same distance. Though, like I said, I think we'll get that clarity as we work through Q1, I said in the range of 10% simply because it can be plus or minus something around that band.  I think we've got -- we'll have a better sense in North America as we get through Q2. I think we'll have visibility, but without all of the certainty as we get through Q2. Again, just because those are slower developing, the decisions are slower developing internationally to a degree just because they have to and there's too many partners, nations, governments, things involved to move at the same pace that a North America nimble independent operator can move. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Anderson from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nDavid Anderson: A question on sort of -- I certainly appreciate the lack of visibility in North America. I don't think that's a surprise to anybody. But your customers are all in various states of health as well, if I think about the majors versus E&Ps versus these privates that are out there. Can you just talk about how those discussions are going and maybe the differences that you see in how those customers are behaving now? I know it just seems like to us on the other side it's all sort of coming at as fast and furious, but if you could maybe segregate how those different customers are behaving and what they're talking to you about that'd be very helpful? \nJeff Miller: Look, I think, they're all behaving in the very near term quite similarly. I think they all have a view and I'm not going to just differentiate between the financial position of the market or the different parts of the market. So I would say that's an incredibly aggressive group of competitors. My clients I'm talking about in North America and they're going to each aggressively act independently. The dialogue with them at least with me has been disappointment over the near term, but all, they bit firmly in their teeth looking ahead to what it looks like on the other side. And the dialogue is always that we're going to need to be super competitive and work with Halliburton when we get to the other side. We've had many discussions about what does a recovery or how do we implement the things we're talking about on the other side. So that's generally been a consistent conversation with all customers. \nDavid Anderson: And a separate question on the international side. You said in your remarks, it sounds like the direct impact from the pandemic is mostly to international operations, supply chain, kind of quarantine, having trouble moving people around. Are you seeing the same thing in the U.S.? I haven't really heard that much about that or is it just the fact that the equip activity is falling so fast that you're not really seeing it, it\u2019s somewhat irrelevant? Can you just talk about kind of the more direct impacts of this pandemic to your operations on the U.S. side? \nJeff Miller: Yes, we\u2019re seeing less of the direct impact just because the workforce is all U.S. Most of the travel can be done in a car, not on a plane. So most of the supply chain is North America based.  It's a very little that we actually source outside the U.S. and so I think that's the reason more than any other that we don't see the disruption in the U.S. and obviously we see the commodity price impact in the U.S. But internationally, even if it's not a U.S.-based workforce, we have a very globally based workforce with 140 nations that work for Halliburton and most of those international. So that's where we get into some of that supply chain.  Well, people interruption though, let me compliment our international folks and operations. I mean they ramped up very quickly. The interruptions to this point have been very limited and it\u2019s because that group has literally sprung to action to manage. I just can't tell you how many people moves and supply chain moves that they've overcome. \nDavid Anderson: So does that give you a little bit of comfort in the second part of the year for international that if you are more impacted today from the pandemic, but as that eases, maybe that gives you a little bit of help in the back part of the year? \nJeff Miller: Well I think the COVID interruption part, it gives me a lot of confidence around our ability to find an operating rhythm which our team typically does and does quite well. But I would say that, that does -- the commodity price impact is what we will see as I\u2019ve described earlier, Dave, working through Q2 and what it might mean. Again, I think in the range of 10% which our initial thoughts had been up and now we're talking about down 10% or so in that range. But I think that clarity -- we really don't get that clarity until it settles in.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC. Your line is now open.\nKurt Hallead: So, Jeff, you spent quite a bit of time on the last conference call talking about the digital dynamic, obviously a reference again and emphasized it today. I think last time we had a discussion, you indicated maybe the digital dynamic might not have a very near-term -- big near-term impact on revenue generation. So just wanted to kind a touch base again and given all the disruption that's happened in the industry, given the commentary you\u2019ve made about a number of different discussions now being had and rethinking and reshaping the industry going forward, any updates or any thoughts on how much revenue digital could potentially push, whether it's this year or whether you think it's going to get accelerated as you go into next year as well? \nJeff Miller: Well, look, I think it accelerates as I have described. I don't think any revenue is accelerating at this very moment, albeit we are seeing a meaningful uptick in new users just over the last 30 days. As I said, in our iEnergy cloud, which has been meaningful, but overall hard to describe revenues up in a meaningful way at least right now. That said, though, the ability to reduce cost by implementing these things is in the here and the now. I mean that is like here and the now this week having an impact. And so I think the ability, for example, on our integrated projects as we -- this accelerates the acceptance by customers and the demand even by our own people to implement those tools that de-man rigs, work remotely, all of those are tools that we've been building over the last several years. We've implemented them or we've talked about them, in the North Sea, with Aker BP and some others who've been quite vocal but we've done it with many others. So it's hard to look at that set of tools today and not ask yourself, \u201cWhy am I not using those tools today?\u201d And so I'm really encouraged about the pace we will see.  I think we'll actually see -- its impact will be still over the next few years as that continues to grow, but the existing tools get adopted quite quickly I think in this market. \nKurt Hallead: Great. Thanks for that color Jeff. And maybe a follow-up here for Lance. In prior cycle downturns, typically the decremental margin associated with this down cycle could be anywhere in, let's just call it 40% or so. I know you guys aren\u2019t giving any specific guidance and I appreciate that dynamic. But just trying to think through this element of, if we're coming through this down cycle at kind of lower price points for U.S. frac, didn't really kind of get the same pricing on the international dynamic through this last upturn. Should we still be thinking about maybe baseline to 40% decrementals or should it be lower? And then in that same context, once we come up with that decremental dynamic, I'm assuming we add back $1 billion of that cost savings to whatever we calculate. Is that -- Lance, is that a fair way to think about it?\nLance Loeffler : Yes, I think it is a fair way to think about it. And I won't try to pick an exact number in terms of decrementals in this cycle. But what I will tell you is, is that we're taking out cost now to buoy those decrementals, to soften those decrementals throughout the full cycle of this downturn. I mean, that's the purpose, that's what we're aiming toward. That comes in the form of lowering our unit costs and ultimately doing everything that we can to improve our operating leverage. So, yes, I mean I think that the way that you're thinking about it, if you had an assumption around decrementals, the fit -- the overhead and other costs that we announced, the $1 billion, which is an addition to the $300 million that we've already taken out in the fourth quarter and first quarter of this year-- fourth quarter of last year, first quarter of this year --we expect those to be impactful and to soften the decrementals in this downturn.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Miller for closing remarks.\nJeff Miller : Yes. Thank you, Gigi. Before we wrap up the call, I'd like to leave you with a few closing comments. First, I thank the Halliburton employees for their dedication to safe, reliable service through these difficult times. I have the utmost confidence in their ability to deliver our value proposition, under any conditions. Second, our balance sheet and liquidity position are solid, and we plan to continue taking actions to strengthen them. We are taking swift actions to address cost, CapEx and working capital, and we'll continue to proactively adjust our business to current market conditions. Finally, we know the industry will recover and believe the actions we are taking will ensure that we are in a strong position, financially and structurally, to take advantage of the markets eventual recovery. Look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Gigi, please close out the call.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeff Miller",
            "content": "Well. Thank you, Abu, and good morning, everyone. We're speaking with you today as billions of people are under some form of quarantine in their homes. Businesses and schools are disrupted and worldwide travel has generally come to a halt. The human and economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic is being felt globally. At the same time, our industry is facing the dual shock of a massive drop in global oil demand, coupled with a resulting oversupply.  As the world is battling the pandemic, I thank our employees for their continued focus during these difficult times. We are a critical part of the global energy infrastructure and an essential service to satisfy both immediate and long-term energy needs. On our customers' work sites and within our facilities, Halliburton people are getting the job done, while taking the appropriate steps to protect themselves and others. Our tiered crisis response model has been road tested in the past through hurricanes and other catastrophic events and it is working well in the current circumstances. Globally, our corporate crisis team monitors the evolving situation across all of our core functions from health and safety to IT infrastructure to supply chain, and provides guidance to support our local response plans. Locally, every country has reviewed their emergency response plans, assessed them for business continuity and activated them in alignment with local authorities. To ensure the safety for all, who must go to a work location, we've provided specific direction about how to work in a COVID-19 world and elevated cleaning protocols for our facilities and equipment.  We've adjusted shifts and rotations to maximize social distancing, as well as implemented varying levels of medical screenings as appropriate. We are maximizing remote work where possible and are encouraging our employees and customers to collaborate virtually using information sharing tools.  Now, let me cover some headlines for what was a solid first quarter of 2020. We finished the quarter with total company revenue of $5.0 billion, a 12% decrease year-over-year; and adjusted operating income of $502 million, an increase of 18% from the first quarter of 2019. Our Completion and Production division revenue declined 19% compared to the first quarter of 2019 and operating margin expanded 170 basis points.  Our Drilling and Evaluation division delivered a strong quarter. Revenue was flat year-over-year and operating margin grew 450 basis points. Our North America revenue declined 25% due to lower activity and pricing in U.S. land. Internationally, we delivered 5% growth this quarter. This marked the 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue increases for our international business.  Finally, free cash flow was effectively neutral for the quarter, which is a significant improvement compared to the first quarter of 2019 and reflects our focus on driving more working capital efficiencies. The first quarter seems like a long time ago, but it is an important demonstration of some key facts. Here's what it tells me.  We make commitments and execute on them quickly. We completed the previously announced $300 million in cost savings. We demonstrated the ability to improve our margins and lower our costs of service delivery. And the Halliburton team is well prepared to adjust and deliver under any market conditions.  Although we came into 2020 with improving expectations for our financial performance in the North America and international markets, the dislocations resulting from the pandemic and the precipitous decline in oil prices have significantly altered those expectations. Let me describe to you what I see ahead of us, recognizing that the market is still in motion.  Activity is in free fall in North America and is slowing down internationally. We cannot predict the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic impact on demand or the pace of any subsequent recovery. At a minimum, we expect the decline in activity to continue through year end. Though we have not experienced anything like the impact of COVID-19 pandemic before, under adverse market conditions, we know what buttons to push and what levers to pull. And we are doing so with swiftness and resolve. Today's market calls for deeper immediate actions. We're significantly reducing costs, cutting CapEx and managing working capital. I will give more detail on each of these actions in a few minutes.  We are unwavering on our commitment to safety and service quality for our customers and our focus on cash flow generation and industry leading returns for our shareholders. And we believe our near term actions will not only temper the impact of activity declines on our financial performance, but also ensure that we are in a strong position financially and structurally to take advantage of the market's eventual recovery. Before we get into the operational discussion, let me address a few topics I deem critically important in the near term.  First, I believe Halliburton has sufficient liquidity, approximately $5 billion including cash on hand and our undrawn credit facility. Second, in the first quarter, we successfully executed both a tender offer for some of our bonds and a debt offering. As a result, we retired $500 million in total debt and extended the maturity for our $1 billion of senior notes out to 2030. We have focused on debt reduction over the last few years, and we enter this downturn with $2.6 billion less debt than in 2016. We also have a very manageable debt maturity profile with only $1.3 billion coming due through 2024. De-leveraging remains a key priority. We believe our free cash flow generation will be sufficient to pay down upcoming debt maturities in the normal course of business.  Finally, our dividend is a lever we can pull, based on our market outlook and valuations. Our Board and management review the dividend quarterly, and will act prudently to make adjustments for the long-term success of our business. Let me be clear. We have no intentions to increase leverage to maintain the dividend. We also do not intend to allow the dividend to prevent us from being structurally and financially positioned to take advantage of the eventual market recovery.  Now let me describe in more detail what I see unfolding in the markets globally; how we are prepared today compared to the most recent downturn and the actions we are taking to adjust our business to today's market.  The market in North America is experiencing the most dramatic and rapid activity decline in recent history. Our customers continue to revise their capital budgets downwards as they swiftly adjust spending levels in response to the lower commodity price. Right now, North American E&P CapEx is trending towards a 50% reduction year-on-year in 2020.  Since mid-March U.S. land rig count has fallen 34% and is expected to continue declining from here. With prices at the wellhead near cash breakeven levels, we expect activity in North America land to further deteriorate during the second quarter and remain depressed through year-end impacting all basins.  Our outlook for the international markets has also changed. In addition to the collapse of oil prices, the industry is dealing with activity interruptions due to the coronavirus pandemic. COVID-19 had minimal impact on our international operations in the first quarter, but the second quarter will be different. We're seeing restricted movements within countries, quarantine requirements for rotational staff, logistics delay due to third-party personnel reductions, and in some cases, entire country closures. Different markets are impacted differently and this will lead to significant operational disruptions at least through the second quarter.  Beyond these near-term headwinds, certain international customers are also fundamentally reducing capital spending, deferring exploration and appraisal activity and looking to cut costs on their major ongoing projects. We expect international spending to be down in the range of 10% on a full year basis.  OPEC+ production decisions and the duration of the pandemic related demand and activity disruptions will ultimately determine how much the international spending declines this year. International projects and contract structures tend to be longer term oriented. However, in the face of these unprecedented circumstances, our customers, IOCs, NOCs and independents alike, are all reassessing their priorities, with some reacting more swiftly than others. We believe the activity changes internationally will not be uniform across all markets. We anticipate that the least effected markets will be the OPEC countries in the Middle East, while offshore Africa and Latin America may see double-digit declines this year.  As operators in North America and international markets look for ways to cut spending, pricing is a lever they're seeking to pull. We continue to make pricing decisions based on our overall returns expectations for the business. Given the oversupply of fracturing equipment in North America, pricing levels in this market were already at historical lows coming into 2020. Internationally, the pricing increases we were starting to see will take a pause. We will work to improve efficiencies as a means to optimize costs for both our customers and Halliburton. It is important to remember, we were coming into this downturn from a very different place than in 2014, and we believe these differences prepare us better for what lies ahead. Spending in the North America market was down in 2019. In response, we introduced a new playbook to prioritize returns over market share. We restructured our North America organization, rationalized our real estate footprint, completed a cost out program and started addressing our fixed costs through the service delivery improvement strategy.  We clearly had momentum from these efforts coming into 2020. Our more efficient Q10 pumps now represent 100% of our fracturing fleet. We also have the largest number of dual fuel and Tier 4 diesel fuel engines in the market. This fleet composition delivers differentiated service quality and efficiency and will ultimately drive the flight to quality when the market stabilizes in North America. We closed key technology gaps in drilling and openhole wireline, added new artificial lift and specialty chemicals capabilities to our portfolio, and continue to lower our costs across various product offerings. This has taken significant technology spend, which is now largely behind us. Our CapEx in 2019 was down year-over-year and we further reduced CapEx coming into 2020 to drive capital discipline across all of our business segments. As a result, we do not have the significant oversupply of tools and equipment in the international markets. We have built an operating machine to be effective and successful across cycles. Unfortunately, as we enter this downturn, we will need to make some painful decisions, and I am aware that this will cause great difficulty for our impacted employees.  We are implementing the following set of measures that will further reduce our costs and improve our cash generation ability as our customers continue to reduce their spending levels.  We were reducing our capital expenditures for 2020 to about $800 million, roughly 50% from 2019 levels. We believe this level of spend will allow us to invest in our key strategic areas, while continuing to support our business in the active markets. We will take out about $1 billion of annualized overhead and other costs across our entire business, with most of it happening in the next two quarters. To accomplish this, we are streamlining our global and regional headcount, consolidating multiple facilities, and removing another layer of operations management in North America. We're accelerating our service delivery improvement strategy in North America, redesigning the way we deliver our fracturing services to lower our unit cost and improved margins and returns in the long run. We are cutting our technology budget by 25%. We have stopped discretionary spend across the business and we have eliminated salary increases for all personnel this year, and I and other members of the executive committee have taken pay cuts.  Additionally, we will make variable headcount adjustments and rationalize our assets to be in line with the activity reductions we anticipate. As we look to reduce our own input costs, we're also renegotiating prices and terms with our suppliers. Finally, we will continue our efforts on working capital improvements across all three of its components. We believe these actions are necessary given the current environment and will help protect our balance sheet and drive cash flow and returns for our shareholders. As we steer the company through this downturn, we remain focused on the underlying drivers of success and our long-term strategic objectives. We will continue to execute our value proposition, deliver value and efficiency across our product offerings and remain focused on safety and service quality.  We remain committed to being leaders in North America by delivering on our low-cost service improvement strategy. We continue to closely collaborate with our customers and partners on leveraging digital solutions to reduce non-productive time and improve labor and asset efficiency. As I've stated on prior calls, we are in the early innings of our artificial lift and specialty chemicals growth internationally and we plan to continue down this path. We believe these businesses give us exposure to a later cycle market with long-term growth potential. We will continue to spend on technology that reduces our operating costs. We believe this is necessary for the future success of our business. We've been through downturns before. As the market unfolds from here, we believe we have the people, the technology and the depth of experience to outperform our competitors. If required, we will take further actions to adjust to the evolving market.  If I've learned something from all of the downturns I've been through in my career, it is that the industry always bounces back. This downturn, although the most severe we have seen in a generation, will be no different. I believe it will reshape our industry and position it better for the next cycle. At some point, returning global economic and oil demand growth, market balancing supply actions by key producing countries and declining non-OPEC production, will likely lead to a new reinvestment cycle. And I believe Halliburton will emerge stronger on the other side like we always have. Now, I will turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our first quarter financial results. Lance? Thanks, Lance. Before we close, there are two important themes that I see accelerating in the depths of this downturn. Both will be helpful today, but more importantly, they will create strong competitive advantages for us in the future. First, we are fast-tracking the implementation of our service delivery improvement strategy in North America, as we restructure our overall North America business. We launched the strategy to lower the cost -- the overall cost of service delivery in the U.S. last year, and we will accelerate these efforts in the current market. Next, this downturn accelerates the adoption of digital technologies by our customers and by Halliburton internally. We are far along the road to delivering the next frontier of digital solutions that will help drive efficiencies in our workforce and reduce capital investments through automation and self-learning processes. In this environment, digitalization will unlock the potential to structurally lower costs and enhance performance across the entire value chain. I have never been more convinced that digital is the future and Halliburton is leading the way. With that, let me summarize our discussion today. To the Halliburton team, the path ahead will be challenging, but I have the utmost confidence in our ability to maintain focus and execute on our value proposition in this extremely difficult environment. Our balance sheet and liquidity positions are solid, and we plan to continue taking actions to strengthen them. We know what buttons to push and what levers to pull, and we will do so quickly around cost, CapEx and working capital, and we will continue to proactively adjust our business to current market conditions. We know that the industry will recover. It may look different when it does, but we believe the actions we are taking will ensure that we are in a strong position, financially and structurally, to take advantage of the market's eventual recovery. And now, let's open it up for questions. Well, look -- thank you, Sean. Yes, I've described how we think about the dividend in the prepared remarks. And so, look, we will review the dividend with our Board, we do that quarterly. We have a Board meeting coming up in May and we'll update you on any decisions, when we get to that point. Yes. Look, quite -- it's fixed costs that are coming out. I guess to compare and contrast, we took out $300 million in the fourth quarter of last year. That was largely -- that was fixed cost as we approached the business. I described this cost reduction similarly, because it is not the variable item. So I guess it's overhead and it's things that are fixed, it's things that take big steps down when you take them out, you don't necessarily add them back, in contrast to crews and the equipment on location and the supplies and all of the things that go with that. So a lot of that -- a lot of our strategy around North America really had been to accelerate our ability to make those decisions and take costs out quickly. These types of fixed costs, again, it's a layer of management, it's a lot of the discretionary things that we take out that we don't -- that aren't required to add back at any point. Thanks, James. A fantastic question. And the current environment really accelerates or allows us to really test the art of the possible with respect to how we work and digital is front and center. And I can see, when we embrace that wholeheartedly as opposed to incrementally, we're able to do things quite differently in terms of less people, less footprint, actually working more effectively in my view. But it really does require divorcing the mind of what a lot of us grew up doing to make that step to, wow, this is all possible without you fill in the blank. All of the things we thought were required to actually execute this work. And so, look, this whole period is awful on a lot of different fronts. But I am an optimist and I think we take advantage of an -- time like this and say \u201cOkay, forget everything you thought you knew.\u201d First and foremost, service quality and safety. Everything else, let's go relook at given the robust set of tools that we have. And a lot of these are tools that we've invented at Halliburton or they're built off of our own native cloud platforms. And so from that respect, that makes it very, very sticky as it -- we come out of this. Actually it is. We've seen a meaningful uptick just in the last 30 days in demand for native cloud services and apps and things that would allow not just working remotely but take the same kind of cost removal that I'm describing, our customers do that when they adopt cloud technology, a lot of what Landmark and our digital organization has been building and has on the shelf. And so it's really -- it's accelerated the demand for that. And obviously necessity is the mother of demand creation in that regard. But quite encouraging to me and actually as I said in my remarks, I'm actually more convinced today than ever that digitalization and the Landmark and then the broader digital platform we have will just serve us better in the future. Well, I think it could be in the range of half. I mean it is meaningful. But it's not the crews, it's partly crew size, but it's really all of the things that are in between the crew and sort of the overhead of the company. There are a lot of steps that involve designing work and how work gets actually prepared for delivery, the delivery of products and materials. The ability to embrace the automation of all of that is pretty meaningful. I think crew size can come down as well because there are a few things around the crew that are required to deliver all of that input. But I think the more impactful part will be all of the sort of transaction friction between sort of the top of the organization in there. Yes, Angie, look, I fully expect we see a flight to quality, but at this very moment there's just not a lot of thought going into anything other than reducing capital spend right now. And so in that kind of environment, there isn't much flight because there's not a lot of new things being added. I'm fully confident and our operating capability and the quality of the service we deliver and we maintain that front and center and fully expect the sort of after the industry is able to take a collective breath, we will be extremely well positioned and see the same flight to quality that we've always seen. Well, we -- look, we think that's an important avenue of growth about those businesses to do that. The early work around trials in a number of countries continues on. It doesn't take much capital to get that going and continue that strategic push into those markets albeit I don't think we'll see the same growth that we had anticipated. It's more a matter of pushing those services or delivering those services through the existing infrastructure that we have. So, to continue that strategic initiative is one that we bought those businesses in order to do that. Obviously, we'd like to see better market for those services as we do this. But it doesn't change the fundamental interest and actually opportunity to continue to do the things required to grow those businesses. It takes many steps to grow those businesses internationally and we don't have to stop those. Yes. I mean, I think we will see most of the U.S. impact in Q2. I mean that's just -- it's moving so quickly that our view on the U.S. is that we see dramatic reduction in Q2, though not able to call a precise number or timing and then likely kind of works off the rest of the year, the -- flattish. The international market reacts a little differently and I just say that because taking a frac holiday is a lot different than taking a deepwater rig holiday. They just happen at different paces. And so, we've got a view of slowing activity internationally. It doesn't necessarily slow at the same pace that we see it, just because they pick a day, it's like we're going to stop on X date, but it's not today. It's at a point in time. And so, I think that unwind is over more than just Q2, albeit the COVID-19 disruption part should get behind us quickly. It's the same operators that are conserving capital in the U.S., in many cases are the operators that will look to conserve capital internationally. NOCs, if we had a grade level of how effective or impactful, NOCs would be less impacted, probably IOCs more so internationally over the balance of the year. But all of that, we'll have better visibility of that as we go through Q2. Look, our playbook doesn't change going into this current environment. By that I mean, returns are front and center, albeit challenged, but we're not chasing market share, don't intend to. I don't think that the dynamics have changed. The things that form our view on our strategy for North America haven't changed, the bigger full cycle type things. And so therefore, we're going to manage our costs. We're going to look at the returns on equipment, the best utilization of equipment, whether that's to stack it or work at. But we don't believe that anyone working below EBIT or EBITDA is not going to be successful in the long-term and we plan to be very successful in the long-term. And so, we haven't changed our view there. Flight to quality may result in more market share at some point, but trust me that is not -- and we don't go-to-market thinking about that. Chase, look, I think that's the kind of clarity we will likely get as we work through Q2. But we just don't -- with respect to OPEC+, I think overall they will be more resilient than the rest of the market, almost independent of what impact the recent agreements have or don't have on activity. The market never really recovered from \u201816 other than nominally. So if it would be hard to follow the same distance. Though, like I said, I think we'll get that clarity as we work through Q1, I said in the range of 10% simply because it can be plus or minus something around that band.  I think we've got -- we'll have a better sense in North America as we get through Q2. I think we'll have visibility, but without all of the certainty as we get through Q2. Again, just because those are slower developing, the decisions are slower developing internationally to a degree just because they have to and there's too many partners, nations, governments, things involved to move at the same pace that a North America nimble independent operator can move. Look, I think, they're all behaving in the very near term quite similarly. I think they all have a view and I'm not going to just differentiate between the financial position of the market or the different parts of the market. So I would say that's an incredibly aggressive group of competitors. My clients I'm talking about in North America and they're going to each aggressively act independently. The dialogue with them at least with me has been disappointment over the near term, but all, they bit firmly in their teeth looking ahead to what it looks like on the other side. And the dialogue is always that we're going to need to be super competitive and work with Halliburton when we get to the other side. We've had many discussions about what does a recovery or how do we implement the things we're talking about on the other side. So that's generally been a consistent conversation with all customers. Yes, we're seeing less of the direct impact just because the workforce is all U.S. Most of the travel can be done in a car, not on a plane. So most of the supply chain is North America based.  It's a very little that we actually source outside the U.S. and so I think that's the reason more than any other that we don't see the disruption in the U.S. and obviously we see the commodity price impact in the U.S. But internationally, even if it's not a U.S.-based workforce, we have a very globally based workforce with 140 nations that work for Halliburton and most of those international. So that's where we get into some of that supply chain.  Well, people interruption though, let me compliment our international folks and operations. I mean they ramped up very quickly. The interruptions to this point have been very limited and it's because that group has literally sprung to action to manage. I just can't tell you how many people moves and supply chain moves that they've overcome. Well I think the COVID interruption part, it gives me a lot of confidence around our ability to find an operating rhythm which our team typically does and does quite well. But I would say that, that does -- the commodity price impact is what we will see as I've described earlier, Dave, working through Q2 and what it might mean. Again, I think in the range of 10% which our initial thoughts had been up and now we're talking about down 10% or so in that range. But I think that clarity -- we really don't get that clarity until it settles in. Well, look, I think it accelerates as I have described. I don't think any revenue is accelerating at this very moment, albeit we are seeing a meaningful uptick in new users just over the last 30 days. As I said, in our iEnergy cloud, which has been meaningful, but overall hard to describe revenues up in a meaningful way at least right now. That said, though, the ability to reduce cost by implementing these things is in the here and the now. I mean that is like here and the now this week having an impact. And so I think the ability, for example, on our integrated projects as we -- this accelerates the acceptance by customers and the demand even by our own people to implement those tools that de-man rigs, work remotely, all of those are tools that we've been building over the last several years. We've implemented them or we've talked about them, in the North Sea, with Aker BP and some others who've been quite vocal but we've done it with many others. So it's hard to look at that set of tools today and not ask yourself, \u201cWhy am I not using those tools today?\u201d And so I'm really encouraged about the pace we will see.  I think we'll actually see -- its impact will be still over the next few years as that continues to grow, but the existing tools get adopted quite quickly I think in this market. Yes. Thank you, Gigi. Before we wrap up the call, I'd like to leave you with a few closing comments. First, I thank the Halliburton employees for their dedication to safe, reliable service through these difficult times. I have the utmost confidence in their ability to deliver our value proposition, under any conditions. Second, our balance sheet and liquidity position are solid, and we plan to continue taking actions to strengthen them. We are taking swift actions to address cost, CapEx and working capital, and we'll continue to proactively adjust our business to current market conditions. Finally, we know the industry will recover and believe the actions we are taking will ensure that we are in a strong position, financially and structurally, to take advantage of the markets eventual recovery. Look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Gigi, please close out the call."

            "name": "Lance Loeffler",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Let's begin with an overview of our first quarter results compared to the first quarter of 2019. Today, our total company revenue for the quarter was $5 billion, a decrease of 12% year-over-year, while adjusted operating income was $502 million, an 18% increase. As Jeff mentioned, during the quarter, we accomplished the remaining $100 million of the announced $300 million in annualized cost reductions. In the first quarter, we recognized approximately $1.1 billion of pre-tax impairments and other charges to further adjust our cost structure to current market conditions. These charges consisted primarily of non-cash asset impairments, mostly associated with pressure pumping equipment, as well as severance and other costs.  In addition, based on the current market environment and its expected impact on our business outlook, we recognized a $310 million non-cash tax adjustment to our deferred tax assets.  Now let me take a moment to discuss our divisional results in more detail. In our Completion and Production division, revenue was $3 billion, a decrease of $700 million or 19% when compared to the first quarter of 2019. Operating income was $345 million, a decrease of $23 million or 6%. These results were primarily due to the lower pressure pumping activity and pricing and reduced completion tool sales in North America partially offset by increased cementing activity and completion tool sales in the Eastern Hemisphere.  In our Drilling and Evaluation division revenue was $2.1 billion which was flat from the first quarter of 2019, while operating income was $217 million, an increase of $94 million or 76%. Higher activity for drilling related services in the North Sea and Asia more than offset reduced activity and pricing for multiple product service lines in North America land and lower fluids activity in Latin America.  Moving on to our geographical results: In North America, revenue was $2.5 billion, a 25% decrease when compared to the first quarter of 2019. This decline was mainly due to reduced activity and pricing in North America land, primarily associated with pressure pumping, well construction and completion tool sales. This decline was partially offset by increased artificial lift activity and specialty chemical sales in North America land and stimulation activity in the Gulf of Mexico.  In Latin America, revenue was $516 million, a 12% decrease year-over-year, resulting primarily from reduced fluids activity and stimulation services across the region, particularly in Argentina. This was coupled with decreased activity in multiple product service lines in Brazil, Ecuador, and Colombia. These declines were partially offset by increased activity across multiple product service lines in Mexico and Guyana.  Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue was $831 million, an 11% increase year-over-year resulting primarily from increased drilling related activity in the North Sea, improved well construction activity in Russia and increased completions activity in Algeria, partially offset by reduced activity in multiple product service lines in Ghana.  In Middle East/Asia, revenue was $1.2 billion, a 9% increase year-over-year, largely resulting from increased activity in the majority of product service lines in the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia and Malaysia, which was partially offset by lower project management activity in India.  In the first quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $60 million and net interest expense was $134 million. Our normalized effective tax rate for the quarter was 21%.  We generated $225 million of cash from operations during the quarter. As anticipated, working capital was seasonally a use of cash but significantly lower than the draw we experienced in the first quarter of 2019. As activity declines globally, working capital has historically been a strong source of cash and I expect a similar pattern this year. We have a heightened focus on improving working capital metrics and are working hard to prudently manage customer credit risk in light of the current market conditions.  Capital expenditures during the quarter were $213 million. As Jeff mentioned, we have reduced our full year CapEx budget to approximately $800 million. These cuts are geared towards both our North America business and uncommitted projects internationally. We believe our capital allocation decisions are consistent with our focus on generating cash flow regardless of the market environment.  Our free cash flow generation for the quarter was $12 million. A significant improvement compared to the first quarter of 2019. During the quarter, we took actions to manage our debt and maturity profile. We executed two transactions, a debt issuance and a subsequent tender, which lowered our total debt by $500 million. But more importantly, it also reduced our 2023 and 2025 maturities by $1.5 billion.  As a result of these transactions, we incurred a net cost of $168 million related to early debt extinguishment. Our total outstanding debt was $9.8 billion as of March 31st. We have no current borrowings under our revolver and no financial covenants in our borrowing facilities for our debt agreements. Now, looking forward, our second quarter results will be impacted by the severity of the continuing activity declines in North America, customer project suspensions and delays internationally, and the uncertain duration of the pandemic-related disruptions, as well as actions related to the OPEC+ production cuts. These uncertainties and the exact timing of our cost reductions impacting our division results preclude us from providing specific guidance for the second quarter. We will continue to execute the measures that Jeff outlined. In addition to the activity-related variable cost adjustments, we plan to reduce annualized overhead and other costs by about $1 billion. To achieve that, we will have an associated cash cost of approximately $200 million. These reductions will target all of our business lines and support functions globally, and we expect to complete most of these actions within the next few quarters. I will now turn the call back over to Jeff for closing comments. Jeff? And I would add, Sean, that these costs, as you asked about the split between sort of North America and international, I think these are predominantly aimed at North America, but they also include international cost-cutting as well. Yes, Bill. Thanks for the question. You're right. Historically we have generated cash from working capital during the last three downturns. I would say on the absolute amounts probably a little bit different profile than particularly the 2015 comparison that you were referencing, just given the fact that on an absolute basis our receivables and inventory are at levels that they were coming off of 2014 record level of revenue. So that's a little bit different, but I still expect the relative behavior to be the same. We should continue to see as the business shrinks over the next three quarters that we continue to generate a cash from working capital in the unwind. Yes, Angie. As we said sort of on the prepared remarks, our expectation is that we retire the $685 million that comes due next year through the free cash flow generation that we would expect to achieve this year, but roughly a $200 million coming due in February of next year and the remainder in November. And so we think that we've got ample capacity to pay debt down. And the focus philosophically for Jeff and I is to continue to reduce debt at this company and that's what we're going to continue to chase. Yes, I think it is a fair way to think about it. And I won't try to pick an exact number in terms of decrementals in this cycle. But what I will tell you is, is that we're taking out cost now to buoy those decrementals, to soften those decrementals throughout the full cycle of this downturn. I mean, that's the purpose, that's what we're aiming toward. That comes in the form of lowering our unit costs and ultimately doing everything that we can to improve our operating leverage. So, yes, I mean I think that the way that you're thinking about it, if you had an assumption around decrementals, the fit -- the overhead and other costs that we announced, the $1 billion, which is an addition to the $300 million that we've already taken out in the fourth quarter and first quarter of this year-- fourth quarter of last year, first quarter of this year --we expect those to be impactful and to soften the decrementals in this downturn."

Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to David Coleman, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nDavid Coleman: Good morning. And welcome to the Halliburton fourth quarter 2021 conference call. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on Halliburton\u2019s website for seven days. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO; and Lance Loeffler, CFO. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton\u2019s views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton\u2019s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2021, recent current reports on Form 8-K, and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings.

After our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow time for others who may be in the queue. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. 2021 finished strong for Halliburton, and I\u2019m excited about the accelerating upcycle as we enter 2022. We have an effective value proposition and benefit from increasing activity both in North America and international markets. At the same time, we see improving service pricing in both markets. Throughout this upcycle I expect Halliburton to grow profitably, accelerate free cash flow generation, strengthen our balance sheet, and increase cash returns to shareholders. But first, I want to take a minute and recognize the men and women of Halliburton for their execution on every dimension of our business: safety, service quality, and financial results. In spite of global complexity in 2021, you outperformed. So, to all of our employees, thank you. I believe 2022 will be a strong year for our industry and especially for Halliburton. While global energy demand and economic growth demonstrated resilience, global energy supply has shown its fragility. The impact of several years of underinvestment in new production is now apparent and the structural requirement to invest around the wellbore is crystal clear. We see increasing customer urgency and a pivot back to what creates value for Halliburton. Our customers demand reliable execution, dependable supply chains, effective technology, and a collaborative service provider to maximize asset value. And this is at the core of Halliburton\u2019s unique value proposition. But first, I\u2019ll highlight some of our 2021 accomplishments. We finished the year with total Company revenue of $15.3 billion, and operating income of $1.8 billion. Both of Halliburton\u2019s divisions grew revenue and margins this year. Our Completion and Production division finished the year with 15% operating margin, driven by activity improvement, despite inflationary pressures. We expect to build on this margin growth in 2022, as global activity and pricing improve. Our Drilling and Evaluation division margins remained firmly in double digits throughout 2021 and achieved full year margins of 12% for the first time since 2014. This is a good demonstration of our steady March forward, and we are not done. I\u2019m pleased with the trajectory of our international business. International revenue and operating income increased every quarter in 2021. In North America, Halliburton achieved 36% incrementals year-on-year as U.S. land activity rebounded, and we maximized the value of our business. We announced our science-based emission reduction targets, added 11 new participating companies to Halliburton labs and were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, which highlights the top 10% most sustainable companies in each industry. Finally, we generated strong free cash flow of $1.4 billion and ended the year with $3 billion of cash on hand, even after the retirement of $685 million of long-term debt in 2021. Next, let me share a few highlights from our fourth quarter performance. Total Company revenue increased 11%, and operating income grew 20% sequentially. Our Completion and Production division revenue increased 10% sequentially and operating income increased 8% with completion tool sales showing the highest third to fourth quarter improvement in the last 15 years. Equally important, our current completion tool order book has more than doubled from a year ago, signaling strong growth and profitability again in 2022. Our Drilling and Evaluation division grew revenue 11%, which outperformed the global rig count growth for the quarter and delivered over 300 basis points of sequential margin improvement. International and North America revenue grew 11% and 10% respectively due to strong year-end sales and activity increases across all regions. Building on this strong foundation of disciplined execution, today we announced two important strategic steps we are taking to further create value for our shareholders. First, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend to $0.12 per share in the first quarter of 2022. This action reflects our confidence in Halliburton\u2019s strong cash generation capacity. Second, in order to accelerate debt retirement and strengthen our balance sheet, we\u2019re redeeming $600 million of our $1 billion in debt maturing in 2025. When these notes are redeemed in February, we will have retired $1.8 billion of debt since the beginning of 2020. These steps demonstrate my confidence in our business, customers, employees, and value proposition. As I discussed with you on recent earnings calls, I expect the macro industry environment to remain supportive, and as we saw in 2021, the international and North America markets will continue their simultaneous growth. This is momentum that I have not seen in a long time. With this momentum, we plan to execute our unique strategic priorities, deliver profitable growth internationally, maximize value in North America, accelerate digital and automation deployment, improve capital efficiency and advance a sustainable energy future. Let\u2019s discuss how we plan to do this. First, internationally, our strategy is to deliver profitable growth. We allocate capital to the highest returns opportunities, which means we are selective on what we bid for and win. Our D&E margin performance in 2021 is a demonstration of this discipline. We continue to invest in technology, both digital and hardware, that maximizes asset value. In 2021, we brought to market over 50 new technologies, including our iStar intelligent formation evaluation platform and the next generation of our iCruise system for harsh drilling environments. Our multiyear investment in drilling technologies is paying off, and we expect to outgrow the market as international drilling activity ramps up. We have unique international growth opportunities in specialty chemicals and artificial lift. As Halliburton expands the international footprint of these businesses, we have a pipeline of opportunities that are longer cycle and should be margin-accretive. Halliburton\u2019s size, scale and sophisticated supply chain and HR teams reliably execute for our customers in the face of supply shortages and labor tightness. Second, in the structurally smaller North American market, our strategy is to maximize cash flow, and it dictates how we approach our North America business. Strong cash flow starts with strong margins, and Halliburton\u2019s margins are the best in class. We completed the most aggressive set of structural cost reductions in our history. We also made significant changes to our processes that drive higher contribution margin, for example, how we perform equipment maintenance and provide engineering support. These changes give us meaningful operating leverage as North American activity accelerates. We consistently replace equipment as it wears out and avoid outsized recapitalization requirements. And we have the right type of equipment. We are the leaders in the low-emissions equipment segment. We believe this gives us a structural pricing advantage as operators are willing to pay a premium for differentiated, more environmentally friendly solutions. Our second generation Zeus electric fracturing technology is working in the field today and delivers results for a growing list of customers. Importantly, in addition to emissions reduction, electric fracturing technology provides unprecedented operational control and precision. For example, Zeus makes pumping rate adjustments at least 4 times faster than a diesel pump, allowing us to respond to surface and subsurface changes more quickly than with a conventional frac spread and precisely execute the job design. We expect fully electric locations to become a larger share of the market. Halliburton has the right kit, including our Zeus electric pumping unit, the ExpressBlend blending system, the eWinch electric wireline unit and the electric tech command center to meet the market demand for lower-emitting fracturing operations. We develop differentiated technologies to focus around the wellbore. As the oil price and customer urgency increase, these technologies become more valuable to operators. For example, our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing solution helps customers optimize fracturing performance and maximize production. Several large operators will have smart fleet working on multi-pad completion programs this year. Additionally, SmartFleet delivers fully automated frac operations, which ensures more consistent fracture placement on every stage, improves cluster uniformity and manages offset frac hits. Finally, I want to highlight the importance of our well construction and production service lines. They each have unique competitive advantage and technology to maximize value in North America. Third, our strategy is to advance digitalization and automation in all aspects of our business. Our digital investments drive higher margins through customer purchases of software, smarter tools and ancillary products, and cost savings for Halliburton. Let me give you an example. Currently, 100% of Halliburton\u2019s drilling jobs run on a cloud-based, real-time system to deliver data and visualization to our customers around the world. Close to 60% of iCruise operations are fully automated, allowing for up to a 70% reduction in headcount per rig. Automation alleviates health and safety concerns by removing personnel from rigs, accelerates service delivery improvements and reduces the environmental footprint of oil and gas operations. Our fourth strategic priority is to drive capital efficiency across the balance sheet. This positions Halliburton to generate industry-leading returns and strong free cash flow as markets grow. We will optimize the working capital required to grow our business and maintain our CapEx in the range of 5% to 6% of revenue. Our business thrives in this range because of our research and development efforts and process changes. These allow us to build tools cheaper, lengthen their run life and move assets quicker to where they make the most money. Our final strategic priority is to advance a sustainable energy future. Our clean energy accelerator, Halliburton Labs, continues to add new participants. We help these early-stage companies achieve important scaling milestones and significantly increase their enterprise value. Through Halliburton Labs, we are actively participating in the clean energy space without committing shareholder capital. Halliburton will evolve as energy evolves, and we will add to our already expanding opportunities to participate as clean energy value chains mature. However, we will do so consistent with our capital allocation strategy and mindful of our commitment to deliver industry-leading returns and free cash flow generation. We will proceed with patience, discipline and resolve. Now, let\u2019s review our fourth quarter 2021 performance and expectations for 2022. As OPEC+\u2019s spare capacity returns to normalized levels this year, we believe sufficient pent-up oil demand will support a call on both international and U.S. production, and lead to increased activity. International activity accelerated in most markets in the second half of the year and finished strong in the fourth quarter with a 23% rig count increase year-on-year. All Halliburton regions grew revenue, led by Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa with both of our divisions contributing to the revenue and margin expansion. I\u2019m excited about our future international growth. Despite typical first quarter seasonality, we are starting 2022 a lot higher than where we entered 2021. I expect our customers\u2019 international spend to increase by mid-teens this year. We anticipate projects in the Middle East, Russia and Latin America to attract the most investment with activity increases in Africa and Europe limited to a few markets. Asset owners are eager to reverse base production declines caused by multiple years of underinvestment. We expect that operators will focus on shorter cycle production opportunities to meet increasing oil demand. This disproportionately benefits Halliburton as these short-cycle barrels require higher service intensity and spending directly focused on the wellbore as opposed to long-cycle infrastructure investments. In 2022, we expect to deliver steady, profitable growth across the international markets. Our tender pipeline is strong. We anticipate higher utilization for our existing equipment in busy markets like the Middle East, Russia and Latin America. We plan to allocate our capital dollars to the opportunities that generate the highest return. Given the tool tightness that exists today in some product lines and geographies, we intend to strategically reallocate assets to drive improved utilization and returns. A tightening market focuses our ongoing pricing discussions with customers. We see pricing traction on new work and contract renewals, including integrated contracts. Additionally, we have introduced pay-for-performance models, negotiated favorable terms and conditions and applied price escalation clauses. While large tenders remain competitive, we are consistent with our strategy to pursue profitable growth. Turning to North America. In 2021, the recovery in North America was faster and more pronounced than in the international markets. In the fourth quarter, U.S. land rig count increased 84% year-on-year, and drilling activity outpaced completions as operators prepared well inventory for 2022 programs. Completed stage count growth moderated slightly due to the holidays, sand supply tightness and lower efficiency levels typically experienced in the winter months. In the fourth quarter, we finished the plant upgrade of all fracturing fleets to the next generation fluid end technology that extends the life of our equipment and helps reduce maintenance cost. We expect a busy 2022 in North America. Given a strong commodity price environment, we anticipate North America customer spending to grow more than 25% year-on-year. We believe the highest increase will come from private operators. Public E&Ps will continue to prioritize returns while delivering production into a supportive market. In North America, Halliburton uniquely benefits as the largest oilfield services provider in the largest oilfield services market in the world. We anticipate solid net pricing gains in North America throughout 2022. Here\u2019s why. The North America completions market is approaching 90% utilization, and Halliburton is sold out. Pricing for our fracturing fleets is moving higher across the board, both for our market-leading low-emissions equipment and our Tier 4 diesel fleets. As a result, we expect to see over 30% incrementals in our hydraulic fracturing business in the first quarter. Anticipated demand growth for equipment provides a runway for us to increase pricing throughout the year. We expect some market-wide operational efficiencies afforded by completing a backlog of DUCs in 2021 to reverse as frac fleets return to the usual mode of following drilling rigs. This will further increase the call on equipment as operators add rigs throughout the year. Finally, during the tendering season, we secured net pricing increases across several different non-frac product service lines: drilling, cementing, fluids, drill bits and artificial lift. As activity accelerates, the market is seeing tightness related to trucking, labor, sand and other inputs. While we pass these increased costs on to operators, Halliburton has effective solutions that minimize the operational impact of this tightness and provide reliable execution for our customers. As an example, in 2021, we expanded our collaboration with Vorto and now benefit from 5F, the largest integrated transportation platform in the oil and gas industry. This platform has several-thousand drivers, hundreds of carriers and a chain of asset maintenance yards. It allows us to effectively manage trucking inflation and availability constraints and significantly reduce logistics-related nonproductive time. Our human resources team and systems effectively mitigate local labor tightness. We recruit nationally and hire, train and manage a commuter workforce that makes up to 80% of our personnel in some areas. There is no doubt the much anticipated multiyear upcycle is now underway. North America production growth remains capped by operators\u2019 capital discipline, while meaningful international production growth is challenged by years of underinvestment. Energy demand has proven its resilience, fueled by pent-up economic growth and a global desire to return to normalcy. This is a fantastic set of conditions for Halliburton. In a strong commodity price environment with limited production growth options, operators turn to short-cycle barrels and increased spend around the wellbore. Our value proposition works. We have the right strategies for both international and North American markets. We are leaders in digital and automation, and we drive capital efficiency while advancing a sustainable energy future. I fully expect that Halliburton will accelerate cash flow generation, strengthen our balance sheet and increase cash returns to shareholders in this upcycle. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our fourth quarter financial results. Lance?\nLance Loeffler: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a summary of our fourth quarter results compared to the third quarter of 2021. Total company revenue for the quarter was $4.3 billion, an increase of 11%. Operating income was $550 million, a 20% increase compared to the adjusted operating income of $458. These results were primarily driven by increased global drilling activity and end-of-year product and software sales. Now, let me discuss our division results in a little more detail. Starting with our Completion and Production division. Revenue was $2.4 billion, an increase of 10%, while operating income was $347 million or an 8% increase. These results were primarily driven by higher completion tool sales globally as well as increased pressure pumping services in North America land and the Middle East/Asia region. These improvements were partially offset by reduced stimulation activity in Latin America, Canada and the Gulf of Mexico; lower pipeline services in Europe/Africa/CIS and Asia; reduced well intervention services in Brazil; and decreased artificial lift activity in North America land. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $1.9 billion, an increase of 11%, while operating income was $269 million or a 45% increase. These results were due to increased drilling-related services globally, wireline sales in Guyana, improved project management activity in Ecuador and India, increased wireline activity in the Middle East/Asia region, and higher software sales in Latin America and Middle East/Asia. Partially offsetting these increases were decreased project management activity and testing services in Mexico as well as lower drilling-related activity in Russia. Moving on to our geographic results. In North America, revenue increased 10%. This increase was primarily driven by higher pressure pumping activity and drilling-related services in North America land in addition to higher completion tool sales and fluid services in the Gulf of Mexico. These increases were partially offset by reduced stimulation activity in Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, coupled with reduced artificial lift activity in North America land. Turning to Latin America. Revenue increased 7% sequentially. This improvement was driven by higher project management activity in Ecuador, increased drilling-related services in Mexico, increased activity across multiple product service lines in Brazil, wireline sales in Guyana, and higher activity across multiple product service lines in Colombia. These increases were partially offset by reduced project management and stimulation activity and testing services in Mexico. In Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue increased 8% sequentially. These results were partially driven by higher software and completion tool sales across the region, improved activity across multiple product service lines in Norway and Egypt, and increased well control activity in Nigeria. These improvements were partially offset by reduced activity in multiple product service lines in Russia, reduced pipeline services and well construction activity in the United Kingdom, and decreased stimulation activity in the Congo. In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue increased 16%, resulting from higher completion tool sales and wireline activity across the region, improved well construction services in Saudi Arabia and Oman, higher software sales in Kuwait and China, improved project management activity in India, and increased stimulation activity throughout Asia. These increases were partially offset by reduced pipeline services in Asia, along with lower activity across multiple product service lines in Vietnam. Now, I\u2019d like to address some additional financial items. In the fourth quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $66 million, which was slightly higher than expected due to an increase in legal reserves. For the first quarter, we expect our corporate expense to be about $60 million. Net interest expense for the quarter was $108 million, slightly lower than anticipated due to higher interest income from our cash balance. Today, we announced our decision to redeem $600 million of the 2025 senior notes using cash on hand. This action will reduce future cash interest expense and reflects our desire to continue reducing debt balances. As a result of the debt retirement in late February, our net interest expense should remain roughly flat in the first quarter. During the quarter, we recognized a noncash gain of approximately $500 million due to the partial release of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. This reversal is based on the improved market conditions and reflects our increased expectation to utilize these deferred tax assets going forward. Our normalized effective tax rate for the fourth quarter came in at approximately 23%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our 2022 first quarter effective tax rate to be approximately the same. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $316 million with our 2021 full year CapEx totaling approximately $800 million. In 2022, we intend to increase our capital expenditures to approximately $1 billion while remaining within our target of 5% to 6% of revenue. We believe that this level of spend will equip us well to execute on our strategic priorities and take advantage of the accelerating market recovery. Turning to cash flow. We generated nearly $700 million of cash from operations during the fourth quarter and delivered approximately $1.4 billion of free cash flow for the full year. As a result, we ended the year with approximately $3 billion in cash. I\u2019ve spoken before about our ability to concurrently reduce debt and increase the return of cash to shareholders, and today, we put that into action. This is a great start to a longer term goal of returning more cash to shareholders. Now, let me provide you with some comments on how we see the first quarter playing out. As is typical, our results will be subject to weather-related seasonality and the roll-off of year-end product sales, which will mostly impact our international and Gulf of Mexico businesses. However, we expect pricing recovery in North America to help offset these dynamics. As a result, in our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue and margins to be essentially flat to the fourth quarter. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect revenue to decrease in the mid-single digits sequentially, while margins are expected to be flat to down 50 basis points. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff?\nJeff Miller: Thanks, Lance. To summarize our discussion today, we see customer urgency and demand for our services increasing internationally and in North America. We expect our strong international business to continue its profitable growth as activity ramps up throughout the year. In the critical North America market, we expect our business to grow and improve margins. We prioritize our investments to the highest-return opportunities and remain committed to capital efficiency. We continue to play a role in advancing cleaner and more affordable energy solutions. In 2022, I expect Halliburton to deliver margin expansion, industry-leading returns and solid free cash flow. And now, let\u2019s open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James West, Evercore ISI.\nJames West: So, Jeff, maybe just to kick us off here, could you talk a bit about the cadence of this cycle? You mentioned several times growth and you also mentioned a key word, which is urgency from customers. And I think that\u2019s going to be something that\u2019s very important when we think about pricing, margins, et cetera. Could you talk about how you see both, North America and the international markets and the cadence of the increases in activity, growth and how you and the broader industry, but you particularly, are expecting things to unfold here as we go through \u201822 and into \u201823 and beyond?\nJeff Miller: Yes. Well, thanks, James. Look, I really like the macro setup, and I have said that before. And what we really see is the fragility, as I described it, of supply and the returning demand. And so, I think, there are factors that the underinvestment internationally means that has to be recovered over a longer period of time. And I think a lot of the return expectations of this industry in North America are still in place and such that is a bit of a cap on production growth. But nevertheless, the activity, that just means a longer upcycle in my view. And I feel really good about the cadence, meaning it continues to move up this year, next year and beyond. And the way that sets up for us is we got -- we have an opportunity to take advantage of the operating leverage that\u2019s already in our business. The pricing environment will be good throughout that period as equipment gets tighter everywhere and our technology is more valuable to customers in this kind of environment. And yes, activity, I believe, does ramp, and it\u2019s going to be the kind of short-cycle barrels that drive the most activity for us because this is urgently trying to return barrels to market under those sort of constraints, very good for us. And so, as we look out to 2023, I\u2019ll just start there, look out to 2023, I don\u2019t see 2023 as an endpoint by any means. I think the road goes on well beyond that. But I can tell you what we\u2019ve talked about for 2023 is biased higher.\nJames West: Right. Okay, okay. Makes sense to me. And that\u2019s clearly in line with our expectations. How are -- Jeff and Lance, the dividend increase -- solid dividend increase, how do you think about and how are you guys thinking about shareholder returns going forward as we kind of move into -- well, we\u2019re into, but I guess is being accelerated into this upcycle?\nJeff Miller: Yes. Look, thanks, James. I\u2019ll take that. Look, those were important actions that we took to date. And we expect to continue, continue finding opportunities to return more cash to shareholders and pay down debt. And as we pay down debt, that creates headroom in our fixed payments as we pay down debt. And think about it, we\u2019ve repaid $1.8 billion of debt since January of 2020. And we get through \u201823 and \u201825, as debt is paid. The next maturity is not until 2030. And so we fully -- I fully expect to continue growing shareholder distributions as the upcycle accelerates.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dave Anderson with Barclays.\nDave Anderson: I just want to ask about C&P margins during the quarter and then thinking about the progression for next year. Highlighted completion tool sales end, but margins kind of slipped a bit during the quarter. And then, Jeff, in your prepared remarks, you had talked about completion tool orders have doubled since last year. So, I\u2019m just trying to understand what all that means in terms of the mix. Obviously, we have the kind of the pressure pumping price in there. If you could just kind of help us understand how that margin should kind of move.\nJeff Miller: Well, look, yes, I mean, as we look at 2021, for example, 15% margins, I\u2019m pleased with those. We got a lot of important work done in our frac business in Q4, which I talked about in my comments, but getting fluid ends installed and then raising prices involves moving equipment around. And so, we probably had 10% of our fleet moving as we raised price and got moved to different customers that were happy with the new price. And so that\u2019s Q4. As we look at the order book doubling in completion tools, that\u2019s really a look ahead to 2022, and that\u2019s very positive for 2022 to see those types of longer lead items building in our order book. I think when we think about progression in 2022, I expect to see 30% incrementals in our frac business in North America in 2022 in first quarter, but what that -- mixed in with that are the completion tools that don\u2019t repeat in Q1. But the reality is we are filling a big hole largely with recurring pricing and the kind of sticky things that we plan to build on. And we still get the 2022 doubling of the order book at some point during the year of 2022 in completion tools. I hope that\u2019s some clarity.\nDave Anderson: That is. That\u2019s great, Jeff. And if I could just shift -- well, I guess, somewhat related question. I want to ask about kind of further e-frac deployment and kind of how you see that developing over the next several years. It\u2019s pretty clear that E&Ps are increasingly looking to reduce emissions. They\u2019re going to need to reduce emissions. E-frac is clearly part of that solution. But of course, it costs more with the power source. I think you\u2019re at like 5 or 6 fleets today. Maybe you could just update us where you are there. But I\u2019m just kind of wondering kind of thinking out the next 12, 18 months, is it possible you could kind of double that deployment? But I guess even more important, do you think E&Ps are willing to underwrite this with longer-term contracts?\nJeff Miller: Let me unpack that a little bit. Just from an e-fleet deployment standpoint, we view e-fleet as replacements for our current equipment. So, the pacing of that is consistent with how we think about sort of fleet management over time. And obviously, that is contingent upon getting the terms and conditions and pricing that are clearly returning above what anything else is returning, and that\u2019s what motivates us there. All of that lives inside of our CapEx outlook of 5% to 6% of revenue. So, I just want to keep all of that sort of in the right frame. We think about power, however, that is a unique piece of this puzzle. And what I expect happens with electric broadly is, yes, it grows, our share will grow of that. I think we\u2019ve got fantastic equipment in the market working today. But the power piece, we\u2019re power-agnostic. And if you recall, over time, I\u2019ve always said, the issue here was the power, who owns the power. And I think we\u2019ve partnered with a very good firm, successful firm that has modular power such that over time, as operators can optimize power sources, meaning the grid, our partner has the ability to scale that back and sort of optimize along with clients. And so, I think that\u2019s the sort of unique power component that we solve for with both the grid.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: Jeff, I wanted to start on the 400 basis-point margin increase target for 2023. As you look at that, what do you think represents the biggest risk to achieving it? And how do you feel about upside scenarios, and what factors could drive that?\nJeff Miller: Yes. Look, thanks, Neil. I\u2019m excited and encouraged about what I see, more so today than I was before, which was all the -- it\u2019s basically the simultaneous growth, North America and international and the -- effectively, the demand for equipment that we see, which now allows both activity and price to move at the same time. So I don\u2019t -- from a risk perspective, look, I think that we\u2019re in a good place to manage those risks that might be out there, whether it\u2019s a range of things. But all of those things appear to be manageable, particularly given how important producing oil clearly is to really our way of life, but also the markets see that. And so, I think that demand for activity will be there. Clearly, that\u2019s going to be biased higher at this point as we look out to 2023. And I think we\u2019re in a great position to take advantage of all of those things that happen, whether it\u2019s price and tightness, it\u2019s our technology. There\u2019s more demand for our technology in this kind of environment because it is our technology that -- drilling technology, for example, that help operators find more barrels nearby the wellbore, helps them do a lot of things that are important to them to accelerate their own production at an effective price.\nNeil Mehta: And there\u2019s been a lot of questions about where we are in terms of frac fleet utilization. I\u2019d love your perspective on that. How do you see this market as tight and if you\u2019d be willing to put a number on utilization? And how should we think about net service pricing in U.S. fracs for the back half of \u201822 and into \u201823, especially as you get some of these new built low-emission frac fleets starting to enter the market once again?\nJeff Miller: Well, we see it as close to 90% utilized as a market for equipment that\u2019s existing today. And so, it doesn\u2019t take much increase in activity to continue to tighten that, and I see that tightening more so in the back half of next year. The electric equipment as it comes into the market, a testament to our R&D organization, but we were able to bring that technology to market very quickly. It\u2019s best in class, and that\u2019s one of the reasons it\u2019s going to work. And that team along with partners solve for sort of the power dilemma. And so, I think we\u2019re in a great place to bring equipment to market. But clearly, that is new capital into the market, which requires higher returns than what we certainly have seen. And so, I think a cap on that\u2019s going to be the requirement for higher returns. I think capital is -- capital for building equipment, clearly in short supply and particularly because there\u2019s a lot of repair to come for returns in North America. So, a lot of that informs our strategy of maximizing value in North America means we approach it differently. It\u2019s not can we grow -- build the most equipment? Can we maximize the most cash flow out of that market? And we think electric fleets positioned the right way help us do that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JP Morgan.\nArun Jayaram: My first question is you guys have repositioned assets, frac fleets to improve utilization returns. And I just wanted to ask is absent pricing gains, what kind of tailwinds do you think that these types of actions could provide to margins as well as we think about adoption of SmartFleet and other Hal 4.0 offerings?\nJeff Miller: Well, we move equipment to raise margins. And I expect that we will see that kind of margin improvement into 2022. You mentioned SmartFleet. I think that\u2019s a key component of what makes Halliburton unique in the fracs business in North America, and it\u2019s one of the unique things of being -- of our large peers, we\u2019re the only one in the frac business in North America, and that allows our technology budget is meaningful. And I think over time, applied consistently R&D investment has always been what moves this industry both from a productivity standpoint and a return standpoint for us. And so SmartFleet being but an example of what that R&D at scale looks like when it\u2019s applied to North America. And so, yes, I think that does contribute to margins as does electric fleets as the many other sort of technology solutions that we\u2019re working on all of the time.\nArun Jayaram: Fair enough. And my second question is, you guys mentioned in your prepared remarks about what\u2019s going on with DUCs. DUCs have been down for 18 months in a row, and you\u2019re starting to see the mix of drilling increase over time. I know that DUCs have been a tailwind for operators and led to, call it, lower frac needs in last year and the year before. And I know it\u2019s difficult to measure, but I just wanted to know if you could maybe measure or quantify what kind of tailwind do you think this could provide the frac demand if the current fleet count\u2019s around 235 or so?\nJeff Miller: Well, you\u2019re thinking about it the right way. And I expect that it does increase demand just because there\u2019s going to be more disruption in the system, meaning fleets will have to follow rigs. That will then create demand for more fleet. Yes, if we\u2019re at 90%, clearly, we sort of run to the end of that quite quickly and expect the entire market needs to get better from a price standpoint. And I expect that we will see that as it gets -- we\u2019re seeing it now. I think that is a dynamic that will continue certainly throughout the balance of this year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America.\nChase Mulvehill: So Lance, I guess, maybe this question\u2019s for you, just thinking about the 1Q guide. I guess, I can kind of connect the dots with the C&P margins being flat because you\u2019ve got completion tool sales kind of rolling off and obviously frac getting better. But thinking about the D&E side, resilient margins as we get into 1Q, and typically, you have software sales in the fourth quarter. So, just maybe help us kind of connect the dots here between 4Q and 1Q with kind of flat to down 50 bps on the D&E side because typically, you see some seasonality in the Eastern Hemisphere and you have software sales that will be rolling off. So, do you have some -- maybe some software sales that kind of linger into first quarter? Or just kind of help us understand the resiliency of margins in the first quarter.\nLance Loeffler: We do, Chase. It\u2019s a good question. We do. So, in our software business, the way that we recognize revenue is sort of spread now between the fourth quarter and the first quarter. So, we still have some resiliency from the software sales. But I wouldn\u2019t discount what we\u2019re doing on the drilling side. You heard Jeff talk about it in his prepared remarks. We\u2019re really excited about what that means for our business. I mean, clearly, we have the weather-driven seasonality that will continue, and that\u2019s always something that exists during the real hard winter months in places like the North Sea and Russia, in particular. But I really think that we\u2019re excited about what the drilling business and the change that we\u2019re making and the impact that\u2019s coming from sort of that investment that we made in rekitting Sperry, for example, is really beginning to pay off.\nChase Mulvehill: Okay, perfect. And then, a follow-up, obviously, you said multiple times here, 90% utilization of frac. But there is some cold-stacked equipment that may or may not come off the sidelines. Obviously, it depends on pricing. I guess maybe could you give us some comments -- or your comments around cold-stacked equipment? How much pricing would have to move for people to spend $10-plus-million because you probably converted some of those from Tier 2 to Tier 4 DGB? So just how much would pricing have to move for the industry to start kind of reactivating and spending more on cold-stacked reactivations?\nJeff Miller: Look, I think prices would have to move a long way. And some of the conversion you\u2019re talking about, that\u2019s dramatic. That\u2019s open heart surgery. Getting from Tier 2 to Tier 4 is not something that happened simply. And it\u2019s really going against the direction the entire market\u2019s going, which is towards environmentally friendly equipment. So, things that come off the bench aren\u2019t going to be in that category for sure. And I think the cost of getting things off the bench for what\u2019s there is going to be a lot higher than people think, and so I think that\u2019s a barrier to that coming back. A lot of that equipment was consumed in the last cycle as spare parts and all of the rest of that. So, I think we underestimate -- excuse me, I think there\u2019s a lot less of that and its cost is much higher.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup.\nScott Gruber: I want to come back to the shareholder return question. Jeff, you commented on further actions to come down the road, which is great to hear. But just given the inherent volatility in the market, is the next move likely to be a buyback or a variable dividend? And then, we\u2019ve also seen many of your E&P customers commit to returning a certain percentage of cash flow or free cash flow. Is that something Halliburton would consider, especially in the context of a multiyear upcycle?\nLance Loeffler: Sure, Scott. This is Lance. Look, we think about it very similar to sort of the line of question you\u2019re going down. I mean, look, today, I think this is a first step in a long line of other things that we expect to do to really accelerate cash returns to shareholders. It will come in the form of both increasing the dividend over time but doing it responsibly. And with any excess free cash flow that we would like to dedicate, we may reinstitute share repurchases. So, I think it will be a balance. We\u2019ll see what it\u2019s like when it gets there, not big band of a variable dividend today. Feel like we have the right things in place, and our communications to The Street are pretty clear around how we\u2019re managing this business and prioritizing free cash flow. And we\u2019ll be really good stewards about how we send it back to shareholders.\nScott Gruber: Got it. I also want to come back to Dave\u2019s question on e-frac and ask a little bit broader question. We got the CapEx figure for the year, and you\u2019re keeping CapEx below the 6% level. But there\u2019s been this kind of outstanding question for Halliburton. As the frac market recovers, do your CapEx need to surprise and you have to go above that level? So, I guess the real question is, are you happy with the cadence of fleet renewal within the frac fleet? Are you able to kind of keep up your competitiveness with the pace of spend embedded in the budget this year? And just kind of as you think about over the medium term, do you think you can keep up your competitiveness with this -- with the cadence of renewal in the frac fleet that\u2019s built into that 6% -- sub-6% reinvestment level?\nJeff Miller: Yes. Yes, we do, is the answer. We believe we thrive in this type of environment and managing or maintaining CapEx where it is. Look, it\u2019s a 5% to 6% of revenues. In my view, this very much show me story and we expect to deliver returns. And we do things ratably. And strategically, we view North America as maximizing value in North America. That means managing the right level of spend, the right type of technology, the right pacing of equipment. Clearly, the right pricing for equipment and making the right cash flow from that equipment. And so, the target is -- we are very consistent around our strategy, and that strategy is actually quite exciting for us to pursue a strategy that delivers the most free cash flow and grows and improves margin. So, I view this as a margin cycle, not a build cycle. And like I said, our team is excited about pursuing that, delivering on that. And that\u2019s why very comfortable with sort of that balance of the right level of investment, while we invest in D&E and international businesses at the same time. I mean, all of that fits together into how do we deliver and our plan to deliver accelerating free cash flow.\nOperator: Next question comes from Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley.\nConnor Lynagh: I wanted to return to the potential shareholder returns. And Lance, I wanted to just clarify a comment that you made in regards to excess free cash flow. I mean, how should we think about what that is? Is there a level of cash balance that you want to maintain in the business? Is there a sort of standard amount of delevering you want to occur over the next few years here? Basically, how would you define that for people?\nLance Loeffler: Yes. Good question. I appreciate the follow-up. I think today, a minimum cash balance for us to run our business is around $2 billion, give or take. And so, we\u2019re always sensitive a little bit to that or mindful of it. But I would say, I\u2019ve been pretty clear about what we want to do in terms of strengthening the balance sheet. We need to be closer to 2 times debt to EBITDA. We spent a lot of time on this call, I know Jeff has, talking about the trajectory of the denominator in that equation. And we have work to do on the numerator. So, we expect to continue to find ways to attack gross debt. And I think starting with retiring the \u201823s and what\u2019s left of the \u201825s post this redemption is a good target.\nConnor Lynagh: Got it. Maybe just switching gears a little bit here. Drilling and Evaluation margins, very strong, and it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re expecting that much of a falloff. I appreciate the software accounting dynamics. But you\u2019re still year-over-year looking at something 250 to 300 basis points above where you were in 2021. I guess, two parts to this. Is that a good bogey for how we should think about the rest of the year in Drilling and Evaluation? And just as we think structurally about the return of international and the like, how should we think about the potential profitability cycle-over-cycle? It certainly is trending a lot higher right now. So, I just want to make sure we understand the moving pieces there.\nJeff Miller: Well, it\u2019s a great starting point, and we expect it to trend higher over time as we move through. So, this is the result of technology investment, an excellent drilling business, drilling technology, collaborative approach with our clients, our value proposition; and the other service lines that are in D&E, very strong service lines, drilling fluids, I won\u2019t try to name them all here, but a very strong group of businesses. And I think what you\u2019re seeing in the margin is a demonstration of the improvement in capital velocity that we saw from the new technology in Sperry; also the improved capabilities, whether it\u2019s LWD or the ability to manage the data around that with the 3D inversion. So, there\u2019s a whole series of things that we\u2019ve been working on and actually have many more things left to deliver in that business during 2022. So, our expectations are that we\u2019re starting at a higher point -- or we\u2019re starting the year lower, but we are moving to a higher point. And I think we\u2019ll see that sort of repeat. Great expectations for that business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ian Macpherson with Piper Sandler.\nIan Macpherson: Just sort of having to squint for concerning issues here as everything is set up pretty well for you here and executing well also. But just curious with escalating tensions in sabre rattling in Ukraine and given that Russia has been a pretty good growth market for the industry. Are you considering any risk with regard to sanctions impacting the trajectory of the business in Russia or Eastern Hemisphere on a knock-on basis at this point, or does this look like things that you\u2019ve seen and done before?\nJeff Miller: Look, these are things we\u2019ve seen and done before. Always unfortunate in so many ways for so many people. But from a business perspective, we\u2019ve managed these sorts of things up and down for, I hate to say, nearly 100 years. So, these are the kinds of things that we would manage through.\nIan Macpherson: Okay. Thanks, Jeff. Lance, just looking at our cash flow calculator for this year. You obviously had some good tailwinds in \u201821 with working capital release, which we know will reverse with cycle growth. And you also had probably better than sort of ratable disposal proceeds. So, when we think about 5% to 6%, you\u2019ll be probably closer to 5% and 6% of gross CapEx this year. How are you thinking about the other pieces? Because I did hear something in the prepared remarks about containing working capital expansion with growth, so maybe not a monster number of working capital expansion this year.\nLance Loeffler: Yes. Look, you\u2019re right. Really happy with the way \u201821 free cash flow performed for us. And I think that we\u2019ve talked about before how we\u2019ve meaningfully, I believe, transformed the free cash flow profile of Halliburton and all the strategic priorities that we\u2019ve sort of discussed are things that help drive us to that end. But you\u2019re right. I think stronger free cash flow starts with stronger margins. And I think what you should expect for 2022 is to see that continued strength, operating cash flow less or excluding working capital to continue to drive higher, obviously. But I think that we\u2019re running into a period of time in 2022 that the amount of growth that we expect in the business is just going to drive an investment in working capital as opposed to a release of cash. But, as I\u2019ve always said, we are looking to put that investment back much more efficiently than when we took it out. And personally, that\u2019s something that I\u2019m committed to and working really hard with the organization to find those benefits.\nOperator: And this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Jeff Miller for closing remarks.\nJeff Miller: Thank you, Shannon. Look, I\u2019ll just conclude that this upcycle is a great setup for Halliburton to achieve profitable growth and accelerated free cash flow generation. Today\u2019s dividend increase and debt retirement announcements provide just two examples of what Halliburton expects to deliver throughout this multiyear upcycle. I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Shannon, let\u2019s close out the call.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeff Miller",
            "content": "Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. 2021 finished strong for Halliburton, and I'm excited about the accelerating upcycle as we enter 2022. We have an effective value proposition and benefit from increasing activity both in North America and international markets. At the same time, we see improving service pricing in both markets. Throughout this upcycle I expect Halliburton to grow profitably, accelerate free cash flow generation, strengthen our balance sheet, and increase cash returns to shareholders. But first, I want to take a minute and recognize the men and women of Halliburton for their execution on every dimension of our business: safety, service quality, and financial results. In spite of global complexity in 2021, you outperformed. So, to all of our employees, thank you. I believe 2022 will be a strong year for our industry and especially for Halliburton. While global energy demand and economic growth demonstrated resilience, global energy supply has shown its fragility. The impact of several years of underinvestment in new production is now apparent and the structural requirement to invest around the wellbore is crystal clear. We see increasing customer urgency and a pivot back to what creates value for Halliburton. Our customers demand reliable execution, dependable supply chains, effective technology, and a collaborative service provider to maximize asset value. And this is at the core of Halliburton's unique value proposition. But first, I'll highlight some of our 2021 accomplishments. We finished the year with total Company revenue of $15.3 billion, and operating income of $1.8 billion. Both of Halliburton's divisions grew revenue and margins this year. Our Completion and Production division finished the year with 15% operating margin, driven by activity improvement, despite inflationary pressures. We expect to build on this margin growth in 2022, as global activity and pricing improve. Our Drilling and Evaluation division margins remained firmly in double digits throughout 2021 and achieved full year margins of 12% for the first time since 2014. This is a good demonstration of our steady March forward, and we are not done. I'm pleased with the trajectory of our international business. International revenue and operating income increased every quarter in 2021. In North America, Halliburton achieved 36% incrementals year-on-year as U.S. land activity rebounded, and we maximized the value of our business. We announced our science-based emission reduction targets, added 11 new participating companies to Halliburton labs and were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, which highlights the top 10% most sustainable companies in each industry. Finally, we generated strong free cash flow of $1.4 billion and ended the year with $3 billion of cash on hand, even after the retirement of $685 million of long-term debt in 2021. Next, let me share a few highlights from our fourth quarter performance. Total Company revenue increased 11%, and operating income grew 20% sequentially. Our Completion and Production division revenue increased 10% sequentially and operating income increased 8% with completion tool sales showing the highest third to fourth quarter improvement in the last 15 years. Equally important, our current completion tool order book has more than doubled from a year ago, signaling strong growth and profitability again in 2022. Our Drilling and Evaluation division grew revenue 11%, which outperformed the global rig count growth for the quarter and delivered over 300 basis points of sequential margin improvement. International and North America revenue grew 11% and 10% respectively due to strong year-end sales and activity increases across all regions. Building on this strong foundation of disciplined execution, today we announced two important strategic steps we are taking to further create value for our shareholders. First, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend to $0.12 per share in the first quarter of 2022. This action reflects our confidence in Halliburton's strong cash generation capacity. Second, in order to accelerate debt retirement and strengthen our balance sheet, we're redeeming $600 million of our $1 billion in debt maturing in 2025. When these notes are redeemed in February, we will have retired $1.8 billion of debt since the beginning of 2020. These steps demonstrate my confidence in our business, customers, employees, and value proposition. As I discussed with you on recent earnings calls, I expect the macro industry environment to remain supportive, and as we saw in 2021, the international and North America markets will continue their simultaneous growth. This is momentum that I have not seen in a long time. With this momentum, we plan to execute our unique strategic priorities, deliver profitable growth internationally, maximize value in North America, accelerate digital and automation deployment, improve capital efficiency and advance a sustainable energy future. Let's discuss how we plan to do this. First, internationally, our strategy is to deliver profitable growth. We allocate capital to the highest returns opportunities, which means we are selective on what we bid for and win. Our D&E margin performance in 2021 is a demonstration of this discipline. We continue to invest in technology, both digital and hardware, that maximizes asset value. In 2021, we brought to market over 50 new technologies, including our iStar intelligent formation evaluation platform and the next generation of our iCruise system for harsh drilling environments. Our multiyear investment in drilling technologies is paying off, and we expect to outgrow the market as international drilling activity ramps up. We have unique international growth opportunities in specialty chemicals and artificial lift. As Halliburton expands the international footprint of these businesses, we have a pipeline of opportunities that are longer cycle and should be margin-accretive. Halliburton's size, scale and sophisticated supply chain and HR teams reliably execute for our customers in the face of supply shortages and labor tightness. Second, in the structurally smaller North American market, our strategy is to maximize cash flow, and it dictates how we approach our North America business. Strong cash flow starts with strong margins, and Halliburton's margins are the best in class. We completed the most aggressive set of structural cost reductions in our history. We also made significant changes to our processes that drive higher contribution margin, for example, how we perform equipment maintenance and provide engineering support. These changes give us meaningful operating leverage as North American activity accelerates. We consistently replace equipment as it wears out and avoid outsized recapitalization requirements. And we have the right type of equipment. We are the leaders in the low-emissions equipment segment. We believe this gives us a structural pricing advantage as operators are willing to pay a premium for differentiated, more environmentally friendly solutions. Our second generation Zeus electric fracturing technology is working in the field today and delivers results for a growing list of customers. Importantly, in addition to emissions reduction, electric fracturing technology provides unprecedented operational control and precision. For example, Zeus makes pumping rate adjustments at least 4 times faster than a diesel pump, allowing us to respond to surface and subsurface changes more quickly than with a conventional frac spread and precisely execute the job design. We expect fully electric locations to become a larger share of the market. Halliburton has the right kit, including our Zeus electric pumping unit, the ExpressBlend blending system, the eWinch electric wireline unit and the electric tech command center to meet the market demand for lower-emitting fracturing operations. We develop differentiated technologies to focus around the wellbore. As the oil price and customer urgency increase, these technologies become more valuable to operators. For example, our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing solution helps customers optimize fracturing performance and maximize production. Several large operators will have smart fleet working on multi-pad completion programs this year. Additionally, SmartFleet delivers fully automated frac operations, which ensures more consistent fracture placement on every stage, improves cluster uniformity and manages offset frac hits. Finally, I want to highlight the importance of our well construction and production service lines. They each have unique competitive advantage and technology to maximize value in North America. Third, our strategy is to advance digitalization and automation in all aspects of our business. Our digital investments drive higher margins through customer purchases of software, smarter tools and ancillary products, and cost savings for Halliburton. Let me give you an example. Currently, 100% of Halliburton's drilling jobs run on a cloud-based, real-time system to deliver data and visualization to our customers around the world. Close to 60% of iCruise operations are fully automated, allowing for up to a 70% reduction in headcount per rig. Automation alleviates health and safety concerns by removing personnel from rigs, accelerates service delivery improvements and reduces the environmental footprint of oil and gas operations. Our fourth strategic priority is to drive capital efficiency across the balance sheet. This positions Halliburton to generate industry-leading returns and strong free cash flow as markets grow. We will optimize the working capital required to grow our business and maintain our CapEx in the range of 5% to 6% of revenue. Our business thrives in this range because of our research and development efforts and process changes. These allow us to build tools cheaper, lengthen their run life and move assets quicker to where they make the most money. Our final strategic priority is to advance a sustainable energy future. Our clean energy accelerator, Halliburton Labs, continues to add new participants. We help these early-stage companies achieve important scaling milestones and significantly increase their enterprise value. Through Halliburton Labs, we are actively participating in the clean energy space without committing shareholder capital. Halliburton will evolve as energy evolves, and we will add to our already expanding opportunities to participate as clean energy value chains mature. However, we will do so consistent with our capital allocation strategy and mindful of our commitment to deliver industry-leading returns and free cash flow generation. We will proceed with patience, discipline and resolve. Now, let's review our fourth quarter 2021 performance and expectations for 2022. As OPEC+'s spare capacity returns to normalized levels this year, we believe sufficient pent-up oil demand will support a call on both international and U.S. production, and lead to increased activity. International activity accelerated in most markets in the second half of the year and finished strong in the fourth quarter with a 23% rig count increase year-on-year. All Halliburton regions grew revenue, led by Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa with both of our divisions contributing to the revenue and margin expansion. I'm excited about our future international growth. Despite typical first quarter seasonality, we are starting 2022 a lot higher than where we entered 2021. I expect our customers' international spend to increase by mid-teens this year. We anticipate projects in the Middle East, Russia and Latin America to attract the most investment with activity increases in Africa and Europe limited to a few markets. Asset owners are eager to reverse base production declines caused by multiple years of underinvestment. We expect that operators will focus on shorter cycle production opportunities to meet increasing oil demand. This disproportionately benefits Halliburton as these short-cycle barrels require higher service intensity and spending directly focused on the wellbore as opposed to long-cycle infrastructure investments. In 2022, we expect to deliver steady, profitable growth across the international markets. Our tender pipeline is strong. We anticipate higher utilization for our existing equipment in busy markets like the Middle East, Russia and Latin America. We plan to allocate our capital dollars to the opportunities that generate the highest return. Given the tool tightness that exists today in some product lines and geographies, we intend to strategically reallocate assets to drive improved utilization and returns. A tightening market focuses our ongoing pricing discussions with customers. We see pricing traction on new work and contract renewals, including integrated contracts. Additionally, we have introduced pay-for-performance models, negotiated favorable terms and conditions and applied price escalation clauses. While large tenders remain competitive, we are consistent with our strategy to pursue profitable growth. Turning to North America. In 2021, the recovery in North America was faster and more pronounced than in the international markets. In the fourth quarter, U.S. land rig count increased 84% year-on-year, and drilling activity outpaced completions as operators prepared well inventory for 2022 programs. Completed stage count growth moderated slightly due to the holidays, sand supply tightness and lower efficiency levels typically experienced in the winter months. In the fourth quarter, we finished the plant upgrade of all fracturing fleets to the next generation fluid end technology that extends the life of our equipment and helps reduce maintenance cost. We expect a busy 2022 in North America. Given a strong commodity price environment, we anticipate North America customer spending to grow more than 25% year-on-year. We believe the highest increase will come from private operators. Public E&Ps will continue to prioritize returns while delivering production into a supportive market. In North America, Halliburton uniquely benefits as the largest oilfield services provider in the largest oilfield services market in the world. We anticipate solid net pricing gains in North America throughout 2022. Here's why. The North America completions market is approaching 90% utilization, and Halliburton is sold out. Pricing for our fracturing fleets is moving higher across the board, both for our market-leading low-emissions equipment and our Tier 4 diesel fleets. As a result, we expect to see over 30% incrementals in our hydraulic fracturing business in the first quarter. Anticipated demand growth for equipment provides a runway for us to increase pricing throughout the year. We expect some market-wide operational efficiencies afforded by completing a backlog of DUCs in 2021 to reverse as frac fleets return to the usual mode of following drilling rigs. This will further increase the call on equipment as operators add rigs throughout the year. Finally, during the tendering season, we secured net pricing increases across several different non-frac product service lines: drilling, cementing, fluids, drill bits and artificial lift. As activity accelerates, the market is seeing tightness related to trucking, labor, sand and other inputs. While we pass these increased costs on to operators, Halliburton has effective solutions that minimize the operational impact of this tightness and provide reliable execution for our customers. As an example, in 2021, we expanded our collaboration with Vorto and now benefit from 5F, the largest integrated transportation platform in the oil and gas industry. This platform has several-thousand drivers, hundreds of carriers and a chain of asset maintenance yards. It allows us to effectively manage trucking inflation and availability constraints and significantly reduce logistics-related nonproductive time. Our human resources team and systems effectively mitigate local labor tightness. We recruit nationally and hire, train and manage a commuter workforce that makes up to 80% of our personnel in some areas. There is no doubt the much anticipated multiyear upcycle is now underway. North America production growth remains capped by operators' capital discipline, while meaningful international production growth is challenged by years of underinvestment. Energy demand has proven its resilience, fueled by pent-up economic growth and a global desire to return to normalcy. This is a fantastic set of conditions for Halliburton. In a strong commodity price environment with limited production growth options, operators turn to short-cycle barrels and increased spend around the wellbore. Our value proposition works. We have the right strategies for both international and North American markets. We are leaders in digital and automation, and we drive capital efficiency while advancing a sustainable energy future. I fully expect that Halliburton will accelerate cash flow generation, strengthen our balance sheet and increase cash returns to shareholders in this upcycle. Now, I'll turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our fourth quarter financial results. Lance? Thanks, Lance. To summarize our discussion today, we see customer urgency and demand for our services increasing internationally and in North America. We expect our strong international business to continue its profitable growth as activity ramps up throughout the year. In the critical North America market, we expect our business to grow and improve margins. We prioritize our investments to the highest-return opportunities and remain committed to capital efficiency. We continue to play a role in advancing cleaner and more affordable energy solutions. In 2022, I expect Halliburton to deliver margin expansion, industry-leading returns and solid free cash flow. And now, let's open it up for questions. Yes. Well, thanks, James. Look, I really like the macro setup, and I have said that before. And what we really see is the fragility, as I described it, of supply and the returning demand. And so, I think, there are factors that the underinvestment internationally means that has to be recovered over a longer period of time. And I think a lot of the return expectations of this industry in North America are still in place and such that is a bit of a cap on production growth. But nevertheless, the activity, that just means a longer upcycle in my view. And I feel really good about the cadence, meaning it continues to move up this year, next year and beyond. And the way that sets up for us is we got -- we have an opportunity to take advantage of the operating leverage that's already in our business. The pricing environment will be good throughout that period as equipment gets tighter everywhere and our technology is more valuable to customers in this kind of environment. And yes, activity, I believe, does ramp, and it's going to be the kind of short-cycle barrels that drive the most activity for us because this is urgently trying to return barrels to market under those sort of constraints, very good for us. And so, as we look out to 2023, I'll just start there, look out to 2023, I don't see 2023 as an endpoint by any means. I think the road goes on well beyond that. But I can tell you what we've talked about for 2023 is biased higher. Yes. Look, thanks, James. I'll take that. Look, those were important actions that we took to date. And we expect to continue, continue finding opportunities to return more cash to shareholders and pay down debt. And as we pay down debt, that creates headroom in our fixed payments as we pay down debt. And think about it, we've repaid $1.8 billion of debt since January of 2020. And we get through \u201823 and \u201825, as debt is paid. The next maturity is not until 2030. And so we fully -- I fully expect to continue growing shareholder distributions as the upcycle accelerates. Well, look, yes, I mean, as we look at 2021, for example, 15% margins, I'm pleased with those. We got a lot of important work done in our frac business in Q4, which I talked about in my comments, but getting fluid ends installed and then raising prices involves moving equipment around. And so, we probably had 10% of our fleet moving as we raised price and got moved to different customers that were happy with the new price. And so that's Q4. As we look at the order book doubling in completion tools, that's really a look ahead to 2022, and that's very positive for 2022 to see those types of longer lead items building in our order book. I think when we think about progression in 2022, I expect to see 30% incrementals in our frac business in North America in 2022 in first quarter, but what that -- mixed in with that are the completion tools that don't repeat in Q1. But the reality is we are filling a big hole largely with recurring pricing and the kind of sticky things that we plan to build on. And we still get the 2022 doubling of the order book at some point during the year of 2022 in completion tools. I hope that's some clarity. Let me unpack that a little bit. Just from an e-fleet deployment standpoint, we view e-fleet as replacements for our current equipment. So, the pacing of that is consistent with how we think about sort of fleet management over time. And obviously, that is contingent upon getting the terms and conditions and pricing that are clearly returning above what anything else is returning, and that's what motivates us there. All of that lives inside of our CapEx outlook of 5% to 6% of revenue. So, I just want to keep all of that sort of in the right frame. We think about power, however, that is a unique piece of this puzzle. And what I expect happens with electric broadly is, yes, it grows, our share will grow of that. I think we've got fantastic equipment in the market working today. But the power piece, we're power-agnostic. And if you recall, over time, I've always said, the issue here was the power, who owns the power. And I think we've partnered with a very good firm, successful firm that has modular power such that over time, as operators can optimize power sources, meaning the grid, our partner has the ability to scale that back and sort of optimize along with clients. And so, I think that's the sort of unique power component that we solve for with both the grid. Yes. Look, thanks, Neil. I'm excited and encouraged about what I see, more so today than I was before, which was all the -- it's basically the simultaneous growth, North America and international and the -- effectively, the demand for equipment that we see, which now allows both activity and price to move at the same time. So I don't -- from a risk perspective, look, I think that we're in a good place to manage those risks that might be out there, whether it's a range of things. But all of those things appear to be manageable, particularly given how important producing oil clearly is to really our way of life, but also the markets see that. And so, I think that demand for activity will be there. Clearly, that's going to be biased higher at this point as we look out to 2023. And I think we're in a great position to take advantage of all of those things that happen, whether it's price and tightness, it's our technology. There's more demand for our technology in this kind of environment because it is our technology that -- drilling technology, for example, that help operators find more barrels nearby the wellbore, helps them do a lot of things that are important to them to accelerate their own production at an effective price. Well, we see it as close to 90% utilized as a market for equipment that's existing today. And so, it doesn't take much increase in activity to continue to tighten that, and I see that tightening more so in the back half of next year. The electric equipment as it comes into the market, a testament to our R&D organization, but we were able to bring that technology to market very quickly. It's best in class, and that's one of the reasons it's going to work. And that team along with partners solve for sort of the power dilemma. And so, I think we're in a great place to bring equipment to market. But clearly, that is new capital into the market, which requires higher returns than what we certainly have seen. And so, I think a cap on that's going to be the requirement for higher returns. I think capital is -- capital for building equipment, clearly in short supply and particularly because there's a lot of repair to come for returns in North America. So, a lot of that informs our strategy of maximizing value in North America means we approach it differently. It's not can we grow -- build the most equipment? Can we maximize the most cash flow out of that market? And we think electric fleets positioned the right way help us do that. Well, we move equipment to raise margins. And I expect that we will see that kind of margin improvement into 2022. You mentioned SmartFleet. I think that's a key component of what makes Halliburton unique in the fracs business in North America, and it's one of the unique things of being -- of our large peers, we're the only one in the frac business in North America, and that allows our technology budget is meaningful. And I think over time, applied consistently R&D investment has always been what moves this industry both from a productivity standpoint and a return standpoint for us. And so SmartFleet being but an example of what that R&D at scale looks like when it's applied to North America. And so, yes, I think that does contribute to margins as does electric fleets as the many other sort of technology solutions that we're working on all of the time. Well, you're thinking about it the right way. And I expect that it does increase demand just because there's going to be more disruption in the system, meaning fleets will have to follow rigs. That will then create demand for more fleet. Yes, if we're at 90%, clearly, we sort of run to the end of that quite quickly and expect the entire market needs to get better from a price standpoint. And I expect that we will see that as it gets -- we're seeing it now. I think that is a dynamic that will continue certainly throughout the balance of this year. Look, I think prices would have to move a long way. And some of the conversion you're talking about, that's dramatic. That's open heart surgery. Getting from Tier 2 to Tier 4 is not something that happened simply. And it's really going against the direction the entire market's going, which is towards environmentally friendly equipment. So, things that come off the bench aren't going to be in that category for sure. And I think the cost of getting things off the bench for what's there is going to be a lot higher than people think, and so I think that's a barrier to that coming back. A lot of that equipment was consumed in the last cycle as spare parts and all of the rest of that. So, I think we underestimate -- excuse me, I think there's a lot less of that and its cost is much higher. Yes. Yes, we do, is the answer. We believe we thrive in this type of environment and managing or maintaining CapEx where it is. Look, it's a 5% to 6% of revenues. In my view, this very much show me story and we expect to deliver returns. And we do things ratably. And strategically, we view North America as maximizing value in North America. That means managing the right level of spend, the right type of technology, the right pacing of equipment. Clearly, the right pricing for equipment and making the right cash flow from that equipment. And so, the target is -- we are very consistent around our strategy, and that strategy is actually quite exciting for us to pursue a strategy that delivers the most free cash flow and grows and improves margin. So, I view this as a margin cycle, not a build cycle. And like I said, our team is excited about pursuing that, delivering on that. And that's why very comfortable with sort of that balance of the right level of investment, while we invest in D&E and international businesses at the same time. I mean, all of that fits together into how do we deliver and our plan to deliver accelerating free cash flow. Well, it's a great starting point, and we expect it to trend higher over time as we move through. So, this is the result of technology investment, an excellent drilling business, drilling technology, collaborative approach with our clients, our value proposition; and the other service lines that are in D&E, very strong service lines, drilling fluids, I won't try to name them all here, but a very strong group of businesses. And I think what you're seeing in the margin is a demonstration of the improvement in capital velocity that we saw from the new technology in Sperry; also the improved capabilities, whether it's LWD or the ability to manage the data around that with the 3D inversion. So, there's a whole series of things that we've been working on and actually have many more things left to deliver in that business during 2022. So, our expectations are that we're starting at a higher point -- or we're starting the year lower, but we are moving to a higher point. And I think we'll see that sort of repeat. Great expectations for that business. Look, these are things we've seen and done before. Always unfortunate in so many ways for so many people. But from a business perspective, we've managed these sorts of things up and down for, I hate to say, nearly 100 years. So, these are the kinds of things that we would manage through. Thank you, Shannon. Look, I'll just conclude that this upcycle is a great setup for Halliburton to achieve profitable growth and accelerated free cash flow generation. Today's dividend increase and debt retirement announcements provide just two examples of what Halliburton expects to deliver throughout this multiyear upcycle. I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Shannon, let's close out the call."

            "name": "Lance Loeffler",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a summary of our fourth quarter results compared to the third quarter of 2021. Total company revenue for the quarter was $4.3 billion, an increase of 11%. Operating income was $550 million, a 20% increase compared to the adjusted operating income of $458. These results were primarily driven by increased global drilling activity and end-of-year product and software sales. Now, let me discuss our division results in a little more detail. Starting with our Completion and Production division. Revenue was $2.4 billion, an increase of 10%, while operating income was $347 million or an 8% increase. These results were primarily driven by higher completion tool sales globally as well as increased pressure pumping services in North America land and the Middle East/Asia region. These improvements were partially offset by reduced stimulation activity in Latin America, Canada and the Gulf of Mexico; lower pipeline services in Europe/Africa/CIS and Asia; reduced well intervention services in Brazil; and decreased artificial lift activity in North America land. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $1.9 billion, an increase of 11%, while operating income was $269 million or a 45% increase. These results were due to increased drilling-related services globally, wireline sales in Guyana, improved project management activity in Ecuador and India, increased wireline activity in the Middle East/Asia region, and higher software sales in Latin America and Middle East/Asia. Partially offsetting these increases were decreased project management activity and testing services in Mexico as well as lower drilling-related activity in Russia. Moving on to our geographic results. In North America, revenue increased 10%. This increase was primarily driven by higher pressure pumping activity and drilling-related services in North America land in addition to higher completion tool sales and fluid services in the Gulf of Mexico. These increases were partially offset by reduced stimulation activity in Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, coupled with reduced artificial lift activity in North America land. Turning to Latin America. Revenue increased 7% sequentially. This improvement was driven by higher project management activity in Ecuador, increased drilling-related services in Mexico, increased activity across multiple product service lines in Brazil, wireline sales in Guyana, and higher activity across multiple product service lines in Colombia. These increases were partially offset by reduced project management and stimulation activity and testing services in Mexico. In Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue increased 8% sequentially. These results were partially driven by higher software and completion tool sales across the region, improved activity across multiple product service lines in Norway and Egypt, and increased well control activity in Nigeria. These improvements were partially offset by reduced activity in multiple product service lines in Russia, reduced pipeline services and well construction activity in the United Kingdom, and decreased stimulation activity in the Congo. In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue increased 16%, resulting from higher completion tool sales and wireline activity across the region, improved well construction services in Saudi Arabia and Oman, higher software sales in Kuwait and China, improved project management activity in India, and increased stimulation activity throughout Asia. These increases were partially offset by reduced pipeline services in Asia, along with lower activity across multiple product service lines in Vietnam. Now, I'd like to address some additional financial items. In the fourth quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $66 million, which was slightly higher than expected due to an increase in legal reserves. For the first quarter, we expect our corporate expense to be about $60 million. Net interest expense for the quarter was $108 million, slightly lower than anticipated due to higher interest income from our cash balance. Today, we announced our decision to redeem $600 million of the 2025 senior notes using cash on hand. This action will reduce future cash interest expense and reflects our desire to continue reducing debt balances. As a result of the debt retirement in late February, our net interest expense should remain roughly flat in the first quarter. During the quarter, we recognized a noncash gain of approximately $500 million due to the partial release of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. This reversal is based on the improved market conditions and reflects our increased expectation to utilize these deferred tax assets going forward. Our normalized effective tax rate for the fourth quarter came in at approximately 23%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our 2022 first quarter effective tax rate to be approximately the same. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $316 million with our 2021 full year CapEx totaling approximately $800 million. In 2022, we intend to increase our capital expenditures to approximately $1 billion while remaining within our target of 5% to 6% of revenue. We believe that this level of spend will equip us well to execute on our strategic priorities and take advantage of the accelerating market recovery. Turning to cash flow. We generated nearly $700 million of cash from operations during the fourth quarter and delivered approximately $1.4 billion of free cash flow for the full year. As a result, we ended the year with approximately $3 billion in cash. I've spoken before about our ability to concurrently reduce debt and increase the return of cash to shareholders, and today, we put that into action. This is a great start to a longer term goal of returning more cash to shareholders. Now, let me provide you with some comments on how we see the first quarter playing out. As is typical, our results will be subject to weather-related seasonality and the roll-off of year-end product sales, which will mostly impact our international and Gulf of Mexico businesses. However, we expect pricing recovery in North America to help offset these dynamics. As a result, in our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue and margins to be essentially flat to the fourth quarter. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect revenue to decrease in the mid-single digits sequentially, while margins are expected to be flat to down 50 basis points. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff? We do, Chase. It's a good question. We do. So, in our software business, the way that we recognize revenue is sort of spread now between the fourth quarter and the first quarter. So, we still have some resiliency from the software sales. But I wouldn't discount what we're doing on the drilling side. You heard Jeff talk about it in his prepared remarks. We're really excited about what that means for our business. I mean, clearly, we have the weather-driven seasonality that will continue, and that's always something that exists during the real hard winter months in places like the North Sea and Russia, in particular. But I really think that we're excited about what the drilling business and the change that we're making and the impact that's coming from sort of that investment that we made in rekitting Sperry, for example, is really beginning to pay off. Sure, Scott. This is Lance. Look, we think about it very similar to sort of the line of question you're going down. I mean, look, today, I think this is a first step in a long line of other things that we expect to do to really accelerate cash returns to shareholders. It will come in the form of both increasing the dividend over time but doing it responsibly. And with any excess free cash flow that we would like to dedicate, we may reinstitute share repurchases. So, I think it will be a balance. We'll see what it's like when it gets there, not big band of a variable dividend today. Feel like we have the right things in place, and our communications to The Street are pretty clear around how we're managing this business and prioritizing free cash flow. And we'll be really good stewards about how we send it back to shareholders. Yes. Good question. I appreciate the follow-up. I think today, a minimum cash balance for us to run our business is around $2 billion, give or take. And so, we're always sensitive a little bit to that or mindful of it. But I would say, I've been pretty clear about what we want to do in terms of strengthening the balance sheet. We need to be closer to 2 times debt to EBITDA. We spent a lot of time on this call, I know Jeff has, talking about the trajectory of the denominator in that equation. And we have work to do on the numerator. So, we expect to continue to find ways to attack gross debt. And I think starting with retiring the \u201823s and what's left of the \u201825s post this redemption is a good target. Yes. Look, you're right. Really happy with the way \u201821 free cash flow performed for us. And I think that we've talked about before how we've meaningfully, I believe, transformed the free cash flow profile of Halliburton and all the strategic priorities that we've sort of discussed are things that help drive us to that end. But you're right. I think stronger free cash flow starts with stronger margins. And I think what you should expect for 2022 is to see that continued strength, operating cash flow less or excluding working capital to continue to drive higher, obviously. But I think that we're running into a period of time in 2022 that the amount of growth that we expect in the business is just going to drive an investment in working capital as opposed to a release of cash. But, as I've always said, we are looking to put that investment back much more efficiently than when we took it out. And personally, that's something that I'm committed to and working really hard with the organization to find those benefits."

Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Miller : Thank you David and good morning everyone. Last quarter, we discussed a longer view of a recovering market and our confidence in a multiyear up-cycle. I am pleased with the steady march of activity and Halliburton 's performance in the third quarter internationally and in North America, all reinforce our enthusiasm today, and for what we expect in 2022 and beyond.  Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of both our strategy and our execution as the market recovery accelerates. Here are some highlights. Total Company revenue increased 4% sequentially with top-line improvements across all regions. While adjusted operating income grew 6% with solid margin performance in both divisions. Our Completion and Production division revenue grew 4%, driven by increased global activity. Operating margin was essentially flat in the third quarter, as we made operational choices to prepare for higher demand for our services in 2022. Our Drilling and Evaluation division revenue grew 4% with increased activity across multiple regions.  Operating margin of 11% was about flat sequentially. North America revenue increased 3% as growth in U.S. land was partially offset by a decline in our Gulf of Mexico business due to Hurricane Ida. International revenue grew 5% sequentially in line with the international rig count growth. Our year-to-date free cash flow generation of almost $900 million puts us solidly on track to deliver our full-year free cash flow objective.  Finally, we retired $500 million of our long-term debt and ended the quarter with 2.6 billion of cash on hand. As this upcycle unfolds in both the International and North America markets, Halliburton is executing on our strategy to deliver profitable growth and generate industry-leading returns.  In the international markets, third quarter activity momentum continued, and I believe it will accelerate into year end and support mid-teen second half revenue growth compared to the second half of last year. This expected outcome is better than we anticipated a quarter ago. In the third quarter, we started long-term projects across all regions in spite of the COVID-19 interruptions.  While mobility restrictions and daily precautions remain in place, business activity around the world has adjusted and continues to improve. In the Middle East, countries relaxed border restrictions and Opec (ph) members prepared for activity increases. We started to work on several rigs offshore UAE, mobilized a work-over project in Bahrain, and completed multiple ESP installations on our Artificial Lift contract in Kuwait. We expect the Middle East to exit the year with solid activity momentum. In Asia-Pacific, we launched operations on an integrated project offshore Malaysia with full implementation of Halliburton's Digital Well construction capabilities. We also ramped up for an increase in our Indonesia drilling operations where the local NOC plans to boost production from its assets. In Europe, Africa, CIS region.  The start of operations on a 23 well offshore integrated development campaign for Woodside in Senegal marked a new country entry for Halliburton. In Russia, we're mobilizing for a multiyear IOC operated project on Sakhalin Island. In the UK sector of the North Sea, work continues on several new development drilling, and workover projects for local independent operators. Finally, Latin America delivered its best quarterly performance since 2015.  We spotted the first well on a three-year integrated project in Brazil, deployed our new drilling technologies on multiple wells in Argentina and prepared to mobilize for new work in Ecuador and Columbia. In addition to contract startups, our pipeline of new tenders continues to grow.  While large Middle East tenders and Latin America projects received most of the headlines, customers in Africa, Russia and Southeast Asia, among others, are also issuing tenders for new work. All of this points to increasing international customer urgency and demand for our services. Let me describe what I'm seeing that gives me this conviction. Global supply and demand balance continues to tighten, resulting in a strong commodity price environment. In response, asset owners are eager to reverse baseline production declines caused by multiple years of under investment.  We expect that NOCs and other operators with short cycle production opportunities will commit additional capital and gain share to meet future oil demand. Additionally, new fields are smaller and more complex. More customers work harder to produce more barrels. Finally, as mature assets change hands, new owners move quickly to revitalize the assets they acquire and unlock remaining reserves.  They require service partners who can deliver proven technology and decades of experience. All of these things have one thing in common. They require higher service intensity, more dollars spent on the wellbore rather than on infrastructure. As the international recovery accelerates, we remain committed to a clear strategic priority. deliver profitable growth, and we have unique competitive advantages to deliver on this priority.  We have the established footprint, geographic presence, and customer and supplier relationships to capitalize on growth. We have a strong presence in all major international markets. The substantial majority of our workforce is local and within the regions where we operate, our supply chain spend is primarily with local suppliers. We have proven capabilities to ramp up our services as customers enter new markets. We demonstrated this in Guyana, Suriname, and most recently, in Senegal.  The Halliburton team mobilized personnel and built a multi-functional operational base to support Woodside as we embark together on a development campaign offshore Senegal. We also engineer innovative solutions, both digital and hardware to meet the complex reservoir challenges faced by our international customers.  For example, in well construction, this quarter we introduced the iStar comprehensive measurement platform. This next-generation intelligent platform provides multiple logging and drilling measurements that enabled reservoir evaluation, faster drilling, and consistent well delivery. For multiple customers in the Middle East and North Sea, the iStar platform provides insight into the impact of drilling parameters on well work conditions, and optimizes the drilling process in real-time. In completions, we're the global leader in downhole completion solutions. As our customers increase their activity, our e-completions ecosystem integrates manufacturing digital twins and technology development processes to increase our speed to market for these long lead complex systems.  In many regions, as customers drive for better performance in the face of increasing operational challenges, I expect adoption of integrated and bundled contracts will continue to grow. Halliburton has strong project management capabilities, and they've proven track record that deliver efficiencies and reduce total customer cost of ownership. Our digital innovations reframe customer project economics through greater efficiencies and improved decision-making.  For example, in the third quarter, we deployed our well construction 4.0 digital solution to deliver further operational efficiencies for our customer in the Middle East. Finally, our customers call on us for collaboration from an IOC, looking to reduce emissions on its operations in Mexico, to a European independent working to remotely monitor and control all of its global drilling operations.  Halliburton 's value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers is working for both our customers and Halliburton. Now, turning to North America, the bifurcation between public and private Company activity continued in the third quarter.  Public E&Ps remain committed to their spending plans for 2021 while private operators continue to take advantage of a strong commodity price environment. As expected, completions growth moderated in the third quarter as operator's shifted their focus from completions to drilling activity. Just like in the international markets, customer urgency and demand for our services keep growing in North America.  Drilled but uncompleted well counts reached the lowest levels since 2013 as operators depleted the surplus of ducks accumulated in 2020, we expect customers to drill and complete more new wells to offset steep base decline rates and deliver production into an anticipated attractive market next year, Completions equipment availability is tightening.  Customers have responded by starting the 2022 tender process earlier in an attempt to lock in access to quality services for next year's programs. Private companies now operate about 60% of the U.S. land rig count. And current commodity prices provide a strong incentive for their activity to expand. Our market-leading position in North America is rooted in the groundbreaking technologies we put to work in this market.  We are the only fully integrated service provider in North America, and this gives us a unique competitive advantage. We combine the full breadth of our technology disciplines, geo -sciences, physics, chemistry, material science, and mechanical, electrical and software engineering to deliver innovative solutions at scale around the world, and uniquely in North America, to maximize production and minimize costs, Our smart fleet intelligent fracturing services transitioned from pilot to campaign mode. Several large operators today have smart fleet working on multi-pad completion programs.  Smart fleet for the first time allows operators to measure treatment placement in real time, which among other things, has demonstrated up to 30% improvement in cluster uniformity. In the third quarter, we introduced the IsoBond Cement System and pumped it for multiple customers in the DJ Basin and in the Marcellus shale. By removing liquid additives, this dry-blended cement provides significant operational efficiencies and lower capital requirements for land operations. Taking advantage of the increasing demand for our services require strategic execution on many fronts, particularly in the current environment of stressed supply chains, tight labor, and inflationary pressures. Against that reality, I believe that Halliburton is best prepared to provide reliable execution for our customers. Our sophisticated supply chain organization translates Halliburton size and scale into real savings for us and our customers.  We are seeing that in action as our supply chain delivers what our customers require for their projects. The labor market is tight today. We've seen the situation before, and our human resources team knows how to navigate it. Over the last few years, we compressed our onboarding time, strengthened our national recruiting network, and used digital solutions to significantly reduce our field personnel requirements. Despite real challenges, we have the scale, speed, and systems to recruit talent nationally and quickly deploy it for our customers. In logistics, we have ready access to a fleet of drivers to make deliveries to the job site. We expanded our collaboration with Vorto, an artificial intelligence supply chain platform. Our early adoption of Vorto's platform that connects drivers, asset owners, and maintenance yards allows us to effectively manage trucking inflation, and availability constraints.  Now let me spend a few minutes on our activity and pricing outlook for 2022, first in the international markets and then in North America. Next year, we expect international activity momentum to accelerate, and international leading edge pricing to move upward in pockets as a result of higher activity. This is what we're seeing today.  Large tenders remain competitive, but we're already seeing modest price increases on discrete work in underserved markets. We see increasing customer demand for Halliburton's high-end technology and the recognition of its value. Finally, as a result of lower spending by service companies for more than half a decade, international market face tightening equipment supply.  To meet these demands, we are strategically reallocating assets to drive, improve utilization and returns. Let me be clear. Halliburton prioritizes profitable growth internationally and this will drive our capital allocation decisions to the best returning product lines, geographies, and contracts.  In North America, we expect customer spending to increase in and around 20% next year, including solid net pricing gains. Many factors drive that spending and pricing, including customer urgency, equipment tightness, handed desire to align with a reliable and differentiated service provider like Halliburton. Last quarter, we highlighted the pricing traction that exists for low emission equipment.  Today, as we tender for 2022 work, we're seeing price increases for the rest of our fracturing fleet as well. Net pricing has also increased across different non - frac product service lines, drilling, cementing, drill bits, and artificial lift. To generate the highest returns as this market grows, we are taking steps to maximize the value of our North America business.  Specifically, we are repositioning our fracturing fleets to customers in areas where we can maximize returns in 2022, securing longer-term, premium pricing contracts for our existing and planned electric fleets, and accelerating fleet maintenance and deployment of the next-generation fluid in technology, which extends the life of our equipment.  Halliburton has committed to North America and I expect we will benefit more than others as activity and pricing momentum accelerates across the board. Next, let me turn to how we are executing on our strategic priority to advance a sustainable energy future. As we are witnessing now and saw in the third quarter, the worlds requires a greater supply of oil and gas. As an oilfield services Company, we have the core competency to help our customers to deliver this supply in the most efficient and technologically advanced ways possible.  With our customers, we are bringing our technical expertise and over a century of industry experience to actively participate in the transition to a cleaner economy. One of the most meaningful contributions we can make today to this transition is to help our customers reduce emissions from their existing production base.  Emissions reduction is a critical part of our technology development process, and our innovative low-carbon solutions are helping oil and gas operators reduce their carbon footprint. Halliburton 's electric fracturing solution delivers results now for our customers. In the third quarter, Halliburton completed an all electric pad operation on a multiyear contract with Chesapeake Energy in the Marcellus shale.  We deployed our electric fracturing spread with electric blending, wireline, and ancillary equipment, and an advanced power-generation system from VoltaGrid. This high-performing solution reduced Chesapeake's emission using over 25 megawatts of lower-carbon power generation from Chesapeake's local field gas. We are collaborating with an IOC in Mexico on their total carbon footprint reduction.  Because we provide both well construction services and logistic services on this contract, we changed supply boat fueling mechanisms and optimized usage to achieve emissions reductions in the first year of operations. We are now using a similar contract structure to collaborate with this IOC on its other projects in Latin America.  We're also advancing renewable energy solutions through Halliburton Labs, our clean energy accelerator. In the third quarter, we doubled our size by increasing the number of Halliburton Labs companies from 4 to 8. Welcoming Alumina Energy from California, Ionada from Ontario, and Parasanti and SurgePower Materials from Texas. We help these companies scale their exciting technologies, from innovative energy storage solutions to modular carbon capture systems. In September, Halliburton Labs hosted its third finalist pitch day, featuring 9 early-stage companies, and an audience of several hundred entrepreneurs, investors, academics, and other professionals, looking to engage with companies that advance cleaner, affordable energy.  The Halliburton Labs participants are achieving results, and Roxol Bioenergy completed a $10 million series 8 round of financing, and Roxol 's patented modular system uses locally sourced organic or plastic waste to generate clean on-site energy, even in the most remote and inaccessible location.  Other accelerator participants achieved important scaling milestones in the third quarter. With both current and expected demand increases, Halliburton remains committed to the priorities we set in 2020. We prioritize profitable growth and returns, remain focused on capital efficiency at are keeping our overall capital investment in the range of 5% to 6% of revenue.  I'm excited about the multiyear up-cycle we see in front of us. I believe our value proposition, technology differentiation, digital adoption, and capital efficiency will allow us to deliver profitable growth internationally and maximize value in North America. Halliburton will continue to execute our key strategic priorities to deliver industry-leading returns and strong free cash flow for our shareholders. Now, I'll turn the call over to Lance (ph) to provide more details on our third quarter financial results (ph). Lance.\nLance Loeffler : Thank you, Jeff. And good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a summary of our third quarter results compared to the second quarter of 2021. Total Company revenue for the quarter was $3.9 billion and adjusted operating income was $458 million, an increase of 4% and 6% respectively.  During the third quarter, Halliburton closed the structured transaction for our North America real estate assets that I described earlier this year, which resulted in a $74 million gain. We also discontinued the proposed sale of our pipeline and process services business, leading to a depreciation catch-up related to these assets previously classified as assets held for sale. As a result, among these and other items, we recognize a $12 million pretax charge. Now, let me take a moment to discuss our division results in more detail. Starting with our completion in production division, revenue was $2.1 billion, an increase of 4% while operating income was $322 million or an increase of 2%. These results were driven by increased activity across multiple product service lines in the western hemisphere, higher cementing activity in the Middle East Asia region, as well as increased well intervention services in the Europe, Africa, CIS region.  These improvements were partially offset by reduced completion tool sales in the eastern hemisphere, lower stimulation activity in the Middle East / Asia region, and accelerated maintenance expenses for our stimulation business in North America, which related to upgrading our fluid and technology in preparation for the anticipated market acceleration that Jeff described earlier.  In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $1.7 billion, or an increase of 4%, while operating income was $186 million, or an increase of 6%. These results were due to improved drilling-related services internationally and in North America land, additional testing services and wireline activity across Latin America, along with increased project management activity in Mexico and Ecuador. Partially off-setting these increases were reduced drilling-related services in Norway and the Gulf of Mexico.  Moving on to our geographic results. In North America, revenue increased 3%. This increase was driven primarily by higher well construction, artificial lift, and wireline activity in North America land, increased completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico, and additional stimulation and drilling activity in Canada.  Partially offsetting these increases were reduced drilling-related, wireline, and stimulation activity in the Gulf of Mexico as a result of the impact from Hurricane Ida. Turning to Latin America, revenue increased 17% sequentially. This improvement was driven by increased activity in multiple product service lines in Argentina, Mexico, and Brazil, as well as higher well construction services in Columbia, and improved project management activity in Ecuador. These increases were partially offset by reduced fluid services in the Caribbean. In Europe, Africa, CIS, revenue was essentially flat sequentially. These results were driven by higher well intervention services across the region, increased well construction services and completion tool sales in Nigeria, additional pipeline and fluid services in Russia, and increased activity across multiple product service lines in Senegal.  These improvements were offset by decreased activity across multiple product service lines in the North Sea and Algeria and lower completion tool sales in Angola. In the Middle East Asia region, revenue increased 2% resulting from improved well construction activity in the Middle East and Australia.  These improvements were partially offset by lower completion tool sales across the region, along with reduced wireline and stimulation activity in Saudi Arabia, lower projects. Management activity in India, and lower stimulation activity in Malaysia. In the Third Quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $50 million For the fourth quarter, we expect our corporate expense to moderately increase.  Net interest expense for the quarter was a $116 million. In the third quarter, we retired $500 million of 2021 senior notes using cash on hand, as a result, our net interest expense in the fourth quarter should decline modestly. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter came in at approximately 24%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our fourth quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 22%.  Capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately a $190 million. In response to higher demand for our services in both international and North America markets, we are pulling forward spending on long lead time items for our premium equipment, and now expect our full-year capital expenditures to be closer to $800 million for the full year.  Turning to cash flow, we generated approximately $620 million of cash from operations and almost $470 million of free cash flow during the third quarter. I am very pleased with our working capital performance this quarter as we delivered net cash proceeds from working capital despite our revenue growth.  Now let me describe our near-term outlook. In North America, we expect moderate pricing and activity improvements in drilling and completions to drive sequential growth. In the international markets, we expect continued improvement in rig counts, the pace of which will vary across regions. As a result, for our Completion and Production division, we anticipate mid single-digit revenue growth sequentially, with operating margins expected to expand by approximately 50 basis points.  The higher year-end completion tool sales will be partially offset by seasonal North America land activity impacted by the holidays and lower efficiency levels typically experienced in the winter months. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate sequential revenue growth of 5% to 7%, and a margin increase of a 150 to 200 basis points, due to seasonal software sales and higher overall global activity. I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff.\nJeff Miller : Thanks, Lance. To summarize our discussion today. Halliburton is on track to deliver strong results and our financial commitments for this year. We see customer urgency and demand for our services increasing internationally and in North America. We expect to benefit from the accelerating recovery and deliver profitable growth in the international markets and maximize value in North America.  We prioritize our investments to the highest returns opportunities and are committed to capital efficiency. As our forward outlook unfolds, we expect to deliver strong free cash flow and industry leading returns for our shareholders. And now, let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nJames West : Hey. Good morning, guys.\nJeff Miller : Morning, James\nLance Loeffler : Morning, James.\nJames West : Just -- clearly, a very bullish global outlook of North America and International. It seems though that International really stepped up even further than you thought, maybe initially in the last 3 months since the last conference call. Could you perhaps describe where the -- these pleasant surprises are coming from?\nJeff Miller : Well, thanks, James. Look, I think broadly if I look out at the improvements, it's really a function of the tightening macro, and what we see and so. I think supply is clearly short. I mean, this underspending that's been happening for really 7 years is starting to have an effect on the supply side, and that drives clearly urgency, but it's harder to do.  And then along with that, we've got short supply service assets, and that is also driving great environment for us and Halliburton's in the right places. And so when I think about profitable growth internationally and also maximizing value in North America, that's right in the fairway of where we want to be.  And so this beginning of an up-cycle, I think what we'll see are our operators work very hard to improve production, but it's short-cycle style barrels are just going to take a lot more work around the wellbore. And all very good. And it's really, as I said, beginning of what I see as a very strong up-cycle for our services.\nJames West : Sure. No doubt about that and we certainly agree. One follow-up from me, North America, the 20% number that you put out there, which is actually the same number that we're using, but how much of that increase is activity versus pricing in the inflationary environment that we're now seeing in North America? Meaning, is activity in that scenario up 10%, 12%, is up 15%. How are you thinking about activity levels versus the overall spend level?\nJeff Miller : Look, I think -- clearly it's a combination of both. I think that we will see certainly inflation, I'm not going to give you a number today, but I think that we're seeing strengthening pricing -- strengthening pricing into 2022 so I think that'll be a part of it. In fact to our strategy of maximizing value in North America, I think that we're going to be really sharp around where we work and how we generate those returns.  So I -- is it -- I would -- I think that pricing will move up more. And I think there will be a lot of effort put into the activity but the combination of equipment shortages that drive prices are going to probably be a headwind to a degree on activity as we get into the year, biased more to price than activity probably.\nJames West : Okay. Got it. Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nNeil Mehta : Good morning team. I want to go back to the comments last quarter, the 400 basis points of margin improvement by 2023. Given we're in a firmer oil macro environment and the activity pick-up that you anticipate. Do you see potential for that actually get pulled forward. And how are we tracking relative to the 400 basis points of their upside or downside, as you tested out real-time.\nJeff Miller : So thanks, Neil. But look, I'm really excited about the outlook and the possibility to pull that forward. Certainly, that's a possibility. I think that we're on track. I mean, everything that I see indicates that's well on our viewfinder in terms of getting to the '23 outlook that I had.  The pace at which oil -- oil demand comes back, which I would say is surprising a little bit to the upside in spite of what's out there with respect to COVID, certainly encouraging, certainly highlights what we've been seeing for some time, which is how important oil is, and more importantly, the impact that not spending normal rates for quite a long time has on the supply of oil. Of course, operators are going to work really hard to accelerate that, which is fantastic for Halliburton. So I'm very encouraged about the outlook and the Pacing.\nNeil Mehta : Alright Jeff. And then the follow-up is just return of capital, that $500 million of debt this quarter next year is set up to be a good free cash flow year, how do you think about getting the dividend or capital returns profile to be more competitive relative to the rest of energy\nLance Loeffler : Yes, Neil, this is Lance. Look, we certainly -- no doubt, we see an environment that provides us with a lot more flexibility as we look towards 2022. And I would just say this year, 2021, we've had a strategy and we're continuing to execute that. It starts with EBITDA growth, Capex control, and a focus on deleveraging throughout the course of the year. The dividend raise is certainly in the viewfinder as our outlook plays out.  We're still going to continue to be focusing on deleveraging our business and to a certain extent accelerating it when it makes economic sense. So there's still work to do there, but I think the message is that we've got a great opportunity to address all of these things as we move into next year.\nNeil Mehta : Thanks, Lance.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is open.\nDavid Anderson : Hi. Good morning, Jeff. So the question on everyone's mind right now is net pricing in the U.S. and whether or not you're getting that now. I was wondering if you could just confirm you have in fact recently put through a pricing increase in U.S. pumping business. And addition, if you could address the topic of labor inflation and how much is that offsetting pricing and what could that mean if the industry looks to add, say, 20 or so fleets on the coming quarters. Our E&P seem to think pricing is going to stay flat outside of inflation, so I'm just kind of curious where you think that disconnect could be.\nJeff Miller : I think the disconnect will be around supply of equipment and also the type of equipment, there's a lot of demand out there. I'll talk about pricing may be first. We're seeing it now, it looks a little different than maybe in prior cycles in the sense that it's more of a process than it is a point in time, but yes, making a lot of progress around that.  We've talked about premium equipment and clearly that's -- a lot of demand for that and it's in short supply and likely stays that way. And so that's certainly positive. Our outlook is that we're going to, certainly, getting that pricing -- getting some net pricing now, and we expect to continue that, particularly as equipment tightens. It starts with the premium equipment, but my view is that we will see that across the entire fleet as we go into 2022.  And so with respect to inflation, yes, seeing that, I think that's been passed along fairly straightforward manner, but that's not the pricing that actually we're looking forward to and seeing some of now. From a labor perspective and, if you described 20 more fleets into 2022, your 40 to 85% utilization today, that takes us what, like close to 100. That drives a lot of pricing activity around equipment, and the labor, I think, it will exacerbate that.  We were very fortunate at Halliburton that we're able to manage the labor, other elements of transportation, I think, more effectively than the market. I described some of that in my comments. But I think that will continue to get tight and I like the way we're differentially positioned around those things also.\nDavid Anderson : Clearly, labor is an issue everywhere and I'd have to think of the oil field especially acutely. A separate question. You touched on this a little bit, but I'm really wondering what the inventory of kind of both directional drilling and completion tools globally. Now, you're spending only about 5% of revenue on Capex.  It's less than half the rate of just a few years ago. Your competitors have also been very capital disciplined. Obviously, not just the E&Ps were capital disciplined, but you guys have been as well. But now on this cost of this global recovery in activity, as you said, multi your up-cycle unfolding.  And we're also seeing the supply chain issues across the industry. I guess my question is, if there's going to be the shortage of type of specialized equipment next year and where do you see it most acute? You talked about reallocating equipment, but I feel like we've done this already a couple of times, and I know you've been moving it around, but it feels like we're kind of coming into this inflection on a lot of this equipment out there, and I'm just kind of curious of your views on that.\nJeff Miller : Well, we likely are and we are -- it's getting tight, it's tighter, and we're going to reallocate equipment to the highest return opportunities. And I think we're just going to see some tightness, which is a healthy thing, which is going to drive better asset allocation to projects. We're -- we see capital velocity as a strategic plank for us that we're very focused on and we think that's the key to driving profitable growth.  And I say it that way because there will be many opportunities, our focus is on the profitable slice of that. And things that we're seeing set up as it gets more active internationally. Short-cycle barrels clearly will use equipment, but as we see, some element of offshore activity creep into that, that soaks up more capacity.  And so I expect we'll see quite a bit of tightness which is very, very positive for Halliburton and our outlook. I mean, I don't -- I think that the returns haven't been there, and we expect to see solid returns, and growth in returns, and free cash flow, and a tight market is what makes that happen.\nDavid Anderson : Looking forward to them. Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nChase Mulvehill : Good morning, everyone. So I just wanted to --\nJeff Miller : Good morning Chase.\nChase Mulvehill : Good morning. I just want to follow up on the commentary around the North America Capex being up 20%, obviously U.S. onshore will be up a little bit more. But I just want to connect the dots there and just try to understand how you're getting to the 20%. Because if you just look at operating cash flow of E and Ps, those could be up 30 to 40% year-over-year. So that would imply that they would spend less of operating cash flow [Indiscernible] today, they're spending about 50% of operating cash flow.  And if you just look at consensus for public E&Ps, we're talking high teens already for growth. So that implies a more modest pace of growth for the private E&P s. So I just I want to kind of understand the 20% [Indiscernible] that you put out there for North America.\nJeff Miller : Thanks, Chase. Look, 20% is a good starting point. Obviously, could it be more? It could be certainly and I think the more activity there is, the more price there will be and so kind of take those in tandem. When we look at 2022, clearly there's a call on U.S. production at the kind of commodity prices that we see today, and particularly given the supply shortage.  So we have always expected that we would see North America move first and strongest as we got into the real heavy lift around short supply. That said though, I do believe that it is moderated to a degree because there are formulas in place around how reinvestment -- around reinvestment rates, around dividend requirements, around compensation schemes.  So all of that's in place which serves to certainly moderate activity for the public. And I suspect we'll -- those budgets aren't out, but I certainly expect that we'll see those. The privates clearly are very active. An evidence to me that we see sort of that strengthening, is we're finding more work.  The reality is -- was we readjust pricing and look at the market that requires moving around to different operators at different times. And we're doing some of that now. But the old adage, you don't quit a job till you have a job. And we're finding jobs. All of that is positive, but I think that there will be tightness around equipment in that environment. I don't -- we're in and around 20 is just sort of a current outlook on 22. I don't mean that to be prescriptive. Could it be more clearly, it could be more. But I also think it will be very tight.\nChase Mulvehill : Thanks. Great. Can I follow-up on the frac maintenance expense. I mean, you noted -- in the press release you talked about it during the earnings call. I don't know if you would offer up how material it was, is it -- does it recur again in 4Q and so maybe that's impacting margins on the CMP side a little bit.  And also maybe, is -- should we think about this is as an indication that you think you're going to be able to get the pricing you need in 2022 to really kind of drive more activity on the frac side.\nJeff Miller : Yeah. Look at the -- the maintenance was maybe a penny. But clarity around where that equipment will go. I mean, that's an indicator that we have certainty around where that equipment will go to work and the kind of things we're doing are like the, the [Indiscernible] end are things that drive better margins for us and a longer life over the life of that so it's just wise to do, I think more important is that we've got real clarity around where that equipment goes and 22 and we want to make certain that we're ready and it goes to work at prices that clearly eclipse any cost of maintenance on the equipment.  It's just the thing that we want to do. Q4, we've given you our guidance and all that's in that guidance. So look, I take it as a real positive that we've got the clarity that we have, and just the concrete evidence of where this equipment will go. And we just want to make certain that we're taking care of everything in real-time.\nChase Mulvehill : Right. Perfect. I'll turn it back over. Thanks, Jeff.\nJeff Miller : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your line is open.\nScott Gruber : Guys, good morning.\nJeff Miller : Hey, Scott.\nLance Loeffler : Morning, Scott.\nScott Gruber : I just want to come back to the domestic inflation question again. Are there any numbers you could put on the delta in your inflation versus the market inflation just given your advantages. And now that you're securing, what I assume is market-based price increases, kind of what that combination could be.  The framework is -- if the market pricing is up 15%, but peers are seeing like 10% inflation only getting net 5. But -- there is a meaningful gap for Halliburton, maybe you're net inflation or your net pricing gains are 10% because you aren't experiencing half of the inflation.  So if you could tell us what that inflation gap could be and obviously I just made those figures up, so [Indiscernible] any color on the potential net pricing gains for Halliburton vis -a - vis the competition would be great.\nJeff Miller : Yeah. Look, guys, it's very competitive information. I'd say we out perform ed the numbers you laid out. But maybe I'll just walk through the components of how we manage these things. It's very -- we have very sophisticated supply chain organization and they are working overtime, but absolutely getting it done.  Price fairly passed on to customers. The labor [Indiscernible] the ability to recruit nationally in the US, and the ability to have a strong local workforce internationally, both are key elements of managing inflation for Halliburton. From our raw materials perspective. Again, supply chain buys from the entire world, we manage logistics, and we actually see that improving in terms of tightness as we go into 2022.  Particularly we're seeing sort of space on airplanes. As the world opens up and we see more carriers sort of get back to work, we actually believe the international logistics around raw material gets better. And then in North America, our relationship with Vorto is having quite an impact. I mean, we are able to add drivers. We were able to retain drivers, it's been quite disruptive but very effective.  And so look, I'm confident that we outperform in terms of managing inflation for Halliburton, but that's a separate topic from where we see pricing going in 2022 and many cases now.\nScott Gruber : Just a quick one on international Jeff, you mentioned an acceleration in international activity next year. Any early read on where that figure could go. Are you thinking potentially mid [Indiscernible], high - [Indiscernible]. We've seen 20% growth in past years during strong up cycles. Just any early read on where international activity growth could ascend to next year?\nJeff Miller : Yeah. Look, the entire international market is a huge market, and so to move all of that at a high rate is probably more difficult to do, particularly given where the supply chain actually in project backlog is for clients. But nevertheless, could it be low-teens to mid-teens? Yeah, certainly could be. Super excited about Latin America and the pace of growth and the outlook there. Middle East should be very strong.  And I think we're going to see the kind of broad-based improvement that allows pricing and pockets of places to continue to get better. So it's going to be good. It should be really, really good market internationally. I think we build into it throughout 22 as well.\nScott Gruber : Got it. Thank you.\nJeff Miller : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nArun Jayaram: Good morning. I wanted to get a bit more color on some of the implications of house decision to reposition some of your frac fleets to get the better pricing you mentioned and exposure to long-term contracts. So I wanted to maybe get a sense of are you mobilizing that equipment today. So, is that going to be a little bit of a drag on 4Q, and as you get that equipment into those newer markets, does that give you some tailwinds as we think about 2022.\nJeff Miller : Yeah. I think it does give us tailwinds as we go into 2022. Drag our headwinds near-term. Not much -- any of that would be in our guidance. But look, this is making -- maximizing the value in North America, which is clearly what strategically we want to do and plan to do. And our doing involves making decisions around what we do with the assets that we have. And I think you're seeing that and will continue to see that from Halliburton.  And so I'm super encouraged, and a lot of the discussions we're having today with customers are around 2022, in fact, most of that dialogue is 2022 and beyond, actually, even into some sort of 23 type discussion. So I'm super encouraged, so what we want to make sure is that our assets are deployed where they're the most valuable for us and our clients. And yes, that does include moving them around.  When we're moving them around, we tend to do more maintenance on them and what not. That's the opportunity that we take typically to do high-grades of fluid ends and that kind of thing. And so it should be interpreted in a very positive way what we're doing, and particularly a demonstration of really two strategic planks. One is maximizing value in North America and the second is capital velocity. Capital efficiency.\nArun Jayaram: Got it. Got it. Any color, Jeff, on which basins that you sense is a better opportunity to get better pricing in these long-term commitments?\nJeff Miller : Well, fortunately, we're in all the basins. And so I don't really take a view of basin by basin as much as we do customer opportunity by customer opportunity, and that can be wherever it might fall. I'm not going to necessarily carve out a particular location. Clearly, there's more activity nearly in all of the basins today, and so that's very encouraging.\nArun Jayaram: Okay. My follow-up is just on international -- there's 3.5 to 4 million barrels offline by OpEx Plus. I wanted to get your views on -- are you seeing any shifts internationally from customers, perhaps shifting from a focus on maintenance Capex, sustaining Capex projects, to growing productive capacity. and if so, which markets are you seeing perhaps some shift towards that -- into a bit more growth?\nJeff Miller : Look, I think [Indiscernible] we're going to find internationally, there's been a lot of under spend for quite a long time and a lot of countries are declining today. Declining is hard to overcome. They'll work hard to do that, but that doesn't necessarily move the needle in terms of production. It might get it back to flat instead of even with extra work, it takes extra work to just stem the decline.  All of that's positive for us. I mean, clearly we see more activity as we go into 2022 in the Middle East and Latin America. But again, I think that those that can spend and are in a position to do so will, but there's the capital austerity by a number of clients is still well in place, and so I think that -- and I say that in the sense that I think that production is going to all be near wellbore, which is very good for us, and I think that a lot of work will get done. But I still see supply as tight for really quite some time.  I mean, it doesn't turn back on. Maybe a point worth remembering, in 2014, the number of big multi-billion-dollar projects with 30-year payouts that were being completed or in the process of finishing, we don't see those today. And the reality is that means there's less spin on infrastructure and a lot more spin on what we do. And I think that's all very, very positive.\nArun Jayaram: Thanks a lot.\nJeff Miller : Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ian Macpherson with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nIan Macpherson : Good morning.\nJeff Miller : Good morning, Ian.\nIan Macpherson : Jeff, it seems like an unsung hero of your year so far has been Latin America. It's whe -- That's where you've had really outsized growth and the market there, the total activity has grown, but it looks like you punched above your weight in Latin America.  Can you speak to those strengths? And you said, I think it's -- not towards in your mouth, but synchronized global, international growth going into next year. For Latin America, in particular, do you expect to see continued momentum on par with the rest of Eastern Hemisphere growth into next year as well?\nJeff Miller : Yes, I do. Look, I'm very encouraged about Latin America. And that team has punched above its weight in Latin America. We've got an excellent team, great position. We're in every country. The technology introduction has been effective there which I've talked about sort of our Drilling Tools and what we've been able to accomplish.  Our project management capabilities are very strong in Latin America and it's allowed us to outperform in my view. I think that continues into 2022 as more work comes on. And again, that's a part of the world where oil production, and it's very important to economies and operators. and I think that we'll continue to see a strong Latin American business.\nIan Macpherson : Great. Thanks, Jeff. And then I was going to ask a follow-up to Lance after. You had a really good quarter here with free cash, with the disposals, and some working capital as well. Any indicators for Q4 [Indiscernible] with regards to extras outside of the basics of free cash with respect to net disposals and working capital movements to close the year.\nLance Loeffler : Yeah, I think we certainly expect continued strength in the operational profit piece of the equation. That's pretty obvious based on our guidance for the quarter. Some of that will be offset by some of that acceleration in Capex spend that we talked about in my prepared remarks.\nJeff Miller : We'll be looking to round out the year around Capex. And look, I think we'll have to see how working capital continues to play out. We have clearly been very focused on working capital and the required investment it would take to put back that investment as we continue to grow, a great outcome this quarter where we actually still generated cash from working capital, despite the fact that our revenue was growing globally.  So all good facts historically, whether we can keep -- whether it's realistic that we can keep that momentum from a working capital perspective going forward might be a little bit harder. So those are all the things that we think about. I mean, look, overall, I'm excited about the way that free cash flow has behaved so far this year and I continue to be encouraged about what that means for next year as well.\nIan Macpherson : Great. Thank you, Jeff.\nJeff Miller : You bet. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Marci Bianci with Cowen (ph). Your line is open.\nMarci Bianci: Thank you. I guess, with regard to CMP in North America here, you've got these little bit of maintenance overhang, I guess it's about 50 basis points based on your comment, Jeff, and then there's these pricing initiatives. Is there any way you could give us a sense of the margin leverage that you could see in 2022 from all of this?  I don't know if it'd be perhaps unreasonable to get to 19& or 20% margins towards the end of the year in CMP, if you're willing to comment on that or any other color about how you would see the margin average shaping up.\nJeff Miller : Look, I feel good about our business in 2022, most certainly for the reasons I've described. I'm not going to try to give an outlook today on 2022, but what I can say from an operating -- from an earnings power standpoint. We've been very effective at maintaining the earnings power reset that really happened a year ago, but that's well in place.  And all of the things, there were a lot of things that we did when we were reducing costs a year ago that really they were going to be savings as we saw activity pick up, but they were sort of the things that improved margins with activity. We didn't have much activity, so we didn't see the benefit of that, but a lot of the digital work that we've done in North America and reduction of roofline and changing of maintenance and all of those things become more valuable as we get into an environment where we see more activity.  And so we're really encouraged about the outlook. And not only activity but our technology offering, particularly around frac in North America, is very unique and I think we will see the power of that also.\nMarci Bianci: Yeah. Okay, great. And then, Lance, going back to free cash flow, it looks like you're going to be approaching maybe 50% conversion of EBITDA here in '21. Maybe walk us through the puts and takes as you look at '22 Capex, probably in that 5% to 6% range, but just any other color you could talk to around the conversion, that would be great.\nLance Loeffler : Yes. So, I think as we look to '22, it's certainly healthier, right? Generally speaking, I describe it that way because it means that our operational profit contribution is clearly moving higher as -- into the year -- into next year. But like I said earlier, even as I was relating to the fourth quarter, our revenue increase is going to require incremental working capital. Look, 21 is proof that we're focused on it, and managing it as tight as we can and as efficiently as we can. And then you're right, Mark, from a Capex perspective. I think we've been pretty clear what the guardrails are on our business even into next year, 5% to 6% of revenue. But look, at the end of the day, maximizing value in North America, growing international profitably, and that keeping real tremendous amount of focus on capital efficiency. I think all leads to free cash flow growth next year.\nMarci Bianci: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. That's all the time we have for questions today. I'd like to turn the call back to A - Jeff Miller for closing comments.\nJeff Miller : Thank you, Katherine. Look, I'm pleased with the quarter and look forward to speaking with you again at the end of the next quarter as we see this multiyear up-cycle continue to unfold. Katherine, you can close out the call.\nOperator: This concludes today's Conference Call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jeff Miller",
            "content": "Thank you David and good morning everyone. Last quarter, we discussed a longer view of a recovering market and our confidence in a multiyear up-cycle. I am pleased with the steady march of activity and Halliburton 's performance in the third quarter internationally and in North America, all reinforce our enthusiasm today, and for what we expect in 2022 and beyond.  Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of both our strategy and our execution as the market recovery accelerates. Here are some highlights. Total Company revenue increased 4% sequentially with top-line improvements across all regions. While adjusted operating income grew 6% with solid margin performance in both divisions. Our Completion and Production division revenue grew 4%, driven by increased global activity. Operating margin was essentially flat in the third quarter, as we made operational choices to prepare for higher demand for our services in 2022. Our Drilling and Evaluation division revenue grew 4% with increased activity across multiple regions.  Operating margin of 11% was about flat sequentially. North America revenue increased 3% as growth in U.S. land was partially offset by a decline in our Gulf of Mexico business due to Hurricane Ida. International revenue grew 5% sequentially in line with the international rig count growth. Our year-to-date free cash flow generation of almost $900 million puts us solidly on track to deliver our full-year free cash flow objective.  Finally, we retired $500 million of our long-term debt and ended the quarter with 2.6 billion of cash on hand. As this upcycle unfolds in both the International and North America markets, Halliburton is executing on our strategy to deliver profitable growth and generate industry-leading returns.  In the international markets, third quarter activity momentum continued, and I believe it will accelerate into year end and support mid-teen second half revenue growth compared to the second half of last year. This expected outcome is better than we anticipated a quarter ago. In the third quarter, we started long-term projects across all regions in spite of the COVID-19 interruptions.  While mobility restrictions and daily precautions remain in place, business activity around the world has adjusted and continues to improve. In the Middle East, countries relaxed border restrictions and Opec (ph) members prepared for activity increases. We started to work on several rigs offshore UAE, mobilized a work-over project in Bahrain, and completed multiple ESP installations on our Artificial Lift contract in Kuwait. We expect the Middle East to exit the year with solid activity momentum. In Asia-Pacific, we launched operations on an integrated project offshore Malaysia with full implementation of Halliburton's Digital Well construction capabilities. We also ramped up for an increase in our Indonesia drilling operations where the local NOC plans to boost production from its assets. In Europe, Africa, CIS region.  The start of operations on a 23 well offshore integrated development campaign for Woodside in Senegal marked a new country entry for Halliburton. In Russia, we're mobilizing for a multiyear IOC operated project on Sakhalin Island. In the UK sector of the North Sea, work continues on several new development drilling, and workover projects for local independent operators. Finally, Latin America delivered its best quarterly performance since 2015.  We spotted the first well on a three-year integrated project in Brazil, deployed our new drilling technologies on multiple wells in Argentina and prepared to mobilize for new work in Ecuador and Columbia. In addition to contract startups, our pipeline of new tenders continues to grow.  While large Middle East tenders and Latin America projects received most of the headlines, customers in Africa, Russia and Southeast Asia, among others, are also issuing tenders for new work. All of this points to increasing international customer urgency and demand for our services. Let me describe what I'm seeing that gives me this conviction. Global supply and demand balance continues to tighten, resulting in a strong commodity price environment. In response, asset owners are eager to reverse baseline production declines caused by multiple years of under investment.  We expect that NOCs and other operators with short cycle production opportunities will commit additional capital and gain share to meet future oil demand. Additionally, new fields are smaller and more complex. More customers work harder to produce more barrels. Finally, as mature assets change hands, new owners move quickly to revitalize the assets they acquire and unlock remaining reserves.  They require service partners who can deliver proven technology and decades of experience. All of these things have one thing in common. They require higher service intensity, more dollars spent on the wellbore rather than on infrastructure. As the international recovery accelerates, we remain committed to a clear strategic priority. deliver profitable growth, and we have unique competitive advantages to deliver on this priority.  We have the established footprint, geographic presence, and customer and supplier relationships to capitalize on growth. We have a strong presence in all major international markets. The substantial majority of our workforce is local and within the regions where we operate, our supply chain spend is primarily with local suppliers. We have proven capabilities to ramp up our services as customers enter new markets. We demonstrated this in Guyana, Suriname, and most recently, in Senegal.  The Halliburton team mobilized personnel and built a multi-functional operational base to support Woodside as we embark together on a development campaign offshore Senegal. We also engineer innovative solutions, both digital and hardware to meet the complex reservoir challenges faced by our international customers.  For example, in well construction, this quarter we introduced the iStar comprehensive measurement platform. This next-generation intelligent platform provides multiple logging and drilling measurements that enabled reservoir evaluation, faster drilling, and consistent well delivery. For multiple customers in the Middle East and North Sea, the iStar platform provides insight into the impact of drilling parameters on well work conditions, and optimizes the drilling process in real-time. In completions, we're the global leader in downhole completion solutions. As our customers increase their activity, our e-completions ecosystem integrates manufacturing digital twins and technology development processes to increase our speed to market for these long lead complex systems.  In many regions, as customers drive for better performance in the face of increasing operational challenges, I expect adoption of integrated and bundled contracts will continue to grow. Halliburton has strong project management capabilities, and they've proven track record that deliver efficiencies and reduce total customer cost of ownership. Our digital innovations reframe customer project economics through greater efficiencies and improved decision-making.  For example, in the third quarter, we deployed our well construction 4.0 digital solution to deliver further operational efficiencies for our customer in the Middle East. Finally, our customers call on us for collaboration from an IOC, looking to reduce emissions on its operations in Mexico, to a European independent working to remotely monitor and control all of its global drilling operations.  Halliburton 's value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers is working for both our customers and Halliburton. Now, turning to North America, the bifurcation between public and private Company activity continued in the third quarter.  Public E&Ps remain committed to their spending plans for 2021 while private operators continue to take advantage of a strong commodity price environment. As expected, completions growth moderated in the third quarter as operator's shifted their focus from completions to drilling activity. Just like in the international markets, customer urgency and demand for our services keep growing in North America.  Drilled but uncompleted well counts reached the lowest levels since 2013 as operators depleted the surplus of ducks accumulated in 2020, we expect customers to drill and complete more new wells to offset steep base decline rates and deliver production into an anticipated attractive market next year, Completions equipment availability is tightening.  Customers have responded by starting the 2022 tender process earlier in an attempt to lock in access to quality services for next year's programs. Private companies now operate about 60% of the U.S. land rig count. And current commodity prices provide a strong incentive for their activity to expand. Our market-leading position in North America is rooted in the groundbreaking technologies we put to work in this market.  We are the only fully integrated service provider in North America, and this gives us a unique competitive advantage. We combine the full breadth of our technology disciplines, geo -sciences, physics, chemistry, material science, and mechanical, electrical and software engineering to deliver innovative solutions at scale around the world, and uniquely in North America, to maximize production and minimize costs, Our smart fleet intelligent fracturing services transitioned from pilot to campaign mode. Several large operators today have smart fleet working on multi-pad completion programs.  Smart fleet for the first time allows operators to measure treatment placement in real time, which among other things, has demonstrated up to 30% improvement in cluster uniformity. In the third quarter, we introduced the IsoBond Cement System and pumped it for multiple customers in the DJ Basin and in the Marcellus shale. By removing liquid additives, this dry-blended cement provides significant operational efficiencies and lower capital requirements for land operations. Taking advantage of the increasing demand for our services require strategic execution on many fronts, particularly in the current environment of stressed supply chains, tight labor, and inflationary pressures. Against that reality, I believe that Halliburton is best prepared to provide reliable execution for our customers. Our sophisticated supply chain organization translates Halliburton size and scale into real savings for us and our customers.  We are seeing that in action as our supply chain delivers what our customers require for their projects. The labor market is tight today. We've seen the situation before, and our human resources team knows how to navigate it. Over the last few years, we compressed our onboarding time, strengthened our national recruiting network, and used digital solutions to significantly reduce our field personnel requirements. Despite real challenges, we have the scale, speed, and systems to recruit talent nationally and quickly deploy it for our customers. In logistics, we have ready access to a fleet of drivers to make deliveries to the job site. We expanded our collaboration with Vorto, an artificial intelligence supply chain platform. Our early adoption of Vorto's platform that connects drivers, asset owners, and maintenance yards allows us to effectively manage trucking inflation, and availability constraints.  Now let me spend a few minutes on our activity and pricing outlook for 2022, first in the international markets and then in North America. Next year, we expect international activity momentum to accelerate, and international leading edge pricing to move upward in pockets as a result of higher activity. This is what we're seeing today.  Large tenders remain competitive, but we're already seeing modest price increases on discrete work in underserved markets. We see increasing customer demand for Halliburton's high-end technology and the recognition of its value. Finally, as a result of lower spending by service companies for more than half a decade, international market face tightening equipment supply.  To meet these demands, we are strategically reallocating assets to drive, improve utilization and returns. Let me be clear. Halliburton prioritizes profitable growth internationally and this will drive our capital allocation decisions to the best returning product lines, geographies, and contracts.  In North America, we expect customer spending to increase in and around 20% next year, including solid net pricing gains. Many factors drive that spending and pricing, including customer urgency, equipment tightness, handed desire to align with a reliable and differentiated service provider like Halliburton. Last quarter, we highlighted the pricing traction that exists for low emission equipment.  Today, as we tender for 2022 work, we're seeing price increases for the rest of our fracturing fleet as well. Net pricing has also increased across different non - frac product service lines, drilling, cementing, drill bits, and artificial lift. To generate the highest returns as this market grows, we are taking steps to maximize the value of our North America business.  Specifically, we are repositioning our fracturing fleets to customers in areas where we can maximize returns in 2022, securing longer-term, premium pricing contracts for our existing and planned electric fleets, and accelerating fleet maintenance and deployment of the next-generation fluid in technology, which extends the life of our equipment.  Halliburton has committed to North America and I expect we will benefit more than others as activity and pricing momentum accelerates across the board. Next, let me turn to how we are executing on our strategic priority to advance a sustainable energy future. As we are witnessing now and saw in the third quarter, the worlds requires a greater supply of oil and gas. As an oilfield services Company, we have the core competency to help our customers to deliver this supply in the most efficient and technologically advanced ways possible.  With our customers, we are bringing our technical expertise and over a century of industry experience to actively participate in the transition to a cleaner economy. One of the most meaningful contributions we can make today to this transition is to help our customers reduce emissions from their existing production base.  Emissions reduction is a critical part of our technology development process, and our innovative low-carbon solutions are helping oil and gas operators reduce their carbon footprint. Halliburton 's electric fracturing solution delivers results now for our customers. In the third quarter, Halliburton completed an all electric pad operation on a multiyear contract with Chesapeake Energy in the Marcellus shale.  We deployed our electric fracturing spread with electric blending, wireline, and ancillary equipment, and an advanced power-generation system from VoltaGrid. This high-performing solution reduced Chesapeake's emission using over 25 megawatts of lower-carbon power generation from Chesapeake's local field gas. We are collaborating with an IOC in Mexico on their total carbon footprint reduction.  Because we provide both well construction services and logistic services on this contract, we changed supply boat fueling mechanisms and optimized usage to achieve emissions reductions in the first year of operations. We are now using a similar contract structure to collaborate with this IOC on its other projects in Latin America.  We're also advancing renewable energy solutions through Halliburton Labs, our clean energy accelerator. In the third quarter, we doubled our size by increasing the number of Halliburton Labs companies from 4 to 8. Welcoming Alumina Energy from California, Ionada from Ontario, and Parasanti and SurgePower Materials from Texas. We help these companies scale their exciting technologies, from innovative energy storage solutions to modular carbon capture systems. In September, Halliburton Labs hosted its third finalist pitch day, featuring 9 early-stage companies, and an audience of several hundred entrepreneurs, investors, academics, and other professionals, looking to engage with companies that advance cleaner, affordable energy.  The Halliburton Labs participants are achieving results, and Roxol Bioenergy completed a $10 million series 8 round of financing, and Roxol 's patented modular system uses locally sourced organic or plastic waste to generate clean on-site energy, even in the most remote and inaccessible location.  Other accelerator participants achieved important scaling milestones in the third quarter. With both current and expected demand increases, Halliburton remains committed to the priorities we set in 2020. We prioritize profitable growth and returns, remain focused on capital efficiency at are keeping our overall capital investment in the range of 5% to 6% of revenue.  I'm excited about the multiyear up-cycle we see in front of us. I believe our value proposition, technology differentiation, digital adoption, and capital efficiency will allow us to deliver profitable growth internationally and maximize value in North America. Halliburton will continue to execute our key strategic priorities to deliver industry-leading returns and strong free cash flow for our shareholders. Now, I'll turn the call over to Lance (ph) to provide more details on our third quarter financial results (ph). Lance. Thanks, Lance. To summarize our discussion today. Halliburton is on track to deliver strong results and our financial commitments for this year. We see customer urgency and demand for our services increasing internationally and in North America. We expect to benefit from the accelerating recovery and deliver profitable growth in the international markets and maximize value in North America.  We prioritize our investments to the highest returns opportunities and are committed to capital efficiency. As our forward outlook unfolds, we expect to deliver strong free cash flow and industry leading returns for our shareholders. And now, let's open it up for questions. Morning, James Well, thanks, James. Look, I think broadly if I look out at the improvements, it's really a function of the tightening macro, and what we see and so. I think supply is clearly short. I mean, this underspending that's been happening for really 7 years is starting to have an effect on the supply side, and that drives clearly urgency, but it's harder to do.  And then along with that, we've got short supply service assets, and that is also driving great environment for us and Halliburton's in the right places. And so when I think about profitable growth internationally and also maximizing value in North America, that's right in the fairway of where we want to be.  And so this beginning of an up-cycle, I think what we'll see are our operators work very hard to improve production, but it's short-cycle style barrels are just going to take a lot more work around the wellbore. And all very good. And it's really, as I said, beginning of what I see as a very strong up-cycle for our services. Look, I think -- clearly it's a combination of both. I think that we will see certainly inflation, I'm not going to give you a number today, but I think that we're seeing strengthening pricing -- strengthening pricing into 2022 so I think that'll be a part of it. In fact to our strategy of maximizing value in North America, I think that we're going to be really sharp around where we work and how we generate those returns.  So I -- is it -- I would -- I think that pricing will move up more. And I think there will be a lot of effort put into the activity but the combination of equipment shortages that drive prices are going to probably be a headwind to a degree on activity as we get into the year, biased more to price than activity probably. So thanks, Neil. But look, I'm really excited about the outlook and the possibility to pull that forward. Certainly, that's a possibility. I think that we're on track. I mean, everything that I see indicates that's well on our viewfinder in terms of getting to the '23 outlook that I had.  The pace at which oil -- oil demand comes back, which I would say is surprising a little bit to the upside in spite of what's out there with respect to COVID, certainly encouraging, certainly highlights what we've been seeing for some time, which is how important oil is, and more importantly, the impact that not spending normal rates for quite a long time has on the supply of oil. Of course, operators are going to work really hard to accelerate that, which is fantastic for Halliburton. So I'm very encouraged about the outlook and the Pacing. I think the disconnect will be around supply of equipment and also the type of equipment, there's a lot of demand out there. I'll talk about pricing may be first. We're seeing it now, it looks a little different than maybe in prior cycles in the sense that it's more of a process than it is a point in time, but yes, making a lot of progress around that.  We've talked about premium equipment and clearly that's -- a lot of demand for that and it's in short supply and likely stays that way. And so that's certainly positive. Our outlook is that we're going to, certainly, getting that pricing -- getting some net pricing now, and we expect to continue that, particularly as equipment tightens. It starts with the premium equipment, but my view is that we will see that across the entire fleet as we go into 2022.  And so with respect to inflation, yes, seeing that, I think that's been passed along fairly straightforward manner, but that's not the pricing that actually we're looking forward to and seeing some of now. From a labor perspective and, if you described 20 more fleets into 2022, your 40 to 85% utilization today, that takes us what, like close to 100. That drives a lot of pricing activity around equipment, and the labor, I think, it will exacerbate that.  We were very fortunate at Halliburton that we're able to manage the labor, other elements of transportation, I think, more effectively than the market. I described some of that in my comments. But I think that will continue to get tight and I like the way we're differentially positioned around those things also. Well, we likely are and we are -- it's getting tight, it's tighter, and we're going to reallocate equipment to the highest return opportunities. And I think we're just going to see some tightness, which is a healthy thing, which is going to drive better asset allocation to projects. We're -- we see capital velocity as a strategic plank for us that we're very focused on and we think that's the key to driving profitable growth.  And I say it that way because there will be many opportunities, our focus is on the profitable slice of that. And things that we're seeing set up as it gets more active internationally. Short-cycle barrels clearly will use equipment, but as we see, some element of offshore activity creep into that, that soaks up more capacity.  And so I expect we'll see quite a bit of tightness which is very, very positive for Halliburton and our outlook. I mean, I don't -- I think that the returns haven't been there, and we expect to see solid returns, and growth in returns, and free cash flow, and a tight market is what makes that happen. Good morning Chase. Thanks, Chase. Look, 20% is a good starting point. Obviously, could it be more? It could be certainly and I think the more activity there is, the more price there will be and so kind of take those in tandem. When we look at 2022, clearly there's a call on U.S. production at the kind of commodity prices that we see today, and particularly given the supply shortage.  So we have always expected that we would see North America move first and strongest as we got into the real heavy lift around short supply. That said though, I do believe that it is moderated to a degree because there are formulas in place around how reinvestment -- around reinvestment rates, around dividend requirements, around compensation schemes.  So all of that's in place which serves to certainly moderate activity for the public. And I suspect we'll -- those budgets aren't out, but I certainly expect that we'll see those. The privates clearly are very active. An evidence to me that we see sort of that strengthening, is we're finding more work.  The reality is -- was we readjust pricing and look at the market that requires moving around to different operators at different times. And we're doing some of that now. But the old adage, you don't quit a job till you have a job. And we're finding jobs. All of that is positive, but I think that there will be tightness around equipment in that environment. I don't -- we're in and around 20 is just sort of a current outlook on 22. I don't mean that to be prescriptive. Could it be more clearly, it could be more. But I also think it will be very tight. Yeah. Look at the -- the maintenance was maybe a penny. But clarity around where that equipment will go. I mean, that's an indicator that we have certainty around where that equipment will go to work and the kind of things we're doing are like the, the [Indiscernible] end are things that drive better margins for us and a longer life over the life of that so it's just wise to do, I think more important is that we've got real clarity around where that equipment goes and 22 and we want to make certain that we're ready and it goes to work at prices that clearly eclipse any cost of maintenance on the equipment.  It's just the thing that we want to do. Q4, we've given you our guidance and all that's in that guidance. So look, I take it as a real positive that we've got the clarity that we have, and just the concrete evidence of where this equipment will go. And we just want to make certain that we're taking care of everything in real-time. Thank you. Hey, Scott. Yeah. Look, guys, it's very competitive information. I'd say we out perform ed the numbers you laid out. But maybe I'll just walk through the components of how we manage these things. It's very -- we have very sophisticated supply chain organization and they are working overtime, but absolutely getting it done.  Price fairly passed on to customers. The labor [Indiscernible] the ability to recruit nationally in the US, and the ability to have a strong local workforce internationally, both are key elements of managing inflation for Halliburton. From our raw materials perspective. Again, supply chain buys from the entire world, we manage logistics, and we actually see that improving in terms of tightness as we go into 2022.  Particularly we're seeing sort of space on airplanes. As the world opens up and we see more carriers sort of get back to work, we actually believe the international logistics around raw material gets better. And then in North America, our relationship with Vorto is having quite an impact. I mean, we are able to add drivers. We were able to retain drivers, it's been quite disruptive but very effective.  And so look, I'm confident that we outperform in terms of managing inflation for Halliburton, but that's a separate topic from where we see pricing going in 2022 and many cases now. Yeah. Look, the entire international market is a huge market, and so to move all of that at a high rate is probably more difficult to do, particularly given where the supply chain actually in project backlog is for clients. But nevertheless, could it be low-teens to mid-teens? Yeah, certainly could be. Super excited about Latin America and the pace of growth and the outlook there. Middle East should be very strong.  And I think we're going to see the kind of broad-based improvement that allows pricing and pockets of places to continue to get better. So it's going to be good. It should be really, really good market internationally. I think we build into it throughout 22 as well. Thank you. Yeah. I think it does give us tailwinds as we go into 2022. Drag our headwinds near-term. Not much -- any of that would be in our guidance. But look, this is making -- maximizing the value in North America, which is clearly what strategically we want to do and plan to do. And our doing involves making decisions around what we do with the assets that we have. And I think you're seeing that and will continue to see that from Halliburton.  And so I'm super encouraged, and a lot of the discussions we're having today with customers are around 2022, in fact, most of that dialogue is 2022 and beyond, actually, even into some sort of 23 type discussion. So I'm super encouraged, so what we want to make sure is that our assets are deployed where they're the most valuable for us and our clients. And yes, that does include moving them around.  When we're moving them around, we tend to do more maintenance on them and what not. That's the opportunity that we take typically to do high-grades of fluid ends and that kind of thing. And so it should be interpreted in a very positive way what we're doing, and particularly a demonstration of really two strategic planks. One is maximizing value in North America and the second is capital velocity. Capital efficiency. Well, fortunately, we're in all the basins. And so I don't really take a view of basin by basin as much as we do customer opportunity by customer opportunity, and that can be wherever it might fall. I'm not going to necessarily carve out a particular location. Clearly, there's more activity nearly in all of the basins today, and so that's very encouraging. Look, I think [Indiscernible] we're going to find internationally, there's been a lot of under spend for quite a long time and a lot of countries are declining today. Declining is hard to overcome. They'll work hard to do that, but that doesn't necessarily move the needle in terms of production. It might get it back to flat instead of even with extra work, it takes extra work to just stem the decline.  All of that's positive for us. I mean, clearly we see more activity as we go into 2022 in the Middle East and Latin America. But again, I think that those that can spend and are in a position to do so will, but there's the capital austerity by a number of clients is still well in place, and so I think that -- and I say that in the sense that I think that production is going to all be near wellbore, which is very good for us, and I think that a lot of work will get done. But I still see supply as tight for really quite some time.  I mean, it doesn't turn back on. Maybe a point worth remembering, in 2014, the number of big multi-billion-dollar projects with 30-year payouts that were being completed or in the process of finishing, we don't see those today. And the reality is that means there's less spin on infrastructure and a lot more spin on what we do. And I think that's all very, very positive. Thank you. Good morning, Ian. Yes, I do. Look, I'm very encouraged about Latin America. And that team has punched above its weight in Latin America. We've got an excellent team, great position. We're in every country. The technology introduction has been effective there which I've talked about sort of our Drilling Tools and what we've been able to accomplish.  Our project management capabilities are very strong in Latin America and it's allowed us to outperform in my view. I think that continues into 2022 as more work comes on. And again, that's a part of the world where oil production, and it's very important to economies and operators. and I think that we'll continue to see a strong Latin American business. We'll be looking to round out the year around Capex. And look, I think we'll have to see how working capital continues to play out. We have clearly been very focused on working capital and the required investment it would take to put back that investment as we continue to grow, a great outcome this quarter where we actually still generated cash from working capital, despite the fact that our revenue was growing globally.  So all good facts historically, whether we can keep -- whether it's realistic that we can keep that momentum from a working capital perspective going forward might be a little bit harder. So those are all the things that we think about. I mean, look, overall, I'm excited about the way that free cash flow has behaved so far this year and I continue to be encouraged about what that means for next year as well. You bet. Thank you. Look, I feel good about our business in 2022, most certainly for the reasons I've described. I'm not going to try to give an outlook today on 2022, but what I can say from an operating -- from an earnings power standpoint. We've been very effective at maintaining the earnings power reset that really happened a year ago, but that's well in place.  And all of the things, there were a lot of things that we did when we were reducing costs a year ago that really they were going to be savings as we saw activity pick up, but they were sort of the things that improved margins with activity. We didn't have much activity, so we didn't see the benefit of that, but a lot of the digital work that we've done in North America and reduction of roofline and changing of maintenance and all of those things become more valuable as we get into an environment where we see more activity.  And so we're really encouraged about the outlook. And not only activity but our technology offering, particularly around frac in North America, is very unique and I think we will see the power of that also. Thank you, Katherine. Look, I'm pleased with the quarter and look forward to speaking with you again at the end of the next quarter as we see this multiyear up-cycle continue to unfold. Katherine, you can close out the call."

            "content": "Thank you, Jeff. And good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a summary of our third quarter results compared to the second quarter of 2021. Total Company revenue for the quarter was $3.9 billion and adjusted operating income was $458 million, an increase of 4% and 6% respectively.  During the third quarter, Halliburton closed the structured transaction for our North America real estate assets that I described earlier this year, which resulted in a $74 million gain. We also discontinued the proposed sale of our pipeline and process services business, leading to a depreciation catch-up related to these assets previously classified as assets held for sale. As a result, among these and other items, we recognize a $12 million pretax charge. Now, let me take a moment to discuss our division results in more detail. Starting with our completion in production division, revenue was $2.1 billion, an increase of 4% while operating income was $322 million or an increase of 2%. These results were driven by increased activity across multiple product service lines in the western hemisphere, higher cementing activity in the Middle East Asia region, as well as increased well intervention services in the Europe, Africa, CIS region.  These improvements were partially offset by reduced completion tool sales in the eastern hemisphere, lower stimulation activity in the Middle East / Asia region, and accelerated maintenance expenses for our stimulation business in North America, which related to upgrading our fluid and technology in preparation for the anticipated market acceleration that Jeff described earlier.  In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $1.7 billion, or an increase of 4%, while operating income was $186 million, or an increase of 6%. These results were due to improved drilling-related services internationally and in North America land, additional testing services and wireline activity across Latin America, along with increased project management activity in Mexico and Ecuador. Partially off-setting these increases were reduced drilling-related services in Norway and the Gulf of Mexico.  Moving on to our geographic results. In North America, revenue increased 3%. This increase was driven primarily by higher well construction, artificial lift, and wireline activity in North America land, increased completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico, and additional stimulation and drilling activity in Canada.  Partially offsetting these increases were reduced drilling-related, wireline, and stimulation activity in the Gulf of Mexico as a result of the impact from Hurricane Ida. Turning to Latin America, revenue increased 17% sequentially. This improvement was driven by increased activity in multiple product service lines in Argentina, Mexico, and Brazil, as well as higher well construction services in Columbia, and improved project management activity in Ecuador. These increases were partially offset by reduced fluid services in the Caribbean. In Europe, Africa, CIS, revenue was essentially flat sequentially. These results were driven by higher well intervention services across the region, increased well construction services and completion tool sales in Nigeria, additional pipeline and fluid services in Russia, and increased activity across multiple product service lines in Senegal.  These improvements were offset by decreased activity across multiple product service lines in the North Sea and Algeria and lower completion tool sales in Angola. In the Middle East Asia region, revenue increased 2% resulting from improved well construction activity in the Middle East and Australia.  These improvements were partially offset by lower completion tool sales across the region, along with reduced wireline and stimulation activity in Saudi Arabia, lower projects. Management activity in India, and lower stimulation activity in Malaysia. In the Third Quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $50 million For the fourth quarter, we expect our corporate expense to moderately increase.  Net interest expense for the quarter was a $116 million. In the third quarter, we retired $500 million of 2021 senior notes using cash on hand, as a result, our net interest expense in the fourth quarter should decline modestly. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter came in at approximately 24%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our fourth quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 22%.  Capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately a $190 million. In response to higher demand for our services in both international and North America markets, we are pulling forward spending on long lead time items for our premium equipment, and now expect our full-year capital expenditures to be closer to $800 million for the full year.  Turning to cash flow, we generated approximately $620 million of cash from operations and almost $470 million of free cash flow during the third quarter. I am very pleased with our working capital performance this quarter as we delivered net cash proceeds from working capital despite our revenue growth.  Now let me describe our near-term outlook. In North America, we expect moderate pricing and activity improvements in drilling and completions to drive sequential growth. In the international markets, we expect continued improvement in rig counts, the pace of which will vary across regions. As a result, for our Completion and Production division, we anticipate mid single-digit revenue growth sequentially, with operating margins expected to expand by approximately 50 basis points.  The higher year-end completion tool sales will be partially offset by seasonal North America land activity impacted by the holidays and lower efficiency levels typically experienced in the winter months. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate sequential revenue growth of 5% to 7%, and a margin increase of a 150 to 200 basis points, due to seasonal software sales and higher overall global activity. I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff. Morning, James. Yes, Neil, this is Lance. Look, we certainly -- no doubt, we see an environment that provides us with a lot more flexibility as we look towards 2022. And I would just say this year, 2021, we've had a strategy and we're continuing to execute that. It starts with EBITDA growth, Capex control, and a focus on deleveraging throughout the course of the year. The dividend raise is certainly in the viewfinder as our outlook plays out.  We're still going to continue to be focusing on deleveraging our business and to a certain extent accelerating it when it makes economic sense. So there's still work to do there, but I think the message is that we've got a great opportunity to address all of these things as we move into next year. Morning, Scott. Yeah, I think we certainly expect continued strength in the operational profit piece of the equation. That's pretty obvious based on our guidance for the quarter. Some of that will be offset by some of that acceleration in Capex spend that we talked about in my prepared remarks. Yes. So, I think as we look to '22, it's certainly healthier, right? Generally speaking, I describe it that way because it means that our operational profit contribution is clearly moving higher as -- into the year -- into next year. But like I said earlier, even as I was relating to the fourth quarter, our revenue increase is going to require incremental working capital. Look, 21 is proof that we're focused on it, and managing it as tight as we can and as efficiently as we can. And then you're right, Mark, from a Capex perspective. I think we've been pretty clear what the guardrails are on our business even into next year, 5% to 6% of revenue. But look, at the end of the day, maximizing value in North America, growing international profitably, and that keeping real tremendous amount of focus on capital efficiency. I think all leads to free cash flow growth next year."

Now, I will turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Thank you, Abu, and good morning, everyone. Our performance in the second quarter demonstrates that our clear strategy is working well and Halliburton strategic priorities are driving value. Let's get right to the highlights. Total company revenue increased 7% sequentially as both North America and international top line continued to improve. Operating income grew 17% with solid margin performance in both divisions.  Our Completion and Production division revenue increased 10%, driven by the strength in U.S. land completions. C&P delivered operating margin of 16% in the second quarter, reaching three-year highs.  Our Drilling and Evaluation division revenue grew 5%. Operating margin of 11% was about flat sequentially with rig count increases across multiple regions, offsetting a seasonal decline in software sales.  North America revenue grew 12% as both drilling and completions activity marched higher throughout the quarter. Increased utilization and our significant operating leverage supported sequential margin expansion.  International revenue grew 4% sequentially, with activity increasing in the key producing regions of the world despite COVID-19 disruptions in various countries.  Finally, we generated strong free cash flow this quarter, bringing the year-to-date free cash flow to almost $425 million.  I'm pleased with the solid performance we delivered in the first half of this transition year. While recent market volatility only demonstrates the fact that we remain in a transition year, today, I want to spend more time discussing what I believe will unfold over the next couple of years.  First, let me reaffirm the outlook for the rest of this year. In the second half of 2021, we expect activity momentum to continue. Internationally, we still anticipate a double-digit increase in activity compared to the second half of 2020 even as certain countries continue to face COVID disruptions.  With commodity prices remaining supportive, we believe activity in North America inches higher with drilling outpacing completions as operators build up well inventory for 2022.  Looking beyond this year, let me describe the longer-term outlook. We believe that we're in the early innings of a multi-year upcycle. For the first time in seven years, we anticipate simultaneous growth in international and North America markets, and this view guides our business objectives and expected outcomes.  So, here's how we see the macro industry environment playing out over the next couple of years. First, we believe commodity prices will remain structurally supportive. With both demand resurgence in many economies and increased vaccines availability, we anticipate the global demand will continue to exceed supply, particularly to the extent OPEC+ manages supply additions over the near-term. As OPEC+'s spare capacity returns to normalized levels over the next year, we believe sufficient pent-up global oil demand will support a call on both international and U.S. production.  Second, multiple years of underinvestment in the international markets, coupled with the anticipated oil and gas demand growth, give us confidence in a healthy international recovery. I believe the growth will be led by the national oil companies and focused on shorter cycle barrels. This activity should come with higher service intensity and higher relative capital spend around the wellbore as opposed to long cycle infrastructure investments.  We expect mature fields, both onshore and offshore, to attract the most investment, while large scale greenfield exploration will be limited to a few markets in Africa and Latin America. As a result, we anticipate double-digit annual international spending growth at least over the next couple of years.  Third, we believe that a supportive commodity price environment, normalized levels of spare OPEC+ capacity and high decline rates in U.S. shale are constructive for North American spending. We expect drilling and completion spending in North America will also grow double digits annually over the next two years, although activity will not return to pre-pandemic levels. We expect private operators to opportunistically lead the activity comeback, while public E&Ps balance growth and returns. Fourth, I believe equipment availability will tighten much faster than most people think. In multiple product lines, we believe that equipment supply will fall behind anticipated demand. Today, both drilling and completions equipment are nearing tightness in North America, and we expect to see international markets tighten over the next few quarters.  Given the scarcity of external capital sources, many North American service companies do not currently generate sufficient cash to organically fund investment in new equipment, innovation and maintenance, let alone generate sufficient returns. Internationally, multiple years of service company CapEx reductions should limit equipment availability.  We expect increasing demand and tightening equipment capacity will lead to higher prices. Pricing is beginning to return in North America now and is expected to lag internationally where contract durations are longer.  I know the positive macro outlook I just described as a case for the rising tide lifting all boats. However, what matters is how Halliburton is positioned to outperform in this market. The improving macro environment marks the first time in a long time that we see an increasing level of customer urgency and a pivot back to what creates value in our industry. And this reinforces the power of Halliburton's unique value proposition. Throughout the downturn, Halliburton doubled down on our value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. We continue to invest in technology, both digital and hardware, that maximizes value per barrel of production. We are expanding in new market segments. We are uniquely positioned in North America as the only integrated service company. Our collaborative culture and engineered solutions create sustainable competitive advantage, setting Halliburton up to move from value creation to value capture.  Here are a few examples of how Halliburton creates and captures value through our digital technologies. We're accelerating the deployment and integration of digital, both with our customers and internally. It creates technical differentiation, contributes to higher margins, and drives internal efficiencies.  Over the first six months of this year, we grew the total user count on our iEnergy public cloud by 70%, and cloud revenue now constitutes almost 20% of our overall software revenues. We believe that this shift from on-prem to cloud software solutions drives faster growth. It also allows us to expand our revenue base with the same customers as we add new cloud native applications and increase the number of users within the same operator.  Digital technology enables high value remote and autonomous operations. We see steady growth of our remote monitoring of open hole wireline operations. For example, this past quarter, we deployed virtual remote logging capabilities on a remote location in Continental Europe, utilizing a wellsite specialist in Norway to remotely operate downhole tools. Virtual remote logging allows us to place highly specialized personnel at regional hubs rather than in the field, which leads to better resource utilization, fewer personnel at the well site, less HSE exposure and higher margins. We also deployed digital and automation in our drilling operations across the globe, both on discrete and integrated contracts. Over 75% of our iCruise drilling system runs are fully automated today, and we expect all runs to have some automation by the end of this year. Across Europe and Eurasia, we increased the number of automated jobs fivefold since the beginning of this year. Drilling automation directly translates to top tier customer performance.  For example, over the last two years, it allowed us to improve the rates of penetration by approximately 25% on a Middle East lump sum turnkey project and on another integrated contract in the North Sea.  Moreover, digitalization and automation improved the resource efficiency of our own operations. In the second quarter, on an NOC project in Russia, we reduced rig site personnel by 40%. Separately, for an IOC in the Caspian, we captured cost efficiencies through using a remote operation center to monitor and control drilling jobs. Halliburton's differentiated drilling technologies penetrate the market and deliver results for our customers. Our multi-year investment in drilling technologies is paying off and we believe we are on the right path to outgrow the market as international drilling activity ramps up. Our drilling technologies deliver top quartile performance on discrete contracts and formed the core of our integrated project management offering.  This past quarter, on a challenging gas project on Russia's Yamal Peninsula, the Halliburton project management team drilled eight horizontal wells 36 days ahead of plan with zero HSE incidents. In close collaboration with our customer, we maximized drilling performance and accelerated the operator's production.  And lastly, we deployed digital solutions to optimize production. In the second quarter, we won a contract that highlights the enormous opportunity for digital adoption in the Middle East. After many years of collaboration with Halliburton on its digital transformation journey, Kuwait Oil Company expanded our automated production management contract in North Kuwait to all other assets in the country. KOC will use DecisionSpace 365, Halliburton's cloud-based subscription service for E&P applications to automate work processes and accurately plan, forecast and optimize production throughout KOC's portfolio. We're also expanding in new market segments. We expect to benefit from the significant growth potential of our specialty chemicals and artificial lift businesses, both in North America and internationally. As Halliburton increases participation in these new segments, we believe we will enjoy unique growth opportunities that are margin accretive and longer cycle.  I'm pleased to announce that, in the second quarter, Halliburton was awarded a seven-year production chemicals contract with a large IOC in Oman. Products for this new contract will be manufactured at Halliburton's new Saudi chemical reaction plant scheduled to open later this year. The strategic location of this plant will allow us to manufacture and sell specialty chemicals to other new customers throughout the region.  In North America, we recently expanded our footprint in the downstream process and water treatment chemicals business through awards of two separate five-year specialty chemicals contracts for large refiners on the Gulf Coast.  In our growing international artificial lift business, earlier this month, we completed the first installation of our ESP contract in Kuwait. We believe this contract gives us scale in the region that will allow us to profitably grow our artificial lift business in other key markets.  Finally, Halliburton has the broadest market exposure because we remain the only integrated service provider active in both North America and international markets. I believe this unique position allows us to capitalize on the double-digit growth, equipment tightness, and resulting better service pricing in both markets.  In the international markets, we expect that Halliburton's differentiated drilling equipment capacity tightens first. Over the next few quarters, as large tenders soak up capacity, I expect a return to the pre-pandemic environment when pricing improved in certain markets.  In North America, specific equipment categories are already tight today. There is a high demand for low emissions frac equipment and the supply is limited. Halliburton leads the market in low emission solutions today and that gives us a structural pricing advantage to further maximize value in North America.  Halliburton showcased our market-leading low emission solutions at a recent event in Duncan, Oklahoma. Over the course of five days, several hundred people from more than 40 operators came to see our electric and dual fuel equipment displays and operational demonstrations, including our 5,000 horsepower Zeus electric pumping unit, our new ExpressBlend blending system, eWinch electric wireline unit, the electric tech command center and an effective power generation solution. They didn't just see R&D plans and prototypes. Instead, they witnessed functional, job-ready equipment that works for our customers today and delivers unprecedented fracturing performance and reduced emissions. The Duncan event also showcased our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing system. SmartFleet marries our digital capabilities and fracturing expertise to do what was not possible until now \u2013 give customers control over fracturing performance in real time. It sets us apart from the rest of the hydraulic fracturing market and solidifies our industry leadership and intelligent fracturing. In the second quarter, we deployed it with two IOC customers in two different US basins with excellent results. Operators achieved more consistent fracturing placement on every stage with improved cluster uniformity and management of offset frac hits.  SmartFleet, paired with our premium low emissions equipment, creates a powerful combination of Halliburton's leading technologies to deliver superior production results, reduced environmental impact, and drive a strong margin differential for Halliburton.  We believe that our unique value proposition, combined with customer urgency and equipment tightness in the US and international markets, will improve pricing for our differentiated equipment and services. As our equipment reaches sustained levels of higher utilization in North America, we are now moving from passing on inflationary cost increases to setting net pricing higher, and we expect this trend to accelerate into 2022.  Internationally, pricing will take longer to catch up to North America and will first manifest itself on discrete contracts in underserved markets. We expect large tenders to remain competitive, but our strategic priority is clear \u2013 deliver profitable growth as the recovery unfolds. We expect improved pricing, higher utilization, and our significant operating leverage will deliver strong incrementals for Halliburton in this upcycle.  In the face of both current and expected demand increases, we remain focused on improved returns and capital efficiency and expect our overall capital investment to stay in the range of 5% to 6% of revenue.  Now, let's step back for a minute and think about what this means for Halliburton. My remarks often focus on the practical view of the near term. But I also have conviction about Halliburton's performance in the early innings of this upcycle. Based on the market assumptions outlined earlier, we expect revenue to grow at a mid-teens compound annual growth rate over the next two years. We also expect operating margins to expand by about 400 basis points by 2023 and thus return to 2014 margin levels.  We are committed to driving significant free cash flow and returns for our shareholders as this multi-year upcycle unfolds. This earnings power results from the execution of Halliburton's strategic priorities. I am confident that our focus on technology differentiation, digital adoption, and capital efficiency positions us for profitable growth internationally and maximizing value in North America.  Now, I will turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our second quarter financial results. Lance?\nLance Loeffler : Thank you, Jeff. And good morning. Let me begin with a summary of our second quarter results compared to the first quarter of 2021. Total company revenue for the quarter was $3.7 billion and operating income was $434 million, an increase of 7% and 17% respectively. Higher equipment utilization and our significant operating leverage supported these strong results as rig counts moved up globally in the second quarter.  Now, let me take a moment to discuss our division results in a little more detail. Starting with our Completion and Production division, revenue was $2 billion, an increase of 10%, while operating income was $317 million or an increase of 26%. These improvements were driven by higher activity across multiple product service lines in North America land, improved cementing activity in the Eastern Hemisphere and Latin America, increased completion tool sales in the Middle East, the North Sea and Latin America, as well as higher well intervention services in Saudi Arabia and Algeria. These improvements were partially offset by lower stimulation activity in Latin America.  In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $1.7 billion, an increase of 5%, while operating income was $175 million or an increase of 2%. These results were driven by improved drilling-related services and wireline activity across all regions, along with increased testing services in the Eastern Hemisphere. Partially offsetting these improvements were reduced software sales globally.  Moving on to our geographic results. In North America, revenue increased 12%, primarily driven by higher pressure pumping services, drilling related services and wireline activity in North America land, as well as higher well construction activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Partially offsetting these increases were reduced software sales across the region.  Turning to Latin America, revenue was flat sequentially, primarily driven by increased activity in multiple product service lines in Mexico, higher fluid services in Brazil, as well as additional completion tool sales in Guyana. These results were offset by lower stimulation activity in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil, decreased software sales across the region, and lower project management activity in Mexico and Ecuador.  In Europe, Africa, CIS, revenue increased 7%, resulting from increased activity across multiple product service lines in Russia, Norway, Algeria, and Ghana. These increases were partially offset by lower software sales across the region and lower activity in Nigeria.  In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue increased 5%, resulting from improved activity in multiple product service lines in Saudi Arabia, improved well intervention services across the region, increased drilling-related services in Oman, higher completion tool sales in Kuwait, improved well construction activity in Australia and increased pipeline services in China. These improvements were offset by lower software sales across the region, reduced project management activity in India and lower overall activity in Bangladesh.  In the second quarter, our corporate and other expenses totaled $58 million. For the third quarter, we expect our corporate expense to remain largely unchanged.  Net interest expense for the quarter was $120 million and should remain flat for the third quarter. We remain focused on reducing our leverage in the near term, and recently announced the redemption of our remaining 2021 senior notes at par ahead of schedule in August using cash on hand, which should reduce interest expense beyond the third quarter.  Our effective tax rate for the second quarter came in better than expected at approximately 22%, benefiting from several one-time discrete items. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our third quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 25%.  Capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately $190 million and will continue to ramp up for the remainder of the year. However, we will stay within our full-year target of 5% to 6% of revenue.  Turning to cash flow, we generated $409 million of cash from operations and $265 million of free cash flow during the second quarter. We believe that our year-to-date and expected earnings performance for the remainder of the year, combined with efficient working capital management, should result in a full-year free cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion. The growth and earnings outlook that Jeff laid out positions us well to grow our free cash flow over the next couple of years.  Now, let me turn to our near-term outlook. In the international markets, we expect a steady increase in activity as the rig counts continued to recover. In North America, we anticipate modest pricing improvement and continued activity momentum in both completions and drilling, but sequential activity growth will be slower than in prior quarters. As a result, for our Completion and Production division, we anticipate high single-digit revenue growth sequentially, with margins expected to modestly increase by 25 basis points to 50 basis points.  In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate sequential revenue growth of 3% to 5% due to continued rig count increases globally and a margin increase similar to that of our C&P division.  I will now turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff? \nJeff Miller : Thanks, Lance. Before I wrap up our discussion today, I want to thank our employees for their terrific execution on our value proposition, dedication to Halliburton, and excellent service delivery for our customers.  Now, let me summarize what we believe and expect will unfold. We're in the early innings of a multi-year upcycle. As oil demand exceeds supply, the macro environment will be constructive for both international and US markets. Halliburton's unique value proposition, integrated service portfolio and differentiated technologies position us to outperform in this market.  We have significant growth potential in new markets with our specialty chemicals and artificial lift businesses. Our technical differentiation allows us to disproportionately benefit from equipment capacity tightening across markets. Improved pricing, higher utilization, and our significant operating leverage will deliver strong incrementals for Halliburton in this upcycle.  We will continue to execute on our strategic priorities and remain committed to driving strong double-digit growth, margin expansion, significant free cash flow and returns for our shareholders as this multi-year upcycle unfolds.  And now, let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nJames West: Thanks. Good morning, John.\nJeff Miller: Good morning, James.\nLance Loeffler: Good morning, James.\nJames West: Jeff, you gave a great outline of what you see as this multi-year expansion for the business. And we certainly agree with what you're suggesting. How do your customers \u2013 when you're looking at the mosaic of all your different customers and all the different regions, are they aligned with kind of that view that it's time to get after it, we need to put some supply into the market and get going?\nJeff Miller: Look, I think what we're looking at today is the macro. When we talk to our customers, particularly publics, they're going to do exactly what they've said they're going to do, and I think we see that playing out. But we also have a good view of the macro in terms of supply and demand. And I think, from that perspective, the planet will demand oil. Where does it come from? Clearly, we've got line of sight to improving activity internationally. I describe that primarily with NOCs. And yes, I think that it's not zeal, it\u2019s steady march to produce more barrels. And then I think that the call back on the U.S. is simply going to be that \u2013 that underinvestment that we've seen for a number of years internationally, it doesn't just spring back into action. And I think that's very positive for North America. So, from a customer perspective, obviously, the privates are much more opportunistic around the supportive oil price. So, we see quite a bit of activity and outlook from them.\nJames West: Right, right. As then as we think about the returns on the assets that you are putting into the field, right now, we're probably at a sub-optimal type of return levels. So, you need prices to go up. And so, what are the levers? Or how quickly do you think pricing can move in this market to get back to what you need \u2013 would want to achieve to drive returns higher?\nJeff Miller: Well, James, it's a process and it's probably multiple iterations. But I think we're seeing net pricing to a certain degree today in the U.S. slow going, but moving. And as we work through into 2022, I expect that continues to accelerate.  Internationally, I think it takes on the same type of dynamics that we saw in 2019, where markets, individual markets see tightness, see pricing, large tenders remain very competitive. And from our perspective, that worked well for Halliburton in 2019 and into the first quarter of 2020.  And we've been very clear, I think, about profitable growth. And so, I think it's key when I think about growth internationally, the key words there being profitable growth. And so that means that \u2013 and we see multiple years of growth in front of us. And for that reason, want to be deliberate about how we put equipment to work and make money. \nJames West: Right. Right, got it. Thanks, Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Thank you, James.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is open.\nDavid Anderson: Hey, good morning, Jeff. Some clearly very bullish comments looking out over the next couple of years. I was wondering if you could talk about maybe some of the signs that you're seeing on the international side, particularly with the Middle East NOCs. Now, you've talked about increased completion tool sales, some artificial lift contracts and other tenders. Yesterday, Aramco suggests maybe shifting 6 billion more into upstream. I was just wondering when you start to see this inflect and when does it come through. We haven't yet seen the rig count pick up. Does 3Q guide indicate sort of a similar outpace of activity from second quarter? But at the same time, Middle East feels like it should be leading that double-digit growth \u2013 the double-digit guidance next year. I was wondering if you could just help me kind of understand that trajectory. Maybe it's obviously not a very opaque \u2013 or it's more of an opaque market. Just help us kind of see what you're seeing in that part of the world?\nJeff Miller: Yes. I mean, what we see is, let's say, broadly, Middle East adding activity, adding it sort of as we speak, but more so focused towards next year. So, I think that we see \u2013 well, I think second half to second half, we're going to be up probably mid double digits for 2021 versus 2020. So, where does that come from? I think that alone is increasing and we see that sort of across the Middle East. But we also see it in Argentina, as an example. We see it in other parts of the market. And so, I think that gets traction and continues to get traction as we go further into 2022. But the activities \u2013 the demand signs are there now that we're seeing, and I think we see growth. But I think that continues to accelerate as we get into 2022 and 2023. But it doesn't necessarily overcome all the underinvestment. So, I think that there's work to be done to grow that business for operators to grow production, I think we see signs of growth now. But I think it'll be more pronounced in 2022. And we\u2019ve described 2021 as a transition year. So, we still see COVID slowdowns in markets. There's a number of rigs that aren't working because they're not staffed today, not by us, but just in general. And so, that type of disruption is weighing down on things a bit. But I fully expect this to work through that through the balance of 2021.\nDavid Anderson: Okay, that\u2019s good to hear. Kind of a different topic. I just wanted to ask about kind of some of the inflation that maybe you're seeing on the North American side, particularly maybe if it impacted your C&P margins at all this quarter. I know you're not really seeing any net - real net pricing right now. But I'm just kind of curious what the E&Ps are seeing in terms of inflation. Are we talking like 5% these days? And sort of around that same question, wondering about labor. If we do see this increase next year in E&P budgets and assuming completion crews are added over the next 12 months, the industry doesn't really seem ready for that labor-wise. I'm just kind of curious how that inflation could kind of start working its way through. And obviously, that could lead to net pricing at some point. But maybe just talk about some of those components that you're seeing on the North America side, please?\nJeff Miller: Yes. I mean, I can speak to what we see in terms of inflation. And we saw inflation in many parts of our business, whether it's maintenance, in particular, cost, parts and people to do it. But we've also been able to pass that along. And in certain cases get \u2013 I think as we get through the second half of this year, we're seeing some net pricing now. And I think we'll see more of that more so as we go into 2022. But the ability to recover inflation is an important step also. In the range, is it 5% to 10%, 5%? It moves all around depending on the category. From a people perspective, we've been able to staff our equipment. We've got a very large footprint and have access to lots of people. And so, yeah, we have seen some attrition or turnover, but we've also been able to replace folks fairly efficiently.\nDavid Anderson: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America.\nChase Mulvehill: I guess first thing, really appreciate you guys kind of giving some visibility over your outlook for the next couple of years on kind of top line and margins. And kind of looking back, if we were to go back to kind of pre kind of 2014 levels and basically look at the prior decade, you sustained 20% plus EBITDA margins for basically a decade and that even includes the 2009 downturn. And so, you've given us guidance that EBITDA margins will get comfortably above 20% over the next couple of years. So, I guess two questions. Number one, when do you think we will get back to that 20% EBITDA mark? Are you comfortable that it's first half of next year, second half of next year? And then, once we get there, how sustainable is 20% EBITDA margins? We haven't been above 20% since before 2014. But how sustainable do you think the 20% EBITDA margins will be over the next cycle?\nJeff Miller: I think I've given you my outlook over the next couple of years. And so, over that period of time, we approach and then exceed those numbers that we got to in 2016. I think the most important part of this is the sustainability of that. And I feel like we see the strengthening macro and our unique competitive position in the marketplace very sustainable. I think we're back on to footing that we have to produce more, the things that we do to create value become more important. An example being the technology and our equipment in North America or our drilling technology, different elements of technology, whether it's digital or lift. But all of those things are what are so important in a market that requires more barrels, and that's what we see unfolding. And so, I think very sustainable. I've described it as the early innings. I think these are the early innings of at least a nine inning game to be played. And so, I really am convicted and excited about the outlook.\nChase Mulvehill: A quick follow-up. You've given us this couple year outlook. Obviously, that's going to lead to some pretty strong free cash flow. You're paying down the 2021 notes here. So, what's the plan for excess free cash flow as we kind of get into 2022 and leverage ratios get to more comfortable levels? Is it a dividend bump? Special dividends, buybacks, M&A, or just maybe just build cash on the balance sheet?\nLance Loeffler: You're right. In the near term, we're focused on trimming our debt levels. I think that that focus \u2013 good example of that focus is what we plan to do this month or early next, actually, with the $500 million maturity that we have coming due, paying it down with cash. Look, I think we're getting to a point where we're continuing to strive to cut our debt levels and get back to that 2 times debt to EBITDA leverage ratio that we've talked about before. But I think we are getting to a point where we intend to return more cash to shareholders, whether in the form of a dividend or share repurchase, not willing to commit to that at this point. But it's certainly something that we think is an and type scenario. So, we continue to trim our level of debt and improve the level of cash that we send back to shareholders.\nOperator: Next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. \nScott Gruber: I wanted to get some more color on the encouraging pricing trends here in North America. Is the net pricing that you're garnering, is that going to impact margins much in the second half? I ask because when you look at the 3Q guide, the embedded incrementals look to be kind of on the order of 20-ish-percent. And I would just think it'd be something greater than that if it's really having a big impact. Is there just a time lag here? Are there other offsets, maybe on equipment sales? Or do we just really need to see a little bit more activity growth to see pricing take a bigger leg higher into 2022?\nJeff Miller: Yeah. As I said, it's not across the board. It is a process, but we are seeing net pricing in certain pockets and certain things today, and I expect that that accelerates, as I said, into 2022. But, clearly, with frac ESG friendly equipment that is in very short supply, we have a leading position in dual fuel electric, tier 4 also. And so, in all those categories, that's what the market demands and that's an \u2013 structurally, because of our large footprint there, we have a structurally differentiated position, but that equipment isn't everywhere and that equipment is some under contract, some is not under \u2013 it's moving. I think what's important at this point is that we're negotiating up and not down, and that's sort of a different dialogue than what we've had. And that's what we're seeing today. So, do you see all of that in Q3? Absolutely not. But what you do is you see us on a journey now that's different than the one that we've been on. And that's where we are.\nScott Gruber: Turning to the digital contract wins, which are great to see, couple of questions there on the impact on margins. First, just so we can dimension it. Do the digital revenues and margin also flow through D&E? Or when you have Completion and Production [indiscernible], does some of it hit C&P? More importantly, how do we think about the real timing and magnitude of the benefit to margins? Is there much of a benefit during the second half through the initial deployment and scaling up in places like Kuwait? Or is it more to come in 2022 and 2023? Particularly for D&E, it's been a segment where you guys have been pushing to structurally lift margins over the last couple of years. How do the digital wins in the digitization of the industry and Halliburton's participation really push where the D&E margin could go on a more normalized basis as we get deep into recovery?\nJeff Miller: When we think about digital, digital margin impact is across the business. Obviously, the software sales and the cloud native apps are in D&E. But more broadly, digital capability affects the whole business. And so, that's behind our [indiscernible] products, so tools like EarthStar and our SmartFleet, all of those are a byproduct of having digital capability in the company. In fact, the capacity to develop software at scale is pretty unique. And that is what allows that to happen.  The third way we consume software, and this has an impact also on the entire business, is the ability to consume the solutions ourselves and reduce our own costs. So, I would argue a large part of our ability to, for example, last year, reduce the roofline by 50% was rooted in our ability to do things digitally that remove many steps and change the processes and took people out. That's why I'm careful how we describe that.  I think that, clearly, it's a contribution to D&E. But I would say that the contracts we've described are all good contracts, but you ramp up \u2013 it might ramp up, they get started. It's a consultative process. And so, I would expect later this year or really more so into 2022 and beyond. I think these build one on top of another and become very sustainable over time, less of a sort of pop all at once, but sort of building into larger projects over time. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ian Macpherson with Piper Sandler.\nIan Macpherson: The one question that I had, Jeff, is when you look at double-digit trajectory for synchronized expansion for North America and international, just given the strong command that OPEC+ has over the oil market over the intermediate term, what type of call on US production growth are Ae you contemplating which underpins your North American outlook for the next couple of years?\nJeff Miller: We think that some of what we've seen over the last couple of days, I think, lays out a path for OPEC. And so, that's, to a certain degree, defined. If we look at pent up demand for oil at least today \u2013 if we look up the pent up demand that we see for oil today, we're at 98 million barrels a day now, the economy feels more than 2 million barrels shut in, to me. In fact, it's probably 4 million barrels consumed in aviation alone. So, I think there's a normalized level of spare capacity that's expected. So then when we think, okay, North America, what happens there? Well, we're up 10% year-on-year. And I think the expectation is that production is largely flat for this year. I would expect that there would be a call of \u2013 is it 500,000 barrels, some number like that? Some level of growth that would be called on in 2022. That, the price clearly supports, which would then drive more activity for us, certainly, and we have \u2013 in that mix is stemming the decline curve that is always working on North America production. So, those are the things that underpin our outlook.\nIan Macpherson: And then, staying on the domestic pressure pumping side, we're obviously beginning to see some of the smaller competitors announce firm plans and sort of abstract plans for renewing their fleets with clean fleet, but different iterations of it. In your view, is that coming earlier than you would like to see it? Or do you think that the market is ready to support the pricing and the returns for that equipment at the scale that we've already seen over the last few months? And should we expect Halliburton within your 5% to 6% CapEx and below to march along at that same industry cadence with new clean fleet investment?\nJeff Miller: Well, if we always look at our \u2013 we're fortunate today that we have one of the youngest fleets in the market. And as we replace equipment, we also have a large fleet. And so, as we systematically replace equipment, we have a choice to make. So, what type of equipment do we replace it with? And it's a combination, generally, of electric or dual fuel. But I think that our steady drumbeat of replacements and within our 5% to 6% of capital spend, we're able to meet demand and also at terms that are adequate. I think those two things have to be in place. Fortunately, we're in a position where we are able to deliver those things today. I say today, but today and over the near term from operations. Remains to be seen the pace at which all of that can happen in the market, given where sort of broadly that market stands today in terms of returns. So, without the returns, it's not \u2013 we wouldn't be investing in these types of equipment at all. Fortunately, we're in a position to do so and do it ratably along with our sort of planned replacement cycle.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: Congrats on a good quarter here. I have a really high level question. It's been a tough 10 years for the energy sector, but it's been an even tougher period of time for oil services relative to the rest of energy. Jeff, as a leader of this industry, what do you think the key is to attract the generalist investor back into this vertical within the space? Do you think it's about earnings execution? Is it about returns on capital? Or is it about returning excess capital to shareholders, so return of capital?\nJeff Miller: It has to be all three of those. But I think it starts with some clarity around what is the trajectory over time that's sustainable as opposed to all of the ups and downs that we seem to have had sort of intra-period gyrations. And I think what's shaping up today, as I've described it, is a more sort of predictable, sustainable trajectory. And that's what we see out over the next couple of years and really beyond that, just because I think we've been through a lot of the over-capitalization. There's been under investment for a long enough period of time, particularly in the resource that, as demand recovers, which it will recover, I think there's a solid opportunity set for our services.  Now, within that, obviously, I have a view that \u2013 and believe firmly that our competitive positioning is different also. And because of that, Halliburton has tools, whether it's our value proposition, our technology or sort of our portfolio and how it's placed to maximize value in North America, which we've always been clear on. We want to maximize value in North America and grow profitably internationally. And I think both those macros are set up perfectly for doing that. And so, as a generalist, there's some clarity around where we're going. We've got some track record of where we've been, where we're going. And I think that sets up well for a generalist investor. \nNeil Mehta: The follow-up on that on on return of capital, if you look at the energy sector, S&P energy sector, it trades at a 4.5% dividend yield. How do you think about Halliburton's value proposition on a multi-year basis around return of capital, whether it's through dividends or through buybacks? Do you ultimately need to be offering a total return of capital yield that's far in excess to the market, given the questions about the terminal value of the business? \nLance Loeffler: Neil, I think it's a great question. And I think that we're going to continue to reevaluate what it means for us in the near term as we continue to grow into this recovery. We certainly believe that we need to improve those yields today on a dividend basis. But we're going to continue to look at and get comfortable with the forward free cash flow profile, what we think that this business, we believe, can generate in these out years that Jeff discussed. But, clearly, we believe it requires improvement from where we are today. \nJeff Miller: Maybe one follow on to that, Neil. Strategically, we have changed the cash flow profile of our business, and that is the shift from 10%, 11% of revenues going into capital down to the 5% to 6%. But what that does is that sets Halliburton up to do those things. And so, I think it's our view and the change in our cash flow profile certainly aid that process.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Aaron JR [ph] with J.P. Morgan.\nUnidentified Participant: My first question relates to just the activity mix in the US. The privates have added more than 70% of the incremental rigs since the activity bottomed mid last year. I guess my first question is, what is your expectation around, call it, the mix of public company activity next year once some of the OPEC barrels are returned? And do you think that a higher mix of public company activity is \u2013 are you indifferent about that? Or do you think it's helpful to your revenue growth and margin opportunities relative to industry next year? \nJeff Miller: I think we will always look for the best return opportunity for us. I'd say operators have not said anything about next year, and I'm not going to project what they might say. I think I have \u2013 we can see what the demand sort of looks like to us as we look out into next year. But I also think that every operator will make their own decisions around how they deploy their capital. And overall, a supportive commodity price, which we see creates headroom for our clients to do work and return cash to their shareholders, which is important for them to do. So, I think the improving commodity price and the structural sort of support that we will see in the commodity price makes all of that work as we go into 2022. \nNeil Mehta: Just my follow-up. We had a dynamic, particularly in the US, where budget exhaustion has led to some frac holidays which has obviously been a headwind. How is Halliburton looking to mitigate that risk as we approach the back half and the fourth quarter kind of given that dynamic?\nJeff Miller: I think operators are going to do exactly what they said they would do. And we really haven't seen budget exhaustion, to this point haven't talked about it. And I think that is because operators are ratably doing exactly what they said they were going to do. So, I don't anticipate that we see any of that or much of that this year. And I'd say the other thing that we've done a lot of work to variabilize our business, such that when we see slowdowns or holds or anything else, we're able to respond to it very, very quickly as opposed to how we might have done it in the past. And that all is process change and really philosophy change, but it's working quite well. I think we'll have a solid sort of working through the balance of the year just because of the clarity that our clients have and are providing to us. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley.\nConnor Lynagh: I wanted to return to the multi-year outlook you guys gave. And basically, what I'm wondering is, certainly, I know you want to stick to the ranges you put out there for capital expenditures, but I would assume there's a certain degree of growth investment required to realize that. So, I was wondering if you could discuss just where you plan on allocating capital, what some of the big areas that you think are sort of priorities within the business over the next couple years here?\nJeff Miller: I think that as we look out, I believe that we've got the opportunity to meet those expectations within the guidance that we've provided with respect to CapEx. I think there is growth CapEx in that sort of 5% to 6% range that we've provided. For example, if I look back over the last five years, asset turns have improved by 50%. That's strong improvement. But this is back to my commentary around strategically approaching capital efficiency. So, as we're very sharp around our R&D dollars, drive capital efficiency, our process drives capital efficiency, and those are the kind of results we see in terms of capital efficiency. And so, we will continue to drive that as the market expands over the next couple of years. And really, strategically, that becomes our operating process. And I expect we'll continue to do that.\nConnor Lynagh: Sort of similar question here. But just in terms of thinking about \u2013 particularly your labor pool, and I guess, your overhead in international markets, so certainly, you've right-sized in select areas, but you're anticipating a pretty big recovery here. I guess I'm just curious, it seems like in the outlook there's an acceleration in incremental margins as you get out into some of the later years. Is that because you have sort of excess labor that's going to be more highly utilized, is that because of the pricing that you're anticipating. Just curious what the what the big drivers are of that improvement in incremental margins?\nLance Loeffler: Look, Connor, I think it's less about cost savings structurally. I think it's more about volume of activity combined with price. So, it's volume, utilization and pricing improvement throughout the course of that journey that Jeff sort of outlined. \nJeff Miller: We're always working on costs. We've got a continuous improvement program where we're constantly driving, managing costs down. And I believe that that program and our approach to that is adequate. As we grow, we will manage the cost. But clearly, we expect to see tightness in pricing and more activity over time that all drives incrementals. \nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Jeff Miller for closing remarks. \nJeff Miller: Before we end the call, let me close with this. We are in the early innings of an unfolding multi-year upcycle that presents growth opportunities for Halliburton internationally and in North America. Those opportunities match Halliburton's unique customer-focused value proposition and our position as the only fully integrated energy services company in both international and North American markets. As this unfolds, we remain committed to driving returns and free cash flow for Halliburton shareholders. I'm optimistic about what lies ahead and look forward to speaking with you next quarter.  Shannon, please close out the call. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeff Miller",
            "content": "Thank you, Abu, and good morning, everyone. Our performance in the second quarter demonstrates that our clear strategy is working well and Halliburton strategic priorities are driving value. Let's get right to the highlights. Total company revenue increased 7% sequentially as both North America and international top line continued to improve. Operating income grew 17% with solid margin performance in both divisions.  Our Completion and Production division revenue increased 10%, driven by the strength in U.S. land completions. C&P delivered operating margin of 16% in the second quarter, reaching three-year highs.  Our Drilling and Evaluation division revenue grew 5%. Operating margin of 11% was about flat sequentially with rig count increases across multiple regions, offsetting a seasonal decline in software sales.  North America revenue grew 12% as both drilling and completions activity marched higher throughout the quarter. Increased utilization and our significant operating leverage supported sequential margin expansion.  International revenue grew 4% sequentially, with activity increasing in the key producing regions of the world despite COVID-19 disruptions in various countries.  Finally, we generated strong free cash flow this quarter, bringing the year-to-date free cash flow to almost $425 million.  I'm pleased with the solid performance we delivered in the first half of this transition year. While recent market volatility only demonstrates the fact that we remain in a transition year, today, I want to spend more time discussing what I believe will unfold over the next couple of years.  First, let me reaffirm the outlook for the rest of this year. In the second half of 2021, we expect activity momentum to continue. Internationally, we still anticipate a double-digit increase in activity compared to the second half of 2020 even as certain countries continue to face COVID disruptions.  With commodity prices remaining supportive, we believe activity in North America inches higher with drilling outpacing completions as operators build up well inventory for 2022.  Looking beyond this year, let me describe the longer-term outlook. We believe that we're in the early innings of a multi-year upcycle. For the first time in seven years, we anticipate simultaneous growth in international and North America markets, and this view guides our business objectives and expected outcomes.  So, here's how we see the macro industry environment playing out over the next couple of years. First, we believe commodity prices will remain structurally supportive. With both demand resurgence in many economies and increased vaccines availability, we anticipate the global demand will continue to exceed supply, particularly to the extent OPEC+ manages supply additions over the near-term. As OPEC+'s spare capacity returns to normalized levels over the next year, we believe sufficient pent-up global oil demand will support a call on both international and U.S. production.  Second, multiple years of underinvestment in the international markets, coupled with the anticipated oil and gas demand growth, give us confidence in a healthy international recovery. I believe the growth will be led by the national oil companies and focused on shorter cycle barrels. This activity should come with higher service intensity and higher relative capital spend around the wellbore as opposed to long cycle infrastructure investments.  We expect mature fields, both onshore and offshore, to attract the most investment, while large scale greenfield exploration will be limited to a few markets in Africa and Latin America. As a result, we anticipate double-digit annual international spending growth at least over the next couple of years.  Third, we believe that a supportive commodity price environment, normalized levels of spare OPEC+ capacity and high decline rates in U.S. shale are constructive for North American spending. We expect drilling and completion spending in North America will also grow double digits annually over the next two years, although activity will not return to pre-pandemic levels. We expect private operators to opportunistically lead the activity comeback, while public E&Ps balance growth and returns. Fourth, I believe equipment availability will tighten much faster than most people think. In multiple product lines, we believe that equipment supply will fall behind anticipated demand. Today, both drilling and completions equipment are nearing tightness in North America, and we expect to see international markets tighten over the next few quarters.  Given the scarcity of external capital sources, many North American service companies do not currently generate sufficient cash to organically fund investment in new equipment, innovation and maintenance, let alone generate sufficient returns. Internationally, multiple years of service company CapEx reductions should limit equipment availability.  We expect increasing demand and tightening equipment capacity will lead to higher prices. Pricing is beginning to return in North America now and is expected to lag internationally where contract durations are longer.  I know the positive macro outlook I just described as a case for the rising tide lifting all boats. However, what matters is how Halliburton is positioned to outperform in this market. The improving macro environment marks the first time in a long time that we see an increasing level of customer urgency and a pivot back to what creates value in our industry. And this reinforces the power of Halliburton's unique value proposition. Throughout the downturn, Halliburton doubled down on our value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. We continue to invest in technology, both digital and hardware, that maximizes value per barrel of production. We are expanding in new market segments. We are uniquely positioned in North America as the only integrated service company. Our collaborative culture and engineered solutions create sustainable competitive advantage, setting Halliburton up to move from value creation to value capture.  Here are a few examples of how Halliburton creates and captures value through our digital technologies. We're accelerating the deployment and integration of digital, both with our customers and internally. It creates technical differentiation, contributes to higher margins, and drives internal efficiencies.  Over the first six months of this year, we grew the total user count on our iEnergy public cloud by 70%, and cloud revenue now constitutes almost 20% of our overall software revenues. We believe that this shift from on-prem to cloud software solutions drives faster growth. It also allows us to expand our revenue base with the same customers as we add new cloud native applications and increase the number of users within the same operator.  Digital technology enables high value remote and autonomous operations. We see steady growth of our remote monitoring of open hole wireline operations. For example, this past quarter, we deployed virtual remote logging capabilities on a remote location in Continental Europe, utilizing a wellsite specialist in Norway to remotely operate downhole tools. Virtual remote logging allows us to place highly specialized personnel at regional hubs rather than in the field, which leads to better resource utilization, fewer personnel at the well site, less HSE exposure and higher margins. We also deployed digital and automation in our drilling operations across the globe, both on discrete and integrated contracts. Over 75% of our iCruise drilling system runs are fully automated today, and we expect all runs to have some automation by the end of this year. Across Europe and Eurasia, we increased the number of automated jobs fivefold since the beginning of this year. Drilling automation directly translates to top tier customer performance.  For example, over the last two years, it allowed us to improve the rates of penetration by approximately 25% on a Middle East lump sum turnkey project and on another integrated contract in the North Sea.  Moreover, digitalization and automation improved the resource efficiency of our own operations. In the second quarter, on an NOC project in Russia, we reduced rig site personnel by 40%. Separately, for an IOC in the Caspian, we captured cost efficiencies through using a remote operation center to monitor and control drilling jobs. Halliburton's differentiated drilling technologies penetrate the market and deliver results for our customers. Our multi-year investment in drilling technologies is paying off and we believe we are on the right path to outgrow the market as international drilling activity ramps up. Our drilling technologies deliver top quartile performance on discrete contracts and formed the core of our integrated project management offering.  This past quarter, on a challenging gas project on Russia's Yamal Peninsula, the Halliburton project management team drilled eight horizontal wells 36 days ahead of plan with zero HSE incidents. In close collaboration with our customer, we maximized drilling performance and accelerated the operator's production.  And lastly, we deployed digital solutions to optimize production. In the second quarter, we won a contract that highlights the enormous opportunity for digital adoption in the Middle East. After many years of collaboration with Halliburton on its digital transformation journey, Kuwait Oil Company expanded our automated production management contract in North Kuwait to all other assets in the country. KOC will use DecisionSpace 365, Halliburton's cloud-based subscription service for E&P applications to automate work processes and accurately plan, forecast and optimize production throughout KOC's portfolio. We're also expanding in new market segments. We expect to benefit from the significant growth potential of our specialty chemicals and artificial lift businesses, both in North America and internationally. As Halliburton increases participation in these new segments, we believe we will enjoy unique growth opportunities that are margin accretive and longer cycle.  I'm pleased to announce that, in the second quarter, Halliburton was awarded a seven-year production chemicals contract with a large IOC in Oman. Products for this new contract will be manufactured at Halliburton's new Saudi chemical reaction plant scheduled to open later this year. The strategic location of this plant will allow us to manufacture and sell specialty chemicals to other new customers throughout the region.  In North America, we recently expanded our footprint in the downstream process and water treatment chemicals business through awards of two separate five-year specialty chemicals contracts for large refiners on the Gulf Coast.  In our growing international artificial lift business, earlier this month, we completed the first installation of our ESP contract in Kuwait. We believe this contract gives us scale in the region that will allow us to profitably grow our artificial lift business in other key markets.  Finally, Halliburton has the broadest market exposure because we remain the only integrated service provider active in both North America and international markets. I believe this unique position allows us to capitalize on the double-digit growth, equipment tightness, and resulting better service pricing in both markets.  In the international markets, we expect that Halliburton's differentiated drilling equipment capacity tightens first. Over the next few quarters, as large tenders soak up capacity, I expect a return to the pre-pandemic environment when pricing improved in certain markets.  In North America, specific equipment categories are already tight today. There is a high demand for low emissions frac equipment and the supply is limited. Halliburton leads the market in low emission solutions today and that gives us a structural pricing advantage to further maximize value in North America.  Halliburton showcased our market-leading low emission solutions at a recent event in Duncan, Oklahoma. Over the course of five days, several hundred people from more than 40 operators came to see our electric and dual fuel equipment displays and operational demonstrations, including our 5,000 horsepower Zeus electric pumping unit, our new ExpressBlend blending system, eWinch electric wireline unit, the electric tech command center and an effective power generation solution. They didn't just see R&D plans and prototypes. Instead, they witnessed functional, job-ready equipment that works for our customers today and delivers unprecedented fracturing performance and reduced emissions. The Duncan event also showcased our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing system. SmartFleet marries our digital capabilities and fracturing expertise to do what was not possible until now \u2013 give customers control over fracturing performance in real time. It sets us apart from the rest of the hydraulic fracturing market and solidifies our industry leadership and intelligent fracturing. In the second quarter, we deployed it with two IOC customers in two different US basins with excellent results. Operators achieved more consistent fracturing placement on every stage with improved cluster uniformity and management of offset frac hits.  SmartFleet, paired with our premium low emissions equipment, creates a powerful combination of Halliburton's leading technologies to deliver superior production results, reduced environmental impact, and drive a strong margin differential for Halliburton.  We believe that our unique value proposition, combined with customer urgency and equipment tightness in the US and international markets, will improve pricing for our differentiated equipment and services. As our equipment reaches sustained levels of higher utilization in North America, we are now moving from passing on inflationary cost increases to setting net pricing higher, and we expect this trend to accelerate into 2022.  Internationally, pricing will take longer to catch up to North America and will first manifest itself on discrete contracts in underserved markets. We expect large tenders to remain competitive, but our strategic priority is clear \u2013 deliver profitable growth as the recovery unfolds. We expect improved pricing, higher utilization, and our significant operating leverage will deliver strong incrementals for Halliburton in this upcycle.  In the face of both current and expected demand increases, we remain focused on improved returns and capital efficiency and expect our overall capital investment to stay in the range of 5% to 6% of revenue.  Now, let's step back for a minute and think about what this means for Halliburton. My remarks often focus on the practical view of the near term. But I also have conviction about Halliburton's performance in the early innings of this upcycle. Based on the market assumptions outlined earlier, we expect revenue to grow at a mid-teens compound annual growth rate over the next two years. We also expect operating margins to expand by about 400 basis points by 2023 and thus return to 2014 margin levels.  We are committed to driving significant free cash flow and returns for our shareholders as this multi-year upcycle unfolds. This earnings power results from the execution of Halliburton's strategic priorities. I am confident that our focus on technology differentiation, digital adoption, and capital efficiency positions us for profitable growth internationally and maximizing value in North America.  Now, I will turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our second quarter financial results. Lance? Thanks, Lance. Before I wrap up our discussion today, I want to thank our employees for their terrific execution on our value proposition, dedication to Halliburton, and excellent service delivery for our customers.  Now, let me summarize what we believe and expect will unfold. We're in the early innings of a multi-year upcycle. As oil demand exceeds supply, the macro environment will be constructive for both international and US markets. Halliburton's unique value proposition, integrated service portfolio and differentiated technologies position us to outperform in this market.  We have significant growth potential in new markets with our specialty chemicals and artificial lift businesses. Our technical differentiation allows us to disproportionately benefit from equipment capacity tightening across markets. Improved pricing, higher utilization, and our significant operating leverage will deliver strong incrementals for Halliburton in this upcycle.  We will continue to execute on our strategic priorities and remain committed to driving strong double-digit growth, margin expansion, significant free cash flow and returns for our shareholders as this multi-year upcycle unfolds.  And now, let's open it up for questions. Good morning, James. Look, I think what we're looking at today is the macro. When we talk to our customers, particularly publics, they're going to do exactly what they've said they're going to do, and I think we see that playing out. But we also have a good view of the macro in terms of supply and demand. And I think, from that perspective, the planet will demand oil. Where does it come from? Clearly, we've got line of sight to improving activity internationally. I describe that primarily with NOCs. And yes, I think that it's not zeal, it's steady march to produce more barrels. And then I think that the call back on the U.S. is simply going to be that \u2013 that underinvestment that we've seen for a number of years internationally, it doesn't just spring back into action. And I think that's very positive for North America. So, from a customer perspective, obviously, the privates are much more opportunistic around the supportive oil price. So, we see quite a bit of activity and outlook from them. Well, James, it's a process and it's probably multiple iterations. But I think we're seeing net pricing to a certain degree today in the U.S. slow going, but moving. And as we work through into 2022, I expect that continues to accelerate.  Internationally, I think it takes on the same type of dynamics that we saw in 2019, where markets, individual markets see tightness, see pricing, large tenders remain very competitive. And from our perspective, that worked well for Halliburton in 2019 and into the first quarter of 2020.  And we've been very clear, I think, about profitable growth. And so, I think it's key when I think about growth internationally, the key words there being profitable growth. And so that means that \u2013 and we see multiple years of growth in front of us. And for that reason, want to be deliberate about how we put equipment to work and make money. Thank you, James. Yes. I mean, what we see is, let's say, broadly, Middle East adding activity, adding it sort of as we speak, but more so focused towards next year. So, I think that we see \u2013 well, I think second half to second half, we're going to be up probably mid double digits for 2021 versus 2020. So, where does that come from? I think that alone is increasing and we see that sort of across the Middle East. But we also see it in Argentina, as an example. We see it in other parts of the market. And so, I think that gets traction and continues to get traction as we go further into 2022. But the activities \u2013 the demand signs are there now that we're seeing, and I think we see growth. But I think that continues to accelerate as we get into 2022 and 2023. But it doesn't necessarily overcome all the underinvestment. So, I think that there's work to be done to grow that business for operators to grow production, I think we see signs of growth now. But I think it'll be more pronounced in 2022. And we've described 2021 as a transition year. So, we still see COVID slowdowns in markets. There's a number of rigs that aren't working because they're not staffed today, not by us, but just in general. And so, that type of disruption is weighing down on things a bit. But I fully expect this to work through that through the balance of 2021. Yes. I mean, I can speak to what we see in terms of inflation. And we saw inflation in many parts of our business, whether it's maintenance, in particular, cost, parts and people to do it. But we've also been able to pass that along. And in certain cases get \u2013 I think as we get through the second half of this year, we're seeing some net pricing now. And I think we'll see more of that more so as we go into 2022. But the ability to recover inflation is an important step also. In the range, is it 5% to 10%, 5%? It moves all around depending on the category. From a people perspective, we've been able to staff our equipment. We've got a very large footprint and have access to lots of people. And so, yeah, we have seen some attrition or turnover, but we've also been able to replace folks fairly efficiently. I think I've given you my outlook over the next couple of years. And so, over that period of time, we approach and then exceed those numbers that we got to in 2016. I think the most important part of this is the sustainability of that. And I feel like we see the strengthening macro and our unique competitive position in the marketplace very sustainable. I think we're back on to footing that we have to produce more, the things that we do to create value become more important. An example being the technology and our equipment in North America or our drilling technology, different elements of technology, whether it's digital or lift. But all of those things are what are so important in a market that requires more barrels, and that's what we see unfolding. And so, I think very sustainable. I've described it as the early innings. I think these are the early innings of at least a nine inning game to be played. And so, I really am convicted and excited about the outlook. Yeah. As I said, it's not across the board. It is a process, but we are seeing net pricing in certain pockets and certain things today, and I expect that that accelerates, as I said, into 2022. But, clearly, with frac ESG friendly equipment that is in very short supply, we have a leading position in dual fuel electric, tier 4 also. And so, in all those categories, that's what the market demands and that's an \u2013 structurally, because of our large footprint there, we have a structurally differentiated position, but that equipment isn't everywhere and that equipment is some under contract, some is not under \u2013 it's moving. I think what's important at this point is that we're negotiating up and not down, and that's sort of a different dialogue than what we've had. And that's what we're seeing today. So, do you see all of that in Q3? Absolutely not. But what you do is you see us on a journey now that's different than the one that we've been on. And that's where we are. When we think about digital, digital margin impact is across the business. Obviously, the software sales and the cloud native apps are in D&E. But more broadly, digital capability affects the whole business. And so, that's behind our [indiscernible] products, so tools like EarthStar and our SmartFleet, all of those are a byproduct of having digital capability in the company. In fact, the capacity to develop software at scale is pretty unique. And that is what allows that to happen.  The third way we consume software, and this has an impact also on the entire business, is the ability to consume the solutions ourselves and reduce our own costs. So, I would argue a large part of our ability to, for example, last year, reduce the roofline by 50% was rooted in our ability to do things digitally that remove many steps and change the processes and took people out. That's why I'm careful how we describe that.  I think that, clearly, it's a contribution to D&E. But I would say that the contracts we've described are all good contracts, but you ramp up \u2013 it might ramp up, they get started. It's a consultative process. And so, I would expect later this year or really more so into 2022 and beyond. I think these build one on top of another and become very sustainable over time, less of a sort of pop all at once, but sort of building into larger projects over time. We think that some of what we've seen over the last couple of days, I think, lays out a path for OPEC. And so, that's, to a certain degree, defined. If we look at pent up demand for oil at least today \u2013 if we look up the pent up demand that we see for oil today, we're at 98 million barrels a day now, the economy feels more than 2 million barrels shut in, to me. In fact, it's probably 4 million barrels consumed in aviation alone. So, I think there's a normalized level of spare capacity that's expected. So then when we think, okay, North America, what happens there? Well, we're up 10% year-on-year. And I think the expectation is that production is largely flat for this year. I would expect that there would be a call of \u2013 is it 500,000 barrels, some number like that? Some level of growth that would be called on in 2022. That, the price clearly supports, which would then drive more activity for us, certainly, and we have \u2013 in that mix is stemming the decline curve that is always working on North America production. So, those are the things that underpin our outlook. Well, if we always look at our \u2013 we're fortunate today that we have one of the youngest fleets in the market. And as we replace equipment, we also have a large fleet. And so, as we systematically replace equipment, we have a choice to make. So, what type of equipment do we replace it with? And it's a combination, generally, of electric or dual fuel. But I think that our steady drumbeat of replacements and within our 5% to 6% of capital spend, we're able to meet demand and also at terms that are adequate. I think those two things have to be in place. Fortunately, we're in a position where we are able to deliver those things today. I say today, but today and over the near term from operations. Remains to be seen the pace at which all of that can happen in the market, given where sort of broadly that market stands today in terms of returns. So, without the returns, it's not \u2013 we wouldn't be investing in these types of equipment at all. Fortunately, we're in a position to do so and do it ratably along with our sort of planned replacement cycle. It has to be all three of those. But I think it starts with some clarity around what is the trajectory over time that's sustainable as opposed to all of the ups and downs that we seem to have had sort of intra-period gyrations. And I think what's shaping up today, as I've described it, is a more sort of predictable, sustainable trajectory. And that's what we see out over the next couple of years and really beyond that, just because I think we've been through a lot of the over-capitalization. There's been under investment for a long enough period of time, particularly in the resource that, as demand recovers, which it will recover, I think there's a solid opportunity set for our services.  Now, within that, obviously, I have a view that \u2013 and believe firmly that our competitive positioning is different also. And because of that, Halliburton has tools, whether it's our value proposition, our technology or sort of our portfolio and how it's placed to maximize value in North America, which we've always been clear on. We want to maximize value in North America and grow profitably internationally. And I think both those macros are set up perfectly for doing that. And so, as a generalist, there's some clarity around where we're going. We've got some track record of where we've been, where we're going. And I think that sets up well for a generalist investor. Maybe one follow on to that, Neil. Strategically, we have changed the cash flow profile of our business, and that is the shift from 10%, 11% of revenues going into capital down to the 5% to 6%. But what that does is that sets Halliburton up to do those things. And so, I think it's our view and the change in our cash flow profile certainly aid that process. I think we will always look for the best return opportunity for us. I'd say operators have not said anything about next year, and I'm not going to project what they might say. I think I have \u2013 we can see what the demand sort of looks like to us as we look out into next year. But I also think that every operator will make their own decisions around how they deploy their capital. And overall, a supportive commodity price, which we see creates headroom for our clients to do work and return cash to their shareholders, which is important for them to do. So, I think the improving commodity price and the structural sort of support that we will see in the commodity price makes all of that work as we go into 2022. I think operators are going to do exactly what they said they would do. And we really haven't seen budget exhaustion, to this point haven't talked about it. And I think that is because operators are ratably doing exactly what they said they were going to do. So, I don't anticipate that we see any of that or much of that this year. And I'd say the other thing that we've done a lot of work to variabilize our business, such that when we see slowdowns or holds or anything else, we're able to respond to it very, very quickly as opposed to how we might have done it in the past. And that all is process change and really philosophy change, but it's working quite well. I think we'll have a solid sort of working through the balance of the year just because of the clarity that our clients have and are providing to us. I think that as we look out, I believe that we've got the opportunity to meet those expectations within the guidance that we've provided with respect to CapEx. I think there is growth CapEx in that sort of 5% to 6% range that we've provided. For example, if I look back over the last five years, asset turns have improved by 50%. That's strong improvement. But this is back to my commentary around strategically approaching capital efficiency. So, as we're very sharp around our R&D dollars, drive capital efficiency, our process drives capital efficiency, and those are the kind of results we see in terms of capital efficiency. And so, we will continue to drive that as the market expands over the next couple of years. And really, strategically, that becomes our operating process. And I expect we'll continue to do that. We're always working on costs. We've got a continuous improvement program where we're constantly driving, managing costs down. And I believe that that program and our approach to that is adequate. As we grow, we will manage the cost. But clearly, we expect to see tightness in pricing and more activity over time that all drives incrementals. Before we end the call, let me close with this. We are in the early innings of an unfolding multi-year upcycle that presents growth opportunities for Halliburton internationally and in North America. Those opportunities match Halliburton's unique customer-focused value proposition and our position as the only fully integrated energy services company in both international and North American markets. As this unfolds, we remain committed to driving returns and free cash flow for Halliburton shareholders. I'm optimistic about what lies ahead and look forward to speaking with you next quarter.  Shannon, please close out the call."

            "name": "Lance Loeffler",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff. And good morning. Let me begin with a summary of our second quarter results compared to the first quarter of 2021. Total company revenue for the quarter was $3.7 billion and operating income was $434 million, an increase of 7% and 17% respectively. Higher equipment utilization and our significant operating leverage supported these strong results as rig counts moved up globally in the second quarter.  Now, let me take a moment to discuss our division results in a little more detail. Starting with our Completion and Production division, revenue was $2 billion, an increase of 10%, while operating income was $317 million or an increase of 26%. These improvements were driven by higher activity across multiple product service lines in North America land, improved cementing activity in the Eastern Hemisphere and Latin America, increased completion tool sales in the Middle East, the North Sea and Latin America, as well as higher well intervention services in Saudi Arabia and Algeria. These improvements were partially offset by lower stimulation activity in Latin America.  In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $1.7 billion, an increase of 5%, while operating income was $175 million or an increase of 2%. These results were driven by improved drilling-related services and wireline activity across all regions, along with increased testing services in the Eastern Hemisphere. Partially offsetting these improvements were reduced software sales globally.  Moving on to our geographic results. In North America, revenue increased 12%, primarily driven by higher pressure pumping services, drilling related services and wireline activity in North America land, as well as higher well construction activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Partially offsetting these increases were reduced software sales across the region.  Turning to Latin America, revenue was flat sequentially, primarily driven by increased activity in multiple product service lines in Mexico, higher fluid services in Brazil, as well as additional completion tool sales in Guyana. These results were offset by lower stimulation activity in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil, decreased software sales across the region, and lower project management activity in Mexico and Ecuador.  In Europe, Africa, CIS, revenue increased 7%, resulting from increased activity across multiple product service lines in Russia, Norway, Algeria, and Ghana. These increases were partially offset by lower software sales across the region and lower activity in Nigeria.  In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue increased 5%, resulting from improved activity in multiple product service lines in Saudi Arabia, improved well intervention services across the region, increased drilling-related services in Oman, higher completion tool sales in Kuwait, improved well construction activity in Australia and increased pipeline services in China. These improvements were offset by lower software sales across the region, reduced project management activity in India and lower overall activity in Bangladesh.  In the second quarter, our corporate and other expenses totaled $58 million. For the third quarter, we expect our corporate expense to remain largely unchanged.  Net interest expense for the quarter was $120 million and should remain flat for the third quarter. We remain focused on reducing our leverage in the near term, and recently announced the redemption of our remaining 2021 senior notes at par ahead of schedule in August using cash on hand, which should reduce interest expense beyond the third quarter.  Our effective tax rate for the second quarter came in better than expected at approximately 22%, benefiting from several one-time discrete items. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our third quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 25%.  Capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately $190 million and will continue to ramp up for the remainder of the year. However, we will stay within our full-year target of 5% to 6% of revenue.  Turning to cash flow, we generated $409 million of cash from operations and $265 million of free cash flow during the second quarter. We believe that our year-to-date and expected earnings performance for the remainder of the year, combined with efficient working capital management, should result in a full-year free cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion. The growth and earnings outlook that Jeff laid out positions us well to grow our free cash flow over the next couple of years.  Now, let me turn to our near-term outlook. In the international markets, we expect a steady increase in activity as the rig counts continued to recover. In North America, we anticipate modest pricing improvement and continued activity momentum in both completions and drilling, but sequential activity growth will be slower than in prior quarters. As a result, for our Completion and Production division, we anticipate high single-digit revenue growth sequentially, with margins expected to modestly increase by 25 basis points to 50 basis points.  In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate sequential revenue growth of 3% to 5% due to continued rig count increases globally and a margin increase similar to that of our C&P division.  I will now turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff? Good morning, James. You're right. In the near term, we're focused on trimming our debt levels. I think that that focus \u2013 good example of that focus is what we plan to do this month or early next, actually, with the $500 million maturity that we have coming due, paying it down with cash. Look, I think we're getting to a point where we're continuing to strive to cut our debt levels and get back to that 2 times debt to EBITDA leverage ratio that we've talked about before. But I think we are getting to a point where we intend to return more cash to shareholders, whether in the form of a dividend or share repurchase, not willing to commit to that at this point. But it's certainly something that we think is an and type scenario. So, we continue to trim our level of debt and improve the level of cash that we send back to shareholders. Neil, I think it's a great question. And I think that we're going to continue to reevaluate what it means for us in the near term as we continue to grow into this recovery. We certainly believe that we need to improve those yields today on a dividend basis. But we're going to continue to look at and get comfortable with the forward free cash flow profile, what we think that this business, we believe, can generate in these out years that Jeff discussed. But, clearly, we believe it requires improvement from where we are today. Look, Connor, I think it's less about cost savings structurally. I think it's more about volume of activity combined with price. So, it's volume, utilization and pricing improvement throughout the course of that journey that Jeff sort of outlined."

Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Abu Zeya, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nAbu Zeya: Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton first quarter 2021 conference call. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton\u2019s website for 7 days. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO and Lance Loeffler, CFO. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton\u2019s views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton\u2019s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020; recent current reports on Form 8-K; and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.  Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of impairments asset dispositions and other charges. Beginning this quarter, we have modified our free cash flow metric, a non-GAAP financial measure to include the impact of Proceeds from sales of property, plant, and equipment. We believe this item is recurring in nature and including it improves comparability of this metric relative to our large cap peers. Additional details including recalculation of this measure for prior periods and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our first quarter earnings release and can also be found in the quarterly results and Presentation section of our website.  After our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period to allow time for others who maybe in the queue. Now, I will turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Thank you, Abu, and good morning everyone. We are off to a good start this year. The world is reopening and even though some regions still experience lockdowns, overall economic and demand recovery continues to build. Oil demand is increasing globally. Oil inventories are down near their five-year averages, and OPEC+ actions continue to support commodity prices. The first quarter strengthened our confidence about how this transition year will play out.  Our first quarter performance demonstrates the strength of our strategy and operating leverage in this global market recovery. Here are some highlights. International revenue grew 2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Marketing and activity inflection in the international markets, strong recovery in Latin America more than offset declines in other regions, while margins remained resilient.  North America revenue grew 13% as both drilling and completions activity ramped up throughout the quarter. Higher utilization and our significant operating leverage supported sequential margin expansion despite weather disruptions.  Our Completion and Production division revenue grew 3% with increased North America and Latin America activity offsetting seasonal declines in other regions. Our Drilling and Evaluation division delivered solid revenue and margin performance. Revenue grew 11% while margins increased 2.6 percentage points, driven by stronger drilling activity in North America and software sales across multiple regions.  Finally, we delivered approximately $160 million of free cash flow in the first quarter, which is a great first step to delivering strong free cash flow for the full year. This was another quarter of solid execution on our five strategic priorities that define Halliburton\u2019s path and will drive our success.  We are committed to drive profitable growth internationally; maximize value in North America; accelerate and integrate digital technologies; improve capital efficiency; and actively participate in advancing cleaner affordable energy.  Our first quarter performance demonstrated that aligning our actions with these strategic priorities boosts our returns and free cash flow generation. We expect to continue delivering strong free cash flow and industry-leading returns as we move through the year. We are encouraged by the inflection in international activity we saw during the first quarter and anticipate that recovery will gain momentum across all regions in the second quarter and beyond.  Today, we see early indicators of future activity growth internationally. Our completion tool orders, a leading indicator of upcoming orders grew throughout the first quarter. The volume of tender work has significantly increased. We are on pace to nearly double the value of submitted bids compared to last year with the most work coming from the NOCs in the Middle East, followed by Latin America.  These signs give us greater conviction that the second half of this year will see a low double-digit increase in international activity year-on-year. We believe the international markets will experience multiple years of growth. However, this upcycle is expected to be structurally different from prior cycles and Halliburton\u2019s international business is better prepared to benefit from it.  Here is why. We expect the NOCs and other short cycle barrel producers will increase investments and gain share to meet future oil demand growth. Halliburton has the established footprint and the customer relationships to capitalize on this growth. As deals become smaller and more complex, operators work harder to produce more barrels.  Their pursuit of incremental production to meet future oil demand growth should require higher service intensity. In certain markets, maturing assets are changing hands. New owners require proven technology and experience to revitalize their assets and unlock remaining reserves. Halliburton\u2019s broad technology portfolio, local expertise, and commercial flexibility are helping these customers achieve their efficiencies and production objectives.  Multiple years of service company CapEx reductions limit equipment availability in the international markets. In early 2020, pre-COVID, international pricing was beginning to increase on the back of equipment tightness, but paused with the oil demand collapse. As the world reopens and activity rebounds, we expect large tenders to remain competitive, but leading edge pricing should increase. Our strategic priority is clear; deliver profitable growth as the expected international recovery unfolds. We believe the following factors will help us accomplish this: first, we expect our ongoing investment in technology innovations to benefit us as the market recovers.  For example, as the global leader in completions technology, we introduced the Ovidius Expanding Isolation Packer. Ovidius uses material science innovation to transform a metal alloy into a rock-like material when it reacts with downhole fluids. It creates a long-lasting seal for improved well integrity and is specially suited for high pressure and high temperature environments, as well as permanent plug and abandonment operations. Our completion tools R&D pipeline incorporates the latest advancements in material science, sensors, telemetry and digitalization. Ovidius is one good example of this pipeline. The successful rollout of our iCruise intelligent drilling system continues to deliver excellent results.  In the first quarter, iCruise improved drilling speeds 55% for a customer in the Middle East; saved an operator three days of rig time in the North Sea and increased drilling rates 25% compared to offset wells in offshore China. Second, our Production business continues to expand internationally with unique growth opportunities. We plan to start executing on our first multiyear electric submersible pump contract in the Middle East in the second half of this year.  We see significant volume and future growth potential for artificial lift solutions in the Middle East as many mature fields across the region come off natural flow and require ESPs to sustain production. With proven Summit ESP technology, a strong local presence, and a focus on profitable growth, we expect to thrive in this market. As we progress towards completing our specialty chemicals plant in Saudi Arabia, we are actively participating in regional tendering activity. In addition to providing new business opportunities, this plant will also manufacture chemicals for our internal consumption. We expect the new plant to deliver cost savings and profitable growth for Halliburton in 2022 and beyond. Finally, we are accelerating the deployment and integration of digital technologies with our customers. We believe digital creates technological differentiation, contributes to higher international margins, and drives internal efficiencies.  In the first quarter, we introduced a new real-time data transmission system for a major customer in the North Sea. This high fidelity, low latency data highway is an essential building block for virtual remote operations that are performed without human intervention and use real-time data and tailored algorithms. We also launched a new digital workflow on a private cloud for an integrated services contract in the Middle East.  This workflow helps our employees make better decisions. It uses a proprietary natural language processing service to extract specific information from a variety of documents and locate associated data in our data lake. This is digital technology in action facilitating collaboration and knowledge management, while improving operational efficiencies. These digital technologies are important milestones in our journey from digital planning to virtual execution. We are using our open architecture platform to integrate real-time information from the customer, Halliburton\u2019s many digitally-enabled technologies and third-party providers across the entire asset.  I believe that Halliburton\u2019s current strengths and new capabilities will deliver profitable growth in a multi-year international recovery. Today, North America is staging a healthy recovery. In the current oil price environment, shale operators have a larger portfolio of economically viable projects. As a result, the average U.S. land rig count grew 27% sequentially in the first quarter, outpacing the growth in completed stages.  We still expect the majority of our customers to remain committed to a disciplined capital program this year. But what we are seeing today solidifies our confidence in a steady activity cadence for the rest of the year as operators work to maintain their productive capacity. The market dynamics continue to improve.  Supportive commodity prices should allow our customers to spend their announced budgets and meet their cash flow objectives. Customer mix should transition as the year unfolds. Privates led the recovery in the first half and we expect some public companies to increase activity in the second half of the year.  Halliburton serves both of these customer groups aligning with operators that have longer term and more efficient programs. As a result, demand for our equipment is increasing and our calendar is filling up for the rest of the year. Last year, we used digital technology to redesign our service delivery approach and create significant differentiation in our cost structure. Adding to our cost reset in 2020, we continued to drive cost out of our North America operations.  As an example, we\u2019ve engaged with Vorto, a software company that designed an artificial intelligence supply chain platform to transform how we buy, move, and sell sand and trucking within our U.S. Land Operations.  Without human intervention, Vorto\u2019s platform optimizes thousands of logistics loads per day while also identifying and addressing issues before they occur. This fits with our strategic priorities to use digital technology to drive down costs in our business and to maximize value in North America. Together with our size and scale, our sustainable operating leverage should widen our margin differential relative to our competitors in North America. We are steadily improving margins and our first quarter performance was another step in the right direction.  As we look ahead, we see upside to our margin performance based on utilization, technology, innovation, and pricing. Utilization is the first step to better margins with a smaller equipment base and the right customer alignment we intend to continue optimizing utilization as market demand grows. Given our scale, the operating leverage impact from utilization increases alone should improve our cash flow generation in North America. Technological differentiation and digital innovation is the next step. Halliburton has the leading low emission solutions in the market today, both electric and dual fuel and we expect they will command a premium as market demand expands. As the leader in hydraulic fracturing, Halliburton has the scale and R&D depths to deliver a proven power-agnostic, capital efficient solution for e-frac. Deployed in the Permian Basin, our fully integrated all-electric frac site includes our 5,000 horsepower Zeus electric pumping unit, our new ExpressBlend blending system, E-Winch electric wireline unit and the electric tech command center built using our flagship Q10 pumps, Zeus delivers performance levels up to 40% higher than conventional pumps and substantially reduces emissions limited only by the grid power source. As certain components of our input costs rise, we are working with our suppliers and our customers to adjust our gross pricing in line with cost inflation we are seeing in the market. While improving U.S. economic activity and winter weather disruptions led to increases in sand, chemicals, cement additives, and raw materials costs, Halliburton\u2019s purchasing power and technology have allowed us to procure and deliver these materials in a cost-efficient manner, such that both Halliburton and our customers are more competitive. Service pricing improvement is the final step. We are not there yet but we see positive signs of market rebalancing that should drive future pricing improvements. Total fracturing equipment capacity has limited room to grow in the current pricing environment.  Continued attrition from the rising service intensity and insufficient returns for many service companies is altering the industry dynamics, because we are an integrated provider, Halliburton participates in all key businesses in North America today and we will benefit more than others when pricing moves up. We believe that Halliburton\u2019s leadership and strength in North America will allow us to take advantage of positive market dynamics and deliver on our strategic priority to maximize value in this market. Consistent with our strategy, we continue to turn every knob to manage greater capital efficiency and drive solid free cash flow generation.  This takes many forms and includes important technology advancements and multiple product service lines whether digital or equipment related, process changes that improve the speed with which we move equipment and respond to market opportunities.  And finally, actions to reduce the pace of working capital consumption required to grow our business. The first quarter was a good demonstration of this and we will continue to build on these actions. We are also executing on our strategic priority to advance cleaner affordable energy and to support sustainable energy advancements using innovation and technology to reduce the environmental impact of producing oil and gas.  Halliburton has a three-prong approach to achieving this objective. First, we recently released our target to achieve 40% reduction in Scope one and two emissions by 2035 from the 2018 baseline. This is consistent with our goal to reduce the carbon footprint and environmental impact of our operations and follows our commitment to set science-based targets announced last year. Second, we are innovating. We continue to develop and deploy low carbon solutions to help oil and gas operators lower their current emissions profiles. We also use our existing technologies in renewable energy applications.  For example, today, the geothermal market in Europe is growing rapidly and represents an attractive expansion opportunity for our artificial lift business. We are currently supplying electric submersible pumps specifically designed for the high temperature, large well bore applications on the geothermal project in Germany.  We are also providing drilling and cementing services for geothermal wells in Indonesia. We developed new high temperature cementing formulations and directional drilling techniques that increase geothermal sites\u2019 generating capacity and improve project economics. And finally, we are excited about the progress of Halliburton Labs, our clean energy accelerator. In the first quarter, we announced Halliburton Labs\u2019 inaugural group of participating companies.  They are working on solutions for transforming organic and plastic waste to renewable power, recycling of lithium-ion batteries and converting carbon dioxide, water and renewable electricity into a hydrogen-rich platform chemical. We are collaborating with these companies and providing world-class industrial capabilities and expertise to help them achieve further scale and increase their valuations.  This engagement in the clean energy space will inform Halliburton\u2019s future strategic decisions as the energy transition evolves. We are taking applications for the next cohort of participants as we continue bringing early-stage clean energy companies in to Halliburton Labs. To sum up, we entered 2021 optimistic and focused on innovation. We believe that the early positive momentum in North America will continue and the international market recovery will accelerate in the second half of the year. Halliburton will continue to execute on our key strategic priorities to deliver industry-leading returns and solid free cash flow as the anticipated multi-year recovery unfolds. I will now turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our financial results. Lance?\nLance Loeffler : Thank you, Jeff. Let\u2019s begin this morning with an overview of our first quarter results, compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Total company revenue for the quarter was $3.5 billion, an increase of 7% and our operating income was $370 million, an increase of 6%, compared to the adjusted operating income of $350 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Now, let me take a moment to discuss our divisional results in a little bit more detail. In our Completion and Production division, revenue was $1.9 billion or an increase of 3%, while operating income was $252 million, representing a decrease of 11%.  The increase in revenue was primarily driven by higher stimulation and artificial lift activity in North America, higher cementing activity in the North Sea, as well as improved stimulation activity in Argentina and Mexico and higher completion tools sales in Latin America. These increases were partially offset by lower cementing services in Russia, lower pressure pumping activity in the Middle East, reduced seasonal completion tool sales and lower well intervention services in the Eastern Hemisphere.  Operating income was negatively impacted primarily by decreased completion tool sales and reduced pressure pumping activity in the Eastern Hemisphere. Our Drilling and Evaluation revenue was $1.6 billion or an increase of 11%, while operating income was $171 million, an increase of 46%. These increases were primarily due to higher software sales globally, improved drilling-related services and wireline activity in the Western Hemisphere and Norway and increased project management activity internationally. Partially offsetting these increases were lower drilling-related services across Asia. Moving on to our geographical results. In North America, revenue was $1.4 billion, representing an increase of 13%. These results were primarily driven by higher drilling-related services, stimulation and artificial lift activity in North America Land, as well as higher wireline activity and software sales in North America Land and the Gulf of Mexico. Partially offsetting these increases were reduced completion tool sales and lower cementing and fluids activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Moving to Latin America, revenue was $535 million, representing an increase of 26% resulting primarily from increased activity in multiple product service lines in Argentina and Mexico, as well as higher fluid services in the Caribbean. Partially offsetting these improvements was reduced activity across multiple product service lines in Colombia. Turning to Europe, Africa, CIS, revenue was $634 million, a 1% decrease sequentially, resulting mainly from reduced completion tool sales and well intervention services across the region, coupled with lower activity in Russia and lower fluid services in Kazakhstan. These decreases were partially offset by higher well construction activity in the North Sea and increased software sales across the region. In Middle East Asia, revenue was $878 million or a 6% decrease. These results were primarily driven by lower stimulation and well intervention services in the Middle East, reduced drilling-related activity in Indonesia and China, and lower completion tool sales across the region. Partially offsetting these declines were improved project management activity in Iraq and Saudi Arabia and higher wireline activity across Asia. In the first quarter, our corporate expense totaled $53 million. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate corporate expense to be slightly higher. Net interest expense for the quarter was $125 million and we expect this level of interest expense to drift slightly lower in the second quarter as a result of our reduced debt balance.  Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 23%. As we go forward into 2021, based on the anticipated market environment and our expected geographic earnings mix, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 25%. Turning to cash flow, we generated $203 million of cash from operations during the first quarter and $157 million of free cash flow. We also repaid $188 million in maturing debt with cash on hand in the first quarter and we\u2019ll continue to prioritize reducing leverage in the near-term.  Capital expenditures during the quarter came in at $104 million. We expect capital equipment deliveries for international projects to ramp up in the second half of the year and as a result, our full year 2021 CapEx guidance remains unchanged. Finally, turning to our near-term operational outlook. Let me provide you with some comments on how we see the second quarter unfolding.  In North America, we expect both completions and drilling activity momentum to continue, but sequential activity growth should moderate. In the international markets, we expect a seasonal rebound and a broad based activity increase, the pace of which will vary across different regions.  As a result, for our Completion and Production division, we anticipate low double-digit revenue growth sequentially with margins expected to expand by 125 to 150 basis points as a result of our strong operating leverage across all markets. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate a mid-single digit revenue increase with margins declining 100 to 125 basis points sequentially. The moderate growth and anticipated reduction in margins are primarily attributed to the seasonal decline in our software sales globally. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff?\nJeff Miller : Thanks, Lance. To sum up, I am optimistic about how this transition year is shaping up. The demand outlook continues to improve both internationally and domestically, even as some regions still experience lockdowns. This year is headed in the right direction and Halliburton is focused on the right things to deliver on our shareholders objectives.  We expect our strong international business to continue its profitable growth as activity increases throughout the year. In North America, our business has recovered and is demonstrating margin improvement on the back of our strong operating leverage. Digital is growing our revenue and helping us and our customers increase operational efficiency and reduce costs. Our commitment to capital efficiency is expected to support growth and solid free cash flow generation.  And finally, we believe that our strategy to advance cleaner affordable energy positions us well for the future. And now let\u2019s open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James West with Evercore ISI. \nJames West : Morning guys. \nJeff Miller: Morning, James. \nJames West : So Jeff, clearly, international looks good in the back half where we are 90 days from your last conference call and obviously you announced [Photonics] [ph] in between. But your visibility on the second half and even more so on 2022, which I think is more important, should have increased at this point.  And so, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on kind of how the international recovery takes shape, I understand you have double-digit year-over-year second half of this year, but really, as it kind of runs into 2022. How we should be thinking about regions, markets, so where the growth is going to be and then should that double-digit momentum continue?\nJeff Miller: Yes. Thanks, James. The \u2013 yes, confidence improving and visibility improving around our outlook both for 2021 and for 2022 and in fact, when we see \u2013 I see tender pipeline strong, strengthening, these are all sort of the things that start sometime later this year, but really start to get traction in 2022 and even 2023. Some of the programs that we are seeing are shorter cycle barrels, but the fact is, those are actually service intense barrels [defined] [ph] so it [indiscernible] going to drive more upstream spending faster and even if I look at just 2021 outlook confidence is more so today. I think earlier \u2013 we see it at a minimum improving to flat year-on-year which is an improvement from what we thought earlier. \nJames West : Right. Okay. Okay. It makes sense. And then as we think about North America, obviously the big E&Ps are going to remain capital disciplined and probably show some really good cash flow this year given where the oil price is, but they\u2019ll step up next year as it committed to spend a certain percentage of cash flow. So, are you starting to have conversations or started to think about 2022 as it reflects to North America and then kind of what the increase could be in spending as oil prices are 30% higher than they were going into this year?\nJeff Miller: Yes, James, I think we are going to see sort of the steady cadence of the increase as we move through this year and even into next year. I think, just the feedback and sense I get is that there is a lot of discipline around production and what they can do profitably and also think as we see improvement into 2022. They will face those service cost inflation just because of where everything is today, what needs to be replaced.  So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u2013 it won\u2019t be the \u2013 certainly won\u2019t be the same and I think that tightening of capacity is very good for Halliburton and I think that anything that will be a bit of a governor. \nJames West : Got you. Okay. Thanks, Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Thanks. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. \nScott Gruber : Yes, good morning. \nJeff Miller: Good morning, Scott. \nScott Gruber : So, as you guys probably heard some of your investor conversations there has been some concern around Halliburton in terms of the C&P margins as we start the year just given the mix towards the domestic completion market and we heard the 2Q guide obviously. How should we be thinking about the second half and assuming no net pricing in the U.S. with the international side starting to accelerate, U.S. continuing to expand on a more efficient and streamlined platform, how should we think about second half incrementals and kind of some high level if could put some color around that? And can we do better than the 2Q pace which looks like to be around 25%?\nJeff Miller: Well, look, thanks, Scott. We are confident about the progression in North America certainly for C&P and globally. And I think that the \u2013 our goal is to maximize the value of this business and I\u2019ve said I think we expect mid teens full year and I think that\u2019s a solid number and that\u2019s the reflecting and activity increase that is driving the incremental margins as opposed to pricing, no pricing in that.  And I think we have visibility towards what will drive pricing which will substantially improve, in fact super charge those incrementals. But I think right now, we are building our outlook around what is a steady cadence of improvement and maintaining, actually continuing to drive further efficiencies in North America with respect to keeping our cost. The reset that we did last year is still alive and well in place. \nScott Gruber : Got you. And a similar question on the D&E side. Obviously, some noise on the margin front around the software sales. But maybe some color on the second half for D&E, I guess, the question is, in the past as we\u2019ve seen the international side of the business accelerate off the bottom, we\u2019ve often seen startup costs, [indiscernible] the margin improvement potential at least for a couple quarters at the start of the cycle. Is there risk of that this cycle or is that really diminished given the digital applications and streamlining the platform? How should we think about D&E margins expansion in the second half as things start to pick up internationally? \nJeff Miller: Yes. Thanks. Look, I think the D&E starting at a higher point than it did finished last year is important. I think it\u2019s just two important things. One, our software business is strong and accretive and it also says though that the rest of the business margins, the breadth of D&E\u2019s margins, the baseline is improving. And so, we are knocking on double-digits as we look out through the rest of the year.  As I look at the back half for the international expansion on D&E, we are positioned today for that. And so, the kind of investment we are making, we view it as of March. We want to continue to improve the baseline margins in that business. So, it\u2019s continuing to improve. And so, I think we\u2019ll see improvement in 2021. I think that continues beyond that.  And so, our outlook is for continuing to grow those margins. I don\u2019t see the kind of headwinds that we might have seen a year ago when we were ramping for one of the largest contracts in the North Sea. I mean, I don\u2019t see that repeat.  And in some of what we are getting also is the benefit of the capital efficiency that\u2019s baked into a lot of our D&E ability to move things around. In fact, that\u2019s at the core of our strategy is capital efficiency and I think that manifests itself around how we move tools and other things. \nScott Gruber : Great. Appreciate the color, Jeff. Thank you. \nJeff Miller: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from David Anderson with Barclays.\nDavid Anderson : Hi, good morning, Jeff. I was just wondering if you could just talk briefly about the pressure pumping market. I certainly want to talk about DGB engines; E&P is increasingly looking to move away from diesel.  Some of it may be suggesting higher pricing on [indiscernible] equipment and I was just wondering if you could kind of tell us where you stand on this and are your customers pushing for this type of equipment? And are you starting to see any bifurcation in the market on pricing because of this? \nJeff Miller: Yes. Thanks, Dave. Look, I think as we look into the future, those types of solutions will get pricing earlier and more so. We are seeing more demand for those types of solutions. We have a leading position around whether it\u2019s Tier-4 dual fuel or also the electric. And so, yes, we are seeing the demand. I think that the bifurcation will happen gradually simply because of the ability to do two things; one, put equipment into the market and so the way we look at that is that\u2019s replacement equipment generally.  So we\u2019ve got 10% to 12% of our equipment that goes off every year. And so, what we are able to do is replace that with what we view would be higher margin, better returning equipment over time, but that\u2019s more of the pacing that we see.  And then the other sort of key components around pricing, I mean, when we look at all of this, but when we think about returns for new equipment \u2013 any kind of new equipment, but particularly technology we expect some premium around the technology and also derisking the time horizon impact of making those returns also I think that\u2019s equally key. \nDavid Anderson : That makes sense. And then, if I could just switchover to the international side, you talked about improved project management activity in Iraq and Saudi Arabia. I was just wondering first, was there anything noteworthy behind this improvement?  Or is this more of the course of business, but kind of more importantly as you talk \u2013 look at the tendering activity out there, is this going to be a preferred contracting model for NOCs? I guess, assuming we are at the beginning of a multi-year growth phase and if so, are you comfortable increasing your exposure to project management activity? \nJeff Miller: The answer to the first question, Dave, this is sort of normal course of business. We see improvements that we see more activity at different times. So, that\u2019s really all to read through on that. I think the \u2013 with respect to project management broadly and how we see those contracts in the future, obviously, a lot of activity around that, we\u2019ll be certainly very thoughtful around how we increase that exposure, we manage that risk. And in fact, the most important component of looking at those types of things is understanding and managing the risk. \nDavid Anderson : Of course.\nJeff Miller: And it\u2019s one of the reasons also, you hear me say it a lot, but I am talking about profitable growth internationally. And so, that profitable component is going to be the lead punch around how we grow internationally. So we\u2019ll take that. Certainly, we are in that business. We are good at that business. But we are also pretty circumspect around how we make money doing that. \nDavid Anderson : Thanks, Jeff. \nJeff Miller: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. \nSean Meakim : Thank you. Hey, good morning. \nJeff Miller: Good morning. \nLance Loeffler: Hey, Sean. \nSean Meakim : So, C&P had pretty good quarter always considered, you expected some mix shift for the back half of the year. Private E&Ps led the very early recovery. You are suggesting some publics to add rigs in the back half. Does this also suggest that you think private E&Ps are mostly as what they can under the current oil price environment?  They have been \u2013 they are over half the rig count today. They are two-thirds of the rigs as of the trough. But their end economics are not that different maybe than from the publics\u2019. So just curious your visibility on the private E&P activity for the balance of the year. \nJeff Miller: Yes. Look, I think that they are the most nimble groups. They are going to move the quick as to engage. They also have a leashed impact on the overall headline production number also. So I think that, I really am encouraged by the activity that we\u2019ve seen. The ability to continue that. I think they are all making their own economic decisions and they make that really without a lot of stakeholder beyond the owners their direction.  And so, I think what we are seeing is a natural reaction to that. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s indicative of how the whole market behaves. And so, they have the ability to get real busy and then, slow down and back it down as they see production start to ramp up a little bit for them and it changes their economics.  So, a hard march up into the right not necessarily I think they all make their own decisions and could easily \u2013 I am not going to say, back off, but what they will do is make those decisions as other operators start to ramp and that\u2019s obviously a much more disciplined group. They have plans in place. I think the key point to make here though, we are at the end of the first quarter.  We are into Q2. And we haven\u2019t talked about any of the kind of budget blow outs that we talked about in prior years where, I, oh, wow, we\u2019ve overspent. So there is something coming that\u2019s going to slow things down. That\u2019s not all what we see.  In fact, what I am describing in terms of confidence and the cadence is, the confidence and the cadence that we are going to stay busy in marching through the second half of the year likely up some. In fact, I think our outlook today is up North America, maybe close to 10% on the full year. So, that\u2019s some moderation, but that\u2019s still growing. \nSean Meakim : That\u2019s a good point. I\u2019d appreciate that feedback. On D&E results obviously impressively sort of unpacked the impact of seasonal software sales spilling into the first quarter. You have also been press releasing a lot of the new contracts and agreements tied to digital initiatives. So just curious how much of the confidence underlying your margin commentary is driven by the improved mix from digital? And could it eventually be justified to maybe enhance some disclosure around the materiality of digital to your results? \nJeff Miller: Well, it\u2019s certainly digital enhancing our margins. But that\u2019s \u2013 and that\u2019s certainly where we want to see that go and we expect it to continue. It\u2019s also baked into all aspects of our business. So, from a digital perspective, it is sort of equal parts, customer-oriented by just consulting and software sales. It\u2019s also equal parts making our tools better, so they become answer products and we sell them through the normal course of business, but they meaningfully impact the value of those tools.  And then finally, what it does internally to drive our own cost down and so helping, yes, but I think more importantly, when I look at D&E is again back to that baseline of improving margins, which is built on the back of sort of the iCruise performance and technology there - wireline performance and technology there. So, those kinds of things that are operational. We can see them. We see them getting traction, more broad traction. Those are the kinds of things that as we look into a multi-year upcycle internationally, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to drive margin up 2021, 2022, 2023. \nSean Meakim : Really helpful. Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ian Macpherson with Simmons. \nIan Macpherson : Thanks, good morning guys. Jeff, I wanted to ask you for an update on your innovative frac operations. You spoke interestingly last quarter about the SmartFleet as well as we\u2019ve seen what you\u2019ve accomplished with the grid fracking.  I know there has been some IP contest there. I don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t need to talk about that, but just kind of an update on how those operations on leading edge technology in domestic frac are going? And how you see that blossoming over the course of the year with incremental fleets of those varieties?\nJeff Miller: Yes, look, I really like the technology. I like what we\u2019ve done. The smart fleet is as advertised. We got more trials to do. But we continue to find more effective ways to deliver that solution which should allow it to scale even more quickly. I think it\u2019s going to continue to gain a lot of traction, very capital-efficient approach to implementing technology, because it implements with the equipment that we have.  From an e-fleet standpoint, again, certainly pleased with the performance that we\u2019ve seen. Yes, it continues to drive or deliver on the kinds of efficiencies we probably would see both for us in terms of utilization and dollars per horsepower. Lot of interest from customers around that technology also. But just remember we are maximizing value in North America. So we only put this equipment out when it meets our return expectations and we can do this \u2013 the time horizon. And so, it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s going to look more like replacement of upgrading replacements as opposed to sort of new investment. \nIan Macpherson : Understood. Thanks, Jeff. And then, separately, Lance, I want to ask you about the free cash flow progression going into Q2 and for the rest year. Obviously, the CapEx was light loaded in Q1. And so, just thoughts on how the CapEx sequences through the year? And just general, maybe a refresh on total absolute dollar working capital framework for this year \u2013 no, sorry, not working capital, but bottom-line free cash?\nLance Loeffler: Yes, no. Good question Ian. Look, I think, overall, as everyone knows, maximizing free cash flow remains the key priority for us and what we are focused on. But more so, free cash flow is driven by margin progression and then all aspects of the capital efficiency. I know, Jeff covered a little bit in his prepared remarks around efficiency and working capital and remaining disciplined around CapEx.  Look, more operating profit we see ahead based on our activity outlook improving and obviously the progression around margins that we\u2019ve discussed already this morning, we are pretty optimistic about what all of that means for 2021 free cash flow target, which today gives us more confidence that we will be sort of ahead of where consensus sits today even excluding the change in the metric that we\u2019ve outlined this quarter. \nIan Macpherson : Perfect. Thanks, Lance. \nLance Loeffler: You bet, Ian. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. \nChase Mulvehill : Hey. Good morning, everybody. \nJeff Miller: Hey. Good morning, Chase.\nChase Mulvehill : Hey Jeff and Lance. So, I guess, in your prepared remarks, you talked about a doubling of the value of submitted bids across the international market we compare that to what you saw last year. So, I guess, I was hoping that maybe you could provide a little color relative to the mix between NOC, IOCs, independent E&Ps and maybe the regions that you see the most pick up in bidding activity.  And then, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d be willing to kind of step out or squeeze a little bit and so, what it might would mean for activity as we kind of get into 2022 if you start signing a lot of these contracts. And so, I know you talked about some continued growth and some strong growth on the international side over the medium-term. But I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d like to quantify that at this point just given the bid activity you are seeing. \nJeff Miller: Yes, look, I think that the type of activity we are seeing is probably more weighted towards Middle East, Latin America, broadly in terms of tender activity. I think that I am not going to try to quantify things that are two derivatives, kind of deviations in the future, but what our view is, that\u2019s certainly indicative of a growing market and a kind of market that will grow over time.  We are going to engage in that and participate in it, but at the end \u2013 and be successful. But our view is, A. focus on profitable growth and drive international revenue growth that way, but I think we are also going to see that sort of lead to the broader based kind of recovery which is equally important to price and so that bring that up is to say that these big tenders are always very competitive from a price standpoint.  But where we start to see price improvement typically is as the market sort of starts to fill up, then we see more opportunities and that is how we see the international market shaping up. So, I think that\u2019s an equally important concept to what we are seeing in terms of growth. \nChase Mulvehill : Okay. Thanks for the color there. And maybe I can kind of come back to the conversation around U.S. onshore and try to tease out a little bit more in the publics versus privates. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d be kind of willing to share your mix of publics versus privates in the U.S. onshore.  I know, kind of overall rig activity is roughly half between the publics and privates today and it continues to kind of see a shift towards privates as activity continues to rebound because they are obviously responding to a high oil price while the publics are not.  So, maybe just talk to your mix and kind of what advantages you think you have when you look to kind of pursue more opportunities on the private side versus your competitors? \nJeff Miller: Look, we have a great footprint in North America. We\u2019ve got a leading position in North America, which means we really work for all of the customers in North America. So, from a mix perspective, what we look for is efficiency. We look for opportunity. We look for growth opportunity and we look for uptake on technology and performance.  And so, I think the \u2013 that\u2019s the way we view the market less around, A versus B, but it\u2019s more do they have the characteristics that allow us to drive our value proposition in market and maximize the kind of returns like we are talking about. And so, I think that, that moves in different times depending on where the market is, but it doesn\u2019t easily change a whole lot. \nChase Mulvehill : Okay. I\u2019ll turn it back over. Thanks, Jeff. \nJeff Miller: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Marc Bianchi with Cowen.\nMarc Bianchi : Thank you. I guess, thinking about the cost structure going forward, there are few variables I think with COVID normalization hopefully coming out of COVID where, maybe there could be some increased travel and entertainment expense. I am curious how that sort of factors into the margin outlook that you have and if there is any risk to maybe a headwind to margin as we get into the back half of the year?\nJeff Miller: Yes. Thanks. Look, those types of costs are in our outlook. So, I don't \u2013 we manage cost all of the time. I don't see a bow wave of that coming back. We've reset the earnings. We reset it in terms of how we work and how we move people around and how we go to market. So, look forward to the market opening. I think that's going to drive a lot more demand that will continue to drive demand for oil. But I think from \u2013 from our standpoint, we're going to \u2013 we just manage those costs.\nMarc Bianchi : Yes. Thanks for that, Jeff. And Lance, back on the free cash flow, working cap was a positive number this quarter, but then there was another sort of 250 drag or outflow from other operating outflows. Could you talk about that? And then, just as I think about those two lines over the course of the year, would you expect them to be net neutral, positive, negative?\nLance Loeffler : Yes. So, other operating in the cash flow line item tends to be pretty heavy in the first quarter. We've got compensation that tends to hit in the first quarter, as well as, taxes are heavy with property taxes, et cetera. And so, that's not atypical from us from a, intra-year cyclicality perspective. We expect that to lighten up obviously into Q, but that's \u2013 that's sort of the color I would give you on that.\nMarc Bianchi : Okay. Thanks for that. I'll turn it back.\nLance Loeffler : Thanks. Thanks, Marc.\nMarc Bianchi : Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley.\nConnor Lynagh : Yes. Thank you. I was hoping we could put a finer point on some of the discussion on pricing in international. You made the comment that obviously large tenders will be competitive, but leading edge pricing should increase. Can you maybe frame for us the extent to which leading edge pricing is meaningfully different from what you're more sort of contracts book looks like? In other words, if leading edge pricing is moving higher would that imply that contract pricing will follow? Or is there a market-to-market impact we should talk about?\nJeff Miller: No, I think contract pricing will follow is the way that works generally. It starts there. The contracts themselves improve over time and I think that having alternatives that are higher priced also helped to create pressure \u2013 upward pressure on pricing even in large contracts.\nLance Loeffler : And I would add. I mean, that's what Jeff is describing is exactly what we were seeing in the early part or late part of 2019 and 2020 was that dynamic in terms of large tenders still bid competitively. But rising level of activity was tightening the rest of the broader market. Obviously, we took a pause with COVID, but we expect as we see activity levels creep back to where we were in those \u2013 at that period of time, I think we are optimistic that we start to see the same behavior from a pricing perspective.\nConnor Lynagh : Got it. It makes sense. And I guess, just further to that, so on the large tender side of things, there has been some discussion about some of the softer elements maybe improving before pricing. How do you, guys feel about the potential for terms and conditions or different types of ancillary charges improving in the near term?  And I guess, the other question is, you've made a lot of changes to your cost structure. Do you think you can maybe drive improved margins without the increase in pricing?\nJeff Miller: Yes, we expect to do that and that's as we continue to see activity come on we will see improving margins. Always working on T's and C's. There are always leading edge sort of things that we are working on that they come easier to do become very important overtime to do. We are doing those all of the time and we are doing those now. Also, digital sort of implicit through all of this. So when you see our digital improving driving margins better all of the time. And so, I think, we should see improving margins before we see even the pricing, but I think the pricing, that's what allows us to really that's where we see the real traction and incrementals.\nConnor Lynagh : Appreciate the color. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Voie with Wells Fargo.\nChris Voie: Thanks. Good morning. Just want to ask first on some of the cost inflation that was mentioned in the prepared remarks. Is that mostly getting offset in the pretty near-term maybe this quarter next? Or is there any impacts that could be flowing through as you get price recovery in the second and third quarter? Just curious if there is going to any tailwind from that?\nLance Loeffler : Yes, Chris. This is Lance. Yes, I mean, a lot of that\u2019s largely, the cost of inflation that we describe is driven by what's happening in North America and the growth that we are seeing there. Some of it was driven by the impact of the storms, right and some of the shortages that we saw across the value chain. But I would say, look, our size and scale gives us an inherent advantage to negotiate the best deals in a lot of those consumables.  And to the extent a lot of our commercial arrangements allow us to pass that through to the customer. Our guidance overall sort of incorporates that. And I think, look, we are always going to be continuing to focus on maximizing our value in North America regardless of the challenges in the environment. But that\u2019s sort of baked into how we see at least, the near-term playing out and obviously the outlook we've given the year.\nChris Voie: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then, maybe on CapEx. So, I think in the past you said 5% to 6% range. In the data it looks like service intensity is very high. Pricing has not really caught up with the amount of work that\u2019s getting done. So just curious to check in on the 5% to 6% range. If you expect that would still be in place for 2021 and probably 2022 as well.\nJeff Miller: Yes. Yes. I mean, that's what we talk about capital efficiency and driving capital efficiency through all parts of our business. That's what allows us to get to that 5% to 6% of revenues in terms of CapEx spend. So yes, for 2021 and 2022.\nChris Voie: Perfect. Thank you.\nJeff Miller: Thanks.\nOperator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Jeff Miller for closing remarks.\nJeff Miller: Okay. Thank you, Liz. Before we end the call, I'd like to make a few closing comments. I am encouraged by this year's positive momentum and demand recovery. We are well positioned globally for growing international demand. The expected steady activity cadence in North America and with our leading digital technologies, which allow us to maximize value for Halliburton and its shareholders. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.  Liz, please close out the call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeff Miller",
            "content": "Thank you, Abu, and good morning everyone. We are off to a good start this year. The world is reopening and even though some regions still experience lockdowns, overall economic and demand recovery continues to build. Oil demand is increasing globally. Oil inventories are down near their five-year averages, and OPEC+ actions continue to support commodity prices. The first quarter strengthened our confidence about how this transition year will play out.  Our first quarter performance demonstrates the strength of our strategy and operating leverage in this global market recovery. Here are some highlights. International revenue grew 2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Marketing and activity inflection in the international markets, strong recovery in Latin America more than offset declines in other regions, while margins remained resilient.  North America revenue grew 13% as both drilling and completions activity ramped up throughout the quarter. Higher utilization and our significant operating leverage supported sequential margin expansion despite weather disruptions.  Our Completion and Production division revenue grew 3% with increased North America and Latin America activity offsetting seasonal declines in other regions. Our Drilling and Evaluation division delivered solid revenue and margin performance. Revenue grew 11% while margins increased 2.6 percentage points, driven by stronger drilling activity in North America and software sales across multiple regions.  Finally, we delivered approximately $160 million of free cash flow in the first quarter, which is a great first step to delivering strong free cash flow for the full year. This was another quarter of solid execution on our five strategic priorities that define Halliburton's path and will drive our success.  We are committed to drive profitable growth internationally; maximize value in North America; accelerate and integrate digital technologies; improve capital efficiency; and actively participate in advancing cleaner affordable energy.  Our first quarter performance demonstrated that aligning our actions with these strategic priorities boosts our returns and free cash flow generation. We expect to continue delivering strong free cash flow and industry-leading returns as we move through the year. We are encouraged by the inflection in international activity we saw during the first quarter and anticipate that recovery will gain momentum across all regions in the second quarter and beyond.  Today, we see early indicators of future activity growth internationally. Our completion tool orders, a leading indicator of upcoming orders grew throughout the first quarter. The volume of tender work has significantly increased. We are on pace to nearly double the value of submitted bids compared to last year with the most work coming from the NOCs in the Middle East, followed by Latin America.  These signs give us greater conviction that the second half of this year will see a low double-digit increase in international activity year-on-year. We believe the international markets will experience multiple years of growth. However, this upcycle is expected to be structurally different from prior cycles and Halliburton's international business is better prepared to benefit from it.  Here is why. We expect the NOCs and other short cycle barrel producers will increase investments and gain share to meet future oil demand growth. Halliburton has the established footprint and the customer relationships to capitalize on this growth. As deals become smaller and more complex, operators work harder to produce more barrels.  Their pursuit of incremental production to meet future oil demand growth should require higher service intensity. In certain markets, maturing assets are changing hands. New owners require proven technology and experience to revitalize their assets and unlock remaining reserves. Halliburton's broad technology portfolio, local expertise, and commercial flexibility are helping these customers achieve their efficiencies and production objectives.  Multiple years of service company CapEx reductions limit equipment availability in the international markets. In early 2020, pre-COVID, international pricing was beginning to increase on the back of equipment tightness, but paused with the oil demand collapse. As the world reopens and activity rebounds, we expect large tenders to remain competitive, but leading edge pricing should increase. Our strategic priority is clear; deliver profitable growth as the expected international recovery unfolds. We believe the following factors will help us accomplish this: first, we expect our ongoing investment in technology innovations to benefit us as the market recovers.  For example, as the global leader in completions technology, we introduced the Ovidius Expanding Isolation Packer. Ovidius uses material science innovation to transform a metal alloy into a rock-like material when it reacts with downhole fluids. It creates a long-lasting seal for improved well integrity and is specially suited for high pressure and high temperature environments, as well as permanent plug and abandonment operations. Our completion tools R&D pipeline incorporates the latest advancements in material science, sensors, telemetry and digitalization. Ovidius is one good example of this pipeline. The successful rollout of our iCruise intelligent drilling system continues to deliver excellent results.  In the first quarter, iCruise improved drilling speeds 55% for a customer in the Middle East; saved an operator three days of rig time in the North Sea and increased drilling rates 25% compared to offset wells in offshore China. Second, our Production business continues to expand internationally with unique growth opportunities. We plan to start executing on our first multiyear electric submersible pump contract in the Middle East in the second half of this year.  We see significant volume and future growth potential for artificial lift solutions in the Middle East as many mature fields across the region come off natural flow and require ESPs to sustain production. With proven Summit ESP technology, a strong local presence, and a focus on profitable growth, we expect to thrive in this market. As we progress towards completing our specialty chemicals plant in Saudi Arabia, we are actively participating in regional tendering activity. In addition to providing new business opportunities, this plant will also manufacture chemicals for our internal consumption. We expect the new plant to deliver cost savings and profitable growth for Halliburton in 2022 and beyond. Finally, we are accelerating the deployment and integration of digital technologies with our customers. We believe digital creates technological differentiation, contributes to higher international margins, and drives internal efficiencies.  In the first quarter, we introduced a new real-time data transmission system for a major customer in the North Sea. This high fidelity, low latency data highway is an essential building block for virtual remote operations that are performed without human intervention and use real-time data and tailored algorithms. We also launched a new digital workflow on a private cloud for an integrated services contract in the Middle East.  This workflow helps our employees make better decisions. It uses a proprietary natural language processing service to extract specific information from a variety of documents and locate associated data in our data lake. This is digital technology in action facilitating collaboration and knowledge management, while improving operational efficiencies. These digital technologies are important milestones in our journey from digital planning to virtual execution. We are using our open architecture platform to integrate real-time information from the customer, Halliburton's many digitally-enabled technologies and third-party providers across the entire asset.  I believe that Halliburton's current strengths and new capabilities will deliver profitable growth in a multi-year international recovery. Today, North America is staging a healthy recovery. In the current oil price environment, shale operators have a larger portfolio of economically viable projects. As a result, the average U.S. land rig count grew 27% sequentially in the first quarter, outpacing the growth in completed stages.  We still expect the majority of our customers to remain committed to a disciplined capital program this year. But what we are seeing today solidifies our confidence in a steady activity cadence for the rest of the year as operators work to maintain their productive capacity. The market dynamics continue to improve.  Supportive commodity prices should allow our customers to spend their announced budgets and meet their cash flow objectives. Customer mix should transition as the year unfolds. Privates led the recovery in the first half and we expect some public companies to increase activity in the second half of the year.  Halliburton serves both of these customer groups aligning with operators that have longer term and more efficient programs. As a result, demand for our equipment is increasing and our calendar is filling up for the rest of the year. Last year, we used digital technology to redesign our service delivery approach and create significant differentiation in our cost structure. Adding to our cost reset in 2020, we continued to drive cost out of our North America operations.  As an example, we've engaged with Vorto, a software company that designed an artificial intelligence supply chain platform to transform how we buy, move, and sell sand and trucking within our U.S. Land Operations.  Without human intervention, Vorto's platform optimizes thousands of logistics loads per day while also identifying and addressing issues before they occur. This fits with our strategic priorities to use digital technology to drive down costs in our business and to maximize value in North America. Together with our size and scale, our sustainable operating leverage should widen our margin differential relative to our competitors in North America. We are steadily improving margins and our first quarter performance was another step in the right direction.  As we look ahead, we see upside to our margin performance based on utilization, technology, innovation, and pricing. Utilization is the first step to better margins with a smaller equipment base and the right customer alignment we intend to continue optimizing utilization as market demand grows. Given our scale, the operating leverage impact from utilization increases alone should improve our cash flow generation in North America. Technological differentiation and digital innovation is the next step. Halliburton has the leading low emission solutions in the market today, both electric and dual fuel and we expect they will command a premium as market demand expands. As the leader in hydraulic fracturing, Halliburton has the scale and R&D depths to deliver a proven power-agnostic, capital efficient solution for e-frac. Deployed in the Permian Basin, our fully integrated all-electric frac site includes our 5,000 horsepower Zeus electric pumping unit, our new ExpressBlend blending system, E-Winch electric wireline unit and the electric tech command center built using our flagship Q10 pumps, Zeus delivers performance levels up to 40% higher than conventional pumps and substantially reduces emissions limited only by the grid power source. As certain components of our input costs rise, we are working with our suppliers and our customers to adjust our gross pricing in line with cost inflation we are seeing in the market. While improving U.S. economic activity and winter weather disruptions led to increases in sand, chemicals, cement additives, and raw materials costs, Halliburton's purchasing power and technology have allowed us to procure and deliver these materials in a cost-efficient manner, such that both Halliburton and our customers are more competitive. Service pricing improvement is the final step. We are not there yet but we see positive signs of market rebalancing that should drive future pricing improvements. Total fracturing equipment capacity has limited room to grow in the current pricing environment.  Continued attrition from the rising service intensity and insufficient returns for many service companies is altering the industry dynamics, because we are an integrated provider, Halliburton participates in all key businesses in North America today and we will benefit more than others when pricing moves up. We believe that Halliburton's leadership and strength in North America will allow us to take advantage of positive market dynamics and deliver on our strategic priority to maximize value in this market. Consistent with our strategy, we continue to turn every knob to manage greater capital efficiency and drive solid free cash flow generation.  This takes many forms and includes important technology advancements and multiple product service lines whether digital or equipment related, process changes that improve the speed with which we move equipment and respond to market opportunities.  And finally, actions to reduce the pace of working capital consumption required to grow our business. The first quarter was a good demonstration of this and we will continue to build on these actions. We are also executing on our strategic priority to advance cleaner affordable energy and to support sustainable energy advancements using innovation and technology to reduce the environmental impact of producing oil and gas.  Halliburton has a three-prong approach to achieving this objective. First, we recently released our target to achieve 40% reduction in Scope one and two emissions by 2035 from the 2018 baseline. This is consistent with our goal to reduce the carbon footprint and environmental impact of our operations and follows our commitment to set science-based targets announced last year. Second, we are innovating. We continue to develop and deploy low carbon solutions to help oil and gas operators lower their current emissions profiles. We also use our existing technologies in renewable energy applications.  For example, today, the geothermal market in Europe is growing rapidly and represents an attractive expansion opportunity for our artificial lift business. We are currently supplying electric submersible pumps specifically designed for the high temperature, large well bore applications on the geothermal project in Germany.  We are also providing drilling and cementing services for geothermal wells in Indonesia. We developed new high temperature cementing formulations and directional drilling techniques that increase geothermal sites' generating capacity and improve project economics. And finally, we are excited about the progress of Halliburton Labs, our clean energy accelerator. In the first quarter, we announced Halliburton Labs' inaugural group of participating companies.  They are working on solutions for transforming organic and plastic waste to renewable power, recycling of lithium-ion batteries and converting carbon dioxide, water and renewable electricity into a hydrogen-rich platform chemical. We are collaborating with these companies and providing world-class industrial capabilities and expertise to help them achieve further scale and increase their valuations.  This engagement in the clean energy space will inform Halliburton's future strategic decisions as the energy transition evolves. We are taking applications for the next cohort of participants as we continue bringing early-stage clean energy companies in to Halliburton Labs. To sum up, we entered 2021 optimistic and focused on innovation. We believe that the early positive momentum in North America will continue and the international market recovery will accelerate in the second half of the year. Halliburton will continue to execute on our key strategic priorities to deliver industry-leading returns and solid free cash flow as the anticipated multi-year recovery unfolds. I will now turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our financial results. Lance? Thanks, Lance. To sum up, I am optimistic about how this transition year is shaping up. The demand outlook continues to improve both internationally and domestically, even as some regions still experience lockdowns. This year is headed in the right direction and Halliburton is focused on the right things to deliver on our shareholders objectives.  We expect our strong international business to continue its profitable growth as activity increases throughout the year. In North America, our business has recovered and is demonstrating margin improvement on the back of our strong operating leverage. Digital is growing our revenue and helping us and our customers increase operational efficiency and reduce costs. Our commitment to capital efficiency is expected to support growth and solid free cash flow generation.  And finally, we believe that our strategy to advance cleaner affordable energy positions us well for the future. And now let's open it up for questions. Morning, James. Yes. Thanks, James. The \u2013 yes, confidence improving and visibility improving around our outlook both for 2021 and for 2022 and in fact, when we see \u2013 I see tender pipeline strong, strengthening, these are all sort of the things that start sometime later this year, but really start to get traction in 2022 and even 2023. Some of the programs that we are seeing are shorter cycle barrels, but the fact is, those are actually service intense barrels [defined] [ph] so it [indiscernible] going to drive more upstream spending faster and even if I look at just 2021 outlook confidence is more so today. I think earlier \u2013 we see it at a minimum improving to flat year-on-year which is an improvement from what we thought earlier. Yes, James, I think we are going to see sort of the steady cadence of the increase as we move through this year and even into next year. I think, just the feedback and sense I get is that there is a lot of discipline around production and what they can do profitably and also think as we see improvement into 2022. They will face those service cost inflation just because of where everything is today, what needs to be replaced.  So, I don't think it's \u2013 it won't be the \u2013 certainly won't be the same and I think that tightening of capacity is very good for Halliburton and I think that anything that will be a bit of a governor. Thanks. Good morning, Scott. Well, look, thanks, Scott. We are confident about the progression in North America certainly for C&P and globally. And I think that the \u2013 our goal is to maximize the value of this business and I've said I think we expect mid teens full year and I think that's a solid number and that's the reflecting and activity increase that is driving the incremental margins as opposed to pricing, no pricing in that.  And I think we have visibility towards what will drive pricing which will substantially improve, in fact super charge those incrementals. But I think right now, we are building our outlook around what is a steady cadence of improvement and maintaining, actually continuing to drive further efficiencies in North America with respect to keeping our cost. The reset that we did last year is still alive and well in place. Yes. Thanks. Look, I think the D&E starting at a higher point than it did finished last year is important. I think it's just two important things. One, our software business is strong and accretive and it also says though that the rest of the business margins, the breadth of D&E's margins, the baseline is improving. And so, we are knocking on double-digits as we look out through the rest of the year.  As I look at the back half for the international expansion on D&E, we are positioned today for that. And so, the kind of investment we are making, we view it as of March. We want to continue to improve the baseline margins in that business. So, it's continuing to improve. And so, I think we'll see improvement in 2021. I think that continues beyond that.  And so, our outlook is for continuing to grow those margins. I don't see the kind of headwinds that we might have seen a year ago when we were ramping for one of the largest contracts in the North Sea. I mean, I don't see that repeat.  And in some of what we are getting also is the benefit of the capital efficiency that's baked into a lot of our D&E ability to move things around. In fact, that's at the core of our strategy is capital efficiency and I think that manifests itself around how we move tools and other things. Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Dave. Look, I think as we look into the future, those types of solutions will get pricing earlier and more so. We are seeing more demand for those types of solutions. We have a leading position around whether it's Tier-4 dual fuel or also the electric. And so, yes, we are seeing the demand. I think that the bifurcation will happen gradually simply because of the ability to do two things; one, put equipment into the market and so the way we look at that is that's replacement equipment generally.  So we've got 10% to 12% of our equipment that goes off every year. And so, what we are able to do is replace that with what we view would be higher margin, better returning equipment over time, but that's more of the pacing that we see.  And then the other sort of key components around pricing, I mean, when we look at all of this, but when we think about returns for new equipment \u2013 any kind of new equipment, but particularly technology we expect some premium around the technology and also derisking the time horizon impact of making those returns also I think that's equally key. The answer to the first question, Dave, this is sort of normal course of business. We see improvements that we see more activity at different times. So, that's really all to read through on that. I think the \u2013 with respect to project management broadly and how we see those contracts in the future, obviously, a lot of activity around that, we'll be certainly very thoughtful around how we increase that exposure, we manage that risk. And in fact, the most important component of looking at those types of things is understanding and managing the risk. And it's one of the reasons also, you hear me say it a lot, but I am talking about profitable growth internationally. And so, that profitable component is going to be the lead punch around how we grow internationally. So we'll take that. Certainly, we are in that business. We are good at that business. But we are also pretty circumspect around how we make money doing that. Thank you. Good morning. Yes. Look, I think that they are the most nimble groups. They are going to move the quick as to engage. They also have a leashed impact on the overall headline production number also. So I think that, I really am encouraged by the activity that we've seen. The ability to continue that. I think they are all making their own economic decisions and they make that really without a lot of stakeholder beyond the owners their direction.  And so, I think what we are seeing is a natural reaction to that. But I don't think it's indicative of how the whole market behaves. And so, they have the ability to get real busy and then, slow down and back it down as they see production start to ramp up a little bit for them and it changes their economics.  So, a hard march up into the right not necessarily I think they all make their own decisions and could easily \u2013 I am not going to say, back off, but what they will do is make those decisions as other operators start to ramp and that's obviously a much more disciplined group. They have plans in place. I think the key point to make here though, we are at the end of the first quarter.  We are into Q2. And we haven't talked about any of the kind of budget blow outs that we talked about in prior years where, I, oh, wow, we've overspent. So there is something coming that's going to slow things down. That's not all what we see.  In fact, what I am describing in terms of confidence and the cadence is, the confidence and the cadence that we are going to stay busy in marching through the second half of the year likely up some. In fact, I think our outlook today is up North America, maybe close to 10% on the full year. So, that's some moderation, but that's still growing. Well, it's certainly digital enhancing our margins. But that's \u2013 and that's certainly where we want to see that go and we expect it to continue. It's also baked into all aspects of our business. So, from a digital perspective, it is sort of equal parts, customer-oriented by just consulting and software sales. It's also equal parts making our tools better, so they become answer products and we sell them through the normal course of business, but they meaningfully impact the value of those tools.  And then finally, what it does internally to drive our own cost down and so helping, yes, but I think more importantly, when I look at D&E is again back to that baseline of improving margins, which is built on the back of sort of the iCruise performance and technology there - wireline performance and technology there. So, those kinds of things that are operational. We can see them. We see them getting traction, more broad traction. Those are the kinds of things that as we look into a multi-year upcycle internationally, that's what's going to drive margin up 2021, 2022, 2023. Yes, look, I really like the technology. I like what we've done. The smart fleet is as advertised. We got more trials to do. But we continue to find more effective ways to deliver that solution which should allow it to scale even more quickly. I think it's going to continue to gain a lot of traction, very capital-efficient approach to implementing technology, because it implements with the equipment that we have.  From an e-fleet standpoint, again, certainly pleased with the performance that we've seen. Yes, it continues to drive or deliver on the kinds of efficiencies we probably would see both for us in terms of utilization and dollars per horsepower. Lot of interest from customers around that technology also. But just remember we are maximizing value in North America. So we only put this equipment out when it meets our return expectations and we can do this \u2013 the time horizon. And so, it's not \u2013 it's going to look more like replacement of upgrading replacements as opposed to sort of new investment. Hey. Good morning, Chase. Yes, look, I think that the type of activity we are seeing is probably more weighted towards Middle East, Latin America, broadly in terms of tender activity. I think that I am not going to try to quantify things that are two derivatives, kind of deviations in the future, but what our view is, that's certainly indicative of a growing market and a kind of market that will grow over time.  We are going to engage in that and participate in it, but at the end \u2013 and be successful. But our view is, A. focus on profitable growth and drive international revenue growth that way, but I think we are also going to see that sort of lead to the broader based kind of recovery which is equally important to price and so that bring that up is to say that these big tenders are always very competitive from a price standpoint.  But where we start to see price improvement typically is as the market sort of starts to fill up, then we see more opportunities and that is how we see the international market shaping up. So, I think that's an equally important concept to what we are seeing in terms of growth. Look, we have a great footprint in North America. We've got a leading position in North America, which means we really work for all of the customers in North America. So, from a mix perspective, what we look for is efficiency. We look for opportunity. We look for growth opportunity and we look for uptake on technology and performance.  And so, I think the \u2013 that's the way we view the market less around, A versus B, but it's more do they have the characteristics that allow us to drive our value proposition in market and maximize the kind of returns like we are talking about. And so, I think that, that moves in different times depending on where the market is, but it doesn't easily change a whole lot. Thank you. Yes. Thanks. Look, those types of costs are in our outlook. So, I don't \u2013 we manage cost all of the time. I don't see a bow wave of that coming back. We've reset the earnings. We reset it in terms of how we work and how we move people around and how we go to market. So, look forward to the market opening. I think that's going to drive a lot more demand that will continue to drive demand for oil. But I think from \u2013 from our standpoint, we're going to \u2013 we just manage those costs. No, I think contract pricing will follow is the way that works generally. It starts there. The contracts themselves improve over time and I think that having alternatives that are higher priced also helped to create pressure \u2013 upward pressure on pricing even in large contracts. Yes, we expect to do that and that's as we continue to see activity come on we will see improving margins. Always working on T's and C's. There are always leading edge sort of things that we are working on that they come easier to do become very important overtime to do. We are doing those all of the time and we are doing those now. Also, digital sort of implicit through all of this. So when you see our digital improving driving margins better all of the time. And so, I think, we should see improving margins before we see even the pricing, but I think the pricing, that's what allows us to really that's where we see the real traction and incrementals. Yes. Yes. I mean, that's what we talk about capital efficiency and driving capital efficiency through all parts of our business. That's what allows us to get to that 5% to 6% of revenues in terms of CapEx spend. So yes, for 2021 and 2022. Thanks. Okay. Thank you, Liz. Before we end the call, I'd like to make a few closing comments. I am encouraged by this year's positive momentum and demand recovery. We are well positioned globally for growing international demand. The expected steady activity cadence in North America and with our leading digital technologies, which allow us to maximize value for Halliburton and its shareholders. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.  Liz, please close out the call."

            "name": "Lance Loeffler",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff. Let's begin this morning with an overview of our first quarter results, compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Total company revenue for the quarter was $3.5 billion, an increase of 7% and our operating income was $370 million, an increase of 6%, compared to the adjusted operating income of $350 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Now, let me take a moment to discuss our divisional results in a little bit more detail. In our Completion and Production division, revenue was $1.9 billion or an increase of 3%, while operating income was $252 million, representing a decrease of 11%.  The increase in revenue was primarily driven by higher stimulation and artificial lift activity in North America, higher cementing activity in the North Sea, as well as improved stimulation activity in Argentina and Mexico and higher completion tools sales in Latin America. These increases were partially offset by lower cementing services in Russia, lower pressure pumping activity in the Middle East, reduced seasonal completion tool sales and lower well intervention services in the Eastern Hemisphere.  Operating income was negatively impacted primarily by decreased completion tool sales and reduced pressure pumping activity in the Eastern Hemisphere. Our Drilling and Evaluation revenue was $1.6 billion or an increase of 11%, while operating income was $171 million, an increase of 46%. These increases were primarily due to higher software sales globally, improved drilling-related services and wireline activity in the Western Hemisphere and Norway and increased project management activity internationally. Partially offsetting these increases were lower drilling-related services across Asia. Moving on to our geographical results. In North America, revenue was $1.4 billion, representing an increase of 13%. These results were primarily driven by higher drilling-related services, stimulation and artificial lift activity in North America Land, as well as higher wireline activity and software sales in North America Land and the Gulf of Mexico. Partially offsetting these increases were reduced completion tool sales and lower cementing and fluids activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Moving to Latin America, revenue was $535 million, representing an increase of 26% resulting primarily from increased activity in multiple product service lines in Argentina and Mexico, as well as higher fluid services in the Caribbean. Partially offsetting these improvements was reduced activity across multiple product service lines in Colombia. Turning to Europe, Africa, CIS, revenue was $634 million, a 1% decrease sequentially, resulting mainly from reduced completion tool sales and well intervention services across the region, coupled with lower activity in Russia and lower fluid services in Kazakhstan. These decreases were partially offset by higher well construction activity in the North Sea and increased software sales across the region. In Middle East Asia, revenue was $878 million or a 6% decrease. These results were primarily driven by lower stimulation and well intervention services in the Middle East, reduced drilling-related activity in Indonesia and China, and lower completion tool sales across the region. Partially offsetting these declines were improved project management activity in Iraq and Saudi Arabia and higher wireline activity across Asia. In the first quarter, our corporate expense totaled $53 million. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate corporate expense to be slightly higher. Net interest expense for the quarter was $125 million and we expect this level of interest expense to drift slightly lower in the second quarter as a result of our reduced debt balance.  Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 23%. As we go forward into 2021, based on the anticipated market environment and our expected geographic earnings mix, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 25%. Turning to cash flow, we generated $203 million of cash from operations during the first quarter and $157 million of free cash flow. We also repaid $188 million in maturing debt with cash on hand in the first quarter and we'll continue to prioritize reducing leverage in the near-term.  Capital expenditures during the quarter came in at $104 million. We expect capital equipment deliveries for international projects to ramp up in the second half of the year and as a result, our full year 2021 CapEx guidance remains unchanged. Finally, turning to our near-term operational outlook. Let me provide you with some comments on how we see the second quarter unfolding.  In North America, we expect both completions and drilling activity momentum to continue, but sequential activity growth should moderate. In the international markets, we expect a seasonal rebound and a broad based activity increase, the pace of which will vary across different regions.  As a result, for our Completion and Production division, we anticipate low double-digit revenue growth sequentially with margins expected to expand by 125 to 150 basis points as a result of our strong operating leverage across all markets. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate a mid-single digit revenue increase with margins declining 100 to 125 basis points sequentially. The moderate growth and anticipated reduction in margins are primarily attributed to the seasonal decline in our software sales globally. I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff? Hey, Sean. Yes, no. Good question Ian. Look, I think, overall, as everyone knows, maximizing free cash flow remains the key priority for us and what we are focused on. But more so, free cash flow is driven by margin progression and then all aspects of the capital efficiency. I know, Jeff covered a little bit in his prepared remarks around efficiency and working capital and remaining disciplined around CapEx.  Look, more operating profit we see ahead based on our activity outlook improving and obviously the progression around margins that we've discussed already this morning, we are pretty optimistic about what all of that means for 2021 free cash flow target, which today gives us more confidence that we will be sort of ahead of where consensus sits today even excluding the change in the metric that we've outlined this quarter. You bet, Ian. Yes. So, other operating in the cash flow line item tends to be pretty heavy in the first quarter. We've got compensation that tends to hit in the first quarter, as well as, taxes are heavy with property taxes, et cetera. And so, that's not atypical from us from a, intra-year cyclicality perspective. We expect that to lighten up obviously into Q, but that's \u2013 that's sort of the color I would give you on that. Thanks. Thanks, Marc. And I would add. I mean, that's what Jeff is describing is exactly what we were seeing in the early part or late part of 2019 and 2020 was that dynamic in terms of large tenders still bid competitively. But rising level of activity was tightening the rest of the broader market. Obviously, we took a pause with COVID, but we expect as we see activity levels creep back to where we were in those \u2013 at that period of time, I think we are optimistic that we start to see the same behavior from a pricing perspective. Yes, Chris. This is Lance. Yes, I mean, a lot of that's largely, the cost of inflation that we describe is driven by what's happening in North America and the growth that we are seeing there. Some of it was driven by the impact of the storms, right and some of the shortages that we saw across the value chain. But I would say, look, our size and scale gives us an inherent advantage to negotiate the best deals in a lot of those consumables.  And to the extent a lot of our commercial arrangements allow us to pass that through to the customer. Our guidance overall sort of incorporates that. And I think, look, we are always going to be continuing to focus on maximizing our value in North America regardless of the challenges in the environment. But that's sort of baked into how we see at least, the near-term playing out and obviously the outlook we've given the year."

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Coleman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDavid Coleman: Hello, and thank you for joining the Halliburton Fourth Quarter 2022 Conference Call. We will make the recording of today's webcast available on Halliburton's Web site after this call.

Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our fourth quarter earnings release and in the quarterly results and presentation section of our Web site. Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Halliburton finished the year strong with solid financial and operational performance in both divisions and both hemispheres. Halliburton's execution in 2022 demonstrates the earnings power of our strategy, and I expect this earnings power to strengthen in 2023 and beyond. Let's jump right into the 2022 highlights. We delivered full year total company revenue of $20.3 billion and operating income of $2.7 billion. Adjusted operating income grew 70% compared to 2021 with improved margin performance in both divisions. Our full year international revenue grew 20% over 2021, and our revenue and operating income increased each quarter in 2022. I am pleased with the international growth and margin progression Halliburton demonstrated this year despite a second quarter exit from our Russian business. Our full year North America revenue increased 51% over 2021 with improved margins driven by activity and pricing gains. Both our drilling and evaluation and completion and production divisions grew revenue and margins this year. The Drilling and Evaluation division generated full year operating margins of 15%, an increase of 320 basis points over 2021. The steady expansion of D&E margins demonstrates the global competitiveness of our D&E business. Our Completion and Production division posted 18% full year operating margins, a year-over-year increase of 290 basis points, driven by activity and pricing improvements. We generated strong free cash flow of $1.4 billion, retired $1.2 billion of debt, maintained capital spending within 5% to 6% of revenues and ended the year with $2.3 billion of cash on hand. Finally, our service quality performance excelled in 2022. Nonproductive time improved by 7% over 2021, which drove the highest ever uptime across our business. Execution is at the heart of who we are and our results are a testament to our employees' continued commitment to superior service quality. I'm pleased with the fourth quarter results. Revenue grew 4% and operating income grew 15% sequentially. Margins increased in both C&P and D&E divisions and in both hemispheres. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $1.2 billion and free cash flow was $856 million. Building on the strong foundation of execution, today, I am pleased to announce the following shareholder return actions: first, our Board approved an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.16 per share in the first quarter of 2023, representing a 33% increase from last year; second, we have resumed share buybacks under our existing Board authorization of approximately $5 billion and in the fourth quarter of 2022, bought back shares totaling $250 million; finally, our Board approved a capital return framework that we expect going forward to return at least 50% of our annual free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. These actions demonstrate Halliburton's confidence in our business, customers, employees and industry outlook. Before we continue, I want to take a moment and thank the Halliburton employees around the world who made these results possible. Our success this quarter and throughout 2022 was a direct result of your hard work and dedication. I thank you for your relentless focus on safety, operational execution, customer collaboration and service quality performance. Now let's turn to the macro outlook where everything I see today points towards continued oil and gas tightness. On the supply side, in the US, an increased spend of almost 50% and activity growth of nearly 30% yielded a production increase of about 5%. Given the increased spend required to grow and replace production, I expect activity to remain strong and service intensity to increase through 2023. I see the same supply side challenges in the international markets. One indicator being that despite OPEC's 2022 production quotas, several members did not meet their goals. On the demand side, we saw the resilience of oil and gas demand throughout 2022, even as central banks raised interest rates to combat inflation. I expect oil and gas demand to remain strong. As we start 2023, I also expect China's reopening to further increase demand. It's clear to me that oil and gas is in short supply and only multiple years of increased investment in both stemming declines and reserve additions will solve short supply. I believe these investments will drive demand for oilfield services for the next several years. The unique feature of this up cycle, as I see it, is the investor driven return discipline by both operators and service companies, which I expect drives a longer duration cycle and translates into years of increasing demand for Halliburton services. Now let's turn to Halliburton, starting with our performance in the international markets. We successfully executed our strategy to deliver profitable international growth through competitive technology offerings, improved pricing and selective contract wins. International revenue grew 20% year-on-year with strong growth and margin expansion from both divisions. This gives me confidence in the earnings power of our international strategy. In 2023, we expect international activity to grow at least mid-teens with most new activity coming from the Middle East and Latin America. As this up cycle continues, I believe that we will see substantial growth in all international markets, both onshore and offshore, led by development activity and increased spend at the wellbore. This is excellent news for Halliburton. About half our revenue comes from international markets. We have leading positions in key well construction product lines and a strong geographic footprint. I'm excited about the growth and profit opportunities that will come with the adoption of our new drilling technology platforms. Our iCruise drilling technology, iStar logging while drilling platform and LOGIX automation capabilities. Each of these technologies are in different stages of implementation, and we are already seeing benefits. Our iCruise directional drilling system represents about half of our rotary steerable fleet while drilling about 70% of our global footage. It is a key contributor to increasing international profitability. Our iStar logging while drilling platform now delivers high definition measurements closer to the bit and deeper into the formation. While early in its rollout with only 600,000 feet logged, the iStar platform directly complements the iCruise directional drilling system. Finally, LOGIX automates drilling with iCruise and iStar. With more than 7 million feet drilled in 20 plus countries the LOGIX platform reduces operational risk and delivers wells reliably. Turning to North America. We had a terrific year. Our performance demonstrated our strategy to maximize value in North America through capital efficiency, improved pricing, differentiated technology and alignment with high quality customers. In 2022, our North America revenue grew 51% year-over-year, while revenue in the fourth quarter was flat sequentially due to weather related downtime late in the year. Looking ahead, we expect strong activity and anticipate customer spending to grow by at least 15% in 2023. The market for equipment is tight. Lead times for new and replacement equipment remain long and service companies remain disciplined. Our completions calendar is fully booked and pricing continues to improve across all product service lines. Against this constructive market backdrop, Halliburton will outperform with our unique strategy to maximize value. We see strong demand for our Zeus e-fleets with several repeat customers contracting additional fleets. Zeus is a proven design with a strong operational track record. Our new automated fracturing platform, Optiv, fully automates equipment operation, reduces maintenance and extends component life. We are in the early innings of this rollout, having proven it over 15,000 stages, and I expect it to drive higher capital efficiency. Finally, our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing system is gaining significant traction with customers. SmartFleet data helps customers answer key questions such as the existence of flow barriers, well interference, parent-child performance and depletion, all to improve completion performance. These are a few examples of how technology maximizes value in North America. Each example delivers better margins either by reducing capital cost or increasing capital velocity and in many cases, both. Halliburton is unique and is the only integrated services company to have a strong presence in both North America and international markets, a strong execution culture and differentiated technology. We will continue to sharpen our value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. I am confident in Halliburton's strong long term outlook. This is the best setup and market outlook for oilfield services om Halliburton that I have seen in a very long time. Our exceptional financial performance this year is a clear result of the execution of our strategic priorities to maximize value in North America, deliver profitable international growth and drive capital efficiency. I expect Halliburton to continue to deliver financial outperformance. Now I will turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric?\nEric Carre: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Let me begin with a summary of our fourth quarter results. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.6 billion, a 4% increase over the third quarter while operating income was $976 million, an increase of 15% over third quarter operating income. Operating margin for the company was 17.5% in the fourth quarter, a 460 basis point increase over operating margins in the fourth quarter of 2021. These results were primarily driven by increased global activity, pricing and year end product and software sales. Our fourth quarter reported net income per diluted share was $0.72, an increase of $0.12 or 20% from the third quarter. Our 2022 full year adjusted net income per diluted share nearly doubled from 2021. Beginning with our Completion and Production division. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $3.2 billion, a 1% increase when compared to the third quarter, while operating income was $659 million, an increase of 13% when compared to the third quarter. Despite weather related downtime late in the year, C&P delivered an operating income margin of 20.7%, the highest operating income margin since 2012. This was due to improved pricing, service efficiency and activity mix in North America land as well as increased activity in international markets. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in the fourth quarter was $2.4 billion, an increase of 8% when compared to the third quarter, while operating income was $387 million, an increase of 19% when compared to the third quarter. These results were driven by higher year end software sales and an uptick in international activity. Operating margin increased 210 basis points above Q4 2021, which demonstrates the global competitiveness of our D&E business. Moving on to geographic results. Our international revenue increased 9% sequentially due to solid year end sales, pricing gains and activity increases. In North America, revenue in the fourth quarter was $2.6 billion, a 1% decrease when compared to the third quarter. This decrease was primarily driven by weather related downtime in North America land. Latin America revenue in the fourth quarter was $945 million, a 12% increase sequentially due to higher activity in Mexico and across the region. Europe/Africa revenue in the fourth quarter was $657 million, a 3% increase sequentially driven by higher completion tool sales, drilling activity and well intervention services across the region. These increases were partially offset by lower activity in Norway. Middle East/Asia revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.4 billion, a 10% increase sequentially, primarily resulting from higher software sales and drilling and evaluation services across the region. Now I'd like to cover some additional financial items. In the fourth quarter, our corporate and other expenses was $70 million. For the first quarter, we expect our corporate expenses to be slightly lower. Net interest expense for the quarter was $74 million, a slight decrease due to higher yields on cash balances and debt retirement in September. For the first quarter, we expect this expense to remain approximately flat. Other net expense for the quarter was $60 million, primarily related to unfavorable foreign exchange movements. For the first quarter, we expect this expense to be slightly lower. Our normalized effective tax rate for the fourth quarter came in at approximately 21%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our first quarter effective tax rate to increase roughly 150 basis points. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $350 million with our 2022 full year CapEx totaling approximately $1 billion. Turning to cash flow. For the full year, we generated $2.2 billion of cash from operations and delivered approximately $1.4 billion of free cash flow. As a result, we ended the year with approximately $2.3 billion in cash. Next, I'd like to provide a few more details about our capital return framework. First, an important pillar of our capital framework is to maintain CapEx between 5% and 6% of revenue. I believe the spending level is appropriate and supports our earnings growth and free cash flow generation over the next several years. Second, we expect to return a minimum of 50% of free cash flow to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 33% to $0.16 per share, effective with a dividend payment in March 2023. Finally, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased $250 million of shares and we have remaining authorization of approximately $5 billion. We were clear about our goals to reduce debt and increased cash returns to shareholders, and I am pleased that we've announced these actions today. I believe Halliburton's capital return framework provides visibility for investors and affords us the flexibility to pursue acquisitions and strengthen the balance sheet. Now let me provide you with some comments on how we see the first quarter. As is typical, our results will be subject to weather related seasonality and the roll-off of year end product sales, which will mostly impact our international business. As a result, in our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to be essentially flat with the fourth quarter while margins will drop between 75 and 125 basis points. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect revenue to decrease in the low to mid single digits sequentially while margins are expected to be down 25 to 75 basis points. I will now turn the call back to Jeff.\nA - Jeff Miller: Thanks, Eric. Let me summarize our discussion today. Oil and gas is tight and only multiple years of increased investment will solve short supply, which translates into years of increasing demand for Halliburton Services. The announced dividend increase, share buybacks and Halliburton's new capital return framework provides shareholders with clarity and consistency on how we expect to return cash to shareholders. This exceptional financial performance is a clear result of our execution of Halliburton's strategic priorities. I expect Halliburton to continue to deliver financial outperformance, strong free cash flow and shareholder returns. And now let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Anderson with Barclays.\nDavid Anderson: So Halliburton's international business is now half of overall revenue. Middle East has been a big part of that growth over the years, it was up 10% this quarter. Just wondering if you could just give us a little bit more insight into kind of your views on that market over the next kind of couple of years. So based on activity is how it's trending and the ramp up is going on, I guess, in the near term, is it reasonable to think the growth should sort of stay at these levels the next several quarters? And also, if you could highlight some of the countries where you see most of the growth coming from over the next several years, including kind of where you think you're best positioned in terms of footprints or product lines in the Middle East?\nJeff Miller: Look, I'm really excited about international growth. I think I said in my call, north of 15%, which clearly, I expect it will be north of that and should continue actually to expand, I think, over the next few years just because we will -- it takes longer to get traction internationally, get things contracted. And so really excited about what we see. With our international business being about half of our business today, that indicate or demonstrates that we have strong footprint sort of everywhere where we think it's important and our technology, as I described, rolling out. So clearly, it's got strong application in the Middle East and Latin America, which we kind of saw this year but it's the same technology that's applicable in all corners of the world. And so I think we're early in the rollout a lot of this technology and that's only going to help strengthen our international business. As we see activity grow, I expect our share of that to grow and improve margins as we focus on profitable international growth.\nDavid Anderson: And if I could shift over on the US side, there's been a lot of recent talk about activity levels slowing down in the US. The rig count has drifted down a bit in recent weeks, been some weather, as you highlighted, and there's also some concerns out there in the natural gas market. I also know how any E&Ps have announced any spending budgets this year. So I was wondering if you can just help us out with a little bit of visibility on the market. Kind of what are your customers saying about kind of how activity is going to play out into the spring? And then based on that, kind of how do you see sort of the dynamics of that pressure pumping market in terms of capacity and the tightness for 2023?\nJeff Miller: Look, North America is going to, in my view, will surprise to the upside. Our outlook is north of 15% growth. Clearly, we outpaced that last year and that's what I said last year. I don't have any clients that are not -- that are -- that plan to get smaller, they all plan to grow. And I think that North America has a dynamic of the more -- the more you grow, the more the market has to work in order to maintain even the growth given decline curves. And so I expect we see increased service intensity throughout '23 and likely beyond, the market is extremely tight for frac equipment and the supply chain still backed up. And so I don't see -- I see discipline in the marketplace and more importantly, I see sort of required discipline based on equipment being unavailable. So the more activity we see then ultimately, the more price we will see. And so I am very positive on '23 North America. So I think the the concerns are misplaced and rig count likely moves up actually as DUCs get blown down.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan.\nArun Jayaram: Jeff, clearly, one of the themes this earnings season has been the inflection in Middle East spending in offshore. I was wondering, Jeff, if you could talk about Halliburton's portfolio and competitive position in both the Middle East and as well as offshore? And how do you think you're positioned in this cycle versus last?\nJeff Miller: Look, we're better positioned than we've ever been as Halliburton, both from a technology perspective that I described examples of that. But clearly, that's not all of the technology we've got in the market today and from a footprint standpoint. So a lot of that build out was done prior cycles, it's still there and ready to go. So I feel very good about our geographic footprint, our technology advancement that we've made and our team. I mean we've just got an exceptionally strong team today internationally. So I feel very confident certainly from that perspective. And when we look at where our business is, offshore is good for us. I think that about 40% of our international business is offshore today. And so that's a good market for us. And I think another nuance as we look out into next year, certainly and likely beyond, is the sort of emphasis on development activity as opposed to exploration that maybe we've seen in prior cycles. And I think that's very consistent with where operators are from a capital discipline standpoint and just producing more barrels sooner, which leads us to development. And that is a place where we have leading positions in a number of the service lines that allow that to happen, so meaning drilling fluids, completion tools. And so I think this is going to be a great even better market for Halliburton.\nArun Jayaram: And maybe a follow-up for Eric. Eric, I wanted to get your thoughts on cash conversion in 2023. And just wanted to think about just working capital needs to support the growth this year? And just any broad thoughts on collections, particularly for international -- some of your international and NOC customers?\nEric Carre: So I mean, broadly speaking, we're looking at the cash generation profile in 2023 as being fairly similar to 2022. So quite a bit weighted toward the back half of the year. Looking at things overall, I mean, the big buckets, obviously, we'll see significantly increased net income driven by growth in our revenue, improvements in our margins. On the CapEx side of things, we finished 2022 on the low end of our range of 5% to 6%. We were at 5%. When I look at '23, we will be at the higher end of that range, primarily driven by supply chain constraints and extended lead time in our supply chain that we talked about on prior calls. And the third element in terms of working capital, again, our business will continue to grow, so we will continue to see some headwinds in terms of working capital essentially and also the impact of growing internationally, which tends to be more bigger consumers of working capital than when we grow our business in North America. So the way all of that is going to land is a little north of 20% growth in terms of free cash flow over our 2022 performance.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James West with Evercore ISI.\nJames West: So Jeff, in North America, I want to start there. In North America, your customer base and the majority of the customers really have three options, you can grow, you can shrink, you can go international. Where do you see, in your conversations with the bigger shale operators -- and you mentioned earlier, you think there could be a surprise to the upside in North America. How do you think they're thinking about the North American market, especially given what's going to be inventory constraints at some point here, whether it's three years, five years, seven years, we don't really know but at some point on wells and what they plan to do over the next couple of years?\nJeff Miller: Well, I expect that within sort of expectations -- within sort of capital discipline levels, I expect growth is really the only path for most of these companies. And commodity price very supportive, the international growth, very, very difficult, and shrink, not really an option. So I think that we'll see increased -- initially increased service intensity, that's the first step and that clearly we benefit from increasing service intensity. The second, if we want to go out 10 years, that's a bet against technology and that's not a bet I'm willing to make. I mean, in fact, I'm very confident in what technology will do. There is a lot of oil in North America and we're already seeing the impact of work harder producing more barrels. And then also that's one of the reasons as Halliburton the SmartFleet, as an example, I talk about it a lot, but that's one of the tools that operators can take. I expect over time and start to solve how to make more barrels and more productivity. And so as we invest a lot of R&D dollars into North America, we're kind of unique in that fashion and we try to put those dollars into what we think are most impactful. So it's not a bigger X or a smaller Y but more a function of what is the technology that I think and the company thinks will really unlock productivity over time. And I think those kind of tools in the hands of our operators, I mean, they are incredibly competitive, smart, technically deep. And I think it's more a matter of getting tools in their hands to allow them to unlock what 10 years down the road looks like.\nJames West: Okay, that's great perspective there. And then if I could just switch to the international side of the business. At this point, are we in a market that is still price driven or have we switched now to a market where it's about availability and service quality?\nJeff Miller: Well, I don't think you have one without the other, James, but I would expect -- my view is service quality and having equipment, quality equipment, is more and more important every day, that ultimately drives prices well. We spend a lot of time focused on how we execute and deliver service quality and our service quality feel very good. And so we are a beneficiary of that. As the market gets tighter, they start to get to the -- the market starts to pull equipment out, but I expect that sort of where we are, we've got a very good equipment portfolio and technology that we're bringing to the market and all of that certainly benefits us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks, Jeff, for the framework around capital returns, and that's kind of where I want to focus my questions here today. Can you talk about why you thought at least 50% of free cash flow was the right number? And then talk about how you -- the definition of that calculation. I think it will be cash flow from -- cash flow from operations inclusive of working capital minus CapEx before M&A, but just to make sure we're on the same page.\nJeff Miller: Go ahead, Eric.\nEric Carre: I think your view is correct, yes. And the 50%, I mean, there's nothing magic in the 50% per se. We think that it's a number that gives some level of certainty in terms of what we're going to return to shareholders while giving us a lot of optionality to continue to invest in our business, to continue to make bolt-on acquisition or to make acquisitions that are complementary to our product line business. And also give us optionality over the next few years to continue to work on strengthening our balance sheet.\nNeil Mehta: And that was my follow-up around capital returns. So as you think about the buyback, how do you think about approaching it? Do you want to take a more ratable approach or do you want to be countercyclical in the way that you prosecute it? And when you talk about M&A, are we talking about bolt-on type of transactions that are -- or do you see a scenario where we could be looking at larger scale things?\nEric Carre: So let me start with M&A maybe. So our philosophy there is extremely focused on adding technology. So it's a bit of a build versus buy approach to complementing our technology budget. It is a bit opportunistic at time depending on what's available and the opportunities that we have. Over the years, we've also invested in complements like smaller businesses that we can easily add to existing product lines. So that's kind of the general view that we have on technology. From an overall strategy standpoint, and I'll let Jeff jump in. But we are where we need to be in terms of the businesses we want to compete in at this stage. So going to the other part of your question, Neil, around buybacks. So I'm not going to go into a lot of details, but generally speaking, we look at buybacks as being level loaded through 2023, which will obviously top off in terms -- in order to make sure that we meet our overall target of 50% or more. So we're thinking about buybacks really as a mechanism to return cash to shareholders. We're not really trying to trade in our shares.\nJeff Miller: Let me just add to that as well. I mean I think the -- no surprises from us, our outlook on M&A hasn't changed, and it will stay that way. As we look at the capital allocation, we also want to continue, as Eric mentioned, opportunistically take out debt. We don't want to be sloppy about it, but kind of in the current market that we see, we have the opportunities to do things that are -- that make returns for the company, but we want to be crystal clear around what our minimum return was. It's clearly -- we'll work through that. But I would expect that by setting that minimum, I think it gives clarity to the marketplace that we will only do things that we believe add meaningful returns to the company.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler.\nLuke Lemoine: Jeff, your 4Q EBITDA margins firmly hopped in that kind of low 20% range here, basically at 14 levels, which was the target for '23, totally get there are some year-end sales there that skewed us higher in 4Q, but you're on the cusp of hitting 14 margins on an annual basis in '23. You and Lance kind of gave us a two year outlook almost two years ago. And I just wanted to see if maybe you could refresh this or expand upon it and how you see margins evolving over the next couple of years?\nJeff Miller: When we did that a couple of years ago, when we looked at published estimates, clearly, we thought they were too low. And so we've made some clear commentary and an effort to correct that. Now as we look at the published REIT estimates today, they seem about right. And so I don't want to try to continue to do that over and over. And what I am is super excited about our outlook. Margins from here are up, revenue is up. I'm as confident in our outlook and our business as I have ever been. But I just want to be clear, in Q2 of '21, we wanted to be clear that we were pointing out what we felt was missing in the future Street estimates. And today, as I said, I think published Street estimates today are about right for the years ahead, both top line and profitability.\nOperator: Next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America.\nChase Mulvehill: Jeff, I guess a quick follow-up or a question, maybe we can kind of dig in a little more on the international side. We spoke a little bit about this at dinner, but we get a lot of questions around confidence in multiyear growth on the international side. Obviously, we saw a strong growth last year and expectations are for another year of strong growth. I guess, could you speak to what you see for continued growth on the international side, once you get past '23 and kind of what gives you confidence that we will continue to see growth on the international side post this year?\nJeff Miller: Well, I would just start with the underinvestment that we've seen for the last roughly eight years and really haven't caught up with that. And so if I just look broadly at kind of reserve replacement and availability, that portends a lot of years of recovery and we're in the early stages of that in a lot of ways. It takes time to get international projects up underway, a lot has to be renegotiated with different partners. And so I think that what we see building is the tender backlog and these are tender backlogs that go beyond a year, well beyond a year and that's consistent with sort of the slower recovery in spend that we typically see internationally. But I'm confident that that's basically what's required to recover and produce enough oil to meet demand. Beyond that, specifically dialog with customers, target set by countries, outlooks that nearly all international countries that produce oil have targets that are certainly above where they are today, less clarity about how they get there, which actually really does indicate more service intensity in terms of how they get there, which is more activity certainly for us.\nChase Mulvehill: If I can pivot a little bit and follow up on some of the North America questions. Obviously, here, you've stated you talked about there's probably upside to North America that you don't see pricing pressure unfolding in pressure pumping, supply chain constraints, probably upside to demand. But we do get a lot of questions around pressure pumping and the risk of pricing. And really, those questions revolve around kind of lower tier fleets and kind of investors kind of asking about who has the high end fleet to the lower end fleet. So I don't know if you could take a moment and just talk about how many -- what percentage of your fleets are kind of Tier 2 diesel where if you were to see some pricing pressure, that's maybe where you would see it if you would see any?\nJeff Miller: Look, I don't see that in our business today at any level of equipment. In fact, all equipment is called for. Clearly, we have a strong environmentally -- a low emissions fleet as well that's probably at the higher end of price deck. But even at the bottom end of the price deck, our equipment -- we've systematically replaced equipment over time. And so we're really pleased with the fleet that we have and even a Tier 2 dual fuel equipment is in demand, most certainly. But what I'm most impressed with actually is sort of the strong market pull that we see around our e-fleets. We've got strong customer demand and especially I'm seeing repeat customers, which is terrific, where it's not one but two to the same customer are all fully contracted. And I think that's just an indication of the strength of our technology, it's proven, proven technology. I believe it's a better mousetrap. And quite frankly, we have a very strong IP portfolio and I think that is going to continue to be important.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read: Congratulations and well done on the quarter. I'd like to come back to some of your guidance and expectations for the international market. As we look at '23, you said kind of 15% but bias to the upside of that. I was just curious what what finished the year strong in '22, maybe better than expectations and sort of feeds into that expectation of, let's say, at least mid-teens to higher as we think about international in '23.\nJeff Miller: Look, I think it's sort of like everything is pointing at busier '23 than '22. That comes in the form of tender pipeline, that comes in form of sort of backlog increasing, product backlog that we've seen strengthened throughout the year and all of that sort of point -- I mean all of it points to '23, maybe even into '24. Discussions with customers, sort of the intensity of customers, view of staying busy and producing more barrels sooner rather than later. It's a very favorable market. And so it just gives me a lot of confidence in the outlook for '23 and particularly from our standpoint where we sit with technology and our global footprint.\nRoger Read: And then on the supply chain side, not just yours, but the one you see for the industry. Any areas you think continue to have, let's just call it, headwinds broadly as we look at '23, something that would slow project development or acceleration in '23?\nJeff Miller: Yes, I don't see anything that slows things down. Are there things that have extended lead times today, we're still working through some of that. But I don't think anything meaningful gets in the way of getting started. I think we still see inflation in the marketplace. So that's one of the ways that we saw for getting things. But I don't think that it's going to be a headwind necessarily. We're starting to see rigs come back. There will be a lot of work around getting those ready in some places. But clearly, motivated customers and there will be some -- as I said, some inflation to get all of that done, but I don't see those as headwinds.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Gruber from Citi.\nScott Gruber: Jeff, you mentioned a very full completion calendar here in the US. A quick question on that topic. Does that pertain to the fleets that the new e-frac fleet will be coming in to replace. My question relates to, is there work already lined up that would keep the legacy fleet fully deployed or those fleets need to be bid on to new jobs?\nJeff Miller: Look, no, we've got everything as spoken for in '23, whether replacement or not, I think over time, e-fleets, replace fleets, but they don't do it initially. And so there'll be some period of time where fleets take the place of legacy fleets, but that's not what we see in \u201823, we see everything busy in '23.\nScott Gruber: Got you, that's encouraging. And then turning to D&E margins, it's another nice year of expansion there. And obviously, you guys have had internal initiatives that structurally lift those margins, but you also have a number of tailwinds today from pricing to mix. How should we think about any incrementals this year you\u2019re willing to provide some color there? And overall, how should we think about where you could take D&E margins over the medium to longer term. I was looking back at our model and your D&E margins basically match where they were last cycle. So think about whether you guys can get to the 20% plus margin that you witnessed back in the late 2000s if this up cycle sustains?\nJeff Miller: Look, I think that I've always said, we've invested in technology and D&E in a meaningful way. We expect those margins to continue to move up. As you just mentioned, they have consistently moved up and that's on the back of technology and footprint and where we are, and I expect that trajectory to continue beyond where we are today or where we were last cycle. And so the outlook would be to continue to stack year-on-year quarters that are better than the last year. And so I have a lot of confidence in our outlook for D&E where they could go '23 and beyond.\nOperator: And our next question, one moment, is from Stephen Gengaro from Stifel.\nStephen Gengaro: So I think two things for me, if you don't mind. Can you talk a little bit on the domestic pressure pumping side. Obviously, I know you guys are pretty much sold out for the year. What are you seeing in the market as far as new build supply demand fundamentals as we look three, four, five quarters out, because I know you guys are -- you got your finger on the pulse there, I'm just curious what your take is on the overall market growth or lack thereof in supply?\nJeff Miller: Look, I think the market is certainly undersupplied today. And I think that attrition is happening every day even if it doesn't happen necessarily at the fleet level, but it does happen at the unit level. And part of the way that got solved in 2022 was through industry consolidation. So that's one method of dealing with attrition is bringing in more inventory and equipment. And then the other, as I look out throughout the year, all of '23, I mean, half the capacity additions that we've heard about are electric. And I think what's being realized in the field is electric is harder to do than it looks. And from our perspective, we have proven technology, we have technology with a track record, and we have a very strong IP portfolio around frac. And so I think that combination gives me a lot of confidence, a, in where we are and also that the market won't be oversupplied.\nStephen Gengaro: And just as a follow-up, we've seen consolidation in the US pressure pumping space. And some of the larger competitors are doing things to kind of make themselves have a higher revenue content at the well site, right, different types of vertical integration or well site integration. Have you seen any change in the competitive landscape at the well site? I mean, obviously, now everybody is busy. But just in general, has there been any change in the way your competitors are competing with Halliburton?\nJeff Miller: No, I don't see any change there. when I think about sand -- you're talking about sand, and when I think about sand, we've got very good suppliers in the sand business. We work well with them. And then I think about competitive advantage, I mean, real competitive advantage. What are things that we do to create competitive advantage. And we want to spend our dollars on things where we do have clear competitive advantage, which is in this case, pumping technology and then drilling technology, software, things where we clearly have competitive advantage. I view sand clearly as an input, it's an important input, we need access to it but at the same time, don't want to overinvest in that part of the business.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to management for closing remarks.\nJeff Miller: Thank you, Catherine. As we close out today's call, let me just close out with this. In this strong market for oilfield services, I am confident that Halliburton will execute on its strategic priorities and deliver financial outperformance. I look forward to speaking with you next quarter. You can close out the call.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Eric Carre",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Let me begin with a summary of our fourth quarter results. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.6 billion, a 4% increase over the third quarter while operating income was $976 million, an increase of 15% over third quarter operating income. Operating margin for the company was 17.5% in the fourth quarter, a 460 basis point increase over operating margins in the fourth quarter of 2021. These results were primarily driven by increased global activity, pricing and year end product and software sales. Our fourth quarter reported net income per diluted share was $0.72, an increase of $0.12 or 20% from the third quarter. Our 2022 full year adjusted net income per diluted share nearly doubled from 2021. Beginning with our Completion and Production division. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $3.2 billion, a 1% increase when compared to the third quarter, while operating income was $659 million, an increase of 13% when compared to the third quarter. Despite weather related downtime late in the year, C&P delivered an operating income margin of 20.7%, the highest operating income margin since 2012. This was due to improved pricing, service efficiency and activity mix in North America land as well as increased activity in international markets. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in the fourth quarter was $2.4 billion, an increase of 8% when compared to the third quarter, while operating income was $387 million, an increase of 19% when compared to the third quarter. These results were driven by higher year end software sales and an uptick in international activity. Operating margin increased 210 basis points above Q4 2021, which demonstrates the global competitiveness of our D&E business. Moving on to geographic results. Our international revenue increased 9% sequentially due to solid year end sales, pricing gains and activity increases. In North America, revenue in the fourth quarter was $2.6 billion, a 1% decrease when compared to the third quarter. This decrease was primarily driven by weather related downtime in North America land. Latin America revenue in the fourth quarter was $945 million, a 12% increase sequentially due to higher activity in Mexico and across the region. Europe/Africa revenue in the fourth quarter was $657 million, a 3% increase sequentially driven by higher completion tool sales, drilling activity and well intervention services across the region. These increases were partially offset by lower activity in Norway. Middle East/Asia revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.4 billion, a 10% increase sequentially, primarily resulting from higher software sales and drilling and evaluation services across the region. Now I'd like to cover some additional financial items. In the fourth quarter, our corporate and other expenses was $70 million. For the first quarter, we expect our corporate expenses to be slightly lower. Net interest expense for the quarter was $74 million, a slight decrease due to higher yields on cash balances and debt retirement in September. For the first quarter, we expect this expense to remain approximately flat. Other net expense for the quarter was $60 million, primarily related to unfavorable foreign exchange movements. For the first quarter, we expect this expense to be slightly lower. Our normalized effective tax rate for the fourth quarter came in at approximately 21%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our first quarter effective tax rate to increase roughly 150 basis points. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $350 million with our 2022 full year CapEx totaling approximately $1 billion. Turning to cash flow. For the full year, we generated $2.2 billion of cash from operations and delivered approximately $1.4 billion of free cash flow. As a result, we ended the year with approximately $2.3 billion in cash. Next, I'd like to provide a few more details about our capital return framework. First, an important pillar of our capital framework is to maintain CapEx between 5% and 6% of revenue. I believe the spending level is appropriate and supports our earnings growth and free cash flow generation over the next several years. Second, we expect to return a minimum of 50% of free cash flow to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 33% to $0.16 per share, effective with a dividend payment in March 2023. Finally, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased $250 million of shares and we have remaining authorization of approximately $5 billion. We were clear about our goals to reduce debt and increased cash returns to shareholders, and I am pleased that we've announced these actions today. I believe Halliburton's capital return framework provides visibility for investors and affords us the flexibility to pursue acquisitions and strengthen the balance sheet. Now let me provide you with some comments on how we see the first quarter. As is typical, our results will be subject to weather related seasonality and the roll-off of year end product sales, which will mostly impact our international business. As a result, in our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to be essentially flat with the fourth quarter while margins will drop between 75 and 125 basis points. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect revenue to decrease in the low to mid single digits sequentially while margins are expected to be down 25 to 75 basis points. I will now turn the call back to Jeff. So I mean, broadly speaking, we're looking at the cash generation profile in 2023 as being fairly similar to 2022. So quite a bit weighted toward the back half of the year. Looking at things overall, I mean, the big buckets, obviously, we'll see significantly increased net income driven by growth in our revenue, improvements in our margins. On the CapEx side of things, we finished 2022 on the low end of our range of 5% to 6%. We were at 5%. When I look at '23, we will be at the higher end of that range, primarily driven by supply chain constraints and extended lead time in our supply chain that we talked about on prior calls. And the third element in terms of working capital, again, our business will continue to grow, so we will continue to see some headwinds in terms of working capital essentially and also the impact of growing internationally, which tends to be more bigger consumers of working capital than when we grow our business in North America. So the way all of that is going to land is a little north of 20% growth in terms of free cash flow over our 2022 performance. I think your view is correct, yes. And the 50%, I mean, there's nothing magic in the 50% per se. We think that it's a number that gives some level of certainty in terms of what we're going to return to shareholders while giving us a lot of optionality to continue to invest in our business, to continue to make bolt-on acquisition or to make acquisitions that are complementary to our product line business. And also give us optionality over the next few years to continue to work on strengthening our balance sheet. So let me start with M&A maybe. So our philosophy there is extremely focused on adding technology. So it's a bit of a build versus buy approach to complementing our technology budget. It is a bit opportunistic at time depending on what's available and the opportunities that we have. Over the years, we've also invested in complements like smaller businesses that we can easily add to existing product lines. So that's kind of the general view that we have on technology. From an overall strategy standpoint, and I'll let Jeff jump in. But we are where we need to be in terms of the businesses we want to compete in at this stage. So going to the other part of your question, Neil, around buybacks. So I'm not going to go into a lot of details, but generally speaking, we look at buybacks as being level loaded through 2023, which will obviously top off in terms -- in order to make sure that we meet our overall target of 50% or more. So we're thinking about buybacks really as a mechanism to return cash to shareholders. We're not really trying to trade in our shares."

            "name": "Jeff Miller",
            "content": "Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Halliburton finished the year strong with solid financial and operational performance in both divisions and both hemispheres. Halliburton's execution in 2022 demonstrates the earnings power of our strategy, and I expect this earnings power to strengthen in 2023 and beyond. Let's jump right into the 2022 highlights. We delivered full year total company revenue of $20.3 billion and operating income of $2.7 billion. Adjusted operating income grew 70% compared to 2021 with improved margin performance in both divisions. Our full year international revenue grew 20% over 2021, and our revenue and operating income increased each quarter in 2022. I am pleased with the international growth and margin progression Halliburton demonstrated this year despite a second quarter exit from our Russian business. Our full year North America revenue increased 51% over 2021 with improved margins driven by activity and pricing gains. Both our drilling and evaluation and completion and production divisions grew revenue and margins this year. The Drilling and Evaluation division generated full year operating margins of 15%, an increase of 320 basis points over 2021. The steady expansion of D&E margins demonstrates the global competitiveness of our D&E business. Our Completion and Production division posted 18% full year operating margins, a year-over-year increase of 290 basis points, driven by activity and pricing improvements. We generated strong free cash flow of $1.4 billion, retired $1.2 billion of debt, maintained capital spending within 5% to 6% of revenues and ended the year with $2.3 billion of cash on hand. Finally, our service quality performance excelled in 2022. Nonproductive time improved by 7% over 2021, which drove the highest ever uptime across our business. Execution is at the heart of who we are and our results are a testament to our employees' continued commitment to superior service quality. I'm pleased with the fourth quarter results. Revenue grew 4% and operating income grew 15% sequentially. Margins increased in both C&P and D&E divisions and in both hemispheres. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $1.2 billion and free cash flow was $856 million. Building on the strong foundation of execution, today, I am pleased to announce the following shareholder return actions: first, our Board approved an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.16 per share in the first quarter of 2023, representing a 33% increase from last year; second, we have resumed share buybacks under our existing Board authorization of approximately $5 billion and in the fourth quarter of 2022, bought back shares totaling $250 million; finally, our Board approved a capital return framework that we expect going forward to return at least 50% of our annual free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. These actions demonstrate Halliburton's confidence in our business, customers, employees and industry outlook. Before we continue, I want to take a moment and thank the Halliburton employees around the world who made these results possible. Our success this quarter and throughout 2022 was a direct result of your hard work and dedication. I thank you for your relentless focus on safety, operational execution, customer collaboration and service quality performance. Now let's turn to the macro outlook where everything I see today points towards continued oil and gas tightness. On the supply side, in the US, an increased spend of almost 50% and activity growth of nearly 30% yielded a production increase of about 5%. Given the increased spend required to grow and replace production, I expect activity to remain strong and service intensity to increase through 2023. I see the same supply side challenges in the international markets. One indicator being that despite OPEC's 2022 production quotas, several members did not meet their goals. On the demand side, we saw the resilience of oil and gas demand throughout 2022, even as central banks raised interest rates to combat inflation. I expect oil and gas demand to remain strong. As we start 2023, I also expect China's reopening to further increase demand. It's clear to me that oil and gas is in short supply and only multiple years of increased investment in both stemming declines and reserve additions will solve short supply. I believe these investments will drive demand for oilfield services for the next several years. The unique feature of this up cycle, as I see it, is the investor driven return discipline by both operators and service companies, which I expect drives a longer duration cycle and translates into years of increasing demand for Halliburton services. Now let's turn to Halliburton, starting with our performance in the international markets. We successfully executed our strategy to deliver profitable international growth through competitive technology offerings, improved pricing and selective contract wins. International revenue grew 20% year-on-year with strong growth and margin expansion from both divisions. This gives me confidence in the earnings power of our international strategy. In 2023, we expect international activity to grow at least mid-teens with most new activity coming from the Middle East and Latin America. As this up cycle continues, I believe that we will see substantial growth in all international markets, both onshore and offshore, led by development activity and increased spend at the wellbore. This is excellent news for Halliburton. About half our revenue comes from international markets. We have leading positions in key well construction product lines and a strong geographic footprint. I'm excited about the growth and profit opportunities that will come with the adoption of our new drilling technology platforms. Our iCruise drilling technology, iStar logging while drilling platform and LOGIX automation capabilities. Each of these technologies are in different stages of implementation, and we are already seeing benefits. Our iCruise directional drilling system represents about half of our rotary steerable fleet while drilling about 70% of our global footage. It is a key contributor to increasing international profitability. Our iStar logging while drilling platform now delivers high definition measurements closer to the bit and deeper into the formation. While early in its rollout with only 600,000 feet logged, the iStar platform directly complements the iCruise directional drilling system. Finally, LOGIX automates drilling with iCruise and iStar. With more than 7 million feet drilled in 20 plus countries the LOGIX platform reduces operational risk and delivers wells reliably. Turning to North America. We had a terrific year. Our performance demonstrated our strategy to maximize value in North America through capital efficiency, improved pricing, differentiated technology and alignment with high quality customers. In 2022, our North America revenue grew 51% year-over-year, while revenue in the fourth quarter was flat sequentially due to weather related downtime late in the year. Looking ahead, we expect strong activity and anticipate customer spending to grow by at least 15% in 2023. The market for equipment is tight. Lead times for new and replacement equipment remain long and service companies remain disciplined. Our completions calendar is fully booked and pricing continues to improve across all product service lines. Against this constructive market backdrop, Halliburton will outperform with our unique strategy to maximize value. We see strong demand for our Zeus e-fleets with several repeat customers contracting additional fleets. Zeus is a proven design with a strong operational track record. Our new automated fracturing platform, Optiv, fully automates equipment operation, reduces maintenance and extends component life. We are in the early innings of this rollout, having proven it over 15,000 stages, and I expect it to drive higher capital efficiency. Finally, our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing system is gaining significant traction with customers. SmartFleet data helps customers answer key questions such as the existence of flow barriers, well interference, parent-child performance and depletion, all to improve completion performance. These are a few examples of how technology maximizes value in North America. Each example delivers better margins either by reducing capital cost or increasing capital velocity and in many cases, both. Halliburton is unique and is the only integrated services company to have a strong presence in both North America and international markets, a strong execution culture and differentiated technology. We will continue to sharpen our value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. I am confident in Halliburton's strong long term outlook. This is the best setup and market outlook for oilfield services om Halliburton that I have seen in a very long time. Our exceptional financial performance this year is a clear result of the execution of our strategic priorities to maximize value in North America, deliver profitable international growth and drive capital efficiency. I expect Halliburton to continue to deliver financial outperformance. Now I will turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric? Look, I'm really excited about international growth. I think I said in my call, north of 15%, which clearly, I expect it will be north of that and should continue actually to expand, I think, over the next few years just because we will -- it takes longer to get traction internationally, get things contracted. And so really excited about what we see. With our international business being about half of our business today, that indicate or demonstrates that we have strong footprint sort of everywhere where we think it's important and our technology, as I described, rolling out. So clearly, it's got strong application in the Middle East and Latin America, which we kind of saw this year but it's the same technology that's applicable in all corners of the world. And so I think we're early in the rollout a lot of this technology and that's only going to help strengthen our international business. As we see activity grow, I expect our share of that to grow and improve margins as we focus on profitable international growth. Look, North America is going to, in my view, will surprise to the upside. Our outlook is north of 15% growth. Clearly, we outpaced that last year and that's what I said last year. I don't have any clients that are not -- that are -- that plan to get smaller, they all plan to grow. And I think that North America has a dynamic of the more -- the more you grow, the more the market has to work in order to maintain even the growth given decline curves. And so I expect we see increased service intensity throughout '23 and likely beyond, the market is extremely tight for frac equipment and the supply chain still backed up. And so I don't see -- I see discipline in the marketplace and more importantly, I see sort of required discipline based on equipment being unavailable. So the more activity we see then ultimately, the more price we will see. And so I am very positive on '23 North America. So I think the the concerns are misplaced and rig count likely moves up actually as DUCs get blown down. Look, we're better positioned than we've ever been as Halliburton, both from a technology perspective that I described examples of that. But clearly, that's not all of the technology we've got in the market today and from a footprint standpoint. So a lot of that build out was done prior cycles, it's still there and ready to go. So I feel very good about our geographic footprint, our technology advancement that we've made and our team. I mean we've just got an exceptionally strong team today internationally. So I feel very confident certainly from that perspective. And when we look at where our business is, offshore is good for us. I think that about 40% of our international business is offshore today. And so that's a good market for us. And I think another nuance as we look out into next year, certainly and likely beyond, is the sort of emphasis on development activity as opposed to exploration that maybe we've seen in prior cycles. And I think that's very consistent with where operators are from a capital discipline standpoint and just producing more barrels sooner, which leads us to development. And that is a place where we have leading positions in a number of the service lines that allow that to happen, so meaning drilling fluids, completion tools. And so I think this is going to be a great even better market for Halliburton. Well, I expect that within sort of expectations -- within sort of capital discipline levels, I expect growth is really the only path for most of these companies. And commodity price very supportive, the international growth, very, very difficult, and shrink, not really an option. So I think that we'll see increased -- initially increased service intensity, that's the first step and that clearly we benefit from increasing service intensity. The second, if we want to go out 10 years, that's a bet against technology and that's not a bet I'm willing to make. I mean, in fact, I'm very confident in what technology will do. There is a lot of oil in North America and we're already seeing the impact of work harder producing more barrels. And then also that's one of the reasons as Halliburton the SmartFleet, as an example, I talk about it a lot, but that's one of the tools that operators can take. I expect over time and start to solve how to make more barrels and more productivity. And so as we invest a lot of R&D dollars into North America, we're kind of unique in that fashion and we try to put those dollars into what we think are most impactful. So it's not a bigger X or a smaller Y but more a function of what is the technology that I think and the company thinks will really unlock productivity over time. And I think those kind of tools in the hands of our operators, I mean, they are incredibly competitive, smart, technically deep. And I think it's more a matter of getting tools in their hands to allow them to unlock what 10 years down the road looks like. Well, I don't think you have one without the other, James, but I would expect -- my view is service quality and having equipment, quality equipment, is more and more important every day, that ultimately drives prices well. We spend a lot of time focused on how we execute and deliver service quality and our service quality feel very good. And so we are a beneficiary of that. As the market gets tighter, they start to get to the -- the market starts to pull equipment out, but I expect that sort of where we are, we've got a very good equipment portfolio and technology that we're bringing to the market and all of that certainly benefits us. Go ahead, Eric. Let me just add to that as well. I mean I think the -- no surprises from us, our outlook on M&A hasn't changed, and it will stay that way. As we look at the capital allocation, we also want to continue, as Eric mentioned, opportunistically take out debt. We don't want to be sloppy about it, but kind of in the current market that we see, we have the opportunities to do things that are -- that make returns for the company, but we want to be crystal clear around what our minimum return was. It's clearly -- we'll work through that. But I would expect that by setting that minimum, I think it gives clarity to the marketplace that we will only do things that we believe add meaningful returns to the company. When we did that a couple of years ago, when we looked at published estimates, clearly, we thought they were too low. And so we've made some clear commentary and an effort to correct that. Now as we look at the published REIT estimates today, they seem about right. And so I don't want to try to continue to do that over and over. And what I am is super excited about our outlook. Margins from here are up, revenue is up. I'm as confident in our outlook and our business as I have ever been. But I just want to be clear, in Q2 of '21, we wanted to be clear that we were pointing out what we felt was missing in the future Street estimates. And today, as I said, I think published Street estimates today are about right for the years ahead, both top line and profitability. Well, I would just start with the underinvestment that we've seen for the last roughly eight years and really haven't caught up with that. And so if I just look broadly at kind of reserve replacement and availability, that portends a lot of years of recovery and we're in the early stages of that in a lot of ways. It takes time to get international projects up underway, a lot has to be renegotiated with different partners. And so I think that what we see building is the tender backlog and these are tender backlogs that go beyond a year, well beyond a year and that's consistent with sort of the slower recovery in spend that we typically see internationally. But I'm confident that that's basically what's required to recover and produce enough oil to meet demand. Beyond that, specifically dialog with customers, target set by countries, outlooks that nearly all international countries that produce oil have targets that are certainly above where they are today, less clarity about how they get there, which actually really does indicate more service intensity in terms of how they get there, which is more activity certainly for us. Look, I don't see that in our business today at any level of equipment. In fact, all equipment is called for. Clearly, we have a strong environmentally -- a low emissions fleet as well that's probably at the higher end of price deck. But even at the bottom end of the price deck, our equipment -- we've systematically replaced equipment over time. And so we're really pleased with the fleet that we have and even a Tier 2 dual fuel equipment is in demand, most certainly. But what I'm most impressed with actually is sort of the strong market pull that we see around our e-fleets. We've got strong customer demand and especially I'm seeing repeat customers, which is terrific, where it's not one but two to the same customer are all fully contracted. And I think that's just an indication of the strength of our technology, it's proven, proven technology. I believe it's a better mousetrap. And quite frankly, we have a very strong IP portfolio and I think that is going to continue to be important. Look, I think it's sort of like everything is pointing at busier '23 than '22. That comes in the form of tender pipeline, that comes in form of sort of backlog increasing, product backlog that we've seen strengthened throughout the year and all of that sort of point -- I mean all of it points to '23, maybe even into '24. Discussions with customers, sort of the intensity of customers, view of staying busy and producing more barrels sooner rather than later. It's a very favorable market. And so it just gives me a lot of confidence in the outlook for '23 and particularly from our standpoint where we sit with technology and our global footprint. Yes, I don't see anything that slows things down. Are there things that have extended lead times today, we're still working through some of that. But I don't think anything meaningful gets in the way of getting started. I think we still see inflation in the marketplace. So that's one of the ways that we saw for getting things. But I don't think that it's going to be a headwind necessarily. We're starting to see rigs come back. There will be a lot of work around getting those ready in some places. But clearly, motivated customers and there will be some -- as I said, some inflation to get all of that done, but I don't see those as headwinds. Look, no, we've got everything as spoken for in '23, whether replacement or not, I think over time, e-fleets, replace fleets, but they don't do it initially. And so there'll be some period of time where fleets take the place of legacy fleets, but that's not what we see in \u201823, we see everything busy in '23. Look, I think that I've always said, we've invested in technology and D&E in a meaningful way. We expect those margins to continue to move up. As you just mentioned, they have consistently moved up and that's on the back of technology and footprint and where we are, and I expect that trajectory to continue beyond where we are today or where we were last cycle. And so the outlook would be to continue to stack year-on-year quarters that are better than the last year. And so I have a lot of confidence in our outlook for D&E where they could go '23 and beyond. Look, I think the market is certainly undersupplied today. And I think that attrition is happening every day even if it doesn't happen necessarily at the fleet level, but it does happen at the unit level. And part of the way that got solved in 2022 was through industry consolidation. So that's one method of dealing with attrition is bringing in more inventory and equipment. And then the other, as I look out throughout the year, all of '23, I mean, half the capacity additions that we've heard about are electric. And I think what's being realized in the field is electric is harder to do than it looks. And from our perspective, we have proven technology, we have technology with a track record, and we have a very strong IP portfolio around frac. And so I think that combination gives me a lot of confidence, a, in where we are and also that the market won't be oversupplied. No, I don't see any change there. when I think about sand -- you're talking about sand, and when I think about sand, we've got very good suppliers in the sand business. We work well with them. And then I think about competitive advantage, I mean, real competitive advantage. What are things that we do to create competitive advantage. And we want to spend our dollars on things where we do have clear competitive advantage, which is in this case, pumping technology and then drilling technology, software, things where we clearly have competitive advantage. I view sand clearly as an input, it's an important input, we need access to it but at the same time, don't want to overinvest in that part of the business. Thank you, Catherine. As we close out today's call, let me just close out with this. In this strong market for oilfield services, I am confident that Halliburton will execute on its strategic priorities and deliver financial outperformance. I look forward to speaking with you next quarter. You can close out the call."

Now I will turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Our outlook today is strong, oil and gas supply remains tight for the foreseeable future, International market activity is accelerating and North America service capacity continues to further tighten. As a result, pricing is moving up in both markets. Halliburton\u2019s strong third quarter results demonstrate the power of our strategy. Here are some highlights. Total company revenue increased 6% sequentially as both North America and International activity continue to expand. Operating income grew 18% compared to adjusted operating income from the second quarter with improved margin performance in both divisions. Our overall operating income margin was 16% representing 45% incremental margins over last quarter\u2019s adjusted operating income. Our Completion and Production division revenue increased 8% over last quarter, driven by completions activity and pricing in North America and International markets. C&P delivered operating margin of 19% in the third quarter. The Drilling and Evaluation division revenue grew 3%. Operating margin of 15% increased 140 basis points sequentially and 380 basis points above the same period last year, demonstrating the earnings power and global competitiveness of our D&E business. North America revenue grew almost 9% sequentially as both drilling and completions activity improved throughout the third quarter. Pricing gains and activity increases across both divisions drove these results. International revenue grew 3% sequentially with improved activity in the Middle East and Latin America that more than offset the revenue decline related to exiting our Russia business. Importantly, during the third quarter, we generated similar incremental margins in both international and North America markets. Finally, we generated free cash flow of $543 million and retired $600 million of debt during the quarter. I am pleased with the third quarter results. I want to express my appreciation to the men and women of Halliburton whose hard work and dedication made these results possible. Your commitment to collaboration, safety and service quality everyday make Halliburton successful. Turning to our macro outlook. Oil and gas supply remains fundamentally tight due to multiple years of underinvestment. This tightness is apparent in historically low inventory levels, production levels well below expectations and temporary actions such as the largest ever SPR release. Against tight supply, demand for oil and gas is strong and we believe it will remain so. While broader market volatility is clear, what we see in our business is strong and growing demand for equipment and services. There is no immediate solution to balance the world\u2019s demand for secure and reliable oil and gas against its limited supply. I believe that only multiple years of increased investment in existing and new sources of production will solve the short supply. The effective solution to short supply is conventional and unconventional, deepwater and shallow water, new and existing developments, and short and long cycle barrels, all of it. I expect progress towards increased supply will be measured in years, not months as behavior of both operators and service companies have changed. Operators remain disciplined. Their commitments to investor returns require a measured approach to growth and investment. Service companies follow the same discipline, delivering on their commitments to investor returns and taking a measured approach to growth and investment. What I think is underappreciated is how this results in more sustainable growth and returns over a longer period of time. Let\u2019s turn now to Halliburton\u2019s performance, starting with the International markets. Our third quarter performance demonstrates the strength of our strategy to deliver profitable International growth through improved pricing, selective contract wins and the competitiveness of our technology offerings. International revenue in the third quarter for the C&P and D&E divisions grew year-over-year from a percentage standpoint in the high teens and mid-20s, respectively, which outpaced International rig count growth and reflects our competitiveness in all markets. Our year-over-year growth and the margin expansion demonstrated by both divisions give me confidence in the earnings power of our International business. Looking forward, I see activity increasing around the world, from the smallest to the largest countries and producers. I expect the areas of strongest growth will be the Middle East, led by Saudi Arabia, but with meaningful activity increases in the UAE, Qatar, Iraq and Kuwait. Elsewhere, Brazil, Guyana and many others have also signaled a commitment to increased activity. Throughout these markets, I am pleased with the broad adoption of our new directional drilling platform such as iCruise and EarthStar. Importantly, these broad-based activity increases serve to tighten equipment availability and drive price increases in our International business. Shifting to North America, we had a fantastic quarter. Our solid performance demonstrates our strategy to maximize value in North America. We achieved this through improved pricing, partnering with high quality customers and differentiated technology. Our revenue grew 9% sequentially and is up 63% over the third quarter last year. Pricing continues to improve across all product lines and completions equipment remains extremely tight across the market. Interest in eFleets is strong and customers are pleased with the superior efficiencies, operational uptime and reduced carbon footprint of our market-leading solution. Looking into 2023, I see continued growth. The inbounds for calendar slots are stronger than I have ever seen at this point in the year. More importantly, I see increased demand for a limited set of equipment and an environment where technology and performance are increasingly valued, all perfectly set up for Halliburton to maximize value in North America. Market consolidation, competitors that answer to public investors, disciplined customers and supply chain constraints, all drive the services market that I expect to remain tight for the foreseeable future. Halliburton will continue to outperform in this market. Our best-in-class Zeus eFleets have pumped over 20,000 hours for customers. Our eFleet customers know that they have a field-proven technology, which carries the full weight of Halliburton\u2019s expertise to build, run and optimize this next-generation equipment. Additionally, our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing system continues to gain traction and we expect an almost eight-fold increase in stages completed this year. SmartFleet gives customers unparalleled access to data about where and how their fractures permeate, the potential for frac hits on adjacent wells and the real-time data necessary to improve completion designs. In all markets, Halliburton\u2019s strong financial performance demonstrates its strategy and action, profitable international growth, maximizing value in North America and improved asset velocity to deliver value for our shareholders today. These strategies equip us to outperform under any market conditions, but especially to maximize returns through this up cycle. Execution is at the heart of Halliburton\u2019s identity. We collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. You have seen that in action in today\u2019s results. You can hear how excited I am about Halliburton\u2019s future all around the world. The structural demand for more oil and gas supply provides strong tailwinds for our business and Halliburton is ideally positioned to deliver improved profitability and increased returns for shareholders. Now I will turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our third quarter financial results. Eric?\nEric Carre: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Let me begin with a summary of our third quarter results. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.4 billion, a 6% increase over the second quarter, while operating income was $846 million, an increase of 18% over second quarter adjusted operating income. Globally, higher activity and pricing improvement supported these strong results. Operating margin for the company was 16% in the third quarter, 164-basis-point increase over second quarter adjusted operating margin and 393 basis points over adjusted operating margin in the third quarter of 2021. Our third quarter reported net income per diluted share was $0.60, an increase of $0.11 or 22% from second quarter adjusted net income per diluted share and more than doubled the adjusted net income per diluted share for the same period last year. Beginning with our Completion and Production division, revenue in the third quarter was $3.1 billion, an 8% increase when compared to the second quarter, while operating income was $583 million, an increase of 17% when compared to the second quarter. These results were driven by increased pressure pumping services, primarily in North America land and increased completion tool sales in Middle East Asia. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in the third quarter was $2.2 billion, an increase of 3% when compared to the second quarter, while operating income was $325 million, an increase of 14% when compared to the second quarter. These results were driven by improved drilling-related services in Latin America and Middle East Asia, and increased project management and wireline services internationally. The exit from our Russia business negatively impacted financial results for both divisions. Moving on to geographic results, in North America, revenue in the third quarter was $2.6 billion, a 9% increase when compared to the second quarter. This increase was primarily driven by increased pressure pumping services and drilling-related services in North America land. These increases were partially offset by decreased activity across multiple product service lines in the Gulf of Mexico. Latin America revenue in the third quarter was $841 million, an 11% increase sequentially, driven by increased well construction services and project management activity in Mexico. Europe Africa revenue in the third quarter was $639 million, an 11% decrease sequentially, almost all of this reduction was related to exiting our Russia business. Middle East/Asia revenue in the third quarter was $1.2 billion, a 6% increase sequentially and primarily resulting from increased completion tool sales in the Arabian Gulf and higher drilling services activity in Saudi Arabia and Southeast Asia. In the third quarter, our corporate and other expenses were $62 million, which was in line with expectations. For the fourth quarter, we expect our corporate expense to be up slightly or roughly in line with second quarter. Net interest expense for the quarter was $93 million, a slight decrease due to higher yields on cash balances. For the fourth quarter, we expect this expense to decrease slightly due to lower debt balances. Other net expense for the quarter was $48 million, primarily related to currency losses driven by the strength of the U.S. dollar. For the fourth quarter, we expect this expense to remain approximately flat. Our normalized effective tax rate for the third quarter came in at approximately 22%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our fourth quarter effective tax rate to increase slightly. Capital expenditure for the third quarter were $251 million. We expect our full year capital expenditure to be in line with our target of 5% to 6% of revenue. Turning to cash flow, we generated $753 million of cash from operations and $543 million of free cash flow during the third quarter. We expect full year free cash flow to be in the range of last year\u2019s free cash flow. With the latest payment of $600 million, we have now retired $2.4 billion of debt since 2020. We are quickly approaching our near-term leverage target of 2 times gross debt-to-EBITDA. Given our balance sheet position and strong outlook, we now have greater flexibility to increase the cash we will return to shareholders through dividends and/or share buybacks under our existing repurchase program. Now let me turn to the near-term outlook. In the Completion and Production division, we expect fourth quarter revenue to grow in the low-to-mid single digits and margins to improve 50 basis points to 100 basis points. In the Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect fourth quarter revenue to grow in the low-to-mid single digits and margins to improve 75 basis points to 125 basis points. I will now turn the call back to Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Thanks, Eric. Let me summarize our discussion today. Halliburton\u2019s third quarter financial performance shows our strategy in action, delivering value for our shareholders. Oil and gas supply remains tight, requiring multiple years of investment. Demand for Halliburton services is strong. We will continue to execute on our strategic priorities that drive free cash flow and returns for our shareholders. And now, let\u2019s open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dave Anderson with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nDave Anderson: Hi. Good morning, Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Good morning, Dave.\nDave Anderson: So first question on U.S. land, so we often hear about budget exhaustion this time of year, but you actually are saying -- you are saying you are seeing stronger inbound than ever going to year end. I am curious as to how those inbounds have changed, are the inbounds more from public E&Ps versus privates? And I am also wondering, are these customers looking for term now, with such limited equipment available and does that get a premium?\nJeff Miller: Yeah. Look, I mean, we are certainly not seeing budget exhaustion. We remain sold out through the end of the year and into next year. So the market is strong and activity remains strong. And so as we look at what kind of inbounds are we getting, I\u2019d say, it\u2019s a mix, but it may be a little stronger towards larger companies. Let\u2019s just say it that way just given they want to be certain they have equipment for 2023. I expect that in North America, the more you work, the more you produce, the more we have to work and I think we are seeing that play out. At term, I would say that, people would like term. We view that as -- we have term, but at the same time, flexibility around pricing, just because, I really believe and I think it\u2019s pretty clear to us that 2023 remains extremely tight, both from an equipment standpoint, repair parts standpoint, you name it, so very encouraged about the outlook for 2023 in North America.\nDave Anderson: That makes sense. I locked in term right here. Shifting over to the Middle East, you talked about increased project management in the Middle East. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a little tricky to do, I was just curious if you could just think about all those projects collectively. Where are we on the overall kind of ramp-up, are you kind of halfway there, are you kind of -- do you -- are you in closer to fully ramped up? And I guess, secondarily, once you do get ramped up on this project management, is there another leg of growth out there in terms of more tenders or is it more likely to be follow-on potentially some upselling of these contracts. It\u2019s been a while since we have seen an upmarket in project management in Middle East?\nJeff Miller: Look, I think that really hasn\u2019t even begun in my view. I think we are just getting underway in terms of some of the bigger projects, discrete work starting. But I think we have got a long way to run internationally and in the Middle East in particular. And this is all consistent with sort of my earlier look on the macro in terms of, we didn\u2019t get here overnight. We got to where we are from a supply standpoint over eight years to 10 years and that\u2019s the kind of time frame that it takes to solve for. And I think the Middle East broadly takes a long view of this business, and as a result, when they are getting traction now, but it\u2019s not a knee-jerk reaction. It is a methodical march towards reserve extensions and adding reserves, which takes time and money, and so I am super encouraged about the outlook in the Middle East.\nDave Anderson: Thanks, Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nJames West: Hey. Good morning, Jeff and Eric.\nJeff Miller: Good morning, James.\nEric Carre: Good morning, James.\nJames West: So, Jeff, I wanted to dig in a little more on the International business, obviously, this quarter had some mixed results just given Russia coming out. But Halliburton as a company as at least I understand it and certainly you can elaborate on this, but you have spent the last the better part of the last three decades really building out a superior International franchise and one that should be competitive with your major peers or your major competitor here. Is there any reason that we should think that you would underperform or that you would outperform over the next several years in the International arena, given the outlook is as strong as kind of you are alluding to and certainly what we see in the market. We start with the Middle East, if you want, but there\u2019s also many other regions that are going to be showing really substantial growth. I am just curious kind of how Halliburton is set up for that?\nJeff Miller: Thanks, James. Look, we are extremely well set up for International expansion and have outgrown many quarters in the past and expect to continue to do so into the future based on our technology portfolio and our footprint internationally. Just for some context, Halliburton grew 21% internationally year-on-year, while exiting Russia this quarter, and of course, this is the quarter in Russia, where we typically see the pre-winter sort of step up in the 15% range, so that wasn\u2019t there. But we are seeing strong growth and expect to continue to see that internationally. I think also important to recall, I mentioned in my comments, was the strong international incrementals, which were basically on par with North America, which continues to demonstrate not only growth but margin expansion internationally. If I look ahead internationally, we are only halfway through our iCruise deployment.\nJames West: Right.\nJeff Miller: I think that all of that left to do. So I feel, like I said, really good, our production business is new and on plan and so I expect to continue growing revenue internationally and expanding margins. So I feel really good about our international outlook, actually better than I ever have.\nJames West: Okay. Well, that\u2019s a very strong statement. And perhaps to follow up on that, on the D&E side, which is an International bias, you are kind of hitting margin targets that we were anticipating for next year. So you are kind of already there. And do you think and as you see the outlook and I know you may not want to get bogged down in specific numbers, but how do you see that progression as we go through the end of this year and 2023?\nJeff Miller: Look, I expect to continue to see improvement. We are in the right markets. We have got extremely competitive portfolio. All service lines are contributing to that. I think the -- when I look out, I have always said about our D&E business that we were making meaningful investments in that business, probably, started saying that four years ago and then every year\u2026\nJames West: Right.\nJeff Miller: \u2026 we wanted to stack better margins on better margins, full year margin, and obviously, there\u2019s cyclicality throughout a year in weather and other stuff. But ultimately, the plan was to continue this march on stacking on better margins and that\u2019s what you are seeing. And as I have already said, if we are only halfway through deployment of what I think the flagship technology is in D&E, we should continue -- I expect to continue stacking those better margins up.\nJames West: Right. Got it. Okay. Thanks, Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nArun Jayaram: Yeah. Good morning, Jeff. I wanted to talk\u2026\nJeff Miller: Hi, Arun.\nArun Jayaram: \u2026 a little bit about the portfolio, I know one of your long-term ambitions is to grow house leverage to the production phase of the oil and gas life cycle versus just pure D&C. So I was wondering, if you could comment where you think you are on -- where you are at in terms of that journey and how you think about your potential to grow your share in things like lift and chemicals?\nJeff Miller: Look, I feel good about that. I mean it\u2019s all marching along as planned and we continue to grow. We are still in the very early innings of that International expansion, so call it, the second inning. So, but it\u2019s doing exactly what we had hoped. We continue to grow the footprint in the Middle East with lift and with chemicals. Chemicals is -- we put our first full scale production lot through the plant this month. That\u2019s an important first step and a lot of work to do. But again, the infrastructure is in place and we are getting access to market and making sales. The lift bottomline just a fantastic business in North America and it\u2019s the same technology that we apply internationally and so those guys are just dead focused on profitable market entries and growth and we are seeing that Latin America and in the Middle East.\nArun Jayaram: Great. And maybe just a follow-up for Eric. Eric, you highlighted your leverage target of 2 times. A number of your peers have announced some return of capital announcements at Liberty-Halliburton [ph] campaign. I was wondering, if you could maybe give us a little bit more thoughts on how you think about return of capital after reaching your deleveraging target and how you are thinking about future dividend growth versus buybacks?\nEric Carre: Right. So, thanks, Arun. So what we have said for the last couple of years is that, our priority number one was really to get our balance sheet in order. So with the $600 million that we have retired in Q3 that puts us at about $2.4 billion retired since 2020, $1.2 billion retired this year alone. So if you combine that with our improved business performance for all practical purposes, we are at our target and considering as well our positive outlook we see no reason for that to change. So really big picture we are starting to turn our attention now to returning more cash to shareholders. So we are working through scenarios. We are engaging our Board. So, more details to come.\nArun Jayaram: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nChase Mulvehill: Hey. Good morning, everybody. So, I guess, first, I kind of want to hit on margins and if we kind of look at how your pre-shale margins, so call it, 2011 and maybe going all the way back to kind of 2006 and 2008 timeframe, you did mid-to-high 20% EBITDA margins. Today, you are sitting in the low 20$s. So, Jeff, I don\u2019t -- could you just kind of walk us through what would need to happen to get back to these type of margins and whether you even think that this is possible to kind of get back to those type of margin levels in this cycle?\nJeff Miller: Look, I think, the key thing about this cycle is its duration and it\u2019s the right kind of cycle from a duration standpoint that I think we grow into better margins as we continue forward. So I am not going to try to put a date or a time. But my expectation is the duration of the market, sort of the behavior that I described to both operators and service companies, which is absolutely rational in terms of returning cash to shareholders, which is what Eric just talked about. This is the kind of cycle where we are able to do that and I think setting up for margin improvement, the EBITDA strengthening, all of those are the things that create the free cash flow. And I think that historically, actually, I really haven\u2019t seen the cycle set up where we have got short supply the way that we do and the sort of runway that I see in front of us and all of the right sort of motivation by the industry. I think energy is a fantastic industry and I think what you are going to see is the demonstration from the entire industry of what returning cash to shareholders and generating meaningful returns look like over a good cycle, long cycle.\nChase Mulvehill: Yeah. Perfect. Just to follow-up on International markets. Could you just talk about how tight the markets are today, what kind of pricing momentum that you are seeing and when you think about idled or spare capacity across international markets, at least for Halliburton, do you see an opportunity to continue to kind of mobilize the tighter markets or do you have a lot less spare capacity and what did that mean for CapEx for next year on the International side?\nJeff Miller: Well, from a CapEx standpoint, we have already described that we are in the 5% to 6% range of revenues on CapEx. So what we do is deploy capital to the best opportunities, which opportunity -- which international markets demonstrate important opportunity, so we would direct capital that way as opposed to others. But I think what\u2019s important about the market as we are just seeing customer urgency return in the sense that quality matters equipment matters. Is it tight, yes, it\u2019s tight. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of spare capacity anywhere in the world. If I go back to our strategic tenants, it\u2019s profitable growth internationally and asset velocity. And I think what you see is that asset velocity being baked into just the way that we work is creating the ability to do a lot more with less than we ever have in the past. And that\u2019s one of the key reasons we are confident in our capital spend levels is because of the type of equipment we are putting in the market, its ability to be moved around, work longer, repair faster, and when we do all of those things, it just makes us a much better effective business internationally.\nChase Mulvehill: Okay. I appreciate the color. I will turn it back over. Thanks, Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Yeah. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nNeil Mehta: Yeah. Good morning, team. The first question was around North America. You mentioned that you continue to see revenue growth in North America and that there is increased demand for a limited set of equipment. Can you talk about what the moving pieces are there? What kind of equipment type -- types of equipment are we talking about and how do you think about adding frac capacity, is there a demand for it as you look out in the market into 2023?\nJeff Miller: Well, the activity we really see is, let\u2019s just describe it as service intensity, which is increasing and that\u2019s more reps on equipment, more sand through equipment. We are also seeing our drilling activity in the U.S. as well, so all services related to D&E. But principally, frac, and so as it works harder, it grow, I mean, that generates more value for us and so that\u2019s probably the principal thing. When I think about capacity, we are maximizing value in North America and we are growing profitably internationally, and that automatically balances where we spend our money and how we approach markets. North America from a capacity standpoint for us, really we look at eFleets and it\u2019s not really capacity, I view it as replacement over different time horizons. But we -- the conversations, for example, that we are having about eFleets are not anything really immediate. It\u2019s all around late 2023, 2024, 2025 in terms of eFleet additions and so that will likely wind up replacing equipment over time. Yeah, so I am really encouraged about where the market goes. It\u2019s extremely tight, it\u2019s tight for repair parts, it\u2019s tight for just everything, and we have all talked about sort of bottlenecks in the supply chain. I know that\u2019s really going to rectify itself over any sort of short horizon. So I think that under all conditions North America is tight. I think capacity\u2026\nNeil Mehta: Yeah.\nJeff Miller: \u2026 could be added in a meaningful way even if it was desired.\nNeil Mehta: Yeah. That\u2019s great perspective. And then just some early thoughts on 2023 in terms of what you are hearing from customers in terms of activity and any early thoughts around what you expect spending increases to be both in the U.S. and internationally as a percentage, and how much do you think inflation will be as a component of that increase?\nJeff Miller: Look, I think, we have got strong growth as we look into next year. Really, we don\u2019t haven\u2019t even seen budgets from customers, but expect that growth to be strong. Clearly, we are going to be up from here, I guess, is how I would describe next year, up from where we are today, and obviously, that\u2019s really strong growth that we have seen over the last year. So I think that the North America demand continues to increase and internationally we have already talked quite a bit about that. But I expect that we will see growth really everywhere in the sense that customers can be busy, they will be busy. I think the traction in the Middle East is just getting underway and I think that we will continue to see a tightening. And I continue to view this as a margin cycle as opposed to necessarily, it\u2019s not a build cycle, it\u2019s a margin cycle and I think that we are going to be the real beneficiaries of that at Halliburton.\nNeil Mehta: Thank you, Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber with Citi. Your line is now open.\nScott Gruber: Yes. Good morning.\nJeff Miller: Good morning, Scott.\nEric Carre: Good morning.\nScott Gruber: The smaller pumpers here domestically have discussed replacing about 10% of their fleet annually, generally with e-frac additions. As we think about Halliburton, is that a rough guide for you all, assuming returns stay positive or do you have a different framework? How do you think about that kind of multiyear replacement cycle?\nJeff Miller: Yeah. Look, what we are seeing, we have a healthy fleet today and we have a healthy fleet, because we have always reinvested in our fleet through thick and thin. I mean, at the worst of the market, the best of the market, we are always maintaining a replacement cycle for equipment and we get the benefit of that all of the time. When I look at the market, I have feedback from a customer recently that a lot of the equipment out there looks just dead on its feet. Don\u2019t know how to get it replaced fast enough. I think that the pace at which we are working, what comes with the service intensity I described for frac equipment is just more revolutions and you can\u2019t meet physics and so I think that when we look at replacement cycle, we view it as an electric replacement cycle. And so we have focused on that. We have got leading technology. And we are seeing strong pull from our customers for that technology. And so what we are doing is, as [Audio Gap] we get -- demand and pull translates into contracts of duration that return capital and cost -- and margin and capital, the actual return of capital all happen inside the same contract. And that demonstrates for me, the strength of the technology and also what that pull looks like. But it\u2019s not something we rush to do. It\u2019s something we do as the pull is adequate to sign that equipment up and it\u2019s going to be over a period of time.\nScott Gruber: Got it. Okay. No. Very well guys. I appreciate the color. And then turning to -- back to the International markets, you had impressive growth internationally even without Russia this quarter, as you highlighted. We had a few inbounds though this morning trying to ascertain exactly what the International growth was year-on-year excluding Russia. I apologize if you mentioned that number earlier, I may have missed it, but are you able to share with us what that\u2026\nJeff Miller: Yeah. Yeah. It\u2019s\u2026\nScott Gruber: \u2026 growth was?\nJeff Miller: Yeah. It\u2019s 21% year-on-year International growth.\nScott Gruber: Was that inclusive of the -- of Russia or excluding Russia?\nJeff Miller: That\u2019s excluding -- well, that\u2019s -- Russia -- while we had Russia and excluding Russia for the last quarter.\nEric Carre: With Russia in H1 and without Russia in Q3.\nScott Gruber: Right. Do you have the number outside of Russia, how quickly you guys grew year-on-year?\nJeff Miller: That I don\u2019t know.\nEric Carre: No.\nJeff Miller: But it would have been substantially -- it would have been more.\nScott Gruber: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I could follow-up. Okay. Thank you.\nJeff Miller: All right. Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nStephen Gengaro: Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen.\nJeff Miller: Good morning, Stephen.\nStephen Gengaro: Two things for me. One just from a North American perspective, how are the conversations with customers about price? I mean, obviously, pricing has been improving for a while now, is there a pushback yet? How do the conversations go as far as 2023 pricing for frac and how do you think that plays out as you go forward?\nJeff Miller: Look, I am absolutely not going to get into details around price discussions with customers. Look, I think that, I have already said, I view that pricing strengthens. We are still below pre-pandemic levels in terms of pricing, so there\u2019s room to improve there. Service quality and technology are both driving premiums. I have talked about sort of pull on eFleets and just general performance and maintenance of the fleet. Pricing is always going to be iterative. It\u2019s not giant steps. It\u2019s what I talked about like throughout the year that gets us to where we are today and I think there\u2019s a lot of power in having a structurally advantaged low emissions fleet, which is what we have out there today.\nStephen Gengaro: Is it\u2026\nJeff Miller: Yeah, I think, one of the things that was left out of the conversation is securing capacity for 2023, reliable capacity, obviously, Halliburton we -- we are the execution company, we do what we say and so we are very reliable in terms of delivery. And I think securing that kind of capacity for 2023 is a high priority for our customers.\nStephen Gengaro: And just as a follow-up, do you see -- is there a gap and how much in conversations the sort of cost of diesel relative to the lower cost of running eFleets play into either the gap in price or the conversations about pricing?\nJeff Miller: Again, ignoring price, the conversation around the eFleets is really that it\u2019s a better mousetrap over the long run. Is it more efficient to operate? Yes, it is. It should -- it creates value from a price standpoint, but it also creates value from an effectiveness standpoint, the ability to pump. These fleets are extremely reliable and then we took one out of the box and it pumped 500 hours first month. I mean that\u2019s the type of reliability we are seeing out of the equipment. So I think all of that conspires to make it sought after in the marketplace. That\u2019s why we see the pulls. Is cost a component? It probably is. I am sure it is for our clients, it always is. But I think it would be wrong to ignore the other components of value there.\nStephen Gengaro: Great. Okay. Thank you.\nJeff Miller: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nRoger Read: Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. I guess I\u2019d like to ask the question a little bit differently on the capacity versus investment and tightness of new equipment, spare parts and everything, as you said, Jeff. But if we were to look at, maybe work you have turned down in North America or contracts that you either don\u2019t want to bid on internationally or bid maybe less aggressively, has there been any change in that as we look across the course of 2022 and maybe what you are seeing for the early parts of 2023?\nJeff Miller: It would be returning more not less in terms of, that\u2019s part of how we improve margins on the overall portfolio and returns. But we have been really consistent about our strategy and maximizing value in North America growing profitably internationally and that is one of the key levers that we have to do both of those things. And so, yes, we have done both of those.\nRoger Read: Yeah. But I guess I am just wondering, I mean, you are turning down more not less, is it a material amount at this point or is it still pretty much just on the margin you see a project that\u2019s not interesting or enticing?\nJeff Miller: Look, I think, that it\u2019s -- clearly it\u2019s -- I don\u2019t know how to describe that is that at the margin. It\u2019s probably at the margin, but it is going to grow as the market continues to get tighter. We are building, I have already described, our CapEx and so we will be adding. We have been able to grow with the CapEx levels that we have had. I\u2019d say, meaningfully, over the last year and expect that we will continue to grow because of the way that we are building equipment. So it\u2019s not we are turning everything down by any means. But I think it\u2019s an important point that we are much more, I mean, the contracts that we pursue and win are accretive to what we are doing and if they are not, then they probably fall out of the list, just because we want to -- even the new capital that we would have, whether it\u2019s drilling equipment or anything else that\u2019s going to go towards things that are of higher value.\nRoger Read: Yeah. It makes sense. So glad to hear there\u2019s better selectivity out there. And then my other question was to follow-up. You mentioned tight for kind of everything in terms of new equipment, spare parts, et cetera. I know you are very integrated on the pressure pumping side in terms of manufacturing. But as you work with subcontracts, are you trying to do anything different in terms of helping them increase capacity or are we just -- the system is tight and there\u2019s not really much prospect for change in terms of, I am just thinking the supply chain all the way down on the types of equipment where you want to expand or where there\u2019s a relatively high maintenance component?\nJeff Miller: Look, it will get fixed over time, but in most of these cases, there\u2019s not a lot that can be done to accelerate their supply chain when it\u2019s far reaching. Clearly, we plan ahead and we have been planning ahead for over a year. We have got great visibility. But that market will just be tight for spare parts and equipment.\nRoger Read: All right. Appreciate that. Thank you.\nJeff Miller: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Your line is now open. Marc Bianchi with Cowen, your line is now open.\nJeff Miller: All right.\nOperator: Please shut your mute button. Thank you. And I am currently showing no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Jeff Miller for closing remarks.\nJeff Miller: Yeah. Thank you, Shannon, and thank you all for participating in today\u2019s call. Just let me summarize with a few key points. Halliburton\u2019s strong third quarter performance shows our strategy is delivering value for our shareholders. Oil and gas supply, shortness constraints and shortages I see today create strong and growing demand for Halliburton\u2019s equipment and services in support of this multiyear upcycle. At Halliburton, we will continue to execute on our strategic priorities to drive free cash flow and we will support of this multiyear. Looking forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Please close out the call.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Eric Carre",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Let me begin with a summary of our third quarter results. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.4 billion, a 6% increase over the second quarter, while operating income was $846 million, an increase of 18% over second quarter adjusted operating income. Globally, higher activity and pricing improvement supported these strong results. Operating margin for the company was 16% in the third quarter, 164-basis-point increase over second quarter adjusted operating margin and 393 basis points over adjusted operating margin in the third quarter of 2021. Our third quarter reported net income per diluted share was $0.60, an increase of $0.11 or 22% from second quarter adjusted net income per diluted share and more than doubled the adjusted net income per diluted share for the same period last year. Beginning with our Completion and Production division, revenue in the third quarter was $3.1 billion, an 8% increase when compared to the second quarter, while operating income was $583 million, an increase of 17% when compared to the second quarter. These results were driven by increased pressure pumping services, primarily in North America land and increased completion tool sales in Middle East Asia. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in the third quarter was $2.2 billion, an increase of 3% when compared to the second quarter, while operating income was $325 million, an increase of 14% when compared to the second quarter. These results were driven by improved drilling-related services in Latin America and Middle East Asia, and increased project management and wireline services internationally. The exit from our Russia business negatively impacted financial results for both divisions. Moving on to geographic results, in North America, revenue in the third quarter was $2.6 billion, a 9% increase when compared to the second quarter. This increase was primarily driven by increased pressure pumping services and drilling-related services in North America land. These increases were partially offset by decreased activity across multiple product service lines in the Gulf of Mexico. Latin America revenue in the third quarter was $841 million, an 11% increase sequentially, driven by increased well construction services and project management activity in Mexico. Europe Africa revenue in the third quarter was $639 million, an 11% decrease sequentially, almost all of this reduction was related to exiting our Russia business. Middle East/Asia revenue in the third quarter was $1.2 billion, a 6% increase sequentially and primarily resulting from increased completion tool sales in the Arabian Gulf and higher drilling services activity in Saudi Arabia and Southeast Asia. In the third quarter, our corporate and other expenses were $62 million, which was in line with expectations. For the fourth quarter, we expect our corporate expense to be up slightly or roughly in line with second quarter. Net interest expense for the quarter was $93 million, a slight decrease due to higher yields on cash balances. For the fourth quarter, we expect this expense to decrease slightly due to lower debt balances. Other net expense for the quarter was $48 million, primarily related to currency losses driven by the strength of the U.S. dollar. For the fourth quarter, we expect this expense to remain approximately flat. Our normalized effective tax rate for the third quarter came in at approximately 22%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our fourth quarter effective tax rate to increase slightly. Capital expenditure for the third quarter were $251 million. We expect our full year capital expenditure to be in line with our target of 5% to 6% of revenue. Turning to cash flow, we generated $753 million of cash from operations and $543 million of free cash flow during the third quarter. We expect full year free cash flow to be in the range of last year's free cash flow. With the latest payment of $600 million, we have now retired $2.4 billion of debt since 2020. We are quickly approaching our near-term leverage target of 2 times gross debt-to-EBITDA. Given our balance sheet position and strong outlook, we now have greater flexibility to increase the cash we will return to shareholders through dividends and/or share buybacks under our existing repurchase program. Now let me turn to the near-term outlook. In the Completion and Production division, we expect fourth quarter revenue to grow in the low-to-mid single digits and margins to improve 50 basis points to 100 basis points. In the Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect fourth quarter revenue to grow in the low-to-mid single digits and margins to improve 75 basis points to 125 basis points. I will now turn the call back to Jeff. Good morning, James. Right. So, thanks, Arun. So what we have said for the last couple of years is that, our priority number one was really to get our balance sheet in order. So with the $600 million that we have retired in Q3 that puts us at about $2.4 billion retired since 2020, $1.2 billion retired this year alone. So if you combine that with our improved business performance for all practical purposes, we are at our target and considering as well our positive outlook we see no reason for that to change. So really big picture we are starting to turn our attention now to returning more cash to shareholders. So we are working through scenarios. We are engaging our Board. So, more details to come. Good morning. With Russia in H1 and without Russia in Q3. No."

            "name": "Jeff Miller",
            "content": "Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Our outlook today is strong, oil and gas supply remains tight for the foreseeable future, International market activity is accelerating and North America service capacity continues to further tighten. As a result, pricing is moving up in both markets. Halliburton's strong third quarter results demonstrate the power of our strategy. Here are some highlights. Total company revenue increased 6% sequentially as both North America and International activity continue to expand. Operating income grew 18% compared to adjusted operating income from the second quarter with improved margin performance in both divisions. Our overall operating income margin was 16% representing 45% incremental margins over last quarter's adjusted operating income. Our Completion and Production division revenue increased 8% over last quarter, driven by completions activity and pricing in North America and International markets. C&P delivered operating margin of 19% in the third quarter. The Drilling and Evaluation division revenue grew 3%. Operating margin of 15% increased 140 basis points sequentially and 380 basis points above the same period last year, demonstrating the earnings power and global competitiveness of our D&E business. North America revenue grew almost 9% sequentially as both drilling and completions activity improved throughout the third quarter. Pricing gains and activity increases across both divisions drove these results. International revenue grew 3% sequentially with improved activity in the Middle East and Latin America that more than offset the revenue decline related to exiting our Russia business. Importantly, during the third quarter, we generated similar incremental margins in both international and North America markets. Finally, we generated free cash flow of $543 million and retired $600 million of debt during the quarter. I am pleased with the third quarter results. I want to express my appreciation to the men and women of Halliburton whose hard work and dedication made these results possible. Your commitment to collaboration, safety and service quality everyday make Halliburton successful. Turning to our macro outlook. Oil and gas supply remains fundamentally tight due to multiple years of underinvestment. This tightness is apparent in historically low inventory levels, production levels well below expectations and temporary actions such as the largest ever SPR release. Against tight supply, demand for oil and gas is strong and we believe it will remain so. While broader market volatility is clear, what we see in our business is strong and growing demand for equipment and services. There is no immediate solution to balance the world's demand for secure and reliable oil and gas against its limited supply. I believe that only multiple years of increased investment in existing and new sources of production will solve the short supply. The effective solution to short supply is conventional and unconventional, deepwater and shallow water, new and existing developments, and short and long cycle barrels, all of it. I expect progress towards increased supply will be measured in years, not months as behavior of both operators and service companies have changed. Operators remain disciplined. Their commitments to investor returns require a measured approach to growth and investment. Service companies follow the same discipline, delivering on their commitments to investor returns and taking a measured approach to growth and investment. What I think is underappreciated is how this results in more sustainable growth and returns over a longer period of time. Let's turn now to Halliburton's performance, starting with the International markets. Our third quarter performance demonstrates the strength of our strategy to deliver profitable International growth through improved pricing, selective contract wins and the competitiveness of our technology offerings. International revenue in the third quarter for the C&P and D&E divisions grew year-over-year from a percentage standpoint in the high teens and mid-20s, respectively, which outpaced International rig count growth and reflects our competitiveness in all markets. Our year-over-year growth and the margin expansion demonstrated by both divisions give me confidence in the earnings power of our International business. Looking forward, I see activity increasing around the world, from the smallest to the largest countries and producers. I expect the areas of strongest growth will be the Middle East, led by Saudi Arabia, but with meaningful activity increases in the UAE, Qatar, Iraq and Kuwait. Elsewhere, Brazil, Guyana and many others have also signaled a commitment to increased activity. Throughout these markets, I am pleased with the broad adoption of our new directional drilling platform such as iCruise and EarthStar. Importantly, these broad-based activity increases serve to tighten equipment availability and drive price increases in our International business. Shifting to North America, we had a fantastic quarter. Our solid performance demonstrates our strategy to maximize value in North America. We achieved this through improved pricing, partnering with high quality customers and differentiated technology. Our revenue grew 9% sequentially and is up 63% over the third quarter last year. Pricing continues to improve across all product lines and completions equipment remains extremely tight across the market. Interest in eFleets is strong and customers are pleased with the superior efficiencies, operational uptime and reduced carbon footprint of our market-leading solution. Looking into 2023, I see continued growth. The inbounds for calendar slots are stronger than I have ever seen at this point in the year. More importantly, I see increased demand for a limited set of equipment and an environment where technology and performance are increasingly valued, all perfectly set up for Halliburton to maximize value in North America. Market consolidation, competitors that answer to public investors, disciplined customers and supply chain constraints, all drive the services market that I expect to remain tight for the foreseeable future. Halliburton will continue to outperform in this market. Our best-in-class Zeus eFleets have pumped over 20,000 hours for customers. Our eFleet customers know that they have a field-proven technology, which carries the full weight of Halliburton's expertise to build, run and optimize this next-generation equipment. Additionally, our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing system continues to gain traction and we expect an almost eight-fold increase in stages completed this year. SmartFleet gives customers unparalleled access to data about where and how their fractures permeate, the potential for frac hits on adjacent wells and the real-time data necessary to improve completion designs. In all markets, Halliburton's strong financial performance demonstrates its strategy and action, profitable international growth, maximizing value in North America and improved asset velocity to deliver value for our shareholders today. These strategies equip us to outperform under any market conditions, but especially to maximize returns through this up cycle. Execution is at the heart of Halliburton's identity. We collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. You have seen that in action in today's results. You can hear how excited I am about Halliburton's future all around the world. The structural demand for more oil and gas supply provides strong tailwinds for our business and Halliburton is ideally positioned to deliver improved profitability and increased returns for shareholders. Now I will turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our third quarter financial results. Eric? Thanks, Eric. Let me summarize our discussion today. Halliburton's third quarter financial performance shows our strategy in action, delivering value for our shareholders. Oil and gas supply remains tight, requiring multiple years of investment. Demand for Halliburton services is strong. We will continue to execute on our strategic priorities that drive free cash flow and returns for our shareholders. And now, let's open it up for questions. Good morning, Dave. Yeah. Look, I mean, we are certainly not seeing budget exhaustion. We remain sold out through the end of the year and into next year. So the market is strong and activity remains strong. And so as we look at what kind of inbounds are we getting, I'd say, it's a mix, but it may be a little stronger towards larger companies. Let's just say it that way just given they want to be certain they have equipment for 2023. I expect that in North America, the more you work, the more you produce, the more we have to work and I think we are seeing that play out. At term, I would say that, people would like term. We view that as -- we have term, but at the same time, flexibility around pricing, just because, I really believe and I think it's pretty clear to us that 2023 remains extremely tight, both from an equipment standpoint, repair parts standpoint, you name it, so very encouraged about the outlook for 2023 in North America. Look, I think that really hasn't even begun in my view. I think we are just getting underway in terms of some of the bigger projects, discrete work starting. But I think we have got a long way to run internationally and in the Middle East in particular. And this is all consistent with sort of my earlier look on the macro in terms of, we didn't get here overnight. We got to where we are from a supply standpoint over eight years to 10 years and that's the kind of time frame that it takes to solve for. And I think the Middle East broadly takes a long view of this business, and as a result, when they are getting traction now, but it's not a knee-jerk reaction. It is a methodical march towards reserve extensions and adding reserves, which takes time and money, and so I am super encouraged about the outlook in the Middle East. Thank you. Good morning, James. Thanks, James. Look, we are extremely well set up for International expansion and have outgrown many quarters in the past and expect to continue to do so into the future based on our technology portfolio and our footprint internationally. Just for some context, Halliburton grew 21% internationally year-on-year, while exiting Russia this quarter, and of course, this is the quarter in Russia, where we typically see the pre-winter sort of step up in the 15% range, so that wasn't there. But we are seeing strong growth and expect to continue to see that internationally. I think also important to recall, I mentioned in my comments, was the strong international incrementals, which were basically on par with North America, which continues to demonstrate not only growth but margin expansion internationally. If I look ahead internationally, we are only halfway through our iCruise deployment. I think that all of that left to do. So I feel, like I said, really good, our production business is new and on plan and so I expect to continue growing revenue internationally and expanding margins. So I feel really good about our international outlook, actually better than I ever have. Look, I expect to continue to see improvement. We are in the right markets. We have got extremely competitive portfolio. All service lines are contributing to that. I think the -- when I look out, I have always said about our D&E business that we were making meaningful investments in that business, probably, started saying that four years ago and then every year... ... we wanted to stack better margins on better margins, full year margin, and obviously, there's cyclicality throughout a year in weather and other stuff. But ultimately, the plan was to continue this march on stacking on better margins and that's what you are seeing. And as I have already said, if we are only halfway through deployment of what I think the flagship technology is in D&E, we should continue -- I expect to continue stacking those better margins up. Yeah. Thank you. Hi, Arun. Look, I feel good about that. I mean it's all marching along as planned and we continue to grow. We are still in the very early innings of that International expansion, so call it, the second inning. So, but it's doing exactly what we had hoped. We continue to grow the footprint in the Middle East with lift and with chemicals. Chemicals is -- we put our first full scale production lot through the plant this month. That's an important first step and a lot of work to do. But again, the infrastructure is in place and we are getting access to market and making sales. The lift bottomline just a fantastic business in North America and it's the same technology that we apply internationally and so those guys are just dead focused on profitable market entries and growth and we are seeing that Latin America and in the Middle East. Look, I think, the key thing about this cycle is its duration and it's the right kind of cycle from a duration standpoint that I think we grow into better margins as we continue forward. So I am not going to try to put a date or a time. But my expectation is the duration of the market, sort of the behavior that I described to both operators and service companies, which is absolutely rational in terms of returning cash to shareholders, which is what Eric just talked about. This is the kind of cycle where we are able to do that and I think setting up for margin improvement, the EBITDA strengthening, all of those are the things that create the free cash flow. And I think that historically, actually, I really haven't seen the cycle set up where we have got short supply the way that we do and the sort of runway that I see in front of us and all of the right sort of motivation by the industry. I think energy is a fantastic industry and I think what you are going to see is the demonstration from the entire industry of what returning cash to shareholders and generating meaningful returns look like over a good cycle, long cycle. Well, from a CapEx standpoint, we have already described that we are in the 5% to 6% range of revenues on CapEx. So what we do is deploy capital to the best opportunities, which opportunity -- which international markets demonstrate important opportunity, so we would direct capital that way as opposed to others. But I think what's important about the market as we are just seeing customer urgency return in the sense that quality matters equipment matters. Is it tight, yes, it's tight. I don't think there's a lot of spare capacity anywhere in the world. If I go back to our strategic tenants, it's profitable growth internationally and asset velocity. And I think what you see is that asset velocity being baked into just the way that we work is creating the ability to do a lot more with less than we ever have in the past. And that's one of the key reasons we are confident in our capital spend levels is because of the type of equipment we are putting in the market, its ability to be moved around, work longer, repair faster, and when we do all of those things, it just makes us a much better effective business internationally. Yeah. Thanks. Well, the activity we really see is, let's just describe it as service intensity, which is increasing and that's more reps on equipment, more sand through equipment. We are also seeing our drilling activity in the U.S. as well, so all services related to D&E. But principally, frac, and so as it works harder, it grow, I mean, that generates more value for us and so that's probably the principal thing. When I think about capacity, we are maximizing value in North America and we are growing profitably internationally, and that automatically balances where we spend our money and how we approach markets. North America from a capacity standpoint for us, really we look at eFleets and it's not really capacity, I view it as replacement over different time horizons. But we -- the conversations, for example, that we are having about eFleets are not anything really immediate. It's all around late 2023, 2024, 2025 in terms of eFleet additions and so that will likely wind up replacing equipment over time. Yeah, so I am really encouraged about where the market goes. It's extremely tight, it's tight for repair parts, it's tight for just everything, and we have all talked about sort of bottlenecks in the supply chain. I know that's really going to rectify itself over any sort of short horizon. So I think that under all conditions North America is tight. I think capacity... ... could be added in a meaningful way even if it was desired. Look, I think, we have got strong growth as we look into next year. Really, we don't haven't even seen budgets from customers, but expect that growth to be strong. Clearly, we are going to be up from here, I guess, is how I would describe next year, up from where we are today, and obviously, that's really strong growth that we have seen over the last year. So I think that the North America demand continues to increase and internationally we have already talked quite a bit about that. But I expect that we will see growth really everywhere in the sense that customers can be busy, they will be busy. I think the traction in the Middle East is just getting underway and I think that we will continue to see a tightening. And I continue to view this as a margin cycle as opposed to necessarily, it's not a build cycle, it's a margin cycle and I think that we are going to be the real beneficiaries of that at Halliburton. Yes. Good morning, Scott. Yeah. Look, what we are seeing, we have a healthy fleet today and we have a healthy fleet, because we have always reinvested in our fleet through thick and thin. I mean, at the worst of the market, the best of the market, we are always maintaining a replacement cycle for equipment and we get the benefit of that all of the time. When I look at the market, I have feedback from a customer recently that a lot of the equipment out there looks just dead on its feet. Don't know how to get it replaced fast enough. I think that the pace at which we are working, what comes with the service intensity I described for frac equipment is just more revolutions and you can't meet physics and so I think that when we look at replacement cycle, we view it as an electric replacement cycle. And so we have focused on that. We have got leading technology. And we are seeing strong pull from our customers for that technology. And so what we are doing is, as [Audio Gap] we get -- demand and pull translates into contracts of duration that return capital and cost -- and margin and capital, the actual return of capital all happen inside the same contract. And that demonstrates for me, the strength of the technology and also what that pull looks like. But it's not something we rush to do. It's something we do as the pull is adequate to sign that equipment up and it's going to be over a period of time. Yeah. Yeah. It's... Yeah. It's 21% year-on-year International growth. That's excluding -- well, that's -- Russia -- while we had Russia and excluding Russia for the last quarter. That I don't know. But it would have been substantially -- it would have been more. All right. Thanks, Scott. Good morning, Stephen. Look, I am absolutely not going to get into details around price discussions with customers. Look, I think that, I have already said, I view that pricing strengthens. We are still below pre-pandemic levels in terms of pricing, so there's room to improve there. Service quality and technology are both driving premiums. I have talked about sort of pull on eFleets and just general performance and maintenance of the fleet. Pricing is always going to be iterative. It's not giant steps. It's what I talked about like throughout the year that gets us to where we are today and I think there's a lot of power in having a structurally advantaged low emissions fleet, which is what we have out there today. Yeah, I think, one of the things that was left out of the conversation is securing capacity for 2023, reliable capacity, obviously, Halliburton we -- we are the execution company, we do what we say and so we are very reliable in terms of delivery. And I think securing that kind of capacity for 2023 is a high priority for our customers. Again, ignoring price, the conversation around the eFleets is really that it's a better mousetrap over the long run. Is it more efficient to operate? Yes, it is. It should -- it creates value from a price standpoint, but it also creates value from an effectiveness standpoint, the ability to pump. These fleets are extremely reliable and then we took one out of the box and it pumped 500 hours first month. I mean that's the type of reliability we are seeing out of the equipment. So I think all of that conspires to make it sought after in the marketplace. That's why we see the pulls. Is cost a component? It probably is. I am sure it is for our clients, it always is. But I think it would be wrong to ignore the other components of value there. Thank you. It would be returning more not less in terms of, that's part of how we improve margins on the overall portfolio and returns. But we have been really consistent about our strategy and maximizing value in North America growing profitably internationally and that is one of the key levers that we have to do both of those things. And so, yes, we have done both of those. Look, I think, that it's -- clearly it's -- I don't know how to describe that is that at the margin. It's probably at the margin, but it is going to grow as the market continues to get tighter. We are building, I have already described, our CapEx and so we will be adding. We have been able to grow with the CapEx levels that we have had. I'd say, meaningfully, over the last year and expect that we will continue to grow because of the way that we are building equipment. So it's not we are turning everything down by any means. But I think it's an important point that we are much more, I mean, the contracts that we pursue and win are accretive to what we are doing and if they are not, then they probably fall out of the list, just because we want to -- even the new capital that we would have, whether it's drilling equipment or anything else that's going to go towards things that are of higher value. Look, it will get fixed over time, but in most of these cases, there's not a lot that can be done to accelerate their supply chain when it's far reaching. Clearly, we plan ahead and we have been planning ahead for over a year. We have got great visibility. But that market will just be tight for spare parts and equipment. All right. Thank you. All right. Yeah. Thank you, Shannon, and thank you all for participating in today's call. Just let me summarize with a few key points. Halliburton's strong third quarter performance shows our strategy is delivering value for our shareholders. Oil and gas supply, shortness constraints and shortages I see today create strong and growing demand for Halliburton's equipment and services in support of this multiyear upcycle. At Halliburton, we will continue to execute on our strategic priorities to drive free cash flow and we will support of this multiyear. Looking forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Please close out the call."

Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. This was an excellent quarter. Our financial performance shows that our strategy is working and driving value. Let's get right to the highlights. Total company revenue increased 18% sequentially as both North America and international activity continued to improve in unison. Adjusted operating income grew 35% with strong margin performance in both divisions. Our Completion and Production division revenue increased 24% driven by robust completions activity in North America and international markets. C&P delivered operating margin of 17% in the second quarter, the first time it reached this level since 2014. Our Drilling and Evaluation division revenue grew 12%. Operating margin of 13% was down sequentially as expected due to the seasonal drop-off in software sales but increased 270 basis points year-on-year. This gives us confidence in the strengthening margin profile of our D&E business. North America revenue grew 26% as both drilling and completions activity marched higher throughout the second quarter. Strong net pricing gains across all product service lines supported sequential margin expansion. International revenue grew 12% sequentially with activity accelerating in all international regions, particularly Latin America and the Middle East. Finally, we recorded a historic best operational performance as measured by nonproductive time for the first six months of this year. I am pleased with the strong performance Halliburton delivered in the first half of this year, and I thank all Halliburton employees for their hard work, contribution to these outstanding results and dedication to superior service quality. Before we discuss our execution in the international and North America markets, let me address recent market volatility. In the second quarter, central banks took actions and an attempt to control inflation, raising concerns about a potential economic slowdown. Despite this near-term volatility, I believe the oil and gas market fundamentals still strongly support a multiyear energy upcycle. From a demand perspective, oil and gas remains a critical component of long-term economic growth. Post pandemic economic expansion, energy security requirements and population growth will continue to drive demand. Today, oil and gas supply is tight, despite an environment muted by ongoing China lockdowns and jet fuel demand below historical norms. Meaningful supply solutions will take time, OPEC spare capacity is at historical lows, the strategic petroleum reserve release is unsustainable, and the risk to Russia supply remains high. On the industry side, despite high commodity prices, operators remain disciplined because of investor return requirements, public ESG commitments and regulatory pressure. In response, service companies invested for returns and did not overbuild. In short, this cycle has been nothing like prior cycles. This means, any economic slowdown will not solve the structural oil undersupply problem. At Halliburton, the steps we took to improve operating leverage, lower capital intensity and strengthen our balance sheet best equip us to outperform under any market conditions. Here's why we believe that. First, we used the pandemic to redesign the cost profile of our business. We structurally removed over $1 billion of costs, the most aggressive cost reductions in our history. This gives us strong and sustainable operating leverage that we see today in meaningful year-on-year margin expansion in both divisions. Second, we fundamentally lowered the capital intensity of our business and set our CapEx target at 5% to 6% of revenue compared to 10% to 11% in the prior upcycle. We advanced our technology so that new generations of equipment would have higher capital velocity. This lower capital profile is key to our strong free cash flow generation. Finally, we prioritize strengthening our balance sheet and retired $1.8 billion of debt since the beginning of 2020. This reduced our cash interest expense and put us within striking distance of our leverage targets. Now, let's turn to our second quarter performance and expectations for the rest of 2022. With energy security firmly in focus, the diversification of supply sources is the central theme in the international markets. Never has energy security been a bigger issue to governments and people all over the world. However, political agendas and years of underinvestment in many markets make it harder to address this critical requirement. As I look across the international markets, our customer spend remains on track to increase by mid-teens this year, with the Middle East and Latin America expected to grow the most on a full year basis. New project announcements across the world, including in the Eastern Mediterranean, Australia and West Africa, give us confidence in continued activity acceleration in 2023 and beyond. Longer term, we believe the international markets will experience multiple years of growth. Halliburton's international business is better prepared to benefit from the upcycle than ever before. We have a strong portfolio of well construction and completion product service lines. We greatly increased our drilling competitiveness. We are present in all the markets that matter and we have unique growth opportunities in the production space. Let me elaborate. The activity mix in this upcycle is different from prior cycles. Today, operators focus more on developing known resources and less on long-term exploration programs. This means drilling more wellbores. The products and services customers require for drilling more wellbores benefit Halliburton. For example, in one of the largest international offshore markets, over 60% of a typical well service cost goes to drilling fluids, cementing and completion hardware. This means more operators spend on services where Halliburton has a leading position. Baroid, our drilling and completion fluids business entered this cycle as the leading fluids provider globally. During the downturn, we brought the chemical supply chain closer to our international customers and localized our workforce. This improved our cost competitiveness and the margins. We introduced new advanced chemistries and now run fluid systems that make better wellbores and create value for our customers and Halliburton through higher margins and lower inventory requirements. Halliburton was founded as a cementing company over 100 years ago. And since then, we never stopped leading and innovating in cementing. Every well in the world, be it a mature producer in the Middle East or a deepwater wellbore in Brazil, must be cemented. The secret to our enduring success in cementing is our capacity and drive to innovate and develop new methods to design, deliver and validate sustainable well barriers. Our latest innovation is the Cognitive Automated Cementing Platform, which allows us to deliver cement jobs autonomously. With limited human direction and intervention, a standard offshore cementing operation typically requires over 300 commands. The Cognitive platform consolidates and automates this to only five mouse clicks by an onshore operator. We already completed over 70 cementing jobs using the system in the North Sea, delivering safer operations, improved service quality and cost efficiency. Well completion tools constitute a larger portion of well services spend internationally than in North America, and they are high tech and high value-add products and services. Halliburton is a global leader in completions technology, especially in advanced completions that include sand control solutions, multilateral wells and intelligent completions. With over 20 years of multilateral installation experience globally, Halliburton is the market leader in multilaterals, a key technical component in many development wells. They help operators increase reservoir drainage in mature fields, address limited subsea infrastructure and reduce environmental impact. Over the past few years, we've strengthened our completion tools product service line in Singapore, which is closer to our international customer base and supply chain sources. With our world-class manufacturing facilities, strong local technical support and continuous innovation, Halliburton completion tools position us to outperform in the international upcycle. Another key well construction service is directional drilling. Over the last five years, we made a concerted effort to improve our drilling technology competitiveness. Our strong D&E margin performance this year demonstrates that our investment is paying off and we expect it to continue as international drilling activity ramps up. Our iCruise intelligent drilling system delivers excellent results. It now constitutes about half of our rotary steerable fleet and has been a key contributor to year-over-year margin improvements, which reflects its higher asset velocity compared to prior generation tools. Last month, for a Middle East customer, Halliburton achieved a new world record, the longest well ever drilled at 50,000 feet measured depth. This extended reach well redefine what's possible with advanced drilling technology. In many regions, as customers face increasing operational challenges and urgency to increase production, I expect that the adoption of integrated contracts will continue to grow. Today, about 20% of our international revenue comes from integrated projects, and this percentage is considerably higher in some markets like Norway, Mexico and Iraq. Halliburton's strong project management capabilities and a proven track record, compress the learning curve and drive cost savings and efficiencies for both us and our customers. The future is without a doubt, more collaborative. Customers across the world increasingly call on Halliburton for collaboration and that perfectly fits with our value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value. Geographic presence is very important in the international markets, and today, we are present everywhere that matters, which is different from prior cycles. We expect to benefit from our established footprint, geographic presence and customer and supplier relationships as international markets grow. Finally, I want to highlight the international growth opportunity Halliburton has in artificial lift and specialty chemicals, which is new for this upcycle. This month, we completed our first year of operations on our electric submersible pump contract in Kuwait. We have already installed almost 200 ESPs, built an artificial lift service facility in country and delivered excellent performance for KOC. We also have successful installations in Oman and have ongoing ESP trials in Saudi Arabia. Upon completion of trials at the end of the year, we expect prequalification to participate in Saudi Aramco's future artificial lift tenders. Latin America is another successful market for our artificial lift business, where we operate in all significant land markets and just installed our 500th ESP in Ecuador. Our new chemical reaction plant in Saudi Arabia mixed the first batch of chemicals last month and is on track to meet its ramp-up goals. This year, we expect the plant to manufacture products for our production chemicals contract with a large IOC in Oman and chemicals for our drilling fluids, specialty chemicals and hydraulic fracturing product service lines. Today, Halliburton is a much stronger international competitor and we expect to benefit more from this multiyear upcycle than ever before. This aligns perfectly with our strategy to deliver profitable international growth. Turning to North America. This market remains strong, steadily growing and all of it sold out. Our strategic priority is to maximize value in North America by focusing on cash flow and returns, not market share. The second quarter saw another step-up in both US land rig activity and stages completed. With the first quarter sand supply interruptions resolved, frac activity steadily increased throughout the quarter. As we look at the second half of 2022, Halliburton remains sold out. As for the overall market, I believe it will be all but sold out for the second half of the year due to service company discipline, long lead times for new fleets and supply chain bottlenecks for consumables. We expect public companies will steadily execute on their drilling and completion programs. Private E&Ps capitalized on available rigs and equipment in the first half of the year and will likely maintain a measured level of activity growth for the rest of the year. We continue to believe that North America operator spending growth will eclipse 35% this year. Our customer conversations have already pivoted to 2023 plans well in advance of the typical time frame. These conversations make it clear that equipment capacity for 2023 is tight. Today, we see a services market in North America that is almost unrecognizable from prior cycles or even a handful of years ago. I believe that the returns focus we now see in the services market is not a temporary phenomenon. The largest more publicly traded pressure pumping companies now account for about two-thirds of the market. This means that investors force discipline on the majority of the industry today. In addition, industry consolidation, structural changes to customer behavior and the requirement to self-fund capital investments all drive capital discipline. In short, it's the result of rational economic behavior and I believe that it is here to stay. Halliburton is well prepared to compete in this new paradigm in North America. We have the largest technology budget in the North American services industry and our advanced technologies deliver what matters to operators: efficiency, insight and emissions reduction. For example, today, our customers can reduce environmental impact with our proven Zeus electric frac offering and optimize completions performance by capturing downhole insight with our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing solution. We operate in every major oil and gas basin across the United States using the same design of equipment built by in-house manufacturing to our specifications. This one design approach greatly simplifies equipment maintenance and helps minimize the supply chain challenges for spares and equipment. Finally, we have global capabilities in managing supply chain and labor complexities that we believe give us a distinct competitive advantage over domestic service providers. To conclude on North America. I expect Halliburton to uniquely maximize value in the strong, steadily growing and all but sold-out market. Globally, supply chain and labor shortages are front and center for many industries as the post-pandemic recovery stressed both raw material supply and transportation logistics. I believe Halliburton manages these shortages better than competitors. Our global business development, supply chain and technology organizations closely monitor market trends and work to mitigate cost impacts through economies of scale and global procurement, technology modifications and efficient sourcing practices. For example, as chemical costs increase, we work with our customers to adjust our pricing for cost inflation. Operators appreciate that these price adjustments are required for us to continue delivering our services. Most customers expect and accept these adjustments. Halliburton's world-class technology organization gives us the ability to change formulations for certain products to avoid the most inflationary inputs. We have already implemented these design changes for some of our drilling fluids and completion tool elastomers. Finally, we have internal chemical manufacturing capabilities in the US and Saudi Arabia, which allow us to diversify supply, mitigate risk and better control input prices. In North America, we employ our global HR capabilities for managing commuter labor to hire out of basin and avoid labor shortage pressures in local markets. This allows us to secure talent from states outside of white hot labor markets in traditional oil and gas basins. At the same time, our voluntary attrition numbers remained stable, both globally and the US. This demonstrates that once we attract the right talent, we provide them with the right incentives and growth opportunities. Turning now to pricing dynamics that we see playing out in North America and internationally. As I stated before, this is a margin cycle, not a build cycle. In North America, net pricing improvements drove our strong C&P margin expansion in the second quarter, and I expect pricing gains to continue. Here's why. Existing active equipment and experienced crews are in high demand and will continue to be highly sought after to efficiently execute programs in the second half of this year and into 2023. The market remains all, but sold out. Supply chain bottlenecks even for diesel fleets make it almost impossible to add incremental capacity this year. Halliburton has the additional advantage that our fleet primarily competes at the higher end of the pricing spectrum. Our portfolio of low emissions equipment commands premium prices and our customers see value in the efficiency and emissions profile we provide. Internationally, we see structural tightness in many product lines, particularly drilling and wireline. Increasing activity soaks up capacity market-wide. And recently, some customer request for additional equipment had to go unanswered. As equipment availability continues to tighten, we expect prices will increase further. Due to the long-term nature of international contracts, only about one-third of our work re-prices every year. This means that margin and pricing inflections internationally will always materialize at a slower pace than in North America. We see evidence of customer urgency indicated by customer preference to pursue direct negotiations for contract extensions. The efficiency gains over the last several years have all accrued directly to operators, and there is still a great deal of room in customer's economics for service providers to earn a fair and durable return. So it often goes unsaid, a robust and investable service industry is a key enabler of our customers' ability to grow and maintain production to address the world's energy needs. I'm thrilled with Halliburton's performance in the second quarter and our immediate and long-term opportunities. Our team is executing well on near-term tactical objectives and the long-term strategic priorities provide real tangible value for Halliburton and our shareholders. Halliburton's competitive position is unique among our peers. We have the scale and technology to benefit meaningfully and differentially from the international market expansion, and we are the leader in the strong, steadily growing and all but sold out North American market. I could not be more excited about the future of Halliburton. Now I will turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our second quarter financial results. Eric?\nEric Carre: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Let me begin with a summary of our second quarter results, compared to the first quarter of 2022. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.1 billion and adjusted operating income was $718 million, an increase of 18% and 35%, respectively. Higher equipment utilization and net pricing gains supported these strong results. In the second quarter, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $344 million as a result of our decision to exit Russia due to sanctions. Now let me take a moment to discuss our division results in more details. Starting with our Completion and Production division, revenue was $2.9 billion, an increase of 24% while operating income was $499 million, an increase of 69%. These results were driven by increased pressure pumping services in the Western Hemisphere; higher completion tool sales globally, increased artificial lift activity in North America land and Kuwait, and improved cementing activity in the Eastern Hemisphere. These improvements were partially offset by lower stimulation activity in Oman and decreased artificial lift activity in Latin America. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $2.2 billion, a 12% increase, while operating income was $286 million, a decrease of 3%. This revenue increase was due to higher fluid services and wireline activity globally, increased project management activity in Latin America and the Middle East, and increased drilling services in Latin America. Operating income decrease was driven by seasonally lower software sales globally and decreased drilling services in Brazil. Moving on to our geographic results. In North America, revenue grew 26%, primarily driven by increased pressure pumping services and artificial lift activity in North America land, increased fluid services, wireline activity, well intervention services and higher completion tool sales across the region and increased cementing activity in the Gulf of Mexico. These increases were partially offset by lower stimulation activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Turning to Latin America. Revenue increased 16% due to improved activity across multiple product service lines in Argentina and Colombia, increased stimulation and well construction services in Mexico, increased drilling related services in the Caribbean, improved stimulation activity in Brazil and higher project management activity in Ecuador. Partially offsetting these increases were decreased drilling related services in Brazil and lower artificial lift activity in Argentina and Ecuador. In Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue increased 6% resulting from higher activity across multiple product service lines in Angola and Eastern Mediterranean, improved cementing activity, pipeline services, wireline activity, and testing services across the region and increased through its services and completion tool sales in the UK. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the wind down of our business in Russia and decreased drilling services in Norway. In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue increased 14%, primarily resulting from higher activity across multiple product service lines in the Middle East, Australia and Brunei. These increases were partially offset by reduced stimulation activity in Oman. All regions experienced a seasonal decline in software sales. In the second quarter, our corporate and other expense was $67 million, which was higher than expected due to the timing of employee incentives. For the third quarter, we expect our corporate expense to be slightly lower. Net interest expense for the quarter was $101 million and should remain about flat for the third quarter. Other net expense for the quarter was $42 million, primarily related to currency losses driven by the strength of the US dollar. For the third quarter, we expect this expense to remain about flat. Our normalized effective tax rate for the second quarter came in at approximately 22%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our third quarter effective tax rate to be slightly higher. Capital expenditure for the quarter were $221 million and will steadily increase for the remainder of the year. For the full year, we expect our CapEx to remain at 5% to 6% of revenue. Turning to cash flow. We generated $376 million of cash from operation and $215 million of free cash flow during the second quarter. Working capital investments grew to support the 18% sequential revenue growth. As is typical for our business in an upcycle, we anticipate free cash flow for the year to be back-end loaded and expect to generate free cash flow at or above last year's level. Now let me turn to our near-term outlook. In the Completion and Production division, we expect third quarter revenue to grow in the mid-single digits and margins to improve 75 to 125 basis points. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect our third quarter revenue to grow in the low to middle single digits. As a result of activity improvements, we expect D&E margins to be flat to up 50 basis points. I will now turn the call back to Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Thanks, Eric. To summarize our discussion today, we are still in the early innings of a multiyear upcycle. The oil supply and demand fundamentals remain constructive for both international and North America markets. The steps we took to improve operating leverage, lower capital intensity and strengthen our balance sheet set Halliburton up to outperform under any market conditions. Internationally, Halliburton is a much stronger competitor, and we expect to benefit more from this multiyear upcycle than ever before. This aligns perfectly with our strategy to deliver profitable international growth. In North America, I expect Halliburton to uniquely maximize value in the strong, steadily growing and all but sold out market. We will continue to execute on our strategic priorities and remain committed to driving profitable growth, margin expansion, strong free cash flow and returns for our shareholders as this multiyear upcycle unfolds. And now let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question coming from James West from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nJames West: Hey, good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Eric.\nJeff Miller: Good morning, James.\nEric Carre: Good morning, James.\nJames West: So Jeff, as you think about the cycle from here, we're clearly setting up for a pretty strong and healthy upcycle where the operating leverage is really in the early days of showing up. But how do you think about the next several quarters, maybe several years if you want to take it that far, playing out in terms of the cycle, there seems to be a growing -- at least from what I can tell, growing urgency from the customer base to bring production or accelerate activity levels from here. And so we could be in a position where you see growth that moves much higher than kind of the steady growth we've seen so far, but could be at a tipping point.\nJeff Miller: James, yes, agree in terms of the outlook. In fact, what I see is a lot of duration in this cycle. I mean, obviously, it's been moving up, and I expect it continues to move up. But the reality is if operators can be busy, particularly international, they are. And the tightness around oil supply is not something that's resolved quickly after seven, eight years of underinvestment. And so while I'm excited about the inflection and the improvement in the upcycle that we see, I have to say I'm equally excited about the duration. This is multiples of years, I was a decade in the making. It's many years in the undoing in terms of producing. And so I think this is a fantastic time for operators and an even better time for Halliburton.\nJames West: Right. Right. Okay. That makes sense. And then from a competitive standpoint, are you seeing the discipline that maybe we hadn't seen in prior years from your competitors, but it seems now like everybody kind of is on the same page as its returns, its margin. And so are you seeing the same kind of pricing discipline that I know you guys are exhibiting the market?\nJeff Miller: Look, pricing is improving around the world. And it's a rational -- it's the allocation of assets and it's moving them to the highest returning opportunities. And that's not unique to Halliburton in terms of expectation of return. I mean, we clearly want to improve our returns and plan to do so. But that's part of this different cycle, different market dynamics in the sense that returns and return of cash matter to our shareholders. And the best way to do that is to not just improve utilization, but improved returns on every asset. And clearly, the approach we're taking and our whole strategy internationally is built around profitable growth, which is, I think, precisely what you saw this quarter and what you'll continue to see from Halliburton in the future.\nJames West: All right. Okay. Got it. Thanks, guys.\nJeff Miller: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our question. And our next question coming from the line of David Anderson from Barclays. Your line is open.\nDavid Anderson: Great. Thanks. Good morning, Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Good morning, David.\nDavid Anderson: Good morning. So nice increase in the North America top line this quarter, well above the rig count, wondering if you could put this into context for us in terms of the customer base that was sort of the incremental driver here? Was it the privates or the public, I guess, is sort of the core question. Along those same lines, I was just wondering, if you could talk about your customer mix and how you're thinking about it. On the one hand, with all the equipment shortages, I would think you could push pricing further with the private. But on the other hand, of course, you get the \u2013 the more visibility, the larger E&P program. So I was just wondering if you could maybe talk about that optimal customer mix today? And does a potential for any recession come into consideration in terms of that mix.\nJeff Miller: Yeah. Let me start with the first part of that question. The activity was really in both camps. We saw a lot of activity. Obviously, a lot of the interruptions in the first quarter were out of the way. And so we had a full utilization quarter, which was certainly a positive from an activity perspective, and that applied equally to privates and publics. Really from a pricing standpoint, important that, we're iteratively moving on pricing and I would argue that's again, consistent in both groups. And from a visibility standpoint, I think it's important to note, I mean, A, we love our customer mix today. I want to be clear. And it maybe slightly weighted towards publics, but that is really \u2013 the privates we work for are big privates. And there are some privates that are bigger than public out there in the marketplace and work for them. And they have terrific visibility as well. So I mean the privates, just like the publics, fully understand, A, that OPEC spare capacity is not there or they would be meeting their quotas. They have great visibility of the supply and demand for oil in our business. And that dialogue has been about 2023 capacity for Halliburton to provide either more equipment or more services, not recession. I can promise you that it's not the discussion, the discussion and what we see in our business is activity demand moving up. We see a tighter 2023 than we see in 2022. So all of these signals and in our business are extremely positive.\nDavid Anderson: Absolutely, I agree. And also I think also noteworthy how your margins are now back to 2014 levels. That's really impressive, I would say. A separate question, Jeff, on the Middle East, you highlighted a 14% increase in revenue this quarter a bunch of contracts are starting up. You mentioned project management that Kuwait ESP project is moving well. It sounds like there's more tenders to come. Question, are we already starting to see the ramp-up in the Middle East? Maybe you could just, kind of, give us your sense of what's going on in the ground in terms of mobilization and the pace of activity. I think you highlighted kind of service discipline over there in terms of pricing. So hopefully, that's looking pretty good. But maybe just tell us what's happening on the ground today? I know we've been waiting for this for a while.\nJeff Miller: Look, I think we're still early innings of Middle East. And so more activity, yes; activity underway, yes. But in terms of supply chain or let's just think more broadly around equipment, rigs, et cetera, those don't come back to work instantaneously. And so I -- my view is there's a lot more demand for services in the Middle East certainly than we're seeing today. So I would say as equipment can be mobilized as projects get underway, I think there's a lot more of that to come.\nDavid Anderson: Good to hear. Thanks Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Yeah. Thank you.\nDavid Coleman: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question coming from the line of Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan Chase. Your line is open.\nArun Jayaram: Good morning Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Good morning.\nArun Jayaram: Jeff, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how is contracting philosophy in North America this cycle. Is it consistent with typical cycles, but I want to get your thoughts on that. You've been essentially sold out for some time now, and we're just trying to gauge the velocity of pricing gains, which could manifest in the second half of this year versus 2023 when a lot of your customers are armed with new budgets?\nJeff Miller: Yeah. Look, I'd be crazy to get into all of those details on a call. But philosophically, I mean, our -- in practical -- in practice, I mean, prices are moving iteratively. And I think that's an important component of what we're seeing when market's tight like this. We ratably look at the best opportunity for assets and what that drives this approach to pricing, which is one that we've seen until now. And so as we look out into the future, in a market like this, we maintain optionality, but we also have very good customers with deep relationships. And because of that, there's a premium on equipment that is working and efficient, particularly in a market that looks like this. And so, look, our customers understand that a vibrant service industry is a critical component of their ability to deliver what they have to deliver. And so I think that as we look out through this year and really into next year, we ought to continue to see improvement in pricing.\nArun Jayaram: Fair enough, Jeff. I wanted to talk a little bit about specialty chemicals and artificial lift. You've highlighted how this provides some unique growth opportunities for how the cycle -- I was wondering if you could maybe help us think about just at a high level, what are some revenue or growth opportunities for how -- from these two segments. Again, we're just trying to estimate what this could mean for your full cycle earnings power?\nJeff Miller: Yes. I want to -- I'm going to -- it's a meaningful opportunity. I mean I think if you go look at total available market for artificial lift, for example, we have a leading position. Actually, some it's number one in the US today and we are just beginning internationally. We've got talked about the growth we've seen, but it is a drop in the bucket compared to what that total available market is out there for lift internationally. And of course, we're super pleased with the technology at Summit, and it's just a matter of growing that business internationally, which the examples I've given you are examples of us doing that. But I would say this is the -- there is the beginnings on what's possible.\nArun Jayaram: Yes. Fair enough. Thanks a lot, Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And our next question coming from the line of Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Your line is open. One moment.\nChase Mulvehill: Yes. Good morning. Real quick, just kind of a follow-up on the 2Q guide and maybe we'll just chalk it up to conservatism. But if we think about the top line, I think if you kind of blend things together from your segment guidance, it kind of implies a 4% or 5% sequential growth in top line. But if we kind of step back and think about expectations for North America and International, I would have expected both North America and international revenues to actually outpace that 4% to 5%. So just kind of help us connect the dots and maybe Russia is a little bit of a drag in 3Q, but just kind of help us connect the dots between North America and international relative to your guidance.\nJeff Miller: Well, I think the first half outperformed. It's a strong year. So I still see us eclipsing 35%. That means more than 35%. The international outlook for us includes Russia dropping out in Q3. So the guide that we have given in the 3% to 5% and that range overcomes Russia, which is exactly what we thought would happen. We thought there would be outsized spending outside of Russia likely to compensate for that, and that's precisely what we're seeing. North America, I'd describe it as steadily growing. And I think that's what steadily growing looks pretty strong on the first half, and it continues to grow. I think that the market is very positive. We got to put a number on it, but it's certainly been strong until now, and this continued to really outperform consistently, so -- \nChase Mulvehill: Okay. Makes sense.\nJeff Miller: This is clearly not -- this is not a step back. This is a step forward in both hemispheres, both US and international.\nChase Mulvehill: Yes, makes sense. I mean, you've got a history of beating expectations, so we'll just kind of leave it there. The follow-up here, if we think about leverage ratios, obviously, they're falling pretty quickly. Your outlook remains robust. It looks like maybe early next year, you might hit 1 times on a leverage ratio. So it puts you in a position to really kind of focus more on returning cash to shareholders really over the next, call it, 6 to 12 months. So could you talk to this a little bit and how you're thinking about buybacks versus dividends and just kind of overall frame kind of the shareholder -- the cash return to shareholder framework.\nEric Carre: Yes. Let me take that one, Chase. It's Eric here. So I'll start by saying that the most important point here is that our priorities as a company have not changed. So maybe let me summarize how we think about this. So first, to your point, we'd like to continue to pay down more debt. Then we would like to continue to return more cash to shareholders. From that perspective, our buyers right now is toward increasing the base dividends but would like at some point in time to address dilution as well. And if you look at the progress that we've made, we've made significant progress actually towards these objectives since the beginning of 2020. We've retired $1.8 billion worth of debt, $600 million this year. If you look at what's ahead of us, we have about $1 billion coming up between 2023 and 2025. Once that is retired, we basically have a clean slate until 2030, which is going to give us great flexibility. The other point I would make is that in Q1 of this year, we did both. So we did retire that and we increased dividend about triple -- pretty close to triple the dividend. So these things don't necessarily need to be done sequentially. We can do them at the same time. And finally, I would say that we fully expect to continue to grow shareholder distribution as the upcycle accelerates. Yes.\nChase Mulvehill: Okay. Perfect. I\u2019ll turn it back over. Thanks, Eric. Thanks, Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question coming from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nNeil Mehta: Yes. Thank you, Jeff. Thank you, team. First question is just the 400 basis point margin improvement target, clearly making progress towards it. Maybe just talk about your views on when you think you can get there and whether there's some upside skew given the commodity macro.\nJeff Miller: Thank you. Look, our -- my long-term outlook is unchanged except that it's biased upwards. In fact, I'm more bullish than I was before. I want to be careful and not get in the business of trying to update that every quarter. But our outlook, my outlook on sort of the trajectory of the market today, the macro in terms of supply shortage, short oil in the world. And I think really importantly, not only is the price of the commodity, always important. Energy security has moved back central -- front and center for a lot of countries and continents. And so that's going to just put further support under my outlook in terms of being busy, the type of activity I described in terms of more wellbores. That's a really important point, meaning that making more barrels is going to look like a lot more development work, a lot more tie back kind of work, and I've described sort of a lot of that spend or right in areas where Halliburton leads, whether it's drilling fluids, cementing and completion tools and then the progress we've made in other parts of our business, I think sets up very well. So without trying to update that outlook, hopefully, I'll give you enough color that we feel really good about it.\nNeil Mehta: Yes. That's good color. And then the follow-up is on working capital and free cash flow, to your point. Free cash flow did come a little softer than we were expecting, but a lot of that is working capital, which is consistent with an upcycle. So just talk about the back half progression in free cash flow as you see it and anything that would need to keep them up.\nEric Carre: Yeah. Good morning, Neil. It's Eric. So the headline is expect free cash flow to follow the typical upcycle profile. So, basically, very heavily loaded towards the second half of the year. And we feel very good about the outlook of the business. The working capital built in Q2 was really to support our growth. So our revenues went up 18%, about $800 million Q2 over Q1. But what was really good is that the efficiency of our working capital improved versus the prior cycle. So \u2013 and we have to do that while managing inflation, managing longer lead time in the supply chain. So we're very pleased with how our organization has managed the situation and the overall progress we're making. So as we get into H2, I think the situation will evolve, and we fully expect to deliver on the free cash flow targets despite the working capital headwinds we had in H1.\nNeil Mehta: Thank you, guys.\nDavid Coleman: Next question.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And our next question is coming from the line of Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. Your line is open.\nStephen Gengaro: Thanks, and good morning, gentlemen. Two things for me. I think the first is, when you look at the domestic frac business, and you obviously, you talked about consolidation you guys have stuck to your plans on CapEx. Are you seeing much out there as far as the new builds in the industry? And maybe talk a little bit about lead times for new equipment at this point?\nJeff Miller: Yeah. Thanks. The \u2013 A, the lead times are still quite long. I mean \u2013 and so I think probably a year to meaningfully do anything. But the market has changed. And so A, we haven't had any meaningful additions into this business at all in six years. So that's a long time. And if I think about our business, I mean, we're always replacing the aging part of our fleet. That's not adding capacity. That's just simply retiring equipment or equipment that's unable to operate or gets damaged in the process of working, which that happens, too. And so at some level, addressing attrition at the bottom end of the fleet is important. And that's one of the reasons \u2013 we do that. That's one of the reasons we have Halliburton one of the healthiest fleets in the industry. The other broad thing that's happening, I would say, is this conversion to lower emission, which again is not adding capacity, but I would see it as a conversion. But the supply chain issues I started with are very real. And I think given the consolidation in the industry, the sort of lack of capital broadly to invest, I think what you'll see \u2013 I think -- I'm just going to guess others view the fleet the way that I do. And I think that what that means is that, we won't see capacity adds.\nStephen Gengaro: Thank you. And then when we think about \u2013 you mentioned the pricing dynamics that you've seen, obviously, things are strong. Has there been any pushback from the E&P side? I mean, I know they're always not trying to take a lot higher prices, but have you seen any material pushback, or just because it's so tight, it's been fairly easy discussions.\nJeff Miller: It's always a discussion, respectfully. But I also think what underpins this is how important service industry is to delivering on what our operators need to do. And I think there's clearly a recognition of that. And so always a discussion, always some back and forth, but realistically, our operators require quality services, and that means fleets that are well-maintained, fleets that are -- attrition is dealt with. And better efficiency in our case, better technology. All of that's appreciated and realized that that has to make solid returns for it to remain vibrant. And I think that's what underpins those conversations.\nStephen Gengaro: Great. Thank you.\nJeff Miller: Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: One moment for your next question. Our next question coming from the line of Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Your line is open.\nMarc Bianchi: Thank you. Jeff, you mentioned you had been speaking to some customers about 2023. What kind of increases are they talking about for North America and International?\nJeff Miller: Look, I think it's consistent with making returns, but up. So let's start with surety of supply. Internationally, it's probably more around ability to supply. I think that operators, particularly in the US, understand returns and shareholder returns, and so do we. And so I think we see a steady march up, but a healthy march up in the sense that as we described, a lot of duration to this cycle, which I think is much welcome by us and I think by our shareholders are going to benefit from that meaningfully because of the duration. So the -- you look at how we've improved the capital intensity of our business, our clients view it the same way. And I think that -- so what we're going to see is more activity, no question, because there's going to be demand for the commodity. But it's -- so it's more around could you add one or do you have an extra one and really a lot of that dialogue given lead times and commitments around our own capital. And I think broadly, the industry's commitment around capital as it comes down to what's the highest returning opportunity for that equipment is more of what that discussion goes like.\nMarc Bianchi: Okay. Thanks. And on D&E, do you think you can get back to first quarter margins this year?\nJeff Miller: Yes. I mean the D&E -- the short answer, yes. Longer answer is that I'm really pleased with the progression and the progress we've seen with D&E margins. If we -- I've always said take a long view of D&E margins and I expect them every year to be higher than last year and next year to be higher than this year. There is some seasonality in that D&E business, both where we work in the world and some of the components that comprise D&E. But the target, and clearly, the expectation by me is that we are just layering on that seasonality a step up every single year, and that's what we've seen.\nMarc Bianchi: Great. Thanks so much.\nJeff Miller: Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. I\u2019m sorry, that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Jeff Miller for closing remarks.\nJeff Miller: Okay. Thank you, Olivia. Before we close out the call, let me just reiterate, Halliburton's performance during the strong quarter demonstrates that we're executing on the right strategy in the international and North America markets to drive value for shareholders throughout this multiyear upcycle. I look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Please close out the call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Eric Carre",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Let me begin with a summary of our second quarter results, compared to the first quarter of 2022. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.1 billion and adjusted operating income was $718 million, an increase of 18% and 35%, respectively. Higher equipment utilization and net pricing gains supported these strong results. In the second quarter, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $344 million as a result of our decision to exit Russia due to sanctions. Now let me take a moment to discuss our division results in more details. Starting with our Completion and Production division, revenue was $2.9 billion, an increase of 24% while operating income was $499 million, an increase of 69%. These results were driven by increased pressure pumping services in the Western Hemisphere; higher completion tool sales globally, increased artificial lift activity in North America land and Kuwait, and improved cementing activity in the Eastern Hemisphere. These improvements were partially offset by lower stimulation activity in Oman and decreased artificial lift activity in Latin America. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $2.2 billion, a 12% increase, while operating income was $286 million, a decrease of 3%. This revenue increase was due to higher fluid services and wireline activity globally, increased project management activity in Latin America and the Middle East, and increased drilling services in Latin America. Operating income decrease was driven by seasonally lower software sales globally and decreased drilling services in Brazil. Moving on to our geographic results. In North America, revenue grew 26%, primarily driven by increased pressure pumping services and artificial lift activity in North America land, increased fluid services, wireline activity, well intervention services and higher completion tool sales across the region and increased cementing activity in the Gulf of Mexico. These increases were partially offset by lower stimulation activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Turning to Latin America. Revenue increased 16% due to improved activity across multiple product service lines in Argentina and Colombia, increased stimulation and well construction services in Mexico, increased drilling related services in the Caribbean, improved stimulation activity in Brazil and higher project management activity in Ecuador. Partially offsetting these increases were decreased drilling related services in Brazil and lower artificial lift activity in Argentina and Ecuador. In Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue increased 6% resulting from higher activity across multiple product service lines in Angola and Eastern Mediterranean, improved cementing activity, pipeline services, wireline activity, and testing services across the region and increased through its services and completion tool sales in the UK. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the wind down of our business in Russia and decreased drilling services in Norway. In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue increased 14%, primarily resulting from higher activity across multiple product service lines in the Middle East, Australia and Brunei. These increases were partially offset by reduced stimulation activity in Oman. All regions experienced a seasonal decline in software sales. In the second quarter, our corporate and other expense was $67 million, which was higher than expected due to the timing of employee incentives. For the third quarter, we expect our corporate expense to be slightly lower. Net interest expense for the quarter was $101 million and should remain about flat for the third quarter. Other net expense for the quarter was $42 million, primarily related to currency losses driven by the strength of the US dollar. For the third quarter, we expect this expense to remain about flat. Our normalized effective tax rate for the second quarter came in at approximately 22%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our third quarter effective tax rate to be slightly higher. Capital expenditure for the quarter were $221 million and will steadily increase for the remainder of the year. For the full year, we expect our CapEx to remain at 5% to 6% of revenue. Turning to cash flow. We generated $376 million of cash from operation and $215 million of free cash flow during the second quarter. Working capital investments grew to support the 18% sequential revenue growth. As is typical for our business in an upcycle, we anticipate free cash flow for the year to be back-end loaded and expect to generate free cash flow at or above last year's level. Now let me turn to our near-term outlook. In the Completion and Production division, we expect third quarter revenue to grow in the mid-single digits and margins to improve 75 to 125 basis points. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect our third quarter revenue to grow in the low to middle single digits. As a result of activity improvements, we expect D&E margins to be flat to up 50 basis points. I will now turn the call back to Jeff. Good morning, James. Yes. Let me take that one, Chase. It's Eric here. So I'll start by saying that the most important point here is that our priorities as a company have not changed. So maybe let me summarize how we think about this. So first, to your point, we'd like to continue to pay down more debt. Then we would like to continue to return more cash to shareholders. From that perspective, our buyers right now is toward increasing the base dividends but would like at some point in time to address dilution as well.

We've retired $1.8 billion worth of debt, $600 million this year. If you look at what's ahead of us, we have about $1 billion coming up between 2023 and 2025. Once that is retired, we basically have a clean slate until 2030, which is going to give us great flexibility. The other point I would make is that in Q1 of this year, we did both. So we did retire that and we increased dividend about triple -- pretty close to triple the dividend. So these things don't necessarily need to be done sequentially. We can do them at the same time. And finally, I would say that we fully expect to continue to grow shareholder distribution as the upcycle accelerates. Yes. Yeah. Good morning, Neil. It's Eric. So the headline is expect free cash flow to follow the typical upcycle profile. So, basically, very heavily loaded towards the second half of the year. And we feel very good about the outlook of the business. The working capital built in Q2 was really to support our growth. So our revenues went up 18%, about $800 million Q2 over Q1. But what was really good is that the efficiency of our working capital improved versus the prior cycle. So \u2013 and we have to do that while managing inflation, managing longer lead time in the supply chain. So we're very pleased with how our organization has managed the situation and the overall progress we're making. So as we get into H2, I think the situation will evolve, and we fully expect to deliver on the free cash flow targets despite the working capital headwinds we had in H1."

            "content": "Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. This was an excellent quarter. Our financial performance shows that our strategy is working and driving value. Let's get right to the highlights. Total company revenue increased 18% sequentially as both North America and international activity continued to improve in unison. Adjusted operating income grew 35% with strong margin performance in both divisions. Our Completion and Production division revenue increased 24% driven by robust completions activity in North America and international markets. C&P delivered operating margin of 17% in the second quarter, the first time it reached this level since 2014. Our Drilling and Evaluation division revenue grew 12%. Operating margin of 13% was down sequentially as expected due to the seasonal drop-off in software sales but increased 270 basis points year-on-year. This gives us confidence in the strengthening margin profile of our D&E business. North America revenue grew 26% as both drilling and completions activity marched higher throughout the second quarter. Strong net pricing gains across all product service lines supported sequential margin expansion. International revenue grew 12% sequentially with activity accelerating in all international regions, particularly Latin America and the Middle East. Finally, we recorded a historic best operational performance as measured by nonproductive time for the first six months of this year. I am pleased with the strong performance Halliburton delivered in the first half of this year, and I thank all Halliburton employees for their hard work, contribution to these outstanding results and dedication to superior service quality. Before we discuss our execution in the international and North America markets, let me address recent market volatility. In the second quarter, central banks took actions and an attempt to control inflation, raising concerns about a potential economic slowdown. Despite this near-term volatility, I believe the oil and gas market fundamentals still strongly support a multiyear energy upcycle. From a demand perspective, oil and gas remains a critical component of long-term economic growth. Post pandemic economic expansion, energy security requirements and population growth will continue to drive demand. Today, oil and gas supply is tight, despite an environment muted by ongoing China lockdowns and jet fuel demand below historical norms. Meaningful supply solutions will take time, OPEC spare capacity is at historical lows, the strategic petroleum reserve release is unsustainable, and the risk to Russia supply remains high. On the industry side, despite high commodity prices, operators remain disciplined because of investor return requirements, public ESG commitments and regulatory pressure. In response, service companies invested for returns and did not overbuild. In short, this cycle has been nothing like prior cycles. This means, any economic slowdown will not solve the structural oil undersupply problem. At Halliburton, the steps we took to improve operating leverage, lower capital intensity and strengthen our balance sheet best equip us to outperform under any market conditions. Here's why we believe that. First, we used the pandemic to redesign the cost profile of our business. We structurally removed over $1 billion of costs, the most aggressive cost reductions in our history. This gives us strong and sustainable operating leverage that we see today in meaningful year-on-year margin expansion in both divisions. Second, we fundamentally lowered the capital intensity of our business and set our CapEx target at 5% to 6% of revenue compared to 10% to 11% in the prior upcycle. We advanced our technology so that new generations of equipment would have higher capital velocity. This lower capital profile is key to our strong free cash flow generation. Finally, we prioritize strengthening our balance sheet and retired $1.8 billion of debt since the beginning of 2020. This reduced our cash interest expense and put us within striking distance of our leverage targets. Now, let's turn to our second quarter performance and expectations for the rest of 2022. With energy security firmly in focus, the diversification of supply sources is the central theme in the international markets. Never has energy security been a bigger issue to governments and people all over the world. However, political agendas and years of underinvestment in many markets make it harder to address this critical requirement. As I look across the international markets, our customer spend remains on track to increase by mid-teens this year, with the Middle East and Latin America expected to grow the most on a full year basis. New project announcements across the world, including in the Eastern Mediterranean, Australia and West Africa, give us confidence in continued activity acceleration in 2023 and beyond. Longer term, we believe the international markets will experience multiple years of growth. Halliburton's international business is better prepared to benefit from the upcycle than ever before. We have a strong portfolio of well construction and completion product service lines. We greatly increased our drilling competitiveness. We are present in all the markets that matter and we have unique growth opportunities in the production space. Let me elaborate. The activity mix in this upcycle is different from prior cycles. Today, operators focus more on developing known resources and less on long-term exploration programs. This means drilling more wellbores. The products and services customers require for drilling more wellbores benefit Halliburton. For example, in one of the largest international offshore markets, over 60% of a typical well service cost goes to drilling fluids, cementing and completion hardware. This means more operators spend on services where Halliburton has a leading position. Baroid, our drilling and completion fluids business entered this cycle as the leading fluids provider globally. During the downturn, we brought the chemical supply chain closer to our international customers and localized our workforce. This improved our cost competitiveness and the margins. We introduced new advanced chemistries and now run fluid systems that make better wellbores and create value for our customers and Halliburton through higher margins and lower inventory requirements. Halliburton was founded as a cementing company over 100 years ago. And since then, we never stopped leading and innovating in cementing. Every well in the world, be it a mature producer in the Middle East or a deepwater wellbore in Brazil, must be cemented. The secret to our enduring success in cementing is our capacity and drive to innovate and develop new methods to design, deliver and validate sustainable well barriers. Our latest innovation is the Cognitive Automated Cementing Platform, which allows us to deliver cement jobs autonomously. With limited human direction and intervention, a standard offshore cementing operation typically requires over 300 commands. The Cognitive platform consolidates and automates this to only five mouse clicks by an onshore operator. We already completed over 70 cementing jobs using the system in the North Sea, delivering safer operations, improved service quality and cost efficiency. Well completion tools constitute a larger portion of well services spend internationally than in North America, and they are high tech and high value-add products and services. Halliburton is a global leader in completions technology, especially in advanced completions that include sand control solutions, multilateral wells and intelligent completions. With over 20 years of multilateral installation experience globally, Halliburton is the market leader in multilaterals, a key technical component in many development wells. They help operators increase reservoir drainage in mature fields, address limited subsea infrastructure and reduce environmental impact. Over the past few years, we've strengthened our completion tools product service line in Singapore, which is closer to our international customer base and supply chain sources. With our world-class manufacturing facilities, strong local technical support and continuous innovation, Halliburton completion tools position us to outperform in the international upcycle. Another key well construction service is directional drilling. Over the last five years, we made a concerted effort to improve our drilling technology competitiveness. Our strong D&E margin performance this year demonstrates that our investment is paying off and we expect it to continue as international drilling activity ramps up. Our iCruise intelligent drilling system delivers excellent results. It now constitutes about half of our rotary steerable fleet and has been a key contributor to year-over-year margin improvements, which reflects its higher asset velocity compared to prior generation tools. Last month, for a Middle East customer, Halliburton achieved a new world record, the longest well ever drilled at 50,000 feet measured depth. This extended reach well redefine what's possible with advanced drilling technology. In many regions, as customers face increasing operational challenges and urgency to increase production, I expect that the adoption of integrated contracts will continue to grow. Today, about 20% of our international revenue comes from integrated projects, and this percentage is considerably higher in some markets like Norway, Mexico and Iraq. Halliburton's strong project management capabilities and a proven track record, compress the learning curve and drive cost savings and efficiencies for both us and our customers. The future is without a doubt, more collaborative. Customers across the world increasingly call on Halliburton for collaboration and that perfectly fits with our value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value. Geographic presence is very important in the international markets, and today, we are present everywhere that matters, which is different from prior cycles. We expect to benefit from our established footprint, geographic presence and customer and supplier relationships as international markets grow. Finally, I want to highlight the international growth opportunity Halliburton has in artificial lift and specialty chemicals, which is new for this upcycle. This month, we completed our first year of operations on our electric submersible pump contract in Kuwait. We have already installed almost 200 ESPs, built an artificial lift service facility in country and delivered excellent performance for KOC. We also have successful installations in Oman and have ongoing ESP trials in Saudi Arabia. Upon completion of trials at the end of the year, we expect prequalification to participate in Saudi Aramco's future artificial lift tenders. Latin America is another successful market for our artificial lift business, where we operate in all significant land markets and just installed our 500th ESP in Ecuador. Our new chemical reaction plant in Saudi Arabia mixed the first batch of chemicals last month and is on track to meet its ramp-up goals. This year, we expect the plant to manufacture products for our production chemicals contract with a large IOC in Oman and chemicals for our drilling fluids, specialty chemicals and hydraulic fracturing product service lines. Today, Halliburton is a much stronger international competitor and we expect to benefit more from this multiyear upcycle than ever before. This aligns perfectly with our strategy to deliver profitable international growth. Turning to North America. This market remains strong, steadily growing and all of it sold out. Our strategic priority is to maximize value in North America by focusing on cash flow and returns, not market share. The second quarter saw another step-up in both US land rig activity and stages completed. With the first quarter sand supply interruptions resolved, frac activity steadily increased throughout the quarter. As we look at the second half of 2022, Halliburton remains sold out. As for the overall market, I believe it will be all but sold out for the second half of the year due to service company discipline, long lead times for new fleets and supply chain bottlenecks for consumables. We expect public companies will steadily execute on their drilling and completion programs. Private E&Ps capitalized on available rigs and equipment in the first half of the year and will likely maintain a measured level of activity growth for the rest of the year. We continue to believe that North America operator spending growth will eclipse 35% this year. Our customer conversations have already pivoted to 2023 plans well in advance of the typical time frame. These conversations make it clear that equipment capacity for 2023 is tight. Today, we see a services market in North America that is almost unrecognizable from prior cycles or even a handful of years ago. I believe that the returns focus we now see in the services market is not a temporary phenomenon. The largest more publicly traded pressure pumping companies now account for about two-thirds of the market. This means that investors force discipline on the majority of the industry today. In addition, industry consolidation, structural changes to customer behavior and the requirement to self-fund capital investments all drive capital discipline. In short, it's the result of rational economic behavior and I believe that it is here to stay. Halliburton is well prepared to compete in this new paradigm in North America. We have the largest technology budget in the North American services industry and our advanced technologies deliver what matters to operators: efficiency, insight and emissions reduction. For example, today, our customers can reduce environmental impact with our proven Zeus electric frac offering and optimize completions performance by capturing downhole insight with our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing solution. We operate in every major oil and gas basin across the United States using the same design of equipment built by in-house manufacturing to our specifications. This one design approach greatly simplifies equipment maintenance and helps minimize the supply chain challenges for spares and equipment. Finally, we have global capabilities in managing supply chain and labor complexities that we believe give us a distinct competitive advantage over domestic service providers. To conclude on North America. I expect Halliburton to uniquely maximize value in the strong, steadily growing and all but sold-out market. Globally, supply chain and labor shortages are front and center for many industries as the post-pandemic recovery stressed both raw material supply and transportation logistics. I believe Halliburton manages these shortages better than competitors. Our global business development, supply chain and technology organizations closely monitor market trends and work to mitigate cost impacts through economies of scale and global procurement, technology modifications and efficient sourcing practices. For example, as chemical costs increase, we work with our customers to adjust our pricing for cost inflation. Operators appreciate that these price adjustments are required for us to continue delivering our services. Most customers expect and accept these adjustments. Halliburton's world-class technology organization gives us the ability to change formulations for certain products to avoid the most inflationary inputs. We have already implemented these design changes for some of our drilling fluids and completion tool elastomers. Finally, we have internal chemical manufacturing capabilities in the US and Saudi Arabia, which allow us to diversify supply, mitigate risk and better control input prices. In North America, we employ our global HR capabilities for managing commuter labor to hire out of basin and avoid labor shortage pressures in local markets. This allows us to secure talent from states outside of white hot labor markets in traditional oil and gas basins. At the same time, our voluntary attrition numbers remained stable, both globally and the US. This demonstrates that once we attract the right talent, we provide them with the right incentives and growth opportunities. Turning now to pricing dynamics that we see playing out in North America and internationally. As I stated before, this is a margin cycle, not a build cycle. In North America, net pricing improvements drove our strong C&P margin expansion in the second quarter, and I expect pricing gains to continue. Here's why. Existing active equipment and experienced crews are in high demand and will continue to be highly sought after to efficiently execute programs in the second half of this year and into 2023. The market remains all, but sold out. Supply chain bottlenecks even for diesel fleets make it almost impossible to add incremental capacity this year. Halliburton has the additional advantage that our fleet primarily competes at the higher end of the pricing spectrum. Our portfolio of low emissions equipment commands premium prices and our customers see value in the efficiency and emissions profile we provide. Internationally, we see structural tightness in many product lines, particularly drilling and wireline. Increasing activity soaks up capacity market-wide. And recently, some customer request for additional equipment had to go unanswered. As equipment availability continues to tighten, we expect prices will increase further. Due to the long-term nature of international contracts, only about one-third of our work re-prices every year. This means that margin and pricing inflections internationally will always materialize at a slower pace than in North America. We see evidence of customer urgency indicated by customer preference to pursue direct negotiations for contract extensions. The efficiency gains over the last several years have all accrued directly to operators, and there is still a great deal of room in customer's economics for service providers to earn a fair and durable return. So it often goes unsaid, a robust and investable service industry is a key enabler of our customers' ability to grow and maintain production to address the world's energy needs. I'm thrilled with Halliburton's performance in the second quarter and our immediate and long-term opportunities. Our team is executing well on near-term tactical objectives and the long-term strategic priorities provide real tangible value for Halliburton and our shareholders. Halliburton's competitive position is unique among our peers. We have the scale and technology to benefit meaningfully and differentially from the international market expansion, and we are the leader in the strong, steadily growing and all but sold out North American market. I could not be more excited about the future of Halliburton. Now I will turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our second quarter financial results. Eric? Thanks, Eric. To summarize our discussion today, we are still in the early innings of a multiyear upcycle. The oil supply and demand fundamentals remain constructive for both international and North America markets. The steps we took to improve operating leverage, lower capital intensity and strengthen our balance sheet set Halliburton up to outperform under any market conditions. Internationally, Halliburton is a much stronger competitor, and we expect to benefit more from this multiyear upcycle than ever before. This aligns perfectly with our strategy to deliver profitable international growth. In North America, I expect Halliburton to uniquely maximize value in the strong, steadily growing and all but sold out market. We will continue to execute on our strategic priorities and remain committed to driving profitable growth, margin expansion, strong free cash flow and returns for our shareholders as this multiyear upcycle unfolds. And now let's open it up for questions. Good morning, James. James, yes, agree in terms of the outlook. In fact, what I see is a lot of duration in this cycle. I mean, obviously, it's been moving up, and I expect it continues to move up. But the reality is if operators can be busy, particularly international, they are. And the tightness around oil supply is not something that's resolved quickly after seven, eight years of underinvestment. And so while I'm excited about the inflection and the improvement in the upcycle that we see, I have to say I'm equally excited about the duration. This is multiples of years, I was a decade in the making. It's many years in the undoing in terms of producing. And so I think this is a fantastic time for operators and an even better time for Halliburton. Look, pricing is improving around the world. And it's a rational -- it's the allocation of assets and it's moving them to the highest returning opportunities. And that's not unique to Halliburton in terms of expectation of return. I mean, we clearly want to improve our returns and plan to do so. But that's part of this different cycle, different market dynamics in the sense that returns and return of cash matter to our shareholders. And the best way to do that is to not just improve utilization, but improved returns on every asset. And clearly, the approach we're taking and our whole strategy internationally is built around profitable growth, which is, I think, precisely what you saw this quarter and what you'll continue to see from Halliburton in the future. Thank you. Good morning, David. Yeah. Let me start with the first part of that question. The activity was really in both camps. We saw a lot of activity. Obviously, a lot of the interruptions in the first quarter were out of the way. And so we had a full utilization quarter, which was certainly a positive from an activity perspective, and that applied equally to privates and publics. Really from a pricing standpoint, important that, we're iteratively moving on pricing and I would argue that's again, consistent in both groups. And from a visibility standpoint, I think it's important to note, I mean, A, we love our customer mix today. I want to be clear. And it maybe slightly weighted towards publics, but that is really \u2013 the privates we work for are big privates. And there are some privates that are bigger than public out there in the marketplace and work for them. And they have terrific visibility as well. So I mean the privates, just like the publics, fully understand, A, that OPEC spare capacity is not there or they would be meeting their quotas. They have great visibility of the supply and demand for oil in our business. And that dialogue has been about 2023 capacity for Halliburton to provide either more equipment or more services, not recession. I can promise you that it's not the discussion, the discussion and what we see in our business is activity demand moving up. We see a tighter 2023 than we see in 2022. So all of these signals and in our business are extremely positive. Look, I think we're still early innings of Middle East. And so more activity, yes; activity underway, yes. But in terms of supply chain or let's just think more broadly around equipment, rigs, et cetera, those don't come back to work instantaneously. And so I -- my view is there's a lot more demand for services in the Middle East certainly than we're seeing today. So I would say as equipment can be mobilized as projects get underway, I think there's a lot more of that to come. Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. Yeah. Look, I'd be crazy to get into all of those details on a call. But philosophically, I mean, our -- in practical -- in practice, I mean, prices are moving iteratively. And I think that's an important component of what we're seeing when market's tight like this. We ratably look at the best opportunity for assets and what that drives this approach to pricing, which is one that we've seen until now. And so as we look out into the future, in a market like this, we maintain optionality, but we also have very good customers with deep relationships. And because of that, there's a premium on equipment that is working and efficient, particularly in a market that looks like this. And so, look, our customers understand that a vibrant service industry is a critical component of their ability to deliver what they have to deliver. And so I think that as we look out through this year and really into next year, we ought to continue to see improvement in pricing. Yes. I want to -- I'm going to -- it's a meaningful opportunity. I mean I think if you go look at total available market for artificial lift, for example, we have a leading position. Actually, some it's number one in the US today and we are just beginning internationally. We've got talked about the growth we've seen, but it is a drop in the bucket compared to what that total available market is out there for lift internationally. And of course, we're super pleased with the technology at Summit, and it's just a matter of growing that business internationally, which the examples I've given you are examples of us doing that. But I would say this is the -- there is the beginnings on what's possible. Thank you. Next question. Well, I think the first half outperformed. It's a strong year. So I still see us eclipsing 35%. That means more than 35%. The international outlook for us includes Russia dropping out in Q3. So the guide that we have given in the 3% to 5% and that range overcomes Russia, which is exactly what we thought would happen. We thought there would be outsized spending outside of Russia likely to compensate for that, and that's precisely what we're seeing. North America, I'd describe it as steadily growing. And I think that's what steadily growing looks pretty strong on the first half, and it continues to grow. I think that the market is very positive. We got to put a number on it, but it's certainly been strong until now, and this continued to really outperform consistently, so -- This is clearly not -- this is not a step back. This is a step forward in both hemispheres, both US and international. Thank you. Next question, please. Thank you. Look, our -- my long-term outlook is unchanged except that it's biased upwards. In fact, I'm more bullish than I was before. I want to be careful and not get in the business of trying to update that every quarter. But our outlook, my outlook on sort of the trajectory of the market today, the macro in terms of supply shortage, short oil in the world. And I think really importantly, not only is the price of the commodity, always important. Energy security has moved back central -- front and center for a lot of countries and continents. And so that's going to just put further support under my outlook in terms of being busy, the type of activity I described in terms of more wellbores. That's a really important point, meaning that making more barrels is going to look like a lot more development work, a lot more tie back kind of work, and I've described sort of a lot of that spend or right in areas where Halliburton leads, whether it's drilling fluids, cementing and completion tools and then the progress we've made in other parts of our business, I think sets up very well. So without trying to update that outlook, hopefully, I'll give you enough color that we feel really good about it. Yeah. Thanks. The \u2013 A, the lead times are still quite long. I mean \u2013 and so I think probably a year to meaningfully do anything. But the market has changed. And so A, we haven't had any meaningful additions into this business at all in six years. So that's a long time. And if I think about our business, I mean, we're always replacing the aging part of our fleet. That's not adding capacity. That's just simply retiring equipment or equipment that's unable to operate or gets damaged in the process of working, which that happens, too. And so at some level, addressing attrition at the bottom end of the fleet is important. And that's one of the reasons \u2013 we do that. That's one of the reasons we have Halliburton one of the healthiest fleets in the industry. The other broad thing that's happening, I would say, is this conversion to lower emission, which again is not adding capacity, but I would see it as a conversion. But the supply chain issues I started with are very real. And I think given the consolidation in the industry, the sort of lack of capital broadly to invest, I think what you'll see \u2013 I think -- I'm just going to guess others view the fleet the way that I do. And I think that what that means is that, we won't see capacity adds. It's always a discussion, respectfully. But I also think what underpins this is how important service industry is to delivering on what our operators need to do. And I think there's clearly a recognition of that. And so always a discussion, always some back and forth, but realistically, our operators require quality services, and that means fleets that are well-maintained, fleets that are -- attrition is dealt with. And better efficiency in our case, better technology. All of that's appreciated and realized that that has to make solid returns for it to remain vibrant. And I think that's what underpins those conversations. Thank you. Next question. Look, I think it's consistent with making returns, but up. So let's start with surety of supply. Internationally, it's probably more around ability to supply. I think that operators, particularly in the US, understand returns and shareholder returns, and so do we. And so I think we see a steady march up, but a healthy march up in the sense that as we described, a lot of duration to this cycle, which I think is much welcome by us and I think by our shareholders are going to benefit from that meaningfully because of the duration. So the -- you look at how we've improved the capital intensity of our business, our clients view it the same way. And I think that -- so what we're going to see is more activity, no question, because there's going to be demand for the commodity. But it's -- so it's more around could you add one or do you have an extra one and really a lot of that dialogue given lead times and commitments around our own capital. And I think broadly, the industry's commitment around capital as it comes down to what's the highest returning opportunity for that equipment is more of what that discussion goes like. Yes. I mean the D&E -- the short answer, yes. Longer answer is that I'm really pleased with the progression and the progress we've seen with D&E margins. If we -- I've always said take a long view of D&E margins and I expect them every year to be higher than last year and next year to be higher than this year. There is some seasonality in that D&E business, both where we work in the world and some of the components that comprise D&E. But the target, and clearly, the expectation by me is that we are just layering on that seasonality a step up every single year, and that's what we've seen. Thank you. Next question. Okay. Thank you, Olivia. Before we close out the call, let me just reiterate, Halliburton's performance during the strong quarter demonstrates that we're executing on the right strategy in the international and North America markets to drive value for shareholders throughout this multiyear upcycle. I look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Please close out the call."

After our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow time for others who may be in the queue. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased with Halliburton's first quarter results. Our performance demonstrates the resilience of our unique strategy in action and the importance of our competitive positioning, both in North America and international markets. Here are some highlights from the first quarter. International revenue grew 15% compared to the first quarter of 2021, with activity accelerating across all international markets. Strong growth in Latin America and the Middle East/Asia offset the winter weather impacts in Europe. In North America, revenue grew 37% year-on-year with the acceleration of both drilling and completions activity. Higher utilization in March and net pricing gains drove margin expansion despite weather and sand disruptions earlier in the quarter. Our Completion and Production division revenue grew 26% compared to the first quarter of 2021 on activity increases in North America, Africa and the Middle East, while operating income increased 17% despite transitory U.S. land/sand delivery disruptions. Our Drilling and Evaluation division grew revenue 22% year-on-year, while margins expanded 440 basis points and started the year at 15% for the first time since 2010. This exceptional performance was largely driven by the strength of our directional drilling and project management businesses. We added three new companies to Halliburton Labs, our clean energy accelerator. This brings the total number of program participants and alumni to 15 companies. Halliburton Labs allows us to actively participate in the future of clean energy value chain. Finally, we retired $600 million of our $1 billion of debt maturing in 2025 and nearly tripled our quarterly dividend to $0.12 per share. These actions strengthen our balance sheet and reflect our commitment to return cash to shareholders. Before we continue, I want to provide a few comments about the current situation in Ukraine and Russia. This is a tragedy on many dimensions and for us, especially for our people in both countries. As we've all seen, governments in the European Union, the United States, Switzerland and other countries swiftly enacted far-reaching sanctions on new investment and export controls on goods, supplies and technologies to Russia. In compliance with sanctions and consistent with our strategy for profitable international growth, we announced that we would begin steps toward a wind-down of our Russian operations, and we remain active in that process. Russia accounts for about 2% of our business. Sanctions and export compliance impact everyone in the oilfield and operations and supply chains in Russia are, at best, challenged. The situation is far too early and evolving to say more. Moving on to our macro outlook, we expect oil and gas demand will grow over the near and medium-term, driven by economic expansion, energy security concerns and population growth. At the same time, supply remains under structural threat of scarcity. While the war in Ukraine has created a short-term dislocation in commodity markets, the fundamental supply tightness existed before this geopolitical conflict. Current oil supply tightness and commodity price levels strengthen my confidence in the accelerating multiyear upcycle and very busy years ahead for Halliburton. In addition, I expect an important change in our customers behavior and priorities will provide structural support to oil prices throughout this upcycle. I believe supply dynamics have fundamentally changed due to investor return requirements, public ESG commitments and regulatory pressure, which make it more difficult for operators to commit to long-cycle hydrocarbon investments and instead drive investment flexibility through short-cycle barrels. The pursuit of increased investment flexibility leads operators to prioritize short-cycle projects, development over exploration, tiebacks versus new infrastructure and shale rather than deepwater. Clearly, there are important exceptions where successful long-term projects will be developed, but painting with a broad brush I believe most investments will be directed primarily towards short-cycle activity in the near and medium-term. The result of this focus is an industry-wide increase in the level of investment flexibility for operators and the subsequent support to commodity prices. With short-cycle barrels, companies make investment decisions annually and can respond more quickly to commodity price signals. As a result, when investment stops, production at a minimum doesn't grow. And in the case with unconventionals, it quickly declines. For example, when the pandemic drove the collapse of oil demand two years ago, U.S. shale companies swiftly reduced activity and production declined 2 million barrels in nine months. In contrast, long-cycle projects have two key elements: a long-time horizon and large upfront capital investment. Once these projects begin, investment continues and production cannot quickly respond to price signals. This tends to result in market oversupply. The pivot to short-cycle barrels creates the opposite effect, a perpetual threat of undersupply that is supportive to commodity price. I believe this pivot to short-cycle barrels is great for Halliburton and sets up fantastic conditions for us to outperform. Short-cycle activity results in higher relative capital spend by operators aimed directly at the wellbore for services Halliburton provides as opposed to infrastructure investments required for long-cycle projects. Our strong technology portfolio and market footprint match this activity globally. Halliburton works, innovates, and invests where it matters most for our customers. And finally, Halliburton's value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers explicitly focuses on helping operators maximize returns and cash flow. This makes Halliburton uniquely relevant for this environment. Our five strategic priorities are clear and effective and will drive our behavior in this upcycle. First, we focus on profitable growth in our strong international franchise. Second, we maximize value and cash flow in North America. Third, we accelerate the deployment and integration of automation and digital technologies. Fourth, we drive increased capital efficiency in all parts of our business. And fifth, we actively participate in advancing a sustainable energy future. As demand for Halliburton services increases, both internationally and in North America, we will execute on our five strategic priorities to deliver industry-leading returns and strong free cash flow for our shareholders. As I look across the international markets, I continue to believe our customers' international spend will increase by mid-teens this year. Here are some leading indicators. First, we started with revenues in the first quarter much higher compared to the same period of last year. Second, our completion tool order book increased 50% year-on-year in the first quarter, which represents work generally delivered within the current year. And third, we have a strong pipeline of new projects scheduled to start in the second half of this year, particularly in the Middle East. We expect international activity to gain momentum in the second quarter, led by the Middle East and Latin America and further accelerate in the second half of the year. More importantly, our strong first quarter Drilling and Evaluation division margins demonstrate our focus on profitable international growth. Beyond the shift to short-cycle barrels already discussed, we expect this international up cycle to be structurally different from prior cycles and Halliburton's international business is poised to benefit from it. Here's why. National oil companies and independents comprise a larger portion of the international customer set. As a result of divestitures in the last few years, many international assets now have new owners who require a more collaborative service provider to help unlock remaining reserves and maximize value. Halliburton's collaborative approach, broad technology portfolio, local expertise, and reliable execution help customers achieve their efficiency and production objectives. Halliburton's execution of our technology roadmap has completely transformed our competitiveness in Drilling and Evaluation. We enter this upcycle with the best product portfolio in our history and we see increased customer demand for our high-end technology and a recognition of its value. For example, Halliburton recently deployed our new Strata Examiner Wireline Imaging Service for multiple customers in Norway and Morocco. Strata Examiner helped operators acquire more accurate well data in oil and synthetic-based muds, better evaluate production potential and save rig time with log-down capability and increased logging speed. Another example is the latest addition to our logging while drilling suite, the StrataStar Azimuthal Resistivity Service for thin interbedded formations. Similar to our premium EarthStar service, the StrataStar combines high fidelity downhole sensors with powerful digital inversion capabilities. Multiple customers in the Middle East, Latin America, US and Canada use it for faster, more accurate reservoir characterization to precisely place wells in the most productive zones and maximize asset value. We also see a slight uptick in offshore exploration activity albeit from a historically low base. Halliburton's increased competitiveness in drilling and evaluation resulted in a doubling of our contract win rate in global exploration work over the last two years and we expect to benefit from any additional growth in this higher-margin market. Different from prior cycles, Halliburton's investments in specialty chemicals and artificial lift create unique growth opportunities as we expand the international footprint of these businesses. Last month, I attended the opening of our new chemical reaction plant in Saudi Arabia. Multiple years in the making, this world-class facility establishes our chemicals manufacturing footprint in the Eastern Hemisphere. It is our launch path for profitable growth in the specialty chemicals industry in the Middle East and beyond. This quarter, it will start manufacturing products for our production chemicals contract with a large IOC in Oman and chemicals for our own product service lines. Several years ago, I described digitalization as one of the defining trends in our industry for this decade. Today, digital innovations permeate all segments of the oilfield services market. At Halliburton, our strategy to drive digital and automation creates technological differentiation, contributes to higher international margins and drives internal efficiencies and cost savings. Here are some examples. On an integrated drilling project in Southeast Asia, Halliburton deployed Well Construction 4.0, our approach to digital transformation of well construction. It improved the rate of penetration by about 40% on initial wells and reduced rig site personnel by 21%. On an integrated project in the Middle East, we combine data science, smart bits drilling automation and project management services for a more than 40% reduction in average well delivery time. We also deploy our digital solutions to advance a sustainable energy future. In the first quarter, Energean hired Halliburton to assess the carbon storage potential of the Prinos Basin in Greece, who will use our DecisionSpace 365 cloud applications to perform long-term ploom modeling, characterize the storage complex and create a conceptual development plan with performance modeling. We expect to deliver steady, profitable growth in the international markets for the rest of this year. Increased activity and equipment tightness continued to sharpen our pricing discussions with customers. Pricing is increasing on current contract extensions. In the first quarter, the percentage of contract extensions exercised almost doubled compared to the same period last year, as operators generally prefer to extend existing contracts rather than bid work in an inflationary market. Pricing is also increasing on new work. Turning to North America. We see market tightness across all service segments. In the first quarter, average US rig count increased 14% sequentially and is up 62% year-on-year. Additionally, frac activity surged in March after winter weather and supply chain disruptions occurred earlier in the quarter. Halliburton's hydraulic fracturing fleet remains sold out and the overall market appears all, but sold out for the second half of the year. The market today presents several positive elements, previously absent in North America, and they give me confidence in the continued strength of this market over the coming years.  First, in the largest service segment in North America, the hydraulic fracturing market structure has improved. Today, the largest four pressure pumping companies account for about two-thirds of the market. Second, I believe that poor service industry returns over many years in North America, ultimately resulted in a closed-loop capital system because access to meaningful outside capital, doesn't exist today, market participants must generate their own cash in order to reinvest and grow their businesses. Broad-based profitability improvements are required to fund growth, not just what appears to be good economics on a single incremental fleet.  Finally, I see greater differentiation in hydraulic fracturing equipment types. In prior cycles, fleets were relatively the same. Today, all equipment is not created equal. Significant operational, environmental and pricing differences exist ranging from electric fleets at the top; dual fuel and Tier 4 diesel in the middle; and finally, Tier 2 diesel equipment at the bottom. We have a terrific fleet composition. Halliburton is the leader in low emissions frac equipment.  Our Zeus eFleets have committed contracts, earn attractive returns and deliver improved performance. Another technology that sets Halliburton apart from the rest of the hydraulic fracturing market is our SmartFleet Intelligent Fracturing System. Customers are adopting this groundbreaking technology and it has moved from pilot to campaign mode. We are deploying it for multiple operators across different basins and expect a six-fold increase in the number of stages completed with SmartFleet this year.  Tightness in North America is not just in hydraulic fracturing equipment. It exists across the whole oil and gas value chain, in spare parts, engines, electronics and many other inputs that cost more and are sometimes, not immediately available. While, we generally pass these increased costs on to operators, we also have effective solutions that minimize this operational impact and provide reliable execution for our customers.  For example, our sophisticated supply chain organization responded by sourcing sand from Wisconsin when local mines were down in the Permian. In trucking, our collaboration with Vorto provides us with real-time information on the market clearing price for drivers and allows us to manage inflation and significantly reduce logistics-related nonproductive time.  Years of low pricing and low returns impacted the North American oilfield services sector and the larger supply chain that supports our industry. Sustainably improved pricing is required to avoid future supply chain disruptions and to invest in the equipment, people and technology necessary to deliver production growth. I believe our customers understand this. Against this backdrop, we see a long runway for ongoing net pricing improvement across all of our product service lines. In this recovery, Halliburton is focused on maximizing value in North America. For us, this is a margin cycle, not a build cycle.  Last quarter, I shared with you my view that North America customer spending would grow more than 25% year-on-year. Today, as I look at a combination of customer activity and inflation, my outlook has improved, and I now expect North America spending to increase by over 35% this year. With respect to activity, over 60% of the US land rig count sits with private companies and they keep growing, while public E&Ps remain committed to their activity plans. Activity and demand for our services are increasing, both internationally and in North America. With our unique value proposition, clearly defined strategic priorities and global presence, I expect Halliburton will deliver profitable growth, solid free cash flow and industry-leading returns and outperform as this upcycle accelerates. Now I will turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our first quarter financial results. Lance?\nLance Loeffler: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a summary of our first quarter results, compared to the first quarter of 2021. Total company revenue for the quarter was $4.3 billion, an increase of 24%. Adjusted operating income was $533 million, or a 44% increase compared to the operating income of $370 million in the first quarter of 2021. These results were primarily driven by increased activity across all regions and improved pricing in North America. In the first quarter, we recorded pre-tax charges of $64 million. Of these, impairments and other charges totaled $22 million, including $16 million of receivables related to the write-off of all of our assets in Ukraine. The remainder of the charges totaled $42 million and was related to the redemption premium and unamortized expenses associated with the early retirement of $600 million of our 2025 senior notes. Now let me discuss our division results in more detail. Starting with our Completion and Production division, revenue was $2.4 billion, an increase of 26%, while operating income was $296 million or an increase of 17%. These results were primarily driven by increased pressure pumping services and artificial lift activity in the Western Hemisphere, higher completion tool sales throughout the Western Hemisphere in the Middle East, increased cementing activity in Africa and Middle East Asia, and improved well intervention services in North America land and the Eastern Hemisphere. These improvements were partially offset by lower activity across multiple product service lines in Europe and lower completion tool sales throughout Asia. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $1.9 billion, an increase of 22%, while operating income was $294 million or a 72% increase. These results were due to increased drilling related services globally; improved wireline activity in North America land, Latin America and the Middle East; increased testing services internationally; and higher project management activity in Latin America, India and Oman. Partially offsetting these increases were lower project management activity in Iraq as well as lower fluid services in the Caribbean, Brunei and Mozambique. Moving on to our geographic results. In North America, revenue increased 37%. This increase was primarily driven by improved pressure pumping activity and drilling related services in North America land, higher stimulation, artificial lift and drilling related activity in Canada and higher completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico. These increases were partially offset by reduced fluid services in the Gulf of Mexico. Turning to Latin America. Revenue increased 22% due to improved activity across multiple product service lines in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico; increased well construction services in Colombia; higher completion tool sales in Guyana; improved project management activity in Ecuador and Colombia; increased testing services and wireline activity across the region; and increased artificial lift activity in Ecuador. Partially offsetting these increases were reduced fluid services in the Caribbean and lower project management and stimulation activity in Mexico. In Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue increased 7%. This improvement was primarily driven by higher activity across multiple product service lines in Egypt, increased drilling-related activity in Azerbaijan, increased well intervention and testing services across the region, improved well construction services in West Africa, and higher completion tool sales and cementing activity in Angola. These increases were partially offset by reduced activity across multiple product service lines in the United Kingdom, reduced well construction services and completion tool sales in Norway and decreased fluid services in Mozambique. In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue increased 17%, primarily resulting from improved well construction services in Saudi Arabia and Oman, increased wireline activity and completion tool sales in the Middle East, and increased testing services across the region. These increases were partially offset by reduced project management activity in Iraq, lower completion tool sales throughout Asia, decreased fluid services in Brunei and lower stimulation activity in Bangladesh. Our corporate and other expense for the quarter totaled $57 million, and I expect that to serve as a good quarterly run rate for the remainder of the year. Net interest expense for the quarter was $107 million. I expect this level of interest expense to drift slightly lower in the second quarter as a result of a full quarter impact of our reduced debt balance. Our normalized effective tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 21%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our second quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 24%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $189 million. Our expected CapEx spend for the full year remains at approximately $1 billion, and we anticipate that our remaining capital expenditures will increase quarter-over-quarter into the end of the year. Our first quarter cash flow from operations and free cash flow was a use of cash of $50 million and $183 million, respectively. These results were primarily driven by investment in working capital, consistent with our strong activity growth. As is typical for our business in an upcycle, we expect our cash flow to be back-end loaded for the year. We still expect to generate strong free cash flow for the remainder of 2022. Finally, turning to our near-term operational outlook, let me provide you with some comments on how we see the second quarter unfolding. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect the seasonal revenue decline in software sales to be offset by further improvements in global drilling activity. Therefore, second quarter revenue is anticipated to grow low- to mid single-digits. As a result of the falloff of software sales, we expect D&E margins to decline 125 to 175 basis points. In the Completions and Production division, activity is accelerating globally and scarcity will drive pricing in North America in the second quarter. As such, we expect second quarter revenue to grow in the mid-teens and margins to improve 350 to 400 basis points. I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff?\nJeff Miller: Thanks, Lance. Let me summarize what we've talked about today. We believe that this accelerating multi-year upcycle is different and more sustainable than prior cycles due to operators' focus on short-cycle barrels. Halliburton's strategic priorities are clear and effective and drive outperformance. Our technology portfolio and market presence mean that we are poised for profitable growth in the international markets. In the tight North America market, we remain focused on maximizing value and improving returns. And finally, I expect Halliburton to continue to deliver profitable growth, strong free cash flow and industry-leading returns in this up cycle. And now, let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is open.\nDavid Anderson: Hi. Good morning, Jeff. \nJeff Miller: Good morning, Dave.\nDavid Anderson: Your sales force in the U.S. has been playing defense the past five or six years, returns of software, but now your customers are actually reaping record cash flows basically on the back of low service cost. And as you said, equipment is essentially sold out in the U.S., activity is ramping up, oil's at 100, fundamentals are pretty tight. I'm not sure if I've ever seen a better environment to push pricing. So I was wondering if you could talk about this process. What are you telling your sales force now in terms of pricing? And more importantly, what's the pushback from E&P? I understand the sense of sticker shock, but the situation is only going to get worse a year from today. I don't see capacity being built, E&P costs are only going in one direction. If you could kind of frame your -- frame the whole pricing debate for me, I'd appreciate that. Thank you.\nJeff Miller: Yes. Yes, I will do that. Look, I think the most important -- I mean, obviously, pushing price all of the time, so guidance to the sales force is literally -- this is the amount of equipment, we expect it to earn more. And the sold-out conditions make that a lot clearer, certainly, for our folks and I think for our customers as well. And I think the other key here is, though, it's a more iterative process and it continues to be iterative. By that, I mean, we've moved on price and we'll continue to move on prices. We work certainly this quarter, next quarter and through the year. And so, I expect to continue to move that direction with price. I think it is a bit of a sticker shock, because you're seeing inflation across the entire sector. So we've got inputs that are going up meaningfully. Our own costs are going up meaningfully, and we're outpacing those costs in terms of net pricing. And so, I would describe it, I think you're accurate. It's more around sticker shock. I described last quarter, we were moving around a little bit between customers as customers, sort of, felt around in the marketplace for what's out there, what's possible. And so, I think that, obviously, we plan to continue moving.\nDavid Anderson: So, Jeff, I recognize it's early to talk about 2023. A lot has changed over the last 90 days, though, especially kind of, if you think about kind of global hydrocarbon movement. I was wondering, is it fair to say that your top line expectations for next year have materially increased, particularly around the international outlook that you're talking about ramping up? And kind of -- and part of that is 35% incremental margins are sort of the baseline, I guess, if we talk about double-digit growth, but could that actually be closer to 40% or even 45% on how you see pricing particularly on that -- based on what we saw in the mid-2000s? So it doesn't seem like much of a stretch.\nJeff Miller: Yes. Look, Dave, I'm really excited about the outlook. And what I don't want to do is get in the business of refining a two-year outlook every quarter. But clearly, every quarter trajectory changes. And I'm very excited about those changes. And I think everything we see, including what you described as energy security, sets up a busier North America, clearly and strong growth internationally. And what's key is we're seeing them both at the same time. And that's -- it's something we really haven't seen in a very long time and sets up very well for certainly us.\nDavid Anderson: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nJames West: Hey, good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Lance.\nJeff Miller: Hey, good morning, James.\nLance Loeffler: Good morning, James.\nJames West: So Jeff, you talked a lot about short-cycle barrels, which makes a ton of sense, given the situation the world's in now being short oil in a pretty significant way that, that would be the focus today. When do you think that, if it does, that the cycle turns into one of a more balanced mix of short-cycle barrels and some longer-cycle barrels, some of the more complex, maybe more offshore or just maybe bigger development-type projects?\nJeff Miller: Well, I think that what we see offshore generally today are tiebacks or development-type activity. But I think when I look further into the future, it's a combination of sort of ESG pressure is clearly one\u2026\nJames West: Right.\nJeff Miller: \u2026capital returns, returns is another key element of that. And I don't think those are changing anytime soon. And so what I think we see is a marketplace that's going to have more optionality clearly for our clients. And in some respects, for us as well. I mean that's the approach we've taken sort of longer-term maximizing value in North America is a view that we are going to be where we need to be. But clearly, in places where we have optionality also, I think you see that in sort of CapEx spend. And I think that we've done -- everything I see, it just takes a long time to get those things underway and lots of money upfront, and I just don't really see over a longer period of time, like I don't know -- I want to give you a time, but a much longer period of time, could we see that creep back in? We probably could, but I don't see it in the viewfinder today.\nJames West: Okay. Okay. That's fair enough. And then Jeff, we hear a lot about and we've been talking to a lot of the NOCs, particularly the ones in the Middle East and North Africa, who are reworking their budgets or have been over the last seven, eight weeks and using a little bit higher oil price estimation. And I'm curious what they're telling you and probably your competitors as well about how these budget increases will flow through? I mean these are, in some cases, fairly bureaucratic operators. And so their ability to change and to get capital into the field and get service companies lined up in rigs and frac spreads, et cetera, takes some time. So I know you're certainly more optimistic now than you were probably yesterday, a day before and six weeks ago, but are \u2013 do you think you see a lot of this in the back half, or are we really starting to talk about a 2023, 2024, 2025 story for a lot of these big NOCs?\nJeff Miller: Look, I think we're going to see building activity sooner than that. I think it builds throughout the balance of 2022 and then probably continues to get legs in 2023, likely beyond. I think the key is that $100 oil, everything is busy. And people want to be busy, but the question is, can they be busy? And what we've seen is really seven years of underinvestment around the entire world spending about half of what we used to spend. And that's not something that's overcome in a day or a year or \u2013 that just takes time to \u2013 to get momentum. And I talked there are clearly all of Middle East, not the same. Clearly, there are NOCs that take a very long view and will build into growing production over time. But that's not the case everywhere. Lot of activity for us, but I think \u2013 and we'll see that sooner. But I don't think that you see the real long cycle-type work. It's just going to take quite a bit of time.\nJames West: All right. All right. Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks, Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nChase Mulvehill: Hey, good morning, everybody.\nLance Loeffler: Good morning, Chase.\nJeff Miller: Hey, Chase.\nChase Mulvehill: Hey, Jeff and hey, Lance. So I guess I wanted to follow-up on the margin guidance on the C&P side. Obviously, pretty strong sequential increase, I think you said 350 to 400 bps of margin improvement on the C&P side. So Lance, I don't know if you could step back and kind of walk us through some of the moving pieces. Obviously, 1Q was a little bit softer than we all thought. But just kind of walk us through price, so maybe some costs coming out or things just to help us kind of get confidence in that big sequential increase in margins on the C&P side?\nLance Loeffler: Yeah. And you're right, Chase. A lot of noise in Q1, we've discussed before sort of the air pocket that exists as we move across the calendar year with completion tool sales and the profitability that goes with that. And certainly, the headwinds that we faced with sand supply early in the first quarter. But I think the real underpinning of the guidance is what we're beginning to see now on pricing in North America, and it really beginning to take hold. I mean, as Jeff said, we've been very careful about the equipment we've told you were sold out. So it's not like we're adding incremental equipment. This is really a pricing story for North America as it begins to turn.\nChase Mulvehill: Okay. I guess, the follow-up is really on pricing. Obviously, pretty tight US market, you're really starting to gain momentum on the pricing side. And Lance, if we were to kind of squint really hard and look at leading-edge pricing, can we say that leading-edge pricing is starting to feel like its back to kind of 2018 levels, or are we kind of a long way from being able to kind of make that comparison just yet?\nLance Loeffler: I think it's a little early, but I think that we're heading in that direction, and we'll get there, we'll eclipse that as we go throughout the course of the second and third quarter.\nJeff Miller: Yeah. I think what's important, though, Chase, is that it's not the marginal fleet at the front edge of the curve, it's really the entire business that needs to get the recovery. And I think that's what we're in the process of doing. So does the leading edge makes sense, yes. But the fact is, as I described in my comments, an incremental fleet is not really the decision point here, it's the recovery of the whole business in order to generate free cash flow.\nLance Loeffler: And improved returns.\nJeff Miller: Yes.\nChase Mulvehill: Great. Makes sense. I\u2019ll turn it back over.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning, team. Jeff, if I heard you right, you talked about North America growing 35% in terms of CapEx this year versus your previous estimate of 25%. Can you talk a little bit about what gives you confidence around that view? Is the composition of that more of the privates, or do you actually see it showing up in public E&Ps? And is that activity-driven, or is it inflation-driven? Any color around the margin because that's a material increase in your macro expectations.\nJeff Miller: Well, a lot of that inflation that we see. It's -- and obviously, there's been a lot of inflation if we just look at the cost of inputs separate from our own, we've seen inputs ranging and cost increases from 20% to 100%, depending on what the item is. And so that weighs on it. Rig counts up 45% if we were to stop today, frac crews are up 20% if we were to stop today and the cost of each of those are more. And so look, I think really what we're seeing is public companies will stick -- are sticking with activity outlook. It's not necessarily increasing activity. And then with privates, we continue to see more activity and they keep growing. And so I think that operators all have different strategies and are very, very sharp around this. And so I expect that they will manage their business the way they plan to manage it, but there's just no question that when I see inflation and activity and clearly privates, to make clear, the private growth is an important part of that outlook. We just -- my view is that we've moved up from where we were a quarter ago.\nNeil Mehta: And Jeff, we clearly build in the rig count here and we're seeing an intention for to come into 2023 a little bit hotter from a production standpoint. But when we talk to producers, the constraint continues to be around labor and pressure pumping equipment. Do you see new capacity being added into the market by your competitors? And ultimately, will that be a constraint on the US production profile over the next couple of years?\nJeff Miller: Yes. I think it will be a constraint. I'm going to go back to my earlier remarks about a closed-loop system and terms of generating cash in order to build equipment and there\u2019s a lot of equipment repair that needs to still happen or replacement in the marketplace. So I think that will be a constraint, labor and certainly equipment. And that's one of the reasons we take a very long view of fleet health, and we've got one of the healthiest fleets in the marketplace. But inside of our capital budget, we're always replacing aging equipment, and we're looking ahead today to 2023 and 2024 in terms of what that fleet composition needs to look like. So we're unique in that regard in terms of where we sit. But I do think that we don't -- I don't see capacity and I don't see meaningful capital to support any kind of build cycle at this point. Reality is this industry is still in recovery mode.\nDavid Anderson: Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your line is open.\nScott Gruber: Yes, good morning. I just want to come back to the C&P margin outlook, especially given what's happening in the marketplace here with your improvement in frac pricing. When I look at the margins and the incrementals, obviously a lot of noise in 1Q, which you've talked about, but when I look at margins embedded in your guide versus the second half of last year, that the incremental still look pretty modest. But going forward, obviously, a building completion tool backlog, frac prices improving, but obviously, pretty stout inflation coming through the system. How should we think about those factors impacting C&P incrementals in the second half? Can we see incrementals rise into the 40s, although inflation constrained those incrementals kind of in the 30s? How should we think about it?\nJeff Miller: Yes. Well, if we look at the Q2, I mean, the way you described it, everything we're doing is driving better margins in C&P, whether it's the operating leverage in the business, moving on price, equipment is tight. I think the Q2 guide is -- puts us in that sort of range. Yes, there's a lot of inflation on other inputs to the business that we are recovering, but even recovering the cost of those other inputs will have a bit of a dilutive impact on overall margins, but that doesn't change the recovery for us and the speed and the momentum of that recovery. And so I feel very good about where we're going and expect incrementals to be at the high end of what a range would be as we move through this process.\nScott Gruber: Got it. Got it. And one of the concerns we've heard just on the capturing the next round of pricing in frac is just around timing. Your pricing leverage is improving. But I guess the question is, when do you see the next round really hitting? Is that kind of in 2Q, 3Q, or do we have to wait until kind of late in the year in the next budget season to really see a -- the next big step-up? How quickly does the next round of pricing in frac [indiscernible]?\nJeff Miller: Yes. Yes, look -- crazy to get into the strategy for different customers and where we are. But obviously, this is an iterative process, meaning it's not something we wait until next year to do again. It's something that we are doing sort of in real time on a very regular basis. And so I expect -- we're in a $100 oil environment here. And this is part of the cost of delivering $100 oil. And so, a healthy recovering industry, we will continue to iterate on price as we move through the year, not planning for next year.\nScott Gruber: Got it. Understood. Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ian Macpherson with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nIan Macpherson: Good morning team. The situation in Russia has shifted the paradigm not only for crude, obviously, but also natural gas and coal, both of which land on the shoulders of natural gas everywhere else. So, we've seen that strip move radically recently. What do you think the customer response will be from US and international producers of natural gas with regard to activity response to what might be a structural higher strip just like crude that maybe hasn't shown up yet in the fundamentals of your business through April?\nJeff Miller: Yes. Look, I think, Ian, that has to strengthen certainly in terms of activity, and I expect we'll see that in the important gas-producing countries internationally, we will see more of that activity and even likely in the US. But the fact is, there still are some important constraints in place around pipeline capacity and whatnot that is serving to keep some of that market constrained today. But look, our business in the gas basins is improving and is busy and really not too dissimilar from kind of the demand response or the activity response that we see from oil.\nIan Macpherson: Okay. And then, Jeff, just going back to the outlook on C&P margins. You -- obviously, there was significant weather and sand bottlenecks that distorted Q1 and you have a healthy recovery guided for Q2. But does your margin guidance for Q2 for C&P embed an assumption that the sand problem is sort of contained fully now, or do you -- or is that an area for remaining incremental recovery of margins from enduring bottleneck on sand as you've guided Q2 later in the year?\nJeff Miller: No, I think the sand is largely behind us. That was a good example of underinvestment in supply chain. And as it was turned back on, it had a lot of maintenance, lack of maintenance thereof, and we even participated with some of our vendors to help them get things back online and I believe that's largely behind us. Look, I think the important point here is this trend is moving up. We're going to see all sorts of things, but our guide accounts for sort of all of the things that we see. And I think that we are just in this place where we're going to continue seeing improvement sort of over whatever the labor bottlenecks happen to be, those are going to all be overcome consistently as we move through year and really beyond. I mean I think that we'll continue to power through all of that and continue to see solid incremental growth at margins.\nIan Macpherson: Super. Thanks Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nConnor Lynagh: Yes. Thank you. I know it's a bit early to say precisely, but just returning to the topic of international pricing. Do you see meaningful constraints in either your available equipment in select markets or your availability of labor, or is that more of a US issue at this point?\nJeff Miller: Look, I think a lot of the same tightness discussion that we talk about in the US is similar internationally. It comes in smaller pockets generally because it's 70 countries as opposed to one. But we're seeing more tightness in tools, clearly in people, and I think that's what's driving extensions today. I described the increase in the number of extensions we are seeing at higher prices. That's a great sign. But that's really predicated on tightening markets and the importance of having services available. Equipment is getting tighter. New work is pricing better. It moves more slowly than the US, so it may be a little less pronounced, but I expect that, that continues to improve. The large tenders remain competitive, but the fact is they're soaking up noticeable equipment. And in fact, some of that tightness in the marketplace is creating opportunity for Halliburton.  There are a number of situations where, because of our supply chain and access to raw materials and products, we were able to supply when others could not. And so, I think that's a real -- that's the evidence that, that market is getting tighter. When we get a third call from a customer says, hey, do you have anything' and we're able to supply it, that's an indicator that the market is getting tighter.\nConnor Lynagh: Got it. That's helpful color. Just on the supply chain side of things, there's obviously been a lot changing in the world over the last month or two here. Have you had any sort of hot spots that you're monitoring? Are there any areas that, we should think about being -- something we should be watching as you ramp activity through the back half of the year here?\nJeff Miller: No, I don't think so. I mean I think what we're going to just see is the lengthening of delivery times. Things take longer to deliver, and therefore, planning matters more than ever. Obviously planning on our part, but also planning on the parts of our customers. And again, it is creating opportunity for us. And I think along the way, the key here is, we can't and won't subsidize operators in this process. So, we've been very transparent in terms of the cost to acquire things, the timing to acquire things. And I think that, again, our supply chain organization is very sophisticated and it outperforms. And so, I put Halliburton right at the top of that when it comes to solving those kinds of shortages, bottlenecks, whatever it may be.\nConnor Lynagh: Got it. Thank you very much.\nJeff Miller: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. Your line is open.\nStephen Gengaro: Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. \nJeff Miller: Good morning, Stephen.\nStephen Gengaro: Two things for me. Just to start with, with the world evolving and you mentioned kind of the pull on short-cycle barrels, how do you think about CapEx? How do you think about investing in assets which have 5-year-plus lives in an environment where things have changed so dramatically?\nJeff Miller: Well, we look at that returns on that equipment inside the time that we know it will work. And so, it much of that at all. Anything that we're doing, we've got line of sight to not only the initial project, but its full cycle return, and expect that to get returned in the life of that contract. I'd use eFleets as an example of that, where our view is, they have to make a return on capital and a return of capital inside of the time it goes -- its initial contract. And we view a lot of things that way. And so, I think just as operators sort of retain flexibility \u2013 budget flexibility around what they choose to do, we're doing the same.  And that's what allows us really in my view, to confidently drive profitable growth internationally, which D&E margins are an example of that, and then also maximize value in North America, which is our approach to North America is demonstrating that also. And so I really like our strategy very much, and I think it's very consistent with the kind of market that we see unfolding.\nStephen Gengaro: Thanks. And I guess the follow-up, just when you think about -- and you mentioned the concentration of frac equipment in the hands of just a few operators now and you've seen consolidation. Have you seen behavioral change from -- in general, just from all the players in the market? Do you think it's just a function of the market being sold out? Do you think other -- your competitors are truly acting better when it comes to pricing?\nJeff Miller: Look, I can't comment there. I mean, what I see is an industry broadly that has underperformed for a long time. And I know in our own case, for Halliburton, in order to reinvest in even replacement equipment, we need fundamentals that are better and returns that are higher in order to generate the cash back to my point around maximizing value in North America. We're only going to do that if the investment is produced by the equipment that is working in the marketplace. And so independent of what others are doing, that's what we are doing. And when I look across the marketplace, I see a whole industry that has largely suffered the same thing. And so that's just pure economics at work there.\nStephen Gengaro: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Miller for closing remarks.\nJeff Miller: Yeah. Thank you, Michelle. Look, before we end the call, let me just close with these comments. I am confident in my outlook on the strength of this market upcycle. And I expect Halliburton will deliver profitable growth, strong free cash flow and industry-leading returns as this upcycle accelerates. The pivot to short-cycle barrels only confirms this upcycle staying power. Look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Michelle, let's close out the call.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeff Miller",
            "content": "Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased with Halliburton's first quarter results. Our performance demonstrates the resilience of our unique strategy in action and the importance of our competitive positioning, both in North America and international markets. Here are some highlights from the first quarter. International revenue grew 15% compared to the first quarter of 2021, with activity accelerating across all international markets. Strong growth in Latin America and the Middle East/Asia offset the winter weather impacts in Europe. In North America, revenue grew 37% year-on-year with the acceleration of both drilling and completions activity. Higher utilization in March and net pricing gains drove margin expansion despite weather and sand disruptions earlier in the quarter. Our Completion and Production division revenue grew 26% compared to the first quarter of 2021 on activity increases in North America, Africa and the Middle East, while operating income increased 17% despite transitory U.S. land/sand delivery disruptions. Our Drilling and Evaluation division grew revenue 22% year-on-year, while margins expanded 440 basis points and started the year at 15% for the first time since 2010. This exceptional performance was largely driven by the strength of our directional drilling and project management businesses. We added three new companies to Halliburton Labs, our clean energy accelerator. This brings the total number of program participants and alumni to 15 companies. Halliburton Labs allows us to actively participate in the future of clean energy value chain. Finally, we retired $600 million of our $1 billion of debt maturing in 2025 and nearly tripled our quarterly dividend to $0.12 per share. These actions strengthen our balance sheet and reflect our commitment to return cash to shareholders. Before we continue, I want to provide a few comments about the current situation in Ukraine and Russia. This is a tragedy on many dimensions and for us, especially for our people in both countries. As we've all seen, governments in the European Union, the United States, Switzerland and other countries swiftly enacted far-reaching sanctions on new investment and export controls on goods, supplies and technologies to Russia. In compliance with sanctions and consistent with our strategy for profitable international growth, we announced that we would begin steps toward a wind-down of our Russian operations, and we remain active in that process. Russia accounts for about 2% of our business. Sanctions and export compliance impact everyone in the oilfield and operations and supply chains in Russia are, at best, challenged. The situation is far too early and evolving to say more. Moving on to our macro outlook, we expect oil and gas demand will grow over the near and medium-term, driven by economic expansion, energy security concerns and population growth. At the same time, supply remains under structural threat of scarcity. While the war in Ukraine has created a short-term dislocation in commodity markets, the fundamental supply tightness existed before this geopolitical conflict. Current oil supply tightness and commodity price levels strengthen my confidence in the accelerating multiyear upcycle and very busy years ahead for Halliburton. In addition, I expect an important change in our customers behavior and priorities will provide structural support to oil prices throughout this upcycle. I believe supply dynamics have fundamentally changed due to investor return requirements, public ESG commitments and regulatory pressure, which make it more difficult for operators to commit to long-cycle hydrocarbon investments and instead drive investment flexibility through short-cycle barrels. The pursuit of increased investment flexibility leads operators to prioritize short-cycle projects, development over exploration, tiebacks versus new infrastructure and shale rather than deepwater. Clearly, there are important exceptions where successful long-term projects will be developed, but painting with a broad brush I believe most investments will be directed primarily towards short-cycle activity in the near and medium-term. The result of this focus is an industry-wide increase in the level of investment flexibility for operators and the subsequent support to commodity prices. With short-cycle barrels, companies make investment decisions annually and can respond more quickly to commodity price signals. As a result, when investment stops, production at a minimum doesn't grow. And in the case with unconventionals, it quickly declines. For example, when the pandemic drove the collapse of oil demand two years ago, U.S. shale companies swiftly reduced activity and production declined 2 million barrels in nine months. In contrast, long-cycle projects have two key elements: a long-time horizon and large upfront capital investment. Once these projects begin, investment continues and production cannot quickly respond to price signals. This tends to result in market oversupply. The pivot to short-cycle barrels creates the opposite effect, a perpetual threat of undersupply that is supportive to commodity price. I believe this pivot to short-cycle barrels is great for Halliburton and sets up fantastic conditions for us to outperform. Short-cycle activity results in higher relative capital spend by operators aimed directly at the wellbore for services Halliburton provides as opposed to infrastructure investments required for long-cycle projects. Our strong technology portfolio and market footprint match this activity globally. Halliburton works, innovates, and invests where it matters most for our customers. And finally, Halliburton's value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers explicitly focuses on helping operators maximize returns and cash flow. This makes Halliburton uniquely relevant for this environment. Our five strategic priorities are clear and effective and will drive our behavior in this upcycle. First, we focus on profitable growth in our strong international franchise. Second, we maximize value and cash flow in North America. Third, we accelerate the deployment and integration of automation and digital technologies. Fourth, we drive increased capital efficiency in all parts of our business. And fifth, we actively participate in advancing a sustainable energy future. As demand for Halliburton services increases, both internationally and in North America, we will execute on our five strategic priorities to deliver industry-leading returns and strong free cash flow for our shareholders. As I look across the international markets, I continue to believe our customers' international spend will increase by mid-teens this year. Here are some leading indicators. First, we started with revenues in the first quarter much higher compared to the same period of last year. Second, our completion tool order book increased 50% year-on-year in the first quarter, which represents work generally delivered within the current year. And third, we have a strong pipeline of new projects scheduled to start in the second half of this year, particularly in the Middle East. We expect international activity to gain momentum in the second quarter, led by the Middle East and Latin America and further accelerate in the second half of the year. More importantly, our strong first quarter Drilling and Evaluation division margins demonstrate our focus on profitable international growth. Beyond the shift to short-cycle barrels already discussed, we expect this international up cycle to be structurally different from prior cycles and Halliburton's international business is poised to benefit from it. Here's why. National oil companies and independents comprise a larger portion of the international customer set. As a result of divestitures in the last few years, many international assets now have new owners who require a more collaborative service provider to help unlock remaining reserves and maximize value. Halliburton's collaborative approach, broad technology portfolio, local expertise, and reliable execution help customers achieve their efficiency and production objectives. Halliburton's execution of our technology roadmap has completely transformed our competitiveness in Drilling and Evaluation. We enter this upcycle with the best product portfolio in our history and we see increased customer demand for our high-end technology and a recognition of its value. For example, Halliburton recently deployed our new Strata Examiner Wireline Imaging Service for multiple customers in Norway and Morocco. Strata Examiner helped operators acquire more accurate well data in oil and synthetic-based muds, better evaluate production potential and save rig time with log-down capability and increased logging speed. Another example is the latest addition to our logging while drilling suite, the StrataStar Azimuthal Resistivity Service for thin interbedded formations. Similar to our premium EarthStar service, the StrataStar combines high fidelity downhole sensors with powerful digital inversion capabilities. Multiple customers in the Middle East, Latin America, US and Canada use it for faster, more accurate reservoir characterization to precisely place wells in the most productive zones and maximize asset value. We also see a slight uptick in offshore exploration activity albeit from a historically low base. Halliburton's increased competitiveness in drilling and evaluation resulted in a doubling of our contract win rate in global exploration work over the last two years and we expect to benefit from any additional growth in this higher-margin market. Different from prior cycles, Halliburton's investments in specialty chemicals and artificial lift create unique growth opportunities as we expand the international footprint of these businesses. Last month, I attended the opening of our new chemical reaction plant in Saudi Arabia. Multiple years in the making, this world-class facility establishes our chemicals manufacturing footprint in the Eastern Hemisphere. It is our launch path for profitable growth in the specialty chemicals industry in the Middle East and beyond. This quarter, it will start manufacturing products for our production chemicals contract with a large IOC in Oman and chemicals for our own product service lines. Several years ago, I described digitalization as one of the defining trends in our industry for this decade. Today, digital innovations permeate all segments of the oilfield services market. At Halliburton, our strategy to drive digital and automation creates technological differentiation, contributes to higher international margins and drives internal efficiencies and cost savings. Here are some examples. On an integrated drilling project in Southeast Asia, Halliburton deployed Well Construction 4.0, our approach to digital transformation of well construction. It improved the rate of penetration by about 40% on initial wells and reduced rig site personnel by 21%. On an integrated project in the Middle East, we combine data science, smart bits drilling automation and project management services for a more than 40% reduction in average well delivery time. We also deploy our digital solutions to advance a sustainable energy future. In the first quarter, Energean hired Halliburton to assess the carbon storage potential of the Prinos Basin in Greece, who will use our DecisionSpace 365 cloud applications to perform long-term ploom modeling, characterize the storage complex and create a conceptual development plan with performance modeling. We expect to deliver steady, profitable growth in the international markets for the rest of this year. Increased activity and equipment tightness continued to sharpen our pricing discussions with customers. Pricing is increasing on current contract extensions. In the first quarter, the percentage of contract extensions exercised almost doubled compared to the same period last year, as operators generally prefer to extend existing contracts rather than bid work in an inflationary market. Pricing is also increasing on new work. Turning to North America. We see market tightness across all service segments. In the first quarter, average US rig count increased 14% sequentially and is up 62% year-on-year. Additionally, frac activity surged in March after winter weather and supply chain disruptions occurred earlier in the quarter. Halliburton's hydraulic fracturing fleet remains sold out and the overall market appears all, but sold out for the second half of the year. The market today presents several positive elements, previously absent in North America, and they give me confidence in the continued strength of this market over the coming years.  First, in the largest service segment in North America, the hydraulic fracturing market structure has improved. Today, the largest four pressure pumping companies account for about two-thirds of the market. Second, I believe that poor service industry returns over many years in North America, ultimately resulted in a closed-loop capital system because access to meaningful outside capital, doesn't exist today, market participants must generate their own cash in order to reinvest and grow their businesses. Broad-based profitability improvements are required to fund growth, not just what appears to be good economics on a single incremental fleet.  Finally, I see greater differentiation in hydraulic fracturing equipment types. In prior cycles, fleets were relatively the same. Today, all equipment is not created equal. Significant operational, environmental and pricing differences exist ranging from electric fleets at the top; dual fuel and Tier 4 diesel in the middle; and finally, Tier 2 diesel equipment at the bottom. We have a terrific fleet composition. Halliburton is the leader in low emissions frac equipment.  Our Zeus eFleets have committed contracts, earn attractive returns and deliver improved performance. Another technology that sets Halliburton apart from the rest of the hydraulic fracturing market is our SmartFleet Intelligent Fracturing System. Customers are adopting this groundbreaking technology and it has moved from pilot to campaign mode. We are deploying it for multiple operators across different basins and expect a six-fold increase in the number of stages completed with SmartFleet this year.  Tightness in North America is not just in hydraulic fracturing equipment. It exists across the whole oil and gas value chain, in spare parts, engines, electronics and many other inputs that cost more and are sometimes, not immediately available. While, we generally pass these increased costs on to operators, we also have effective solutions that minimize this operational impact and provide reliable execution for our customers.  For example, our sophisticated supply chain organization responded by sourcing sand from Wisconsin when local mines were down in the Permian. In trucking, our collaboration with Vorto provides us with real-time information on the market clearing price for drivers and allows us to manage inflation and significantly reduce logistics-related nonproductive time.  Years of low pricing and low returns impacted the North American oilfield services sector and the larger supply chain that supports our industry. Sustainably improved pricing is required to avoid future supply chain disruptions and to invest in the equipment, people and technology necessary to deliver production growth. I believe our customers understand this. Against this backdrop, we see a long runway for ongoing net pricing improvement across all of our product service lines. In this recovery, Halliburton is focused on maximizing value in North America. For us, this is a margin cycle, not a build cycle.  Last quarter, I shared with you my view that North America customer spending would grow more than 25% year-on-year. Today, as I look at a combination of customer activity and inflation, my outlook has improved, and I now expect North America spending to increase by over 35% this year. With respect to activity, over 60% of the US land rig count sits with private companies and they keep growing, while public E&Ps remain committed to their activity plans. Activity and demand for our services are increasing, both internationally and in North America. With our unique value proposition, clearly defined strategic priorities and global presence, I expect Halliburton will deliver profitable growth, solid free cash flow and industry-leading returns and outperform as this upcycle accelerates. Now I will turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our first quarter financial results. Lance? Thanks, Lance. Let me summarize what we've talked about today. We believe that this accelerating multi-year upcycle is different and more sustainable than prior cycles due to operators' focus on short-cycle barrels. Halliburton's strategic priorities are clear and effective and drive outperformance. Our technology portfolio and market presence mean that we are poised for profitable growth in the international markets. In the tight North America market, we remain focused on maximizing value and improving returns. And finally, I expect Halliburton to continue to deliver profitable growth, strong free cash flow and industry-leading returns in this up cycle. And now, let's open it up for questions. Good morning, Dave. Yes. Yes, I will do that. Look, I think the most important -- I mean, obviously, pushing price all of the time, so guidance to the sales force is literally -- this is the amount of equipment, we expect it to earn more. And the sold-out conditions make that a lot clearer, certainly, for our folks and I think for our customers as well. And I think the other key here is, though, it's a more iterative process and it continues to be iterative. By that, I mean, we've moved on price and we'll continue to move on prices. We work certainly this quarter, next quarter and through the year. And so, I expect to continue to move that direction with price. I think it is a bit of a sticker shock, because you're seeing inflation across the entire sector. So we've got inputs that are going up meaningfully. Our own costs are going up meaningfully, and we're outpacing those costs in terms of net pricing. And so, I would describe it, I think you're accurate. It's more around sticker shock. I described last quarter, we were moving around a little bit between customers as customers, sort of, felt around in the marketplace for what's out there, what's possible. And so, I think that, obviously, we plan to continue moving. Yes. Look, Dave, I'm really excited about the outlook. And what I don't want to do is get in the business of refining a two-year outlook every quarter. But clearly, every quarter trajectory changes. And I'm very excited about those changes. And I think everything we see, including what you described as energy security, sets up a busier North America, clearly and strong growth internationally. And what's key is we're seeing them both at the same time. And that's -- it's something we really haven't seen in a very long time and sets up very well for certainly us. Hey, good morning, James. Well, I think that what we see offshore generally today are tiebacks or development-type activity. But I think when I look further into the future, it's a combination of sort of ESG pressure is clearly one... ...capital returns, returns is another key element of that. And I don't think those are changing anytime soon. And so what I think we see is a marketplace that's going to have more optionality clearly for our clients. And in some respects, for us as well. I mean that's the approach we've taken sort of longer-term maximizing value in North America is a view that we are going to be where we need to be. But clearly, in places where we have optionality also, I think you see that in sort of CapEx spend. And I think that we've done -- everything I see, it just takes a long time to get those things underway and lots of money upfront, and I just don't really see over a longer period of time, like I don't know -- I want to give you a time, but a much longer period of time, could we see that creep back in? We probably could, but I don't see it in the viewfinder today. Look, I think we're going to see building activity sooner than that. I think it builds throughout the balance of 2022 and then probably continues to get legs in 2023, likely beyond. I think the key is that $100 oil, everything is busy. And people want to be busy, but the question is, can they be busy? And what we've seen is really seven years of underinvestment around the entire world spending about half of what we used to spend. And that's not something that's overcome in a day or a year or \u2013 that just takes time to \u2013 to get momentum. And I talked there are clearly all of Middle East, not the same. Clearly, there are NOCs that take a very long view and will build into growing production over time. But that's not the case everywhere. Lot of activity for us, but I think \u2013 and we'll see that sooner. But I don't think that you see the real long cycle-type work. It's just going to take quite a bit of time. Thank you. Hey, Chase. Yeah. I think what's important, though, Chase, is that it's not the marginal fleet at the front edge of the curve, it's really the entire business that needs to get the recovery. And I think that's what we're in the process of doing. So does the leading edge makes sense, yes. But the fact is, as I described in my comments, an incremental fleet is not really the decision point here, it's the recovery of the whole business in order to generate free cash flow. Yes. Well, a lot of that inflation that we see. It's -- and obviously, there's been a lot of inflation if we just look at the cost of inputs separate from our own, we've seen inputs ranging and cost increases from 20% to 100%, depending on what the item is. And so that weighs on it. Rig counts up 45% if we were to stop today, frac crews are up 20% if we were to stop today and the cost of each of those are more. And so look, I think really what we're seeing is public companies will stick -- are sticking with activity outlook. It's not necessarily increasing activity. And then with privates, we continue to see more activity and they keep growing. And so I think that operators all have different strategies and are very, very sharp around this. And so I expect that they will manage their business the way they plan to manage it, but there's just no question that when I see inflation and activity and clearly privates, to make clear, the private growth is an important part of that outlook. We just -- my view is that we've moved up from where we were a quarter ago. Yes. I think it will be a constraint. I'm going to go back to my earlier remarks about a closed-loop system and terms of generating cash in order to build equipment and there's a lot of equipment repair that needs to still happen or replacement in the marketplace. So I think that will be a constraint, labor and certainly equipment. And that's one of the reasons we take a very long view of fleet health, and we've got one of the healthiest fleets in the marketplace. But inside of our capital budget, we're always replacing aging equipment, and we're looking ahead today to 2023 and 2024 in terms of what that fleet composition needs to look like. So we're unique in that regard in terms of where we sit. But I do think that we don't -- I don't see capacity and I don't see meaningful capital to support any kind of build cycle at this point. Reality is this industry is still in recovery mode. Yes. Well, if we look at the Q2, I mean, the way you described it, everything we're doing is driving better margins in C&P, whether it's the operating leverage in the business, moving on price, equipment is tight. I think the Q2 guide is -- puts us in that sort of range. Yes, there's a lot of inflation on other inputs to the business that we are recovering, but even recovering the cost of those other inputs will have a bit of a dilutive impact on overall margins, but that doesn't change the recovery for us and the speed and the momentum of that recovery. And so I feel very good about where we're going and expect incrementals to be at the high end of what a range would be as we move through this process. Yes. Yes, look -- crazy to get into the strategy for different customers and where we are. But obviously, this is an iterative process, meaning it's not something we wait until next year to do again. It's something that we are doing sort of in real time on a very regular basis. And so I expect -- we're in a $100 oil environment here. And this is part of the cost of delivering $100 oil. And so, a healthy recovering industry, we will continue to iterate on price as we move through the year, not planning for next year. Yes. Look, I think, Ian, that has to strengthen certainly in terms of activity, and I expect we'll see that in the important gas-producing countries internationally, we will see more of that activity and even likely in the US. But the fact is, there still are some important constraints in place around pipeline capacity and whatnot that is serving to keep some of that market constrained today. But look, our business in the gas basins is improving and is busy and really not too dissimilar from kind of the demand response or the activity response that we see from oil. No, I think the sand is largely behind us. That was a good example of underinvestment in supply chain. And as it was turned back on, it had a lot of maintenance, lack of maintenance thereof, and we even participated with some of our vendors to help them get things back online and I believe that's largely behind us. Look, I think the important point here is this trend is moving up. We're going to see all sorts of things, but our guide accounts for sort of all of the things that we see. And I think that we are just in this place where we're going to continue seeing improvement sort of over whatever the labor bottlenecks happen to be, those are going to all be overcome consistently as we move through year and really beyond. I mean I think that we'll continue to power through all of that and continue to see solid incremental growth at margins. Yes, thank you. Look, I think a lot of the same tightness discussion that we talk about in the US is similar internationally. It comes in smaller pockets generally because it's 70 countries as opposed to one. But we're seeing more tightness in tools, clearly in people, and I think that's what's driving extensions today. I described the increase in the number of extensions we are seeing at higher prices. That's a great sign. But that's really predicated on tightening markets and the importance of having services available. Equipment is getting tighter. New work is pricing better. It moves more slowly than the US, so it may be a little less pronounced, but I expect that, that continues to improve. The large tenders remain competitive, but the fact is they're soaking up noticeable equipment. And in fact, some of that tightness in the marketplace is creating opportunity for Halliburton.  There are a number of situations where, because of our supply chain and access to raw materials and products, we were able to supply when others could not. And so, I think that's a real -- that's the evidence that, that market is getting tighter. When we get a third call from a customer says, hey, do you have anything' and we're able to supply it, that's an indicator that the market is getting tighter. No, I don't think so. I mean I think what we're going to just see is the lengthening of delivery times. Things take longer to deliver, and therefore, planning matters more than ever. Obviously planning on our part, but also planning on the parts of our customers. And again, it is creating opportunity for us. And I think along the way, the key here is, we can't and won't subsidize operators in this process. So, we've been very transparent in terms of the cost to acquire things, the timing to acquire things. And I think that, again, our supply chain organization is very sophisticated and it outperforms. And so, I put Halliburton right at the top of that when it comes to solving those kinds of shortages, bottlenecks, whatever it may be. Thank you. Good morning, Stephen. Well, we look at that returns on that equipment inside the time that we know it will work. And so, it much of that at all. Anything that we're doing, we've got line of sight to not only the initial project, but its full cycle return, and expect that to get returned in the life of that contract. I'd use eFleets as an example of that, where our view is, they have to make a return on capital and a return of capital inside of the time it goes -- its initial contract. And we view a lot of things that way. And so, I think just as operators sort of retain flexibility \u2013 budget flexibility around what they choose to do, we're doing the same.  And that's what allows us really in my view, to confidently drive profitable growth internationally, which D&E margins are an example of that, and then also maximize value in North America, which is our approach to North America is demonstrating that also. And so I really like our strategy very much, and I think it's very consistent with the kind of market that we see unfolding. Look, I can't comment there. I mean, what I see is an industry broadly that has underperformed for a long time. And I know in our own case, for Halliburton, in order to reinvest in even replacement equipment, we need fundamentals that are better and returns that are higher in order to generate the cash back to my point around maximizing value in North America. We're only going to do that if the investment is produced by the equipment that is working in the marketplace. And so independent of what others are doing, that's what we are doing. And when I look across the marketplace, I see a whole industry that has largely suffered the same thing. And so that's just pure economics at work there. Yeah. Thank you, Michelle. Look, before we end the call, let me just close with these comments. I am confident in my outlook on the strength of this market upcycle. And I expect Halliburton will deliver profitable growth, strong free cash flow and industry-leading returns as this upcycle accelerates. The pivot to short-cycle barrels only confirms this upcycle staying power. Look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Michelle, let's close out the call."

            "name": "Lance Loeffler",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a summary of our first quarter results, compared to the first quarter of 2021. Total company revenue for the quarter was $4.3 billion, an increase of 24%. Adjusted operating income was $533 million, or a 44% increase compared to the operating income of $370 million in the first quarter of 2021. These results were primarily driven by increased activity across all regions and improved pricing in North America. In the first quarter, we recorded pre-tax charges of $64 million. Of these, impairments and other charges totaled $22 million, including $16 million of receivables related to the write-off of all of our assets in Ukraine. The remainder of the charges totaled $42 million and was related to the redemption premium and unamortized expenses associated with the early retirement of $600 million of our 2025 senior notes. Now let me discuss our division results in more detail. Starting with our Completion and Production division, revenue was $2.4 billion, an increase of 26%, while operating income was $296 million or an increase of 17%. These results were primarily driven by increased pressure pumping services and artificial lift activity in the Western Hemisphere, higher completion tool sales throughout the Western Hemisphere in the Middle East, increased cementing activity in Africa and Middle East Asia, and improved well intervention services in North America land and the Eastern Hemisphere. These improvements were partially offset by lower activity across multiple product service lines in Europe and lower completion tool sales throughout Asia. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $1.9 billion, an increase of 22%, while operating income was $294 million or a 72% increase. These results were due to increased drilling related services globally; improved wireline activity in North America land, Latin America and the Middle East; increased testing services internationally; and higher project management activity in Latin America, India and Oman. Partially offsetting these increases were lower project management activity in Iraq as well as lower fluid services in the Caribbean, Brunei and Mozambique. Moving on to our geographic results. In North America, revenue increased 37%. This increase was primarily driven by improved pressure pumping activity and drilling related services in North America land, higher stimulation, artificial lift and drilling related activity in Canada and higher completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico. These increases were partially offset by reduced fluid services in the Gulf of Mexico. Turning to Latin America. Revenue increased 22% due to improved activity across multiple product service lines in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico; increased well construction services in Colombia; higher completion tool sales in Guyana; improved project management activity in Ecuador and Colombia; increased testing services and wireline activity across the region; and increased artificial lift activity in Ecuador. Partially offsetting these increases were reduced fluid services in the Caribbean and lower project management and stimulation activity in Mexico. In Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue increased 7%. This improvement was primarily driven by higher activity across multiple product service lines in Egypt, increased drilling-related activity in Azerbaijan, increased well intervention and testing services across the region, improved well construction services in West Africa, and higher completion tool sales and cementing activity in Angola. These increases were partially offset by reduced activity across multiple product service lines in the United Kingdom, reduced well construction services and completion tool sales in Norway and decreased fluid services in Mozambique. In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue increased 17%, primarily resulting from improved well construction services in Saudi Arabia and Oman, increased wireline activity and completion tool sales in the Middle East, and increased testing services across the region. These increases were partially offset by reduced project management activity in Iraq, lower completion tool sales throughout Asia, decreased fluid services in Brunei and lower stimulation activity in Bangladesh. Our corporate and other expense for the quarter totaled $57 million, and I expect that to serve as a good quarterly run rate for the remainder of the year. Net interest expense for the quarter was $107 million. I expect this level of interest expense to drift slightly lower in the second quarter as a result of a full quarter impact of our reduced debt balance. Our normalized effective tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 21%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our second quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 24%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $189 million. Our expected CapEx spend for the full year remains at approximately $1 billion, and we anticipate that our remaining capital expenditures will increase quarter-over-quarter into the end of the year. Our first quarter cash flow from operations and free cash flow was a use of cash of $50 million and $183 million, respectively. These results were primarily driven by investment in working capital, consistent with our strong activity growth. As is typical for our business in an upcycle, we expect our cash flow to be back-end loaded for the year. We still expect to generate strong free cash flow for the remainder of 2022. Finally, turning to our near-term operational outlook, let me provide you with some comments on how we see the second quarter unfolding. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect the seasonal revenue decline in software sales to be offset by further improvements in global drilling activity. Therefore, second quarter revenue is anticipated to grow low- to mid single-digits. As a result of the falloff of software sales, we expect D&E margins to decline 125 to 175 basis points. In the Completions and Production division, activity is accelerating globally and scarcity will drive pricing in North America in the second quarter. As such, we expect second quarter revenue to grow in the mid-teens and margins to improve 350 to 400 basis points. I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff? Good morning, James. Good morning, Chase. Yeah. And you're right, Chase. A lot of noise in Q1, we've discussed before sort of the air pocket that exists as we move across the calendar year with completion tool sales and the profitability that goes with that. And certainly, the headwinds that we faced with sand supply early in the first quarter. But I think the real underpinning of the guidance is what we're beginning to see now on pricing in North America, and it really beginning to take hold. I mean, as Jeff said, we've been very careful about the equipment we've told you were sold out. So it's not like we're adding incremental equipment. This is really a pricing story for North America as it begins to turn. I think it's a little early, but I think that we're heading in that direction, and we'll get there, we'll eclipse that as we go throughout the course of the second and third quarter. And improved returns."

Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our fourth quarter earnings release and in the Quarterly Results & Presentation section of our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeffrey Miller: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. 2023 was a great year for Halliburton. Both of our divisions achieved their highest operating margins in over a decade, and we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders. Here are the highlights. We delivered full year total company revenue of $23 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year; and operating income of $4.1 billion, an increase of 33% compared to 2022 adjusted operating income. Our international business demonstrated strong growth with our revenue up 17% year-over-year despite our exit from Russia in August of 2022, completing 2 consecutive years of high teens growth. Our North America business showed strength with revenue up 9% year-over-year despite rig count declines. Completion and Production revenue grew 18% year-over-year and margins expanded 312 basis points. Drilling and Evaluation grew 7% year-over-year and margins expanded 171 basis points. Turning now to Q4, where Halliburton delivered exceptional margin performance supported by better-than-anticipated completion tool sales globally, strong performance across multiple high-margin product lines and favorable weather in North America. Completion and Production margins finished the year almost 100 basis points higher than Q4 of 2022. International revenue grew 12% year-over-year, led by the Europe-Africa region, which grew revenue 17%. Finally, during the fourth quarter, we generated $1.4 billion of cash from operations, $1.1 billion of free cash flow and repurchased approximately $250 million of common stock and $150 million of debt. Before we continue, I want to take a moment and thank the Halliburton employees around the world who made these results possible. Our success last quarter and throughout 2023 was a direct result of your hard work and dedication. Thank you for your relentless focus on safety, operational execution, customer collaboration and service quality performance. Let me begin with my views on the strength of the oilfield services market. As we look past the new cycle and near-term commodity price volatility, the fundamentals for oilfield services remain strong. Here are 2 reasons why. First, we see an increase in service intensity everywhere we operate. Whether it's longer laterals in North America, smaller and more complex reservoirs in mature fields or offshore deepwater, customers require more services to develop their resources, not fewer. Second, long-term expansion of the global economy will continue to create enormous demands on all forms of energy. I expect oil and gas remains a critical component of the global energy mix with demand growth well into the future. With this positive macro outlook, I believe Halliburton's strong execution, leading technology and collaborative approach will drive demand for Halliburton's products and services around the world. Now let's turn to international markets, where Halliburton's performance delivered another year of profitable growth. Halliburton's full year international revenue grew 17% year-on-year, and our quarterly revenue grew 12% compared to the same quarter of last year. Each region delivered year-on-year revenue growth throughout 2023, and both divisions delivered improved international margins year-on-year. Our results in 2023 demonstrate the effectiveness of Halliburton's profitable international growth strategy, the strength of our global competitiveness across product lines and the power of our value proposition with customers. In 2024, we expect international E&P spending to grow at a low double-digit pace and foresee multiple years of sustained activity growth. Although we anticipate regional differences in growth rates for 2024, we believe the Middle East/Asia region will likely experience the greatest increases in activity with other regions closely behind. As we look out to 2025, we expect Africa and Europe, among others, to demonstrate above-average growth. Beyond 2025, we see an active tender pipeline with work scopes extending through the end of the decade, which gives me confidence in the duration of this multiyear upcycle. While we expect overall activity growth, we also see above-market growth within our well construction product lines, where customers choose Halliburton to improve the reliability, consistency and efficiency of their drilling operations. One such technology is LOGIX' autonomous drilling platform, which is now used on 90% of our iCruise runs worldwide. Customers also rely on Halliburton's subsurface expertise to develop today's most complex reservoirs. This requires technologies to reduce uncertainties, such as our DecisionSpace 365, unified ensemble modeling and advanced formation evaluation systems like our iStar logging well drilling platform, and reservoir Xaminer formation testing service. These technologies enable customers to target small reservoirs, identify bypassed reserves and gather reservoir properties in real time. We see reservoir complexity increasing worldwide, and I expect the capabilities of these systems will continue to deliver customer value and lead in overall growth within our formation evaluation portfolio. For Completion and Production, we also expect increased adoption of our technologies like intelligent completions, multilateral solutions and artificial lift. Our intelligent and multilateral completions enable customers to produce, inject and control multiple zones in a wellbore, which is critical for offshore developments, a segment we expect to outpace the overall market. In artificial lift, our strategy targets markets like the Middle East and Latin America, where our differentiated performance and existing footprint create a solid foundation for profitable growth. We also expect strong demand for our services in carbon capture and storage, where Halliburton's leading capabilities to design, deliver and validate reliable barriers play a crucial role. As our customers invest in carbon storage, our tailored cement designs and casing equipment technology enable them to address the unique challenges of long-term carbon sequestration. With this activity growth, the availability of equipment and experienced personnel remains tight. We expect asset-intensive offshore activity to increase, which will further tighten the market. As offshore represents over half of our business outside North America land, we expect this activity to drive improved pricing and higher margins for our business. I am confident in Halliburton's strategy for profitable international growth, and I am excited about our performance in 2024 and well into the future. Turning to North America. Halliburton's strategy yielded strong results in 2023. Our full year North America revenue of $10.5 billion was a 9% increase when compared to 2022 despite sequentially lower rig count. Fourth quarter margins in North America land were relatively flat quarter-over-quarter despite lower revenue. Our full year and fourth quarter results demonstrated the strength of our differentiated business and the successful execution of our strategy to maximize value. The dynamic North America market continues to evolve with larger customers and stable programs, elevated quality expectations and greater demand for technology to improve recovery and well productivity. This evolution fits perfectly with Halliburton's value proposition. Our Zeus electric fracturing solution is highly sought after in this market, where its seamless combination of electric frac, automation and real-time subsurface measurements uniquely address customer requirements. We believe customers demand Zeus because it provides the lowest total cost of ownership and it's shown to be the most proven and reliable solution in the market. The market pull for this technology has been strong. The combination of Zeus fleets working in the field today and Zeus fleets contracted for 2024 delivery represent over 40% of our fracturing fleet. I expect well over half of our fleets will be electric in 2025 with all of these e-fleets on multiyear contracts generating full return of and return on capital during their initial contract terms. Consistent with our strategy from the beginning, we plan for our Zeus deliveries in 2024 to replace existing fleets rather than add incremental fleet capacity. This is how we maximize value in North America. The growth of Zeus and our commercial approach has transformed the North America completion services market. Technology is only transformative when adopted and is only adopted at the rate of Zeus when it works and creates meaningful value for our customers. Zeus' rapid adoption, both by new and repeat customers, tells us our solution is the right one for North America. Turning to our 2024 North America outlook. We expect a continued strong business with the combination of stable levels of activity in the market and the contracted nature of Halliburton's portfolio. We expect this results in a flattish revenue and margin environment for Halliburton. To close out, I am confident in our strategies to maximize value in North America and for profitable growth internationally. In 2023, Halliburton demonstrated the power of these strategies, the consistency of our execution and the value of our differentiated technology. We generated about $2.3 billion of free cash flow during the year, retired approximately $300 million of debt and returned $1.4 billion of cash to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends, which represents over 60% of our free cash flow. Today, I am pleased to announce that our Board of Directors approved an increase of our quarterly dividend to $0.17 per share. Our outlook for oilfield services remains strong, and I expect we will deepen and strengthen our value proposition and generate significant free cash flow. Now I'll turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric?\nEric Carre: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. 2023 was a strong year for Halliburton. Multiple financial and operational metrics showed the best business performance in recent memory, any one of which are worthy of highlighting. More important than any single metric, however, the overall business performance demonstrated the effectiveness of our strategy. Here are a few highlights. In our C&P division, our 2023 margins of 20.7% were the highest since 2011. In our D&E division, 2023 margins of 16.5% were the highest since 2008. In North America, our strategy to maximize value is about structurally changing the risk and return profile of our business. We delivered steady margins through the year despite lower activity driven by the rollout of our Zeus fleet and their associated contract terms and the strength of our well construction business. Internationally, our profitable growth strategy drove revenue and margin improvement across all of our geographies. Revenue was the highest in the last 8 years, and profit margins were the highest in over a decade. Beyond pricing and activity, this is the result of the multiyear investment in our drilling business and technology differentiation across multiple product lines. Our focus on capital efficiency allowed this revenue growth and structural margin improvement, while capital spending remained within our target range of 5% to 6% of revenue. Collectively, these results generated about $2.3 billion of free cash flow, the highest cash generation in the last 15 years. Let's turn now to our fourth quarter results. Our Q4 reported net income per diluted share was $0.74. Net income per diluted share, adjusted for losses in Argentina primarily due to the currency devaluation, was $0.86. Total company revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $5.7 billion. Operating income was $1.1 billion and the operating margin was 18.4%, a 95 basis point increase over Q4 2022. Beginning with our Completion and Production division. Revenue in Q4 was $3.3 billion, operating income was $716 million, and the operating income margin was 22%. Our better-than-anticipated results were driven by the best fourth quarter of completion tool sales in 9 years, strong performance across multiple product lines and favorable weather in North America. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in Q4 was $2.4 billion, operating income was $420 million, and the operating income margin was 17%, an increase of 122 basis point over Q4 last year. These results were in line with our expectation and driven by international software sales, higher project management activity in the Eastern Hemisphere and increased fluid services in the Western Hemisphere. Now let's move on to geographic results. Our Q4 international revenue increased 4% sequentially, which was our highest international revenue quarter since 2015 and tenth consecutive quarter of year-on-year revenue growth. Q4 sequential growth was led by the Middle East region driven by improved activity across multiple product lines and strong year-end completion tool sales. Europe/Africa demonstrated sequential growth consistent with the overall international market with higher activity in Africa offsetting lower product sales in Europe. Latin America revenue declined slightly in the fourth quarter, where reduced completion-related activity following a very strong third quarter activity improvements in the Caribbean. In North America, revenue in Q4 decreased 7% sequentially driven primarily by a decline in U.S. land activity as a result of typical holiday-related slowdowns. However, we experienced fewer weather-related events than expected. As weather-related downtime is more expensive than planned downtime, this means our Q4 North America land margins were higher than anticipated. Additionally, completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico delivered the strongest quarter in 3 years. Moving on to other items. In Q4, our corporate and other expense was $63 million. For the first quarter of 2024, we expect corporate expenses to be flat. Our SAP deployment remains on budget and on schedule to conclude in 2025. In Q4, we spent $15 million or about $0.02 per diluted share on SAP S/4 migration, which is included in our results. For the first quarter 2024, we expect these expenses to be approximately $30 million or $0.03 per share due to the timing associated with accelerated phases of the rollout. In 2024, we expect to spend $120 million and $80 million in 2025. Net interest expense for the quarter was $98 million, slightly higher than expected primarily due to premiums associated with debt buybacks. For the first quarter 2024, we expect net interest expense to be roughly $85 million. Other net expense for Q4 was $16 million lower than our prior guidance due to the non-GAAP treatment of the Argentinian peso devaluation. For the first quarter 2024, we expect this expense to be about $35 million. Our adjusted effective tax rate for Q4 was 17.9%, lower than expected due to discrete items. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our first quarter 2024 effective tax rate to be approximately 21%, slightly lower than our anticipated full year effective tax rate. Capital expenditure for Q4 were $399 million, which brought our full year CapEx total to $1.4 billion. Approximately 60% of our CapEx was deployed to international and offshore markets in 2023, and we expect this ratio to remain similar in 2024. For the full year of 2024, we expect capital expenditures to remain approximately 6% of revenue. Our Q4 cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion and free cash flow was $1.1 billion, bringing our full year free cash flow to about $2.3 billion. For 2024, we expect free cash flow to be directionally higher. Now let me provide you with some comments on our expectations for the first quarter. As is typical, our results will be subject to weather-related seasonality and the roll-off of significant year-end product sales. As a result, in our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to be flat to down 2% and margins lower by 125 to 175 basis points. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect sequential revenue to decline between 1% to 3% and margins to be lower by 25 to 75 basis points. I will now turn the call back to Jeff.\nJeffrey Miller: Thanks, Eric. Let me summarize our discussion today. 2023 was a great year for Halliburton. We generated about $2.3 billion of free cash flow and returned over 60% of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. We're committed to return over 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders in 2024. For our international business, we expect low double-digit growth driven by the power of our value proposition, global competitiveness across all product lines and our profitable growth strategy. In North America, we expect a continued strong business driven by stable activity, our differentiated technical position with our Zeus electric frac solution and the increasingly contracted nature of our business. And now let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. First question comes from David Anderson with Barclays.\nDavid Anderson: So a question on the C&P margins that held flat during the quarter, and you said U.S. land was holding flat. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the influence of your growing e-frac fleet on the bottom line. We know the operational advantages, but I was wondering if you could talk about how it impacts financially. How does e-frac, say -- compared to, say, your Tier 4 dual fuel, the diesel fleets just in terms of pricing and operating costs, trying to get a sense of how accretive the new equipment is. And sort of secondarily on that, with E&P consolidation well underway and we look out, say, 12 to 24 months, would you expect the majority of your e-frac fleets to be with these larger operators under multiyear contracts?\nJeffrey Miller: Yes. Well, thanks, Dave. Look, e-fleets are accretive. They're accretive for a couple of reasons. Number one, highly efficient to operate from our standpoint. And so that makes them more accretive. Clearly, the are bringing a lot of value to clients, and therefore, they're priced and thought about differently in the marketplace. And so look, I expect that, that will continue into the future. But I think what's most important is the contracted nature of the fleets, which mean a couple of things also. Number one, that the pricing is sticky, but it's sticky because it's contracted over time and the value is thought about. And so sophisticated procurers can look at that and model that, and we can model it as well and comfortable with the value created. But I think the second thing, as we think about what types of customers look at e-fleets, these aren't a spot market solution. I mean the companies that are interested in e-fleets are those that have steady programs, work through cycles, have a clear vision of where their business needs to go and are willing to commit to the technology to deliver that over the long term. And so -- and really, it's an entire system. If we think about an electric fleet, it's -- obviously, it's an efficient, lowest-TCO electric solution, but it's also automated, which drives the level of precision around fracking that I've never seen before. And so the clients know that they're delivering what they expect to deliver, and then finally, the subsurface measurement. But I bring all of that up because that's part of what drives it being accretive: a, it creates a lot more value, therefore, is more accretive than a Tier 4 diesel fleet clearly; and then also a different set of conditions, which also changes the return profile of these assets as we go into the market. I hope that helps, Dave.\nDavid Anderson: It does. A clear differentiation there. So a separate question here. I noticed in your release, you announced 2 new collaborations with other service companies: one in reservoir analysis, the other MPD. It sort of effectively fills a few of your weaker spots of your portfolio. And if I just think back to last cycle, we saw a number of acquisitions, but I don't recall too many collaborations out there. I mean, on the one hand -- I guess, from my point of view, on the one hand, maybe you're testing the waters a bit, but on the other, it seems like it's a pretty good way to fill product lines without spending a lot of capital. I was wondering if you could talk about the strategy and why it's different during the current cycle. And would you expect to enter more collaborations in the coming years?\nJeffrey Miller: Well, look, I think it's more a function of the technology that we have and when we see -- we've developed some things around digital cores and the ability to evaluate them digitally, for example, but trying to buy our way into the entire core space. We'd rather partner with who we think the premier core analysis company is. And so we're able to bring our technology to that. And effectively, it's a complementary strategy where we make better returns doing the things that we've developed and know how to do. And obviously, we believe Core Labs is a fantastic company. And so we're able to bring something to that, that we believe creates more value rather than trying to enter into a different type of arrangement. You mentioned the other one was Oil State. Similar kind of thing, got terrific technology, but we don't know that we want to try to plow that much capital into the rest of their business. But we do know where we can generate outsized returns for Halliburton. Yes, I would throw in another similar type thing is subsea with TechniqueFMC, who -- I really believe TechnipFMC is the absolute premier subsea company in the world. And we work closely with them, developing joint IP, delivering on electric completions, all electric completions. And so there are a lot of things we're able to do where we can mine what I think is our core competency or competitive advantage along with others without trying to broaden our way into things that aren't really strategically fit. Hope that helps, Dave.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: The first question is around a more macro question, which is one of the things that surprised us last year was the exit to exit of U.S. oil production, which came in above, I think, where consensus expectations were. You have unique visibility into U.S. completion and volumes. What do you think happened there? And as we think about 2024, how do you think about exit rate of U.S. growth? And maybe talk about the moving pieces, including DUCs.\nJeffrey Miller: Yes. Look, if I'm thinking about production growth in '24, production is a function of service intensity. So simply put, more sand, more barrels. And we saw peak levels of service intensity throughout last -- really in the first half of last year, and a lot of that comes on in the latter half. And I think some of this is efficiency in the sense that we are delivering more sand to the reservoir. And that comes in a lot of forms. E-fleets are part of that and some of the technology that we brought to market. But I also think that the market that we see for next year, it's hard for me to forecast at this point exactly what operators will do because every operator plays their own game. But at the same time, I would probably be over on rigs because I think that we'll run out of DUCs at some point. I think I would take the under only production only because whatever you think it is, I'll take the under only because what we see are stable customers delivering to their plans. But what we don't see as a lot of the smaller companies coming into the market in an effort to really ramp up production. So I think from our perspective at Halliburton, very stable market. But from a production standpoint, as we watch it unfold, it will be a matter of how much incremental sand gets pumped to overcome what is clearly going to be a decline rate that comes with when we add barrels rapidly, obviously, they fall off rapidly.\nNeil Mehta: Good color there. And then you made a comment that you feel like you have international visibility through the end of the decade. Can you expand there and help give the market a little more confidence about what the post 2024-2025 file looks like?\nJeffrey Miller: Well, look, I mean we are working on tenders today for work all of next year and the following year. I mean when we talk with customers, I think about what's going to happen. Really, I don't think the North Sea and West Africa even really wake up until 2025. We've seen strong in those markets. However, the real growth we're working on planning today doesn't even start until '25. And all of these things are 3- and 4-year-type efforts. I mean these aren't individual wells in places like that. These are programs. And so we spent -- we're actually on contract with a client working on just the planning of logistics for '25-'26 and beyond. And so I've just got a lot of confidence in terms of what we see in hand, the tender pipeline and then the pipeline of work that we are planning with customers that may or may not even be tendered. It's just more a matter of it will be done. And we've got clarity on that in '25 and beyond.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.\nArun Jayaram: Jeff, you mentioned that 40% of your contracted fleets this year will be Zeus going to 50% or more in '25. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how your commercial model for Zeus has evolved. And one of the things we get questions on is just the significant amount of completion efficiency gains that the industry is generated. And what is the sharing of that between E&P and service company?\nJeffrey Miller: Well, look, I think, number one, it's the value created by Zeus is what drives the contracting nature. A couple of things. When we started to develop Zeus, we started, like I said, quite a while back, our view was we want to maximize value to North America, number one. And in order to do that, we just had to -- we believe that the technology created enough value, so much value that we aren't going to build it unless it's demonstrated for customers. And I think the contracting nature of the longer-term contracts, 3-year-type contracts is because we let the market pull rather than trying to push thing into the market. It is that different and special. And as that system continues to develop and evolve, meaning automation, measurement, all of these things that drive really meaningful value, that is what's creating, I think, the different dialogue around Zeus with our customers because it will become more and more integral to how they create value as well. And then from an efficiency standpoint or like volume standpoint, our equipment is very efficient. So as we go from zipper frac to simo frac to, in this case, trial frac with the customer, that is not a one-to-one increase in horsepower requirements. So we become more efficient as those volumes go up. But that is also a unique feature, though, of Zeus and its ability to scale up, but it's not 1 one for one. And so from Halliburton perspective, we do create outsized value for Halliburton and also for our clients because we're using less equipment than we would had we gone at it in a traditional fashion. So I think that the combination of reliability but also automation, because it's -- as those fracs -- as fracs get larger, the precision gets more important. There are a whole lot of things that start to happen. And so very collaborative efforts with our clients to utilize that technology. In the case of a trial frac, really groundbreaking type work, super excited to do it with this customer.\nArun Jayaram: Great. Jeff, my follow-up, natural gas is on people's minds in North America. Just given the contango in the market, 2024 is just above 2 50. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how much of your activity is levered just to dry gas. And what are some of the risks to the earnings picture from a soft market for gas this year?\nJeffrey Miller: Look, we've got very little gas exposure in our business. Today, the ones -- the exposure that we do have is contracted under -- is sort of the Zeus solution somewhat and then we've got, I guess, a little bit of other things. But look, the gas work that we have is not a significant part of our overall portfolio. And so we plan for what we can see. I think legitimately, there could be equal upside on gas as LNG comes on. But we haven't baked it into our outlook today. But I would say that's clearly one of the upsides to North America, maybe more so than a downside to North America.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read: And actually, to last week to visit a tribal frac site and saw the e-fleet. So pretty impressive setup. One of the things the customer mentioned was a slightly different, I guess, sort of price-to-value contract structure. Looks like from a margin standpoint, you're doing fine on that. But is there anything you can kind of enlighten us on, on maybe how we thought about traditional pressure pumping contracting and a lot of spot exposure versus kind of how this is going through? What does it mean in terms of sharing gains with the customer? What's the right way for us to think about that on kind of a price...\nJeffrey Miller: Look, from our standpoint, our -- Roger, thank you. We won't create value for our customers. I think you have to create meaningful value for customers in order to be a long-term supplier and partner to a customer. So we start from that position. And as you said, solid contract for us over the very long term. We went into this focused on maximize value, which in our view, means maximize returns, which we're able to do under these types of environments. And so rather than play sort of the spot -- we don't intend to play the spot game. That spot game is kind of a -- it's a win-lose on either side of the market. Really, when the market is getting tight, probably operators are losing. When it's going the other direction, service companies lose a lot. And our strategy is to stay out of that. And so right contracts with customers that, in our view, are fair and deliver a lot of value both in terms of pumping value and also recovery value. And I think that we're uniquely positioned to do that. And so improving recovery per foot or production per foot is a long-term game, and we want to play that long-term game with customers that are working on that long-term game. And we're ecstatic about the customers we have and who we get to work with, try to solve what we think are the real pressing issues of the future in North America frac. And so we don't get to play that game. That game doesn't get played successfully if it's the frac is sure. We need to be part of that process, and our clients allow us to do that.\nRoger Read: Appreciate that. The follow-up question I have, it's unrelated, but I think kind of critical to the announcement this morning raising the dividend. What is the right way for us to think about your uses of free cash flow between, as you did in the fourth quarter, sort of elective repurchases of debt as opposed to maturities? But as we're thinking debt, dividend is pretty fixed here and then share repurchases. What way do you want us to think about the return of free cash flow?\nEric Carre: Yes. Thanks, Roger. It's Eric. So think about it in a fairly similar way as what we did in 2023, except higher. So we increased the dividend 6%. We're now back to about 95% of where we were pre-COVID. In terms of buyback, we intend to continue buying back share. Our intention today is to buy back more share in dollar terms in 2024 than we did in 2023. At the same time, as we did also in 2023, we intend to continue to retire debt and continue to strengthen the balance sheet. So overall, fairly similar structure in '24 as what we did in '23 but kind of bump up everything a bit higher.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James West with Evercore ISI.\nJames West: So Jeff, it -- you talked about West Africa, North Sea not awakening until '25. A lot of tendering or just conversations about '25-'26. I know some of the -- your partners like FTI are bidding for deliveries that wouldn't happen until '29 and '30. The offshore rig companies, they're getting locked up into '26-'27. I mean the visibility this cycle seems to me to be somewhat unprecedented. And I'm curious if that's consistent with your view of how things are playing on how customers are behaving and how your conversations are going. Because it seems like the industry is on board with -- is it going to be a long cycle? What we recognize, of course, macroeconomic events could derail things. But at least for now, with this oil price range that we're in, it's kind of all systems go for a long time.\nJeffrey Miller: Look, I'm careful speaking for the entire industry. But I would say I have this, including Halliburton, very focused on running return -- businesses for strong returns over the long term, which is precisely what we all do. And I think that's good for our clients and it's good for us as well. And so that level of visibility is not inconsistent with companies planning a future around how to make money for shareholders. And that's what we're doing as well. And so I think it's a very good setup for the rest of this decade, quite frankly, just because, a, we know there's demand; b, we are able to -- our whole value proposition around is how we collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. And this type of setup allows us to do that. The other thing that happens, though, when we run a business for returns is we don't overinvest in the business. And so we've told you kind of where our CapEx will fall and level of growth that we're looking at. And so we're very thoughtful about the growth because we are keeping profitable international growth firmly in hand. And so I think assets are tight and they'll remain tight for those very reasons. It's very natural economic reasons for an industry that's running their businesses for return, which is clearly what we're doing. And then I think our level of CapEx, the way that structured drives that level of thoughtful investment and manages the contracts that we win indirectly. And it also maximizes returning cash to shareholders. So it's a very good environment in my view.\nJames West: Okay. That's -- we certainly agree with that. And then maybe a follow-up for me and potentially, I don't know if Eric is going to take this one. But the D&E margins, which I know are more levered towards international, where a lot of the volume growth is certainly going to come from, and you're going to have natural operating leverage from that and inflation. It seems to be cooling somewhat so you should -- incremental should improve here. Where are you anticipating? I know you gave this quarter guidance, but that's seasonal. Where do you anticipate margins? Or maybe if you want to talk about incrementals, however you want to discuss it for D&E going forward as we go through '24 and into '25?\nEric Carre: Yes, Jim. So to your point, if you just look at Q1, obviously you get seasonal effect. So -- but more importantly, looking at the year-on-year and the general trend of the D&E margins. So first, I think it's worth noting, as Jeff mentioned in the script, that we had our best D&E margins in 15 years. So it means that a lot of the investment we have done in the last few years are paying off. So what to watch really is the general trajectory of margins in the business. And for us, it's a matter of balancing revenue growth, improvements in margin, improvements in returns as we continue to invest in the D&E business. So all of that to say that expect margins to continue to firm up as we get into '24. And we're expecting our margins to be materially higher in D&E in 2024 than they were in 2023. Now there might be some bumps along the road from 1 quarter to the next, et cetera. It's a business that typically tends to have a lot of moving parts. But directionally, margins will be higher in 2024 than they were in 2023.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup.\nScott Gruber: So Jeff, as I step back and think about the outlook for your U.S. business, it appears that you're on a pathway to establishing a business that will deliver more consistent and better free cash flow in the years ahead than we've seen historically, in part that's given the e-frac investment investment across the portfolio. So I'm wondering if you'd just give some color kind of around that. We're seeing the consistency now. If I heard correctly, the CapEx color doesn't suggest a material reduction in domestic CapEx into '24. So curious kind of around kind of bending that curve lower and just kind of overall helping this business model that's much more consistent and less CapEx-intensive ultimately.\nJeffrey Miller: Yes. Thanks. And that is precisely what we set out to do, and that's what's playing out now. And so in terms of a consistent business that generates strong free cash flow through the cycle, and that's been our intent all along. With the way we bring Zeus fleets to market, the way we invest in North America broadly, we are very deliberate about how we maximize value over the long term in North America. And I think you saw that play out in the last 2 quarters as we've seen the market moving around. But nevertheless, steady drumbeat of execution and cash flow delivery by Halliburton. And I expect to continue that because that is precisely our strategy. And so when it comes to cash flow, our capital allocation of our capital budget, we're going to allocate it to those things where we see that opportunity, which we certainly see that with Zeus fleets. But remember, that's a demand pull, not a push strategy. So we don't build fleets until we have contracts for fleets. And so that's a different -- completely different environment than maybe we would have seen in prior cycles from Halliburton, anything else we do in North America. Like we've developed some very good, in my view, fit-for-purpose drilling technology for North America. But we're not going to overbuild it. We're selling it into the market as the market will take it. It's a lot of excitement about it, but our approach is still going to be consistent delivery of margins and free cash flow in North America. And so I think you'll see us continue to do that. And that means we put e-fleets in the market, we retire sort of the fleets that are at the bottom of the stack and continue that march forward.\nScott Gruber: Got it. Okay. Appreciate the color. Unrelated follow-up here. Leverage is down to about 1x now, which is good to see. And it sounds like the cash return could step up a bit. Can you just kind of walk us through your thoughts as you move forward in time, the cycle continues, you'll generate more free cash flow, leverage continues to come down. Outside of any M&A, should we think about that shareholder return as a percentage of free cash flow moving higher given that you will be trending somewhat on leverage on a go-forward basis?\nEric Carre: Yes, yes. I mean just starting with free cash flow, I think that you can expect 2024 free cash flow to be at least 10% over '23. So that is going to basically help us return -- increase returns on a dollar basis. Now in terms of the percentage, we're still guided by our overall 50% return to shareholder. But directionally, it would make sense to believe that we'll do at least what we did in 2023 in terms of the percentage return.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler.\nLuke Lemoine: Jeff, your North America rev significantly outperformed the U.S. land rig count in '24. And I would guess some of the factors were Zeus fleet, service quality, more stable customer base and a pickup in the Gulf of Mexico. But could you talk about any other factors that drove this? And then with the U.S. land rig count most likely down in '24, do you think North America revs could be up in '24 for you?\nJeffrey Miller: Yes. Look, the outperformance is just the stability of the business as I described it. And so a big part of that is 40% of our fleet by the end '24 under long-term contracts. That creates a steady environment. So the rig count is going to move around and do what it does, but our largest part of our business, very stable. And the reality is the North America business is very big. We saw growth Gulf of Mexico and other offshore environments. However, a very large, stable North America business -- land business is going to mute some of that. And as we go into '25, I expect the same kind of performance out of our North America business sort of in spite of what rigs do. Now I do believe a repoint where DUCs are drawn down, they're largely drawn down. And I think that we'll see rig count increase only because it's supplying the inventory of DUCs required to run a very smooth, stable-type business. And I would say our customers largely plan their business around turning wells into production more than they do numbers of rigs in the air. And so I think there's a lot of planning that goes on to deliver a very stable business of completing wells. And so I think one of the reasons I would say I'd take the over on rig count, I don't think -- I won't try to forecast rig count at this point. But I do think there's upside in North America. We plan the business for what we can see, and we expect it to be stable. But that being said, I think there are obviously factors that could push that up. Like gas activity is clearly out there and I would pull the pace at which LNG plants come online, but we know that they will. Is it '24 event or a '25? I think we'll get to that point and see that Halliburton participates in that upside, and that could happen this year. But at this point, we're planning the business around returns.\nLuke Lemoine: Okay. And I guess a follow-up with this more stable North American business, you talk about your North American land margins you're ascribing flat in 4Q. Could you talk about how you see this progressing in '24 kind of with that stable business?\nJeffrey Miller: Well, look, let's just leave it at steady and stable moving forward. I think that we've got a very strong international business as well that contributes, and I think that continues to grow and expand margins. But we're really pleased with where we are. But U.S. revenue and margins flattish through any cycle, I think, is where we wanted to get this business. Clearly, there's upside. And I do expect from a C&P standpoint, we're going to see the benefit of our market leadership positions in PE, cementing, baroid and other things that we do around the world. So I think that we're going to continue to participate in that meaningfully, particularly from a margin standpoint. But again, our key in North America is stability through cycles. And I think we're demonstrating -- I don't think, I know we're demonstrating that now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Gengaro with Stifel.\nStephen Gengaro: Two for me. Wanted just to follow up on the prior question around sort of margins in C&P and the Zeus fleets. When you talk about these assets being contracted, are there any difference in sort of the pricing dynamic versus sort of prior cycles and price openers quarterly? And how should we just think about the pricing for those assets in an environment where maybe there's a little excess capacity near term from some, quite honestly, maybe not as competitive assets but older assets in the market? Does it matter -- is pricing pretty stable? Can you talk about that a bit?\nJeffrey Miller: Look, these are long-term deals that we go into knowing the cost of the asset and knowing what the return needs to be. So now it just becomes a bit of a math problem around duration. And so there are variable costs in the market that we don't control and we don't try to own. We just pass through to customers, whether it's sand cost and many other things. But for -- where we create competitive advantage for our equipment is we go into these long-term vehicles. We don't need price opener and all of that sort of jazz. There's no reason for it. We literally sit down and work through what is the return for client, return for Halliburton, and then we fix that and move forward. That doesn't change over time. And so -- well, the rest of the market, the spot-type market, all of that is going to do what it's going to do. But I think that's when we take a long view of the market in value creation, that's math that both clients and how can do. And I think that's what makes it so very different, our approach in North America. It's not particularly differentiated, if at all, in the spot market. And as a result, it's just kind of does what it does. It's on a free for all. But I would say, in the market where we want to play, which is technology-driven, lowest total cost of ownership and working on, I think, most important, which is productivity per foot. That's a different game. That's a long-term game.\nStephen Gengaro: Great. And then just one quick one, probably for Eric, on the cash flow statement. Anything we should know about working capital parameters in '24 versus '23 that would be much different as we kind of build out the models, whether it's DSOs or payables, et cetera?\nEric Carre: No. I think what's important around free cash flow is, as I mentioned earlier, is we're expecting the free cash flow to be at least 10% over '23. That's going to be on the back of improved income. It's going to be on the back also of improved efficiencies around working capital. So we spend a lot of time working on improving DSOs, working on improving DIOs. And when I speak like this, I don't mean just pushing the organization, I mean implementing different initiatives. For example, I'll give you a couple of examples on DSO. We spend a lot of time on automating the invoicing process on integrated services. For example, invoicing on integrated service is extremely complicated. We have multiple product lines, multiple parts of our organization, customer organization, so it takes a lot of time. And to the extent that you can automate that and then remove -- reduce cycle time, then you improve DSO. We just rolled out 18 months ago a company-wide demand planning software, which when combined with the rollout of S/4 in the future is going to give us totally different capabilities to plan our business and reduce inventory while not increasing the risk from an operation perspective. So these are the things where we're spending a lot of our time to basically structurally improve the efficiency of working capital. So that's going to be the other component of why we're expecting our free cash flow to improve next year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Marc Bianchi with TD Cowen.\nMarc Bianchi: I just wanted to first clarify on the North America outlook that you provided for it to be flat. That's a comment for the full year. Is that correct? Or was that a comment from where run rates are today?\nJeffrey Miller: Look, we think that Q1 is up from Q4. So there's activity that comes back to seasonal in Q4. As we look at the balance of the year, I think that there are -- as we plan the business for what we got visibility of and we can see our fleets are largely contracted for '24, that's what we know. Are there factors that may add to that? I think -- if you have to do that, I think if production levels are low, clients may speed up. There's a lot of variables that could happen that, I think, are to the positive. But nevertheless, as we look out to '24 and we plan a business that generates the kind of returns we expect to generate, that's what we see.\nMarc Bianchi: Okay. The other question I had was on D&E in the first quarter here. I think historically, there have been some onetime sales that continue for D&E in the first quarter. And then margin could be down in the second quarter. Is that sort of the base case outlook here? Or is there something unusual going on this year versus the prior years?\nEric Carre: No, there's nothing unusual. I think if you -- actually, if you were to go back and look at the Q1 '24 over Q4 '23 guidance that we just gave, it is very much in line with the typical Q4 to Q1 seasonality that we saw prior to COVID, so you go back to 2020, 2019, 2018. So what we're seeing here is really a business that's fully in line with historical trend. What's happening on the D&E side, the influence of software sales in Q4 typically is maintained in Q1. But we're having a lot of weather-related issues in the Eastern Hemisphere and the North Sea, et cetera, that is influencing our D&E margins. But again, very much in line in terms of quarter-on-quarter guidance as we have had historically in our business, nothing unusual.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with Benchmark.\nKurt Hallead: A lot of good stuff to digest here to make. Jeff, appreciate all that color. I think my question here, kind of what piqued my curiosity was, again, a couple of things that you -- one of which you put in the press release, which was a kind of AI-driven dynamic that you have going on with ADNOC. And maybe start with that one in the context of how you are seeing AI evolving as a tool for the customer base as a tool for your company. The -- how do you see the adoption of that? And how do you see the financial impact of that evolving over the course of the next couple of years?\nJeffrey Miller: Yes. Thanks, Kurt. Look, I think software and automation, and I say it that way because software business is strong and focused on enterprise solutions, which will adopt all sort of AI and generative AI as we continue to move forward. And that will create efficiency and [indiscernible] in a lot of ways for our customers. Internally, as we adopt automation and AI into our tools and service delivery, I expect that it will have a meaningful impact. Probably over the next 2, 3 to 5 years, just as those things are adopted, it's going to reduce service costs, it's going to drive demanding. And it's also going to improve service quality, and I think will actually improve the capability of tools, which I think is so fundamental to how we generate long-term returns.\nKurt Hallead: Appreciate that color. Also just that Halliburton Labs entered into a venture to some direct lithium extraction. So curious as to how you might see Halliburton involved in that process as well.\nJeffrey Miller: Well, look, that's one of our labs companies. We're excited to have them here. We make a very, very small investment in companies that join our labs, but it's very small. It's around $100,000. So it's -- we're a tiny piece of their Series B, which we're excited for them. But Hal Labs continues to attract, in my view, more quality investable companies over time. We're watching them enter Series As, and in some cases, Series B. And it's a journey. We're doing a lot different industries, but we're careful. This is clearly not corporate venture capital. We are not investing in the companies that join Hal Labs other than small 3% to 5% stake that we get from them generally for the services that we provide to them as a member of Halliburton Labs. So super excited about where that's going. But we just need to let that continue to progress on its own.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Jeff for any closing remarks.\nJeffrey Miller: Yes. Thank you, Josh. Let me close the call with this: I'm excited about 2024. I mean our outlook for oilfield services is strong, and I expect Halliburton will generate significant free cash flow for shareholders in 2024. Look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Let's close out the call.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Eric Carre",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. 2023 was a strong year for Halliburton. Multiple financial and operational metrics showed the best business performance in recent memory, any one of which are worthy of highlighting. More important than any single metric, however, the overall business performance demonstrated the effectiveness of our strategy. Here are a few highlights. In our C&P division, our 2023 margins of 20.7% were the highest since 2011. In our D&E division, 2023 margins of 16.5% were the highest since 2008. In North America, our strategy to maximize value is about structurally changing the risk and return profile of our business. We delivered steady margins through the year despite lower activity driven by the rollout of our Zeus fleet and their associated contract terms and the strength of our well construction business. Internationally, our profitable growth strategy drove revenue and margin improvement across all of our geographies. Revenue was the highest in the last 8 years, and profit margins were the highest in over a decade. Beyond pricing and activity, this is the result of the multiyear investment in our drilling business and technology differentiation across multiple product lines. Our focus on capital efficiency allowed this revenue growth and structural margin improvement, while capital spending remained within our target range of 5% to 6% of revenue. Collectively, these results generated about $2.3 billion of free cash flow, the highest cash generation in the last 15 years. Let's turn now to our fourth quarter results. Our Q4 reported net income per diluted share was $0.74. Net income per diluted share, adjusted for losses in Argentina primarily due to the currency devaluation, was $0.86. Total company revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $5.7 billion. Operating income was $1.1 billion and the operating margin was 18.4%, a 95 basis point increase over Q4 2022. Beginning with our Completion and Production division. Revenue in Q4 was $3.3 billion, operating income was $716 million, and the operating income margin was 22%. Our better-than-anticipated results were driven by the best fourth quarter of completion tool sales in 9 years, strong performance across multiple product lines and favorable weather in North America. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in Q4 was $2.4 billion, operating income was $420 million, and the operating income margin was 17%, an increase of 122 basis point over Q4 last year. These results were in line with our expectation and driven by international software sales, higher project management activity in the Eastern Hemisphere and increased fluid services in the Western Hemisphere. Now let's move on to geographic results. Our Q4 international revenue increased 4% sequentially, which was our highest international revenue quarter since 2015 and tenth consecutive quarter of year-on-year revenue growth. Q4 sequential growth was led by the Middle East region driven by improved activity across multiple product lines and strong year-end completion tool sales. Europe/Africa demonstrated sequential growth consistent with the overall international market with higher activity in Africa offsetting lower product sales in Europe. Latin America revenue declined slightly in the fourth quarter, where reduced completion-related activity following a very strong third quarter activity improvements in the Caribbean. In North America, revenue in Q4 decreased 7% sequentially driven primarily by a decline in U.S. land activity as a result of typical holiday-related slowdowns. However, we experienced fewer weather-related events than expected. As weather-related downtime is more expensive than planned downtime, this means our Q4 North America land margins were higher than anticipated. Additionally, completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico delivered the strongest quarter in 3 years. Moving on to other items. In Q4, our corporate and other expense was $63 million. For the first quarter of 2024, we expect corporate expenses to be flat. Our SAP deployment remains on budget and on schedule to conclude in 2025. In Q4, we spent $15 million or about $0.02 per diluted share on SAP S/4 migration, which is included in our results. For the first quarter 2024, we expect these expenses to be approximately $30 million or $0.03 per share due to the timing associated with accelerated phases of the rollout. In 2024, we expect to spend $120 million and $80 million in 2025. Net interest expense for the quarter was $98 million, slightly higher than expected primarily due to premiums associated with debt buybacks. For the first quarter 2024, we expect net interest expense to be roughly $85 million. Other net expense for Q4 was $16 million lower than our prior guidance due to the non-GAAP treatment of the Argentinian peso devaluation. For the first quarter 2024, we expect this expense to be about $35 million. Our adjusted effective tax rate for Q4 was 17.9%, lower than expected due to discrete items. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our first quarter 2024 effective tax rate to be approximately 21%, slightly lower than our anticipated full year effective tax rate. Capital expenditure for Q4 were $399 million, which brought our full year CapEx total to $1.4 billion. Approximately 60% of our CapEx was deployed to international and offshore markets in 2023, and we expect this ratio to remain similar in 2024. For the full year of 2024, we expect capital expenditures to remain approximately 6% of revenue. Our Q4 cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion and free cash flow was $1.1 billion, bringing our full year free cash flow to about $2.3 billion. For 2024, we expect free cash flow to be directionally higher. Now let me provide you with some comments on our expectations for the first quarter. As is typical, our results will be subject to weather-related seasonality and the roll-off of significant year-end product sales. As a result, in our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to be flat to down 2% and margins lower by 125 to 175 basis points. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect sequential revenue to decline between 1% to 3% and margins to be lower by 25 to 75 basis points. I will now turn the call back to Jeff. Yes. Thanks, Roger. It's Eric. So think about it in a fairly similar way as what we did in 2023, except higher. So we increased the dividend 6%. We're now back to about 95% of where we were pre-COVID. In terms of buyback, we intend to continue buying back share. Our intention today is to buy back more share in dollar terms in 2024 than we did in 2023. At the same time, as we did also in 2023, we intend to continue to retire debt and continue to strengthen the balance sheet. So overall, fairly similar structure in '24 as what we did in '23 but kind of bump up everything a bit higher. Yes, Jim. So to your point, if you just look at Q1, obviously you get seasonal effect. So -- but more importantly, looking at the year-on-year and the general trend of the D&E margins. So first, I think it's worth noting, as Jeff mentioned in the script, that we had our best D&E margins in 15 years. So it means that a lot of the investment we have done in the last few years are paying off. So what to watch really is the general trajectory of margins in the business. And for us, it's a matter of balancing revenue growth, improvements in margin, improvements in returns as we continue to invest in the D&E business. So all of that to say that expect margins to continue to firm up as we get into '24. And we're expecting our margins to be materially higher in D&E in 2024 than they were in 2023. Now there might be some bumps along the road from 1 quarter to the next, et cetera. It's a business that typically tends to have a lot of moving parts. But directionally, margins will be higher in 2024 than they were in 2023. Yes, yes. I mean just starting with free cash flow, I think that you can expect 2024 free cash flow to be at least 10% over '23. So that is going to basically help us return -- increase returns on a dollar basis. Now in terms of the percentage, we're still guided by our overall 50% return to shareholder. But directionally, it would make sense to believe that we'll do at least what we did in 2023 in terms of the percentage return. No. I think what's important around free cash flow is, as I mentioned earlier, is we're expecting the free cash flow to be at least 10% over '23. That's going to be on the back of improved income. It's going to be on the back also of improved efficiencies around working capital. So we spend a lot of time working on improving DSOs, working on improving DIOs. And when I speak like this, I don't mean just pushing the organization, I mean implementing different initiatives. For example, I'll give you a couple of examples on DSO. We spend a lot of time on automating the invoicing process on integrated services. For example, invoicing on integrated service is extremely complicated. We have multiple product lines, multiple parts of our organization, customer organization, so it takes a lot of time. And to the extent that you can automate that and then remove -- reduce cycle time, then you improve DSO. We just rolled out 18 months ago a company-wide demand planning software, which when combined with the rollout of S/4 in the future is going to give us totally different capabilities to plan our business and reduce inventory while not increasing the risk from an operation perspective. So these are the things where we're spending a lot of our time to basically structurally improve the efficiency of working capital. So that's going to be the other component of why we're expecting our free cash flow to improve next year. No, there's nothing unusual. I think if you -- actually, if you were to go back and look at the Q1 '24 over Q4 '23 guidance that we just gave, it is very much in line with the typical Q4 to Q1 seasonality that we saw prior to COVID, so you go back to 2020, 2019, 2018. So what we're seeing here is really a business that's fully in line with historical trend. What's happening on the D&E side, the influence of software sales in Q4 typically is maintained in Q1. But we're having a lot of weather-related issues in the Eastern Hemisphere and the North Sea, et cetera, that is influencing our D&E margins. But again, very much in line in terms of quarter-on-quarter guidance as we have had historically in our business, nothing unusual."

            "name": "Jeffrey Miller",
            "content": "Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. 2023 was a great year for Halliburton. Both of our divisions achieved their highest operating margins in over a decade, and we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders. Here are the highlights. We delivered full year total company revenue of $23 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year; and operating income of $4.1 billion, an increase of 33% compared to 2022 adjusted operating income. Our international business demonstrated strong growth with our revenue up 17% year-over-year despite our exit from Russia in August of 2022, completing 2 consecutive years of high teens growth. Our North America business showed strength with revenue up 9% year-over-year despite rig count declines. Completion and Production revenue grew 18% year-over-year and margins expanded 312 basis points. Drilling and Evaluation grew 7% year-over-year and margins expanded 171 basis points. Turning now to Q4, where Halliburton delivered exceptional margin performance supported by better-than-anticipated completion tool sales globally, strong performance across multiple high-margin product lines and favorable weather in North America. Completion and Production margins finished the year almost 100 basis points higher than Q4 of 2022. International revenue grew 12% year-over-year, led by the Europe-Africa region, which grew revenue 17%. Finally, during the fourth quarter, we generated $1.4 billion of cash from operations, $1.1 billion of free cash flow and repurchased approximately $250 million of common stock and $150 million of debt. Before we continue, I want to take a moment and thank the Halliburton employees around the world who made these results possible. Our success last quarter and throughout 2023 was a direct result of your hard work and dedication. Thank you for your relentless focus on safety, operational execution, customer collaboration and service quality performance. Let me begin with my views on the strength of the oilfield services market. As we look past the new cycle and near-term commodity price volatility, the fundamentals for oilfield services remain strong. Here are 2 reasons why. First, we see an increase in service intensity everywhere we operate. Whether it's longer laterals in North America, smaller and more complex reservoirs in mature fields or offshore deepwater, customers require more services to develop their resources, not fewer. Second, long-term expansion of the global economy will continue to create enormous demands on all forms of energy. I expect oil and gas remains a critical component of the global energy mix with demand growth well into the future. With this positive macro outlook, I believe Halliburton's strong execution, leading technology and collaborative approach will drive demand for Halliburton's products and services around the world. Now let's turn to international markets, where Halliburton's performance delivered another year of profitable growth. Halliburton's full year international revenue grew 17% year-on-year, and our quarterly revenue grew 12% compared to the same quarter of last year. Each region delivered year-on-year revenue growth throughout 2023, and both divisions delivered improved international margins year-on-year. Our results in 2023 demonstrate the effectiveness of Halliburton's profitable international growth strategy, the strength of our global competitiveness across product lines and the power of our value proposition with customers. In 2024, we expect international E&P spending to grow at a low double-digit pace and foresee multiple years of sustained activity growth. Although we anticipate regional differences in growth rates for 2024, we believe the Middle East/Asia region will likely experience the greatest increases in activity with other regions closely behind. As we look out to 2025, we expect Africa and Europe, among others, to demonstrate above-average growth. Beyond 2025, we see an active tender pipeline with work scopes extending through the end of the decade, which gives me confidence in the duration of this multiyear upcycle. While we expect overall activity growth, we also see above-market growth within our well construction product lines, where customers choose Halliburton to improve the reliability, consistency and efficiency of their drilling operations. One such technology is LOGIX' autonomous drilling platform, which is now used on 90% of our iCruise runs worldwide. Customers also rely on Halliburton's subsurface expertise to develop today's most complex reservoirs. This requires technologies to reduce uncertainties, such as our DecisionSpace 365, unified ensemble modeling and advanced formation evaluation systems like our iStar logging well drilling platform, and reservoir Xaminer formation testing service. These technologies enable customers to target small reservoirs, identify bypassed reserves and gather reservoir properties in real time. We see reservoir complexity increasing worldwide, and I expect the capabilities of these systems will continue to deliver customer value and lead in overall growth within our formation evaluation portfolio. For Completion and Production, we also expect increased adoption of our technologies like intelligent completions, multilateral solutions and artificial lift. Our intelligent and multilateral completions enable customers to produce, inject and control multiple zones in a wellbore, which is critical for offshore developments, a segment we expect to outpace the overall market. In artificial lift, our strategy targets markets like the Middle East and Latin America, where our differentiated performance and existing footprint create a solid foundation for profitable growth. We also expect strong demand for our services in carbon capture and storage, where Halliburton's leading capabilities to design, deliver and validate reliable barriers play a crucial role. As our customers invest in carbon storage, our tailored cement designs and casing equipment technology enable them to address the unique challenges of long-term carbon sequestration. With this activity growth, the availability of equipment and experienced personnel remains tight. We expect asset-intensive offshore activity to increase, which will further tighten the market. As offshore represents over half of our business outside North America land, we expect this activity to drive improved pricing and higher margins for our business. I am confident in Halliburton's strategy for profitable international growth, and I am excited about our performance in 2024 and well into the future. Turning to North America. Halliburton's strategy yielded strong results in 2023. Our full year North America revenue of $10.5 billion was a 9% increase when compared to 2022 despite sequentially lower rig count. Fourth quarter margins in North America land were relatively flat quarter-over-quarter despite lower revenue. Our full year and fourth quarter results demonstrated the strength of our differentiated business and the successful execution of our strategy to maximize value. The dynamic North America market continues to evolve with larger customers and stable programs, elevated quality expectations and greater demand for technology to improve recovery and well productivity. This evolution fits perfectly with Halliburton's value proposition. Our Zeus electric fracturing solution is highly sought after in this market, where its seamless combination of electric frac, automation and real-time subsurface measurements uniquely address customer requirements. We believe customers demand Zeus because it provides the lowest total cost of ownership and it's shown to be the most proven and reliable solution in the market. The market pull for this technology has been strong. The combination of Zeus fleets working in the field today and Zeus fleets contracted for 2024 delivery represent over 40% of our fracturing fleet. I expect well over half of our fleets will be electric in 2025 with all of these e-fleets on multiyear contracts generating full return of and return on capital during their initial contract terms. Consistent with our strategy from the beginning, we plan for our Zeus deliveries in 2024 to replace existing fleets rather than add incremental fleet capacity. This is how we maximize value in North America. The growth of Zeus and our commercial approach has transformed the North America completion services market. Technology is only transformative when adopted and is only adopted at the rate of Zeus when it works and creates meaningful value for our customers. Zeus' rapid adoption, both by new and repeat customers, tells us our solution is the right one for North America. Turning to our 2024 North America outlook. We expect a continued strong business with the combination of stable levels of activity in the market and the contracted nature of Halliburton's portfolio. We expect this results in a flattish revenue and margin environment for Halliburton. To close out, I am confident in our strategies to maximize value in North America and for profitable growth internationally. In 2023, Halliburton demonstrated the power of these strategies, the consistency of our execution and the value of our differentiated technology. We generated about $2.3 billion of free cash flow during the year, retired approximately $300 million of debt and returned $1.4 billion of cash to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends, which represents over 60% of our free cash flow. Today, I am pleased to announce that our Board of Directors approved an increase of our quarterly dividend to $0.17 per share. Our outlook for oilfield services remains strong, and I expect we will deepen and strengthen our value proposition and generate significant free cash flow. Now I'll turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric? Thanks, Eric. Let me summarize our discussion today. 2023 was a great year for Halliburton. We generated about $2.3 billion of free cash flow and returned over 60% of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. We're committed to return over 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders in 2024. For our international business, we expect low double-digit growth driven by the power of our value proposition, global competitiveness across all product lines and our profitable growth strategy. In North America, we expect a continued strong business driven by stable activity, our differentiated technical position with our Zeus electric frac solution and the increasingly contracted nature of our business. And now let's open it up for questions. Yes. Well, thanks, Dave. Look, e-fleets are accretive. They're accretive for a couple of reasons. Number one, highly efficient to operate from our standpoint. And so that makes them more accretive. Clearly, the are bringing a lot of value to clients, and therefore, they're priced and thought about differently in the marketplace. And so look, I expect that, that will continue into the future. But I think what's most important is the contracted nature of the fleets, which mean a couple of things also. Number one, that the pricing is sticky, but it's sticky because it's contracted over time and the value is thought about. And so sophisticated procurers can look at that and model that, and we can model it as well and comfortable with the value created. But I think the second thing, as we think about what types of customers look at e-fleets, these aren't a spot market solution. I mean the companies that are interested in e-fleets are those that have steady programs, work through cycles, have a clear vision of where their business needs to go and are willing to commit to the technology to deliver that over the long term. And so -- and really, it's an entire system. If we think about an electric fleet, it's -- obviously, it's an efficient, lowest-TCO electric solution, but it's also automated, which drives the level of precision around fracking that I've never seen before. And so the clients know that they're delivering what they expect to deliver, and then finally, the subsurface measurement. But I bring all of that up because that's part of what drives it being accretive: a, it creates a lot more value, therefore, is more accretive than a Tier 4 diesel fleet clearly; and then also a different set of conditions, which also changes the return profile of these assets as we go into the market. I hope that helps, Dave. Well, look, I think it's more a function of the technology that we have and when we see -- we've developed some things around digital cores and the ability to evaluate them digitally, for example, but trying to buy our way into the entire core space. We'd rather partner with who we think the premier core analysis company is. And so we're able to bring our technology to that. And effectively, it's a complementary strategy where we make better returns doing the things that we've developed and know how to do. And obviously, we believe Core Labs is a fantastic company. And so we're able to bring something to that, that we believe creates more value rather than trying to enter into a different type of arrangement. You mentioned the other one was Oil State. Similar kind of thing, got terrific technology, but we don't know that we want to try to plow that much capital into the rest of their business. But we do know where we can generate outsized returns for Halliburton. Yes, I would throw in another similar type thing is subsea with TechniqueFMC, who -- I really believe TechnipFMC is the absolute premier subsea company in the world. And we work closely with them, developing joint IP, delivering on electric completions, all electric completions. And so there are a lot of things we're able to do where we can mine what I think is our core competency or competitive advantage along with others without trying to broaden our way into things that aren't really strategically fit. Hope that helps, Dave. Yes. Look, if I'm thinking about production growth in '24, production is a function of service intensity. So simply put, more sand, more barrels. And we saw peak levels of service intensity throughout last -- really in the first half of last year, and a lot of that comes on in the latter half. And I think some of this is efficiency in the sense that we are delivering more sand to the reservoir. And that comes in a lot of forms. E-fleets are part of that and some of the technology that we brought to market. But I also think that the market that we see for next year, it's hard for me to forecast at this point exactly what operators will do because every operator plays their own game. But at the same time, I would probably be over on rigs because I think that we'll run out of DUCs at some point. I think I would take the under only production only because whatever you think it is, I'll take the under only because what we see are stable customers delivering to their plans. But what we don't see as a lot of the smaller companies coming into the market in an effort to really ramp up production. So I think from our perspective at Halliburton, very stable market. But from a production standpoint, as we watch it unfold, it will be a matter of how much incremental sand gets pumped to overcome what is clearly going to be a decline rate that comes with when we add barrels rapidly, obviously, they fall off rapidly. Well, look, I mean we are working on tenders today for work all of next year and the following year. I mean when we talk with customers, I think about what's going to happen. Really, I don't think the North Sea and West Africa even really wake up until 2025. We've seen strong in those markets. However, the real growth we're working on planning today doesn't even start until '25. And all of these things are 3- and 4-year-type efforts. I mean these aren't individual wells in places like that. These are programs. And so we spent -- we're actually on contract with a client working on just the planning of logistics for '25-'26 and beyond. And so I've just got a lot of confidence in terms of what we see in hand, the tender pipeline and then the pipeline of work that we are planning with customers that may or may not even be tendered. It's just more a matter of it will be done. And we've got clarity on that in '25 and beyond. Well, look, I think, number one, it's the value created by Zeus is what drives the contracting nature. A couple of things. When we started to develop Zeus, we started, like I said, quite a while back, our view was we want to maximize value to North America, number one. And in order to do that, we just had to -- we believe that the technology created enough value, so much value that we aren't going to build it unless it's demonstrated for customers. And I think the contracting nature of the longer-term contracts, 3-year-type contracts is because we let the market pull rather than trying to push thing into the market. It is that different and special. And as that system continues to develop and evolve, meaning automation, measurement, all of these things that drive really meaningful value, that is what's creating, I think, the different dialogue around Zeus with our customers because it will become more and more integral to how they create value as well. And then from an efficiency standpoint or like volume standpoint, our equipment is very efficient. So as we go from zipper frac to simo frac to, in this case, trial frac with the customer, that is not a one-to-one increase in horsepower requirements. So we become more efficient as those volumes go up. But that is also a unique feature, though, of Zeus and its ability to scale up, but it's not 1 one for one. And so from Halliburton perspective, we do create outsized value for Halliburton and also for our clients because we're using less equipment than we would had we gone at it in a traditional fashion. So I think that the combination of reliability but also automation, because it's -- as those fracs -- as fracs get larger, the precision gets more important. There are a whole lot of things that start to happen. And so very collaborative efforts with our clients to utilize that technology. In the case of a trial frac, really groundbreaking type work, super excited to do it with this customer. Look, we've got very little gas exposure in our business. Today, the ones -- the exposure that we do have is contracted under -- is sort of the Zeus solution somewhat and then we've got, I guess, a little bit of other things. But look, the gas work that we have is not a significant part of our overall portfolio. And so we plan for what we can see. I think legitimately, there could be equal upside on gas as LNG comes on. But we haven't baked it into our outlook today. But I would say that's clearly one of the upsides to North America, maybe more so than a downside to North America. Look, from our standpoint, our -- Roger, thank you. We won't create value for our customers. I think you have to create meaningful value for customers in order to be a long-term supplier and partner to a customer. So we start from that position. And as you said, solid contract for us over the very long term. We went into this focused on maximize value, which in our view, means maximize returns, which we're able to do under these types of environments. And so rather than play sort of the spot -- we don't intend to play the spot game. That spot game is kind of a -- it's a win-lose on either side of the market. Really, when the market is getting tight, probably operators are losing. When it's going the other direction, service companies lose a lot. And our strategy is to stay out of that. And so right contracts with customers that, in our view, are fair and deliver a lot of value both in terms of pumping value and also recovery value. And I think that we're uniquely positioned to do that. And so improving recovery per foot or production per foot is a long-term game, and we want to play that long-term game with customers that are working on that long-term game. And we're ecstatic about the customers we have and who we get to work with, try to solve what we think are the real pressing issues of the future in North America frac. And so we don't get to play that game. That game doesn't get played successfully if it's the frac is sure. We need to be part of that process, and our clients allow us to do that. Look, I'm careful speaking for the entire industry. But I would say I have this, including Halliburton, very focused on running return -- businesses for strong returns over the long term, which is precisely what we all do. And I think that's good for our clients and it's good for us as well. And so that level of visibility is not inconsistent with companies planning a future around how to make money for shareholders. And that's what we're doing as well. And so I think it's a very good setup for the rest of this decade, quite frankly, just because, a, we know there's demand; b, we are able to -- our whole value proposition around is how we collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. And this type of setup allows us to do that. The other thing that happens, though, when we run a business for returns is we don't overinvest in the business. And so we've told you kind of where our CapEx will fall and level of growth that we're looking at. And so we're very thoughtful about the growth because we are keeping profitable international growth firmly in hand. And so I think assets are tight and they'll remain tight for those very reasons. It's very natural economic reasons for an industry that's running their businesses for return, which is clearly what we're doing. And then I think our level of CapEx, the way that structured drives that level of thoughtful investment and manages the contracts that we win indirectly. And it also maximizes returning cash to shareholders. So it's a very good environment in my view. Yes. Thanks. And that is precisely what we set out to do, and that's what's playing out now. And so in terms of a consistent business that generates strong free cash flow through the cycle, and that's been our intent all along. With the way we bring Zeus fleets to market, the way we invest in North America broadly, we are very deliberate about how we maximize value over the long term in North America. And I think you saw that play out in the last 2 quarters as we've seen the market moving around. But nevertheless, steady drumbeat of execution and cash flow delivery by Halliburton. And I expect to continue that because that is precisely our strategy. And so when it comes to cash flow, our capital allocation of our capital budget, we're going to allocate it to those things where we see that opportunity, which we certainly see that with Zeus fleets. But remember, that's a demand pull, not a push strategy. So we don't build fleets until we have contracts for fleets. And so that's a different -- completely different environment than maybe we would have seen in prior cycles from Halliburton, anything else we do in North America. Like we've developed some very good, in my view, fit-for-purpose drilling technology for North America. But we're not going to overbuild it. We're selling it into the market as the market will take it. It's a lot of excitement about it, but our approach is still going to be consistent delivery of margins and free cash flow in North America. And so I think you'll see us continue to do that. And that means we put e-fleets in the market, we retire sort of the fleets that are at the bottom of the stack and continue that march forward. Yes. Look, the outperformance is just the stability of the business as I described it. And so a big part of that is 40% of our fleet by the end '24 under long-term contracts. That creates a steady environment. So the rig count is going to move around and do what it does, but our largest part of our business, very stable. And the reality is the North America business is very big. We saw growth Gulf of Mexico and other offshore environments. However, a very large, stable North America business -- land business is going to mute some of that. And as we go into '25, I expect the same kind of performance out of our North America business sort of in spite of what rigs do. Now I do believe a repoint where DUCs are drawn down, they're largely drawn down. And I think that we'll see rig count increase only because it's supplying the inventory of DUCs required to run a very smooth, stable-type business. And I would say our customers largely plan their business around turning wells into production more than they do numbers of rigs in the air. And so I think there's a lot of planning that goes on to deliver a very stable business of completing wells. And so I think one of the reasons I would say I'd take the over on rig count, I don't think -- I won't try to forecast rig count at this point. But I do think there's upside in North America. We plan the business for what we can see, and we expect it to be stable. But that being said, I think there are obviously factors that could push that up. Like gas activity is clearly out there and I would pull the pace at which LNG plants come online, but we know that they will. Is it '24 event or a '25? I think we'll get to that point and see that Halliburton participates in that upside, and that could happen this year. But at this point, we're planning the business around returns. Well, look, let's just leave it at steady and stable moving forward. I think that we've got a very strong international business as well that contributes, and I think that continues to grow and expand margins. But we're really pleased with where we are. But U.S. revenue and margins flattish through any cycle, I think, is where we wanted to get this business. Clearly, there's upside. And I do expect from a C&P standpoint, we're going to see the benefit of our market leadership positions in PE, cementing, baroid and other things that we do around the world. So I think that we're going to continue to participate in that meaningfully, particularly from a margin standpoint. But again, our key in North America is stability through cycles. And I think we're demonstrating -- I don't think, I know we're demonstrating that now. Look, these are long-term deals that we go into knowing the cost of the asset and knowing what the return needs to be. So now it just becomes a bit of a math problem around duration. And so there are variable costs in the market that we don't control and we don't try to own. We just pass through to customers, whether it's sand cost and many other things. But for -- where we create competitive advantage for our equipment is we go into these long-term vehicles. We don't need price opener and all of that sort of jazz. There's no reason for it. We literally sit down and work through what is the return for client, return for Halliburton, and then we fix that and move forward. That doesn't change over time. And so -- well, the rest of the market, the spot-type market, all of that is going to do what it's going to do. But I think that's when we take a long view of the market in value creation, that's math that both clients and how can do. And I think that's what makes it so very different, our approach in North America. It's not particularly differentiated, if at all, in the spot market. And as a result, it's just kind of does what it does. It's on a free for all. But I would say, in the market where we want to play, which is technology-driven, lowest total cost of ownership and working on, I think, most important, which is productivity per foot. That's a different game. That's a long-term game. Look, we think that Q1 is up from Q4. So there's activity that comes back to seasonal in Q4. As we look at the balance of the year, I think that there are -- as we plan the business for what we got visibility of and we can see our fleets are largely contracted for '24, that's what we know. Are there factors that may add to that? I think -- if you have to do that, I think if production levels are low, clients may speed up. There's a lot of variables that could happen that, I think, are to the positive. But nevertheless, as we look out to '24 and we plan a business that generates the kind of returns we expect to generate, that's what we see. Yes. Thanks, Kurt. Look, I think software and automation, and I say it that way because software business is strong and focused on enterprise solutions, which will adopt all sort of AI and generative AI as we continue to move forward. And that will create efficiency and [indiscernible] in a lot of ways for our customers. Internally, as we adopt automation and AI into our tools and service delivery, I expect that it will have a meaningful impact. Probably over the next 2, 3 to 5 years, just as those things are adopted, it's going to reduce service costs, it's going to drive demanding. And it's also going to improve service quality, and I think will actually improve the capability of tools, which I think is so fundamental to how we generate long-term returns. Well, look, that's one of our labs companies. We're excited to have them here. We make a very, very small investment in companies that join our labs, but it's very small. It's around $100,000. So it's -- we're a tiny piece of their Series B, which we're excited for them. But Hal Labs continues to attract, in my view, more quality investable companies over time. We're watching them enter Series As, and in some cases, Series B. And it's a journey. We're doing a lot different industries, but we're careful. This is clearly not corporate venture capital. We are not investing in the companies that join Hal Labs other than small 3% to 5% stake that we get from them generally for the services that we provide to them as a member of Halliburton Labs. So super excited about where that's going. But we just need to let that continue to progress on its own. Yes. Thank you, Josh. Let me close the call with this: I'm excited about 2024. I mean our outlook for oilfield services is strong, and I expect Halliburton will generate significant free cash flow for shareholders in 2024. Look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Let's close out the call."

Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Halliburton delivered an impressive third quarter. Our margin strength demonstrated the power of our strategy. I am pleased with the stability of our North America business and the profitability of our international growth. Let's jump right into the highlights. Total company revenue increased 8% year-over-year, while operating income grew 23%. International revenue grew 17% year-over-year with strong activity in all geographic markets. North America revenue was roughly flat year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. Our completion and production division grew revenue 11% year-over-year, while margins expanded 280 basis points, margins expanded 105 basis points sequentially driven by international operations, while North American C&P margins remained approximately flat the last quarter. Our drilling and evaluation division grew revenue 4% year-over-year, while margins expanded 168 basis points. Finally, we generated $874 million of cash from operations, $511 million of free cash flow and repurchased approximately $200 million of common stock and $150 million of debt during the quarter. To our over 45,000 employees globally. Thank you for another outstanding quarter, you executed our strategy and delivered excellent financial results. I'll begin with what I see in the macro environment. Reliable and affordable energy remains at the very center of global economic growth and security. The most recent world oil outlook from OPEC expects 10 million barrels of oil demand growth before the end of the decade and further demand growth through 2045. Maintaining production while adding incremental supply requires meaningful long-term investment in both short and long cycle barrels to meet demand. This challenge is reflected in our customers' activity levels and future development plans. Consistent with this outlook, we expect continued demand growth for oilfield services in 2024 and beyond. Everything I see today strengthens my conviction in the long duration of this upcycle. Against this backdrop, I believe the execution of our strategy will deliver strong free cash flow, growing margins and more cash return to shareholders. Starting with North America, Halliburton performed exactly as I expected, delivering our strategy to maximize value in North America. Our North America business has changed. Despite the U.S. rig count decreasing around 20% since Q4 of 2022, Halliburton delivered strong revenue and margin performance during this period. That's quite a different result from what Halliburton would have delivered in prior cycles. Since 2015, we changed our strategy. We changed our operating model, and the market structure changed. Our strategy in North America is to maximize value. Executing this strategy made many of our decisions over the last few years crystal clear, including our decision to invest in differentiated and value-added technologies, such as our Zeus electric fleets, automation, and our fiber optic downhole fracturing diagnostics. We know that in a competitive market to capture value, you must first create value. Our decision to derisk returns and maximize free cash flow by only building fracturing equipment under long-term contracts. And finally, our decision to retire old equipment when returns are not sufficient rather than to pursue market share. Maximizing value means just that, do the things that improve returns and stop doing the things that lower them. Next, we fundamentally changed our operating model. We removed $1 billion of fixed costs from our business in 2020. Those cost reductions were structural and remain in place today. As a result, today, our cost structure is more variable and less fixed. And it's one of the reasons we have the flexibility to pursue returns rather than market share. Our commitment to continuous improvement drove significant changes in the way we work, which delivered efficiency improvements in our operations. This resulted in a 68% improvement in hours pumped per crew in just the last four years. Finally, the E&P and services markets fundamentally changed. Today the market is more consolidated, more focused on returns, and more focused on free cash flow generation. We see the benefits of this change. Customers assign value to technology and efficiency, and the service industry is rewarded for returns rather than growth. Never before as the success of our North America business been better aligned with the success of our customers who make significant long-term investments in the region. I expect the combination of our value proposition and strategy will deliver a more profitable business that generates more free cash flow for years to come. Now let's turn to international markets, where Halliburton's revenue grew 17% compared to the same quarter of last year. In the third quarter, we saw activity increase in both divisions, though particularly in our completions and production division. Our results clearly demonstrate Halliburton strong global competitiveness in both divisions and the successful execution of our strategy for profitable international growth. We execute our profitable growth strategy through our differentiated technology offerings, selective contract wins, and our unique collaborative approach with customers, all of which build on our foundation as a leader in service quality and execution. I expect the market for oilfield services will further tighten as asset intensive offshore activity increases. More importantly, I expect that pricing returns will serve as the mechanism to allocate scarce equipment. This is a great market for Halliburton to execute its strategy for profitable international growth. I'm excited about our international business and we're on track to deliver high teens year-on-year growth in 2023. Looking ahead, 2024 is coming into view and I expect to see international activity again directionally higher, with market growth in the double-digit range. I'd like to take a few minutes and talk more about our global offshore business. Let me start with some color. Offshore represents more than 50% of our business outside of North America land. About 25% of our C&P revenue is generated offshore. More than 40% of our D&E revenue is generated offshore. All of our regions contribute materially to our offshore revenue. All of our product lines operate offshore and Halliburton leads in many well construction product lines key to offshore development. Customers choose Halliburton because we collaborate and deliver impactful results. The combination of our leading product lines, and our collaboration from design through well delivery is what drives superior results for our customers. One example is in Norway, where according to IHS Rushmore data, the Aker BP Alliance where Halliburton provides well construction services consistently represents the top quartile of drilling performance. This performance matters even more in a market where offshore rig rates and spread costs are rising. With our customers, we deliver some of the most technically complex wells in our industry. We provide leading solutions in many areas including high pressure, deepwater completions, complex multilateral junctions, ultra deep reading LWD tools, narrow margin drilling fluids and tailored lightweight cement. These solutions enable our customers to efficiently and reliably develop their offshore reserves and maximize the value of their assets. Execution of our value proposition has created a strong offshore business underpinned by efficiency and differentiated technology. Our ability to compete in all parts of the offshore business including exploration, development and intervention has never been better. Let me close with this. I'm both excited and confident in the outlook for our business, the duration of this upcycle the clarity and depth of our strategy and the strength of our execution. Now I'll turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric?\nEric Carre: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Our Q3 reported net income per diluted share was $0.79. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.8 billion flat sequentially, while operating income was $1 billion a sequential increase of 3%. Operating margin for the company was 17.9% in Q3, a 207 basis point increase over Q3 2022. Beginning with our completion and production division, revenue in Q3 was $3.5 billion flat sequentially, while operating income was $746 million, an increase of 6% sequentially. C&P delivered an operating income margin of 21%. These results were primarily due to increased stimulation activity internationally, higher cementing activity in the eastern hemisphere, and improved completion tool sales globally. These increases were partially offset by lower pressure pumping services in North America. In our drilling and evaluation division, revenue in Q3 was $2.3 billion flat sequentially, while operating income was $378 million, which was also flat from Q2. D&E delivered an operating income margin of 16%, an increase of 168 basis points over Q3 last year. Sequential changes were driven by higher fluid services in Middle East Asia, and Latin America, and increased wireline activity in Latin America and Europe/Africa. These were offset by decreased drilling related services, lower project management activity and software sales in Mexico. Now let's move on to geographic results. Our Q3 international revenue increased 3% sequentially. Latin America revenue in Q3 was $1 billion, a 5% increase sequentially. This increase was primarily due to increased pressure pumping services, and drilling fluids in Argentina, improved completion tool sales in Brazil, and higher project management and drilling related services in Colombia and Ecuador. Partially offsetting these increases were lower software sales, decreased project management and lower well construction services in Mexico. Europe/Africa revenue in Q3 was $734 million, a 5% increase sequentially. This increase was primarily driven by improved well construction services, higher completion tool sales and improved wireline activity in Norway, and higher completion tool sales in the Caspian area. These were partially offset by lower activity in Africa across multiple product service lines. Middle East Asia revenue in Q3 was $1.4 billion, which was flat from q2. These results were driven by higher well construction in Iraq, increased drilling related services and completion tool sales in Qatar, and higher pressure pumping and fluid services in Asia. These were offset by decreased activity in multiple product service lines in Kuwait, and India and lower drilling, testing and well intervention services in Asia. In North America, revenue in Q3 was $2.6 billion, a 3% decrease sequentially. This decline was primarily driven by decreased pressure pumping services in U.S. land, and lower well intervention services in the Gulf of Mexico. Partially offsetting these decreases was improved completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico. Moving on to other items, in Q3, our corporate and other expenses were $64 million. For Q4, we expect our corporate expense to increase by about $5 million as a result of timing and special items. In Q3, we spent $23 million, or about $0.03 per diluted share on SAP S4 migration, which is included in our results. For Q4, we expect these expenses to be approximately $14 million, which makes our spent approximately $50 million for 2023 as planned. Net interest expense for the quarter was $93 million, which was flat from the prior quarter. For Q4, we expect this expense to remain approximately flat. Other net expense for Q3 was $28 million, primarily related to unfavorable foreign exchange movements. For Q4, we expect this expense to remain approximately flat. Our effective tax rate for Q3 came in at 21%, based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to remain approximately flat. Capital expenditure for Q3 were $409 million, we anticipate that for the full year, capital expenditure will be approximately 6% of revenue. Our Q3 cash flow from operations was $874 million, and free cash flow was $511 million. We expect to generate over $2 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2023. Finally, consistent with our capital return policy of returning at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders, we repurchased approximately $200 million of our common stock during Q3. Additionally, during Q3, we repurchased $150 million of debt. Now turning to our near-term outlook. Let me provide you with some comments on how we see Q4 unfolding. In our Completion and Production division, we anticipate revenue to decrease by 3% to 5% sequentially, while operating margins are expected to decrease 25 to 75 basis points as a result of lower North America land activity due to holidays and lower winter month efficiencies, partially offset by higher year-end completion tool sales. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate revenue to grow by 4% to 6% sequentially, while operating margins are expected to increase 75 to 125 basis points due to seasonal software sales and higher global activity. I will now turn the call back to Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Thanks, Eric. Let me summarize our discussion today. Halliburton delivered an impressive third quarter. Our margin strength demonstrated the power of our strategy. I'm pleased with the stability of our North America business and the profitability of our international growth. Our North America business performed exactly as I expected, delivering our strategy to maximize value in North America. Our international results clearly demonstrate Halliburton's strong global competitiveness in both divisions and the successful execution of our strategy for profitable international growth. Execution of our value proposition has created a strong offshore business, and our ability to compete in all parts of the business has never been better. And now let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Dave Anderson with Barclays. Please proceed.\nDave Anderson: So Jeff, the duration story internationally is very compelling with the capacity expansion in Middle East, offshore FIDs and offshore work that you were talking about. So I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how that translates into the cadence of international growth over the next 12 to 24 months. International sale looks a little sluggish this quarter, MENA was flat. I know Kuwait's been a bit slow, but I'm just wondering, should we start to see the region accelerate in 2024?\nJeff Miller: Yes. Thank you, Dave. And look, I expect that it will. And I've talked about growth for 2024 double digits. But to frame that, our strategy is profitable international growth. And we've grown 20% in '22, high teens this year, double digits next year. So I'm comfortable with the growth and expect we will continue to see strong growth, certainly above market growth. But we're doing that while improving margins and expanding margins. And so I think that our strategy is crystal clear around what we're going about. There's plenty of market there to do that and expect we will continue to do that in '24 and beyond.\nDave Anderson: And if I could just shift over to kind of one of the big topics out there is M&A, Chevron, Exxon, [indiscernible] EPs in North America. Can you talk a bit about what this means to Halliburton. On the one hand, I'm thinking this should provide you really significant visibility on your development programs. On the other hand, perhaps your pricing levers might be a bit compromised if you only have a handful of large customers. Could you just kind of big picture, talk about what's leading to your business, please?\nJeff Miller: Yes. Big picture, good for Halliburton. I think it does a couple of things what we're seeing. Certainly, it demonstrates the long-term importance of oil and gas and more specifically, worldwide and more importantly, the long-term importance of North America. I mean what we're seeing are big players that take a really long view, and these are the kind of customers that clearly work through cycles. And so I think we'll see a much more stable North America I really like our position with our customer mix today is clearly biased. Most of our work is with very large privates and publics. And so I like our position there. And then more importantly, these are customers that care about the kinds of things we work on at Halliburton. So when we work on, I think important things like productivity, efficiency and recovery. And we talk about all 3 of those in our business. And I think we're unique in the way that we approach those. So I think it will be good for Halliburton.\nDave Anderson: And what this accelerated adoption of e-frac, you think, with both of those two customers?\nJeff Miller: Look, I think that's exactly the kind of tool that customers like this want to have in their hands, and we're seeing pretty good adoption. I would say north of 60% of our business today are repeat customers. So these aren't science projects. This is things that are being baked into workflows.\nOperator: It comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nNeil Mehta: One of the notable things about the quarter was the return of capital, the $200 million of share repurchases. Maybe you could just frame out for the market, how you're thinking about your share repurchase strategy and setting us up for your framework as we go into 2024?\nEric Carre: Yes. Good morning, Neil. So look, dividends and it's clearly part of our return strategy. But directionally nothing has changed in our overall policy of returning about 50% or over 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. I mean right now, we like the flexibility that buybacks give us, and we're thinking similarly as we get into next year. If we look at what we've done this year, we've returned $1 billion already to shareholders so far this year. As our business continues to grow and our margins continue to improve as well. I would expect that these overall returns would be higher as we get into 2024.\nNeil Mehta: Okay. That's helpful. And we appreciated a little bit of color on 4Q, but I was wondering if you could kind of unpack some of that guidance a little bit more, talk about what you're thinking about from a regional perspective? And any comments that we need to keep in mind as we think about the next quarter sequentially.\nEric Carre: Yes. I think, Neil, we're typically giving guidance on a division basis, which is the way we report numbers, and I think we will leave it at that.\nJeff Miller: Well, maybe just a little bit of color around North America, we're going to see some seasonality as we've described it in the last few years. We've had really strong tailwinds into Q4. I would expect this year, we'll see what I would describe as more normal seasonality. And then, clearly, there will be completion tools and other sales in there that help internationally, we'll probably see software sales in Q4, probably Q1 and more activity and more pricing. And hopefully, that's helpful color.\nOperator: And it comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI.\nJames West: If I could, I'd love, Jeff, as you would talk a little bit about the competitive environment that you see in front of you now. It seems to me that we've had a big change in the overall market over the last decade or so with one competitor kind of dropping back, one moving into other non-oil and gas businesses and so kind of leaving the oil and gas side is somewhat about a duopoly for yourself and your main competitor but both of you are focused on returns. And so it's not a pricing fight or a market share fight, it's kind of, hey, we're in the same game, let's generate cash, let's generate free cash flow to get back to shareholders. Let's get pricing up for returns. Is that kind of how you see '24, '25, '26 unfolding or am I mistaken in my view, we've got a different competitive environment.\nJeff Miller: Well, James, it's highly competitive in the marketplace. And we are absolutely focused on our strategy at Halliburton and I've been really clear about that. And so independent of what anyone does in the marketplace from a Halliburton standpoint, we are maximizing value in North America. We are growing profitably internationally and driving capital efficiency. And I think some of the cash flows that you see and improving cash flow that you see is driven out of our fundamental strategy to develop R&D that is more capital efficient. And so this has been a strategy underway for probably 5 or 6 years, maybe longer. And today, we're seeing the fruits of that. But from a competitive perspective, highly competitive marketplace and we're always continuing to lower total cost of ownership for our customers and also drive the three things. And the outcome of that is clearly better free cash flow, more cash flow return to customers, but it starts with that basic strategy.\nJames West: Right. Got it. Okay. And then, if we think about North America as this cash machine, as I think about it for you guys, with some seasonality here in the fourth quarter, do you anticipate pricing degradation? Or do you think that everything kind of holds up here and we're in just kind of this continued harvesting period.\nJeff Miller: Well, look, I think that North America, as we look forward into '24, the consolidation activity that we've seen is clearly a demonstration of how important North America is. In the kind of environment that we're in today, it's hard for me to imagine operators who want to be smaller rather than bigger given the $85, $90 commodity price. So I think that will drive certain amount of activity up from here. From our perspective, we see largely a steady market from as you described it, just partly because we are focused on retiring diesel fleets and transitioning to electric. We've got a very clear strategy around North America. And we believe that our service quality performance and technology, those get better every day, and they drive margins. So this is an important component. They drive margins. And I think our customers understand the level of investment required in order to deliver service quality, performance and technology. So we've seen what this market looks like when we burn up equipment at very low returns that don't allow for that reinvestment, probably we've seen that, that's not a good outcome certainly not for service companies, but it's also not a good outcome for operators. So I think that's what gives me confidence in sort of the stability of this. And to that point, we're mostly I'd say, mostly contracted for 2024.\nOperator: And it comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.\nRoger Read: Yes. Good morning. Probably just to follow up on a couple of the questions already been asked, maybe slightly differently. As you think about the outlook here for the fourth quarter and maybe in the first half of '24, I was just curious where you feel like you're being properly cautious, maybe slightly overly cautious and where you think things actually need to come through to sort of hit the numbers, right? I'm just sort of looking for some guidelines maybe of what to pay attention to as the quarter unfolds.\nJeff Miller: Look, I think the guidance we've given you is fairly clear, and we've got a lot of confidence in the way we looked at the market. And as I described, seasonality in North America, it's something we've certainly seen before and we know what that looks like. I expect our international business continues to do, continues to grow, and we've already sort of laid out what we expect this year to look like. So I feel confident in our outlook. And then, as we go into the first half of next year, I think that we're going to clearly see North America up from here. Maybe that's the color that wasn't clear when I answered the last question. But in terms of sort of where the commodity price is and also not as dependent on that, but really what we're seeing in terms of customers' plans. And also, just the decline rates in North America. So the reality is you have to do more work in order to stay flat. And so I suspect that we'll see some of that as well. As the rest of next year plays out, it's too early to call that. We don't have budget numbers from customers but the customers operating in North America today are the kinds of folks that execute their plans and so those plans will be executed. I hope that's helpful.\nRoger Read: Yes, it is. My follow-up question is a little bit different tack. But it gets back to some of your opening comments about adjusting your cost structure and less fixed, more variable, we've typically thought of the way to measure performance with service companies in Halliburton, off the incremental margins. But if the fixed costs are becoming more variable, then maybe we don't see quite the same change in the incremental margin, but we'd still pay attention to the absolute margin. So maybe just as a way to ask about where you think the absolute margin can go relative to what we've seen over the last several quarters, any expectations there. I mean, is it -- these margins with revenue growth or margin expansion from here?\nJeff Miller: Well, look, I tend to always think more about margin expansion just because it's sort of core to how we're operating the business. But I think that the cost reductions have been super important. And I think a lot of what we've seen has been off the back of that but that's critical to how we run the business. And as I've said, maximizing value in North America is our fundamental strategy, and that will translate into strong incrementals, which we've seen. And I don't expect those have gone away, but that's partly because of the type of equipment we're putting in the market as much as anything. And so as we continue to pivot from diesel to electric, I would expect to see over time as those go into the marketplace, stronger incrementals. I would also say the same about what we're doing sort of quietly but equally important with drilling tools in North America. So we have been able to put together much better capital efficiency around our drilling business, and it's gaining traction. So those are the kind of things that drive incrementals even off of a fairly low fixed cost base.\nOperator: And it comes from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please proceed.\nScott Gruber: Yes. Good morning. Jeff, the trends in the U.S. certainly seem positive for Halliburton. So my question is, if we experience just a half recovery in market activities, so let's just say we get back about 50% of the rigs that we lost in the U.S. In that scenario, can Halliburton get back close to operating your peak frac fleet count from earlier this year. Can you get back close to peak numbers in that scenario?\nJeff Miller: Yes. Thanks. So I mean, look, we've got a really good position in North America. And I think as we look at '24, a couple of things, even beyond activity is, I view we have asymmetric sort of opportunity in North America. So I've said, I expect activity to be up, not down as we go into '24, just given where we are and as you described it. But the opportunity is around demand we see for [indiscernible]. So that's an opportunity that is largely unique to us in terms of the way we're approaching that. And certainly, our drilling business is equally an asymmetric opportunity for Halliburton just given the fundamental change in technology and the ability to put that to work in North America. And I think that will benefit on its own just from the technology, but equally so, maybe from any growth in rig count will only accelerate the uptake on that technology.\nScott Gruber: Got it. And another unique opportunity for Halliburton has been on the production side of the business, particularly outside of the U.S. as you take in the [indiscernible] business internationally and build the chemical facility in the Middle East. Can you just update us on the outlook for continued share gains within production outside of the U.S. in 2024?\nJeff Miller: Yes, thanks. The lift business continues to grow. I mean, this is a fantastic technology. And the reason it's leading in North America is because of its execution and its technology. And those are the same reasons that we're seeing the growth internationally. And so also an initial really solid contract in Kuwait that has continued to expand in the Middle East with trials and opportunities and actually getting meaningful traction. Similarly, in Latin America, where we had quite a bit of success in a variety of countries, including Ecuador and others. And look, lift is becoming -- our ESPs are becoming more resilient, the technology continues to improve. The summit team is at the leading edge of that. And so look, very high expectations for where they go and expect that, that is, again, another unique international growth opportunity for Halliburton, very resilient in the North America sort of independence of activity rig count activity. And then, the chemical business is it continues to get traction. We're on pace, we're on plan, I would say, with the plant in the Middle East. So it's doing what we had expected it to do. And so pleased with where we are.\nOperator: And it comes from the line of Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler.\nLuke Lemoine: Jeff, you talked last quarter about a record number of these fleets that you signed in 2Q. I wanted to see if you could give us a qualitative update on incremental these fleets maybe interest from customers and how you see your, this program shaping up for 24? And then, if you could provide any commentary on conventional equipment displacements, that would be helpful, too.\nJeff Miller: Look, we've continued on the track we were on. We've continued to see very strong demand. Yes, we've signed up new fleets. This quarter, we put a couple of work. I believe that trajectory is unchanged. And so very pleased with the trajectory that we see around e-fleets and they're performing very, very well. So that continues to sort of build up the confidence of the market and that technology. I think that the fact that they are lower TCO than existing equipment is a big part of why they are successful. From a displacement standpoint, we've described as we bring out electric equipment, we would retire diesel equipment. And I've always said, it's not a perfect science of 1:1. But we've had an opportunity this year to retire diesel fleets, which we've described. And by doing that has effectively accelerated the marketplace. And what we're really pleased to see a repeat customer. And I think that's an important component of confidence in the technology, customers come back for a second one.\nOperator: And it comes from the line of Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. Please proceed.\nStephen Gengaro: Two things for me. The first, when you think -- you mentioned this I think a little bit earlier, Jeff, but when you think about U.S. production levels, where do you think frac fleet activity needs to be. Are we around that level, do you think to keep production flat under or over.\nJeff Miller: Look, I think that's going to be unique to different and certainly the different operators and levels of efficiency and many other things. Look, I think that we'll know a lot more as we go into next year and start to see where production levels are. Clearly, this year saw a lot of broad activity by a lot of operators early in the year, and I suspect North America is getting the benefit of that right now. The private market was super busy the first part of the year 2023. You saw that group not really drill wells as we got into the late summer, which is the time they normally would. And so I think that will weigh on probably production as we go into '24. That said, we've got a commodity market that is probably quite supportive. And so it'd be hard to imagine less, not more. But in terms of production going into 2024, it would seem that a big chunk of what was added in '23 is not repeating right now with good weigh on production. That said, as I've said before, I think we'll see activity up, not down from here for those reasons.\nStephen Gengaro: Great. Thanks. And then my follow-up question was around sort of the maybe lesser Tier 1 acreage out there and sort of the impact that you think it has on how's business from both the pressure pumping but also across C&P in North America as far as, does it help, do you think efficiencies are slowing on the completion side. So how does that phenomena play into sort of demand and service intensity of sort of on a per production or per well basis.\nJeff Miller: Look, it drives service intensity up without question. And that's good for Halliburton. It also drives technology in terms of things like our downhole diagnostics, which we call SmartFleet. But I mean I think addressing productivity per foot which comes in the form of efficiency, and placement, reconciling all of those things between well design and production, having the tools to do that, and that's precisely what we introduced to the marketplace in the form of SmartFleet, which is a critical building block in my view, solving for that. And I think that's why we're seeing uptake on that technology. So I think that never bet against this industry ever. I mean our customers in North America are very smart, very good, very competitive. And the history of this industry broadly is improving recovery factors, whether it's through process and methodology or automation or in many cases, just physics and science. And I think that what that does do is it drives more reps for Halliburton. It will drive more sand in wells that will do a lot of things. But I also expect, as we've done for so many years, that we'll see the actual breakeven cost or the cost of producing oil and gas in North America continue to come down on the back of technology.\nOperator: It comes from the line of Marc Bianchi with TD Cowen. Please proceed.\nMarc Bianchi: Thank you. I wanted to ask about the C&P performance here in the third quarter and the outlook for fourth quarter. If I look at sort of the original guidance for third quarter, it was for margins to be flat, but they ended up growing by 100 basis points. And then as we look to fourth quarter, the decline is kind of guided to 100 basis points. Was there a pull forward of some completion tool sales that would usually occur in the fourth quarter? Is that explaining it? Or are there some other elements that we should be thinking about as we bridge from where we were in the second quarter?\nJeff Miller: Look, I expect to see strong performance from C&P, Q4 and beyond. Look, I think that I've described some seasonality. But I think what you're really seeing is the quantity and the quality of the development work that's happening around the world. I mean, you saw equipment is clearly tight moving up. We've got a leadership position. And several things in C&P whether it's production enhancement, which is very important internationally as well, cementing and completion tools. And then, certainly, it helps that North America executed very well. So we've seen flat margins despite the rig count being down.\nMarc Bianchi: Okay. Thanks for that Jeff. The other one I had was on kind of the international growth. So if I look at your Middle East and Africa, it was flat this quarter. I'm curious how you're thinking about that region and maybe the other regions if we're going to get to sort of a low double digits for the year. are any regions leading that or would you expect them all to grow at a similar type rate?\nJeff Miller: Well look, as I said, I expect we finished this year at high double digits, not low double digits. And so look, expect to see growth, but we're seeing growth everywhere. I mean, growth can be lumpy at different times. It depends on what's happening in a particular region on any given day or set of quarters. But I would say this quarter, we've grown 17% overall and would expect to see solid growth in '24. And so that will be in bright region, but I am not concerned at all about quarter-to-quarter where growth happens to be. We've seen very strong in Middle East earlier this year, and we'll probably see growth for the full year. So I think that quarter-to-quarter, trying to measure that is not as impactful as sort of year-on-year. And I think we take a set of assets and we put them to work where we see the best returns on them. And some of those C&P margins that you're seeing are at the root of that.\nOperator: It comes from the line of Jim Rollyson with Raymond James. Please proceed.\nJim Rollyson: Jeff, I just had one question. On the pricing front, you've talked about this, obviously, over the past few quarters. And my recollection historically is international pricing kind of takes a longer cycle to roll over. I'm kind of curious what you think -- what inning you think we're in from a pricing perspective if we're truly in this longer duration cycle and just how you think about that impact from here on margins since your margins are pretty strong relative to historical cycles already.\nJeff Miller: Look, I think that continue to strengthen. [Technical Difficulty]. We expect margins to continue to strengthen. The asset feedback, let's see. We expect margins to continue to strengthen internationally because they tend to move 1/3, 1/3, 1/3. However, what's important is, we're also seeing growth in offshore at the same time. And so we've got a tightening of capacity that sort of comes at a higher rate from offshore work just because it requires more capital offshore than it does onshore. And so the type of activity that we're seeing is continuing to tighten the market. At the same time, so that's driving pricing to a large degree. And I think the type of activity that we see planned that is either underway or being tendered or just being planned that clearly extends well into the decade is going to serve to drive our pricing.\nOperator: And it comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with Benchmark. Please proceed.\nKurt Hallead: I'm kind of curious here, Jeff, right, you given mentioned a number of different positive factors, right, that are driving your business, both internationally and domestically. And on the domestic front, right, your fleet mix, technology, service quality, et cetera. So with that dynamic and with that kind of mix, right, are you confident or comfortable enough to suggest that you think your North America revenue could grow in 2024, even if overall activity is flat or down?\nJeff Miller: Yes. Yes. I mean, again, I think we've got some unique opportunity. Asymmetric sort of positioning with Halliburton in terms of electric fleets that we're able to do that the market wants and that we can produce that is unique to Halliburton. And also, as I've described, our drilling technology as that grows in North America that will be, again, an opportunity for growth for Halliburton that probably won't be consistent across the broader piece of that. So yes, I am confident that Halliburton has the ability and will grow.\nKurt Hallead: Okay. Good. Great. Now I have a follow-up. I think in your prior conversations, I understood this correctly that when you're being approached by customers to talk about e-fleet opportunities. You guys are kind of looking at contractual commitments that maybe could be as long as 3 years. Is that still the case?\nJeff Miller: Yes. Look, it's a very good technology. We've talked about maximizing value in North America. That is what we're doing. And part of maximizing value in North America is building technology that customers want and creates value for customers. And for that, this is a fairly low risk decision by an operator realistically. The operators that we're talking to about e-fleets are the kind of operators that will always have equipment working. The reality is the first question is describe a scenario where you won't be fracking at all and the answer to that is there is no scenario where a large operator will not be fracking. Then it becomes, why wouldn't you want that one fleet at least to be your lowest cost operating fleet because it's burning natural gas, it's emitting less and it's working at the highest performance. At that point, this becomes a much easier discussion because it is the lowest cost operating fleet. It is extremely high efficiency and it lowers their overall cost. And so all of a sudden, that type of commitment isn't a huge hurdle to get over for customers that are committed to the long term in this business and that's been our experience. And I think that new capital should earn a return as part of maximizing value and we've got something that creates value for customers.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes the Q&A answer period. I will now turn the call back over to Jeff Miller.\nJeff Miller: Thank you, Carmen. Before we close out, Halliburton delivered an impressive third quarter. And our margin strength demonstrated the power of our strategy. Everything I see today strengthens my conviction and the long duration of this up cycle. So I look forward to speaking with you next quarter, Carmen will close out the call.\nOperator: Thank you. And with that, we thank you for participating in today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Our Q3 reported net income per diluted share was $0.79. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.8 billion flat sequentially, while operating income was $1 billion a sequential increase of 3%. Operating margin for the company was 17.9% in Q3, a 207 basis point increase over Q3 2022. Beginning with our completion and production division, revenue in Q3 was $3.5 billion flat sequentially, while operating income was $746 million, an increase of 6% sequentially. C&P delivered an operating income margin of 21%. These results were primarily due to increased stimulation activity internationally, higher cementing activity in the eastern hemisphere, and improved completion tool sales globally. These increases were partially offset by lower pressure pumping services in North America. In our drilling and evaluation division, revenue in Q3 was $2.3 billion flat sequentially, while operating income was $378 million, which was also flat from Q2. D&E delivered an operating income margin of 16%, an increase of 168 basis points over Q3 last year. Sequential changes were driven by higher fluid services in Middle East Asia, and Latin America, and increased wireline activity in Latin America and Europe/Africa. These were offset by decreased drilling related services, lower project management activity and software sales in Mexico. Now let's move on to geographic results. Our Q3 international revenue increased 3% sequentially. Latin America revenue in Q3 was $1 billion, a 5% increase sequentially. This increase was primarily due to increased pressure pumping services, and drilling fluids in Argentina, improved completion tool sales in Brazil, and higher project management and drilling related services in Colombia and Ecuador. Partially offsetting these increases were lower software sales, decreased project management and lower well construction services in Mexico. Europe/Africa revenue in Q3 was $734 million, a 5% increase sequentially. This increase was primarily driven by improved well construction services, higher completion tool sales and improved wireline activity in Norway, and higher completion tool sales in the Caspian area. These were partially offset by lower activity in Africa across multiple product service lines. Middle East Asia revenue in Q3 was $1.4 billion, which was flat from q2. These results were driven by higher well construction in Iraq, increased drilling related services and completion tool sales in Qatar, and higher pressure pumping and fluid services in Asia. These were offset by decreased activity in multiple product service lines in Kuwait, and India and lower drilling, testing and well intervention services in Asia. In North America, revenue in Q3 was $2.6 billion, a 3% decrease sequentially. This decline was primarily driven by decreased pressure pumping services in U.S. land, and lower well intervention services in the Gulf of Mexico. Partially offsetting these decreases was improved completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico. Moving on to other items, in Q3, our corporate and other expenses were $64 million. For Q4, we expect our corporate expense to increase by about $5 million as a result of timing and special items. In Q3, we spent $23 million, or about $0.03 per diluted share on SAP S4 migration, which is included in our results. For Q4, we expect these expenses to be approximately $14 million, which makes our spent approximately $50 million for 2023 as planned. Net interest expense for the quarter was $93 million, which was flat from the prior quarter. For Q4, we expect this expense to remain approximately flat. Other net expense for Q3 was $28 million, primarily related to unfavorable foreign exchange movements. For Q4, we expect this expense to remain approximately flat. Our effective tax rate for Q3 came in at 21%, based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to remain approximately flat. Capital expenditure for Q3 were $409 million, we anticipate that for the full year, capital expenditure will be approximately 6% of revenue. Our Q3 cash flow from operations was $874 million, and free cash flow was $511 million. We expect to generate over $2 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2023. Finally, consistent with our capital return policy of returning at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders, we repurchased approximately $200 million of our common stock during Q3. Additionally, during Q3, we repurchased $150 million of debt. Now turning to our near-term outlook. Let me provide you with some comments on how we see Q4 unfolding. In our Completion and Production division, we anticipate revenue to decrease by 3% to 5% sequentially, while operating margins are expected to decrease 25 to 75 basis points as a result of lower North America land activity due to holidays and lower winter month efficiencies, partially offset by higher year-end completion tool sales. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate revenue to grow by 4% to 6% sequentially, while operating margins are expected to increase 75 to 125 basis points due to seasonal software sales and higher global activity. I will now turn the call back to Jeff. Yes. Good morning, Neil. So look, dividends and it's clearly part of our return strategy. But directionally nothing has changed in our overall policy of returning about 50% or over 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. I mean right now, we like the flexibility that buybacks give us, and we're thinking similarly as we get into next year. If we look at what we've done this year, we've returned $1 billion already to shareholders so far this year. As our business continues to grow and our margins continue to improve as well. I would expect that these overall returns would be higher as we get into 2024. Yes. I think, Neil, we're typically giving guidance on a division basis, which is the way we report numbers, and I think we will leave it at that."

            "content": "Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Halliburton delivered an impressive third quarter. Our margin strength demonstrated the power of our strategy. I am pleased with the stability of our North America business and the profitability of our international growth. Let's jump right into the highlights. Total company revenue increased 8% year-over-year, while operating income grew 23%. International revenue grew 17% year-over-year with strong activity in all geographic markets. North America revenue was roughly flat year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. Our completion and production division grew revenue 11% year-over-year, while margins expanded 280 basis points, margins expanded 105 basis points sequentially driven by international operations, while North American C&P margins remained approximately flat the last quarter. Our drilling and evaluation division grew revenue 4% year-over-year, while margins expanded 168 basis points. Finally, we generated $874 million of cash from operations, $511 million of free cash flow and repurchased approximately $200 million of common stock and $150 million of debt during the quarter. To our over 45,000 employees globally. Thank you for another outstanding quarter, you executed our strategy and delivered excellent financial results. I'll begin with what I see in the macro environment. Reliable and affordable energy remains at the very center of global economic growth and security. The most recent world oil outlook from OPEC expects 10 million barrels of oil demand growth before the end of the decade and further demand growth through 2045. Maintaining production while adding incremental supply requires meaningful long-term investment in both short and long cycle barrels to meet demand. This challenge is reflected in our customers' activity levels and future development plans. Consistent with this outlook, we expect continued demand growth for oilfield services in 2024 and beyond. Everything I see today strengthens my conviction in the long duration of this upcycle. Against this backdrop, I believe the execution of our strategy will deliver strong free cash flow, growing margins and more cash return to shareholders. Starting with North America, Halliburton performed exactly as I expected, delivering our strategy to maximize value in North America. Our North America business has changed. Despite the U.S. rig count decreasing around 20% since Q4 of 2022, Halliburton delivered strong revenue and margin performance during this period. That's quite a different result from what Halliburton would have delivered in prior cycles. Since 2015, we changed our strategy. We changed our operating model, and the market structure changed. Our strategy in North America is to maximize value. Executing this strategy made many of our decisions over the last few years crystal clear, including our decision to invest in differentiated and value-added technologies, such as our Zeus electric fleets, automation, and our fiber optic downhole fracturing diagnostics. We know that in a competitive market to capture value, you must first create value. Our decision to derisk returns and maximize free cash flow by only building fracturing equipment under long-term contracts. And finally, our decision to retire old equipment when returns are not sufficient rather than to pursue market share. Maximizing value means just that, do the things that improve returns and stop doing the things that lower them. Next, we fundamentally changed our operating model. We removed $1 billion of fixed costs from our business in 2020. Those cost reductions were structural and remain in place today. As a result, today, our cost structure is more variable and less fixed. And it's one of the reasons we have the flexibility to pursue returns rather than market share. Our commitment to continuous improvement drove significant changes in the way we work, which delivered efficiency improvements in our operations. This resulted in a 68% improvement in hours pumped per crew in just the last four years. Finally, the E&P and services markets fundamentally changed. Today the market is more consolidated, more focused on returns, and more focused on free cash flow generation. We see the benefits of this change. Customers assign value to technology and efficiency, and the service industry is rewarded for returns rather than growth. Never before as the success of our North America business been better aligned with the success of our customers who make significant long-term investments in the region. I expect the combination of our value proposition and strategy will deliver a more profitable business that generates more free cash flow for years to come. Now let's turn to international markets, where Halliburton's revenue grew 17% compared to the same quarter of last year. In the third quarter, we saw activity increase in both divisions, though particularly in our completions and production division. Our results clearly demonstrate Halliburton strong global competitiveness in both divisions and the successful execution of our strategy for profitable international growth. We execute our profitable growth strategy through our differentiated technology offerings, selective contract wins, and our unique collaborative approach with customers, all of which build on our foundation as a leader in service quality and execution. I expect the market for oilfield services will further tighten as asset intensive offshore activity increases. More importantly, I expect that pricing returns will serve as the mechanism to allocate scarce equipment. This is a great market for Halliburton to execute its strategy for profitable international growth. I'm excited about our international business and we're on track to deliver high teens year-on-year growth in 2023. Looking ahead, 2024 is coming into view and I expect to see international activity again directionally higher, with market growth in the double-digit range. I'd like to take a few minutes and talk more about our global offshore business. Let me start with some color. Offshore represents more than 50% of our business outside of North America land. About 25% of our C&P revenue is generated offshore. More than 40% of our D&E revenue is generated offshore. All of our regions contribute materially to our offshore revenue. All of our product lines operate offshore and Halliburton leads in many well construction product lines key to offshore development. Customers choose Halliburton because we collaborate and deliver impactful results. The combination of our leading product lines, and our collaboration from design through well delivery is what drives superior results for our customers. One example is in Norway, where according to IHS Rushmore data, the Aker BP Alliance where Halliburton provides well construction services consistently represents the top quartile of drilling performance. This performance matters even more in a market where offshore rig rates and spread costs are rising. With our customers, we deliver some of the most technically complex wells in our industry. We provide leading solutions in many areas including high pressure, deepwater completions, complex multilateral junctions, ultra deep reading LWD tools, narrow margin drilling fluids and tailored lightweight cement. These solutions enable our customers to efficiently and reliably develop their offshore reserves and maximize the value of their assets. Execution of our value proposition has created a strong offshore business underpinned by efficiency and differentiated technology. Our ability to compete in all parts of the offshore business including exploration, development and intervention has never been better. Let me close with this. I'm both excited and confident in the outlook for our business, the duration of this upcycle the clarity and depth of our strategy and the strength of our execution. Now I'll turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric? Thanks, Eric. Let me summarize our discussion today. Halliburton delivered an impressive third quarter. Our margin strength demonstrated the power of our strategy. I'm pleased with the stability of our North America business and the profitability of our international growth. Our North America business performed exactly as I expected, delivering our strategy to maximize value in North America. Our international results clearly demonstrate Halliburton's strong global competitiveness in both divisions and the successful execution of our strategy for profitable international growth. Execution of our value proposition has created a strong offshore business, and our ability to compete in all parts of the business has never been better. And now let's open it up for questions. Yes. Thank you, Dave. And look, I expect that it will. And I've talked about growth for 2024 double digits. But to frame that, our strategy is profitable international growth. And we've grown 20% in '22, high teens this year, double digits next year. So I'm comfortable with the growth and expect we will continue to see strong growth, certainly above market growth. But we're doing that while improving margins and expanding margins. And so I think that our strategy is crystal clear around what we're going about. There's plenty of market there to do that and expect we will continue to do that in '24 and beyond. Yes. Big picture, good for Halliburton. I think it does a couple of things what we're seeing. Certainly, it demonstrates the long-term importance of oil and gas and more specifically, worldwide and more importantly, the long-term importance of North America. I mean what we're seeing are big players that take a really long view, and these are the kind of customers that clearly work through cycles. And so I think we'll see a much more stable North America I really like our position with our customer mix today is clearly biased. Most of our work is with very large privates and publics. And so I like our position there. And then more importantly, these are customers that care about the kinds of things we work on at Halliburton. So when we work on, I think important things like productivity, efficiency and recovery. And we talk about all 3 of those in our business. And I think we're unique in the way that we approach those. So I think it will be good for Halliburton. Look, I think that's exactly the kind of tool that customers like this want to have in their hands, and we're seeing pretty good adoption. I would say north of 60% of our business today are repeat customers. So these aren't science projects. This is things that are being baked into workflows. Well, maybe just a little bit of color around North America, we're going to see some seasonality as we've described it in the last few years. We've had really strong tailwinds into Q4. I would expect this year, we'll see what I would describe as more normal seasonality. And then, clearly, there will be completion tools and other sales in there that help internationally, we'll probably see software sales in Q4, probably Q1 and more activity and more pricing. And hopefully, that's helpful color. Well, James, it's highly competitive in the marketplace. And we are absolutely focused on our strategy at Halliburton and I've been really clear about that. And so independent of what anyone does in the marketplace from a Halliburton standpoint, we are maximizing value in North America. We are growing profitably internationally and driving capital efficiency. And I think some of the cash flows that you see and improving cash flow that you see is driven out of our fundamental strategy to develop R&D that is more capital efficient. And so this has been a strategy underway for probably 5 or 6 years, maybe longer. And today, we're seeing the fruits of that. But from a competitive perspective, highly competitive marketplace and we're always continuing to lower total cost of ownership for our customers and also drive the three things. And the outcome of that is clearly better free cash flow, more cash flow return to customers, but it starts with that basic strategy. Well, look, I think that North America, as we look forward into '24, the consolidation activity that we've seen is clearly a demonstration of how important North America is. In the kind of environment that we're in today, it's hard for me to imagine operators who want to be smaller rather than bigger given the $85, $90 commodity price. So I think that will drive certain amount of activity up from here. From our perspective, we see largely a steady market from as you described it, just partly because we are focused on retiring diesel fleets and transitioning to electric. We've got a very clear strategy around North America. And we believe that our service quality performance and technology, those get better every day, and they drive margins. So this is an important component. They drive margins. And I think our customers understand the level of investment required in order to deliver service quality, performance and technology. So we've seen what this market looks like when we burn up equipment at very low returns that don't allow for that reinvestment, probably we've seen that, that's not a good outcome certainly not for service companies, but it's also not a good outcome for operators. So I think that's what gives me confidence in sort of the stability of this. And to that point, we're mostly I'd say, mostly contracted for 2024. Look, I think the guidance we've given you is fairly clear, and we've got a lot of confidence in the way we looked at the market. And as I described, seasonality in North America, it's something we've certainly seen before and we know what that looks like. I expect our international business continues to do, continues to grow, and we've already sort of laid out what we expect this year to look like. So I feel confident in our outlook. And then, as we go into the first half of next year, I think that we're going to clearly see North America up from here. Maybe that's the color that wasn't clear when I answered the last question. But in terms of sort of where the commodity price is and also not as dependent on that, but really what we're seeing in terms of customers' plans. And also, just the decline rates in North America. So the reality is you have to do more work in order to stay flat. And so I suspect that we'll see some of that as well. As the rest of next year plays out, it's too early to call that. We don't have budget numbers from customers but the customers operating in North America today are the kinds of folks that execute their plans and so those plans will be executed. I hope that's helpful. Well, look, I tend to always think more about margin expansion just because it's sort of core to how we're operating the business. But I think that the cost reductions have been super important. And I think a lot of what we've seen has been off the back of that but that's critical to how we run the business. And as I've said, maximizing value in North America is our fundamental strategy, and that will translate into strong incrementals, which we've seen. And I don't expect those have gone away, but that's partly because of the type of equipment we're putting in the market as much as anything. And so as we continue to pivot from diesel to electric, I would expect to see over time as those go into the marketplace, stronger incrementals. I would also say the same about what we're doing sort of quietly but equally important with drilling tools in North America. So we have been able to put together much better capital efficiency around our drilling business, and it's gaining traction. So those are the kind of things that drive incrementals even off of a fairly low fixed cost base. Yes. Thanks. So I mean, look, we've got a really good position in North America. And I think as we look at '24, a couple of things, even beyond activity is, I view we have asymmetric sort of opportunity in North America. So I've said, I expect activity to be up, not down as we go into '24, just given where we are and as you described it. But the opportunity is around demand we see for [indiscernible]. So that's an opportunity that is largely unique to us in terms of the way we're approaching that. And certainly, our drilling business is equally an asymmetric opportunity for Halliburton just given the fundamental change in technology and the ability to put that to work in North America. And I think that will benefit on its own just from the technology, but equally so, maybe from any growth in rig count will only accelerate the uptake on that technology. Yes, thanks. The lift business continues to grow. I mean, this is a fantastic technology. And the reason it's leading in North America is because of its execution and its technology. And those are the same reasons that we're seeing the growth internationally. And so also an initial really solid contract in Kuwait that has continued to expand in the Middle East with trials and opportunities and actually getting meaningful traction. Similarly, in Latin America, where we had quite a bit of success in a variety of countries, including Ecuador and others. And look, lift is becoming -- our ESPs are becoming more resilient, the technology continues to improve. The summit team is at the leading edge of that. And so look, very high expectations for where they go and expect that, that is, again, another unique international growth opportunity for Halliburton, very resilient in the North America sort of independence of activity rig count activity. And then, the chemical business is it continues to get traction. We're on pace, we're on plan, I would say, with the plant in the Middle East. So it's doing what we had expected it to do. And so pleased with where we are. Look, we've continued on the track we were on. We've continued to see very strong demand. Yes, we've signed up new fleets. This quarter, we put a couple of work. I believe that trajectory is unchanged. And so very pleased with the trajectory that we see around e-fleets and they're performing very, very well. So that continues to sort of build up the confidence of the market and that technology. I think that the fact that they are lower TCO than existing equipment is a big part of why they are successful. From a displacement standpoint, we've described as we bring out electric equipment, we would retire diesel equipment. And I've always said, it's not a perfect science of 1:1. But we've had an opportunity this year to retire diesel fleets, which we've described. And by doing that has effectively accelerated the marketplace. And what we're really pleased to see a repeat customer. And I think that's an important component of confidence in the technology, customers come back for a second one. Look, I think that's going to be unique to different and certainly the different operators and levels of efficiency and many other things. Look, I think that we'll know a lot more as we go into next year and start to see where production levels are. Clearly, this year saw a lot of broad activity by a lot of operators early in the year, and I suspect North America is getting the benefit of that right now. The private market was super busy the first part of the year 2023. You saw that group not really drill wells as we got into the late summer, which is the time they normally would. And so I think that will weigh on probably production as we go into '24. That said, we've got a commodity market that is probably quite supportive. And so it'd be hard to imagine less, not more. But in terms of production going into 2024, it would seem that a big chunk of what was added in '23 is not repeating right now with good weigh on production. That said, as I've said before, I think we'll see activity up, not down from here for those reasons. Look, it drives service intensity up without question. And that's good for Halliburton. It also drives technology in terms of things like our downhole diagnostics, which we call SmartFleet. But I mean I think addressing productivity per foot which comes in the form of efficiency, and placement, reconciling all of those things between well design and production, having the tools to do that, and that's precisely what we introduced to the marketplace in the form of SmartFleet, which is a critical building block in my view, solving for that. And I think that's why we're seeing uptake on that technology. So I think that never bet against this industry ever. I mean our customers in North America are very smart, very good, very competitive. And the history of this industry broadly is improving recovery factors, whether it's through process and methodology or automation or in many cases, just physics and science. And I think that what that does do is it drives more reps for Halliburton. It will drive more sand in wells that will do a lot of things. But I also expect, as we've done for so many years, that we'll see the actual breakeven cost or the cost of producing oil and gas in North America continue to come down on the back of technology. Look, I expect to see strong performance from C&P, Q4 and beyond. Look, I think that I've described some seasonality. But I think what you're really seeing is the quantity and the quality of the development work that's happening around the world. I mean, you saw equipment is clearly tight moving up. We've got a leadership position. And several things in C&P whether it's production enhancement, which is very important internationally as well, cementing and completion tools. And then, certainly, it helps that North America executed very well. So we've seen flat margins despite the rig count being down. Well look, as I said, I expect we finished this year at high double digits, not low double digits. And so look, expect to see growth, but we're seeing growth everywhere. I mean, growth can be lumpy at different times. It depends on what's happening in a particular region on any given day or set of quarters. But I would say this quarter, we've grown 17% overall and would expect to see solid growth in '24. And so that will be in bright region, but I am not concerned at all about quarter-to-quarter where growth happens to be. We've seen very strong in Middle East earlier this year, and we'll probably see growth for the full year. So I think that quarter-to-quarter, trying to measure that is not as impactful as sort of year-on-year. And I think we take a set of assets and we put them to work where we see the best returns on them. And some of those C&P margins that you're seeing are at the root of that. Look, I think that continue to strengthen. [Technical Difficulty]. We expect margins to continue to strengthen. The asset feedback, let's see. We expect margins to continue to strengthen internationally because they tend to move 1/3, 1/3, 1/3. However, what's important is, we're also seeing growth in offshore at the same time. And so we've got a tightening of capacity that sort of comes at a higher rate from offshore work just because it requires more capital offshore than it does onshore. And so the type of activity that we're seeing is continuing to tighten the market. At the same time, so that's driving pricing to a large degree. And I think the type of activity that we see planned that is either underway or being tendered or just being planned that clearly extends well into the decade is going to serve to drive our pricing. Yes. Yes. I mean, again, I think we've got some unique opportunity. Asymmetric sort of positioning with Halliburton in terms of electric fleets that we're able to do that the market wants and that we can produce that is unique to Halliburton. And also, as I've described, our drilling technology as that grows in North America that will be, again, an opportunity for growth for Halliburton that probably won't be consistent across the broader piece of that. So yes, I am confident that Halliburton has the ability and will grow. Yes. Look, it's a very good technology. We've talked about maximizing value in North America. That is what we're doing. And part of maximizing value in North America is building technology that customers want and creates value for customers. And for that, this is a fairly low risk decision by an operator realistically. The operators that we're talking to about e-fleets are the kind of operators that will always have equipment working. The reality is the first question is describe a scenario where you won't be fracking at all and the answer to that is there is no scenario where a large operator will not be fracking. Then it becomes, why wouldn't you want that one fleet at least to be your lowest cost operating fleet because it's burning natural gas, it's emitting less and it's working at the highest performance. At that point, this becomes a much easier discussion because it is the lowest cost operating fleet. It is extremely high efficiency and it lowers their overall cost. And so all of a sudden, that type of commitment isn't a huge hurdle to get over for customers that are committed to the long term in this business and that's been our experience. And I think that new capital should earn a return as part of maximizing value and we've got something that creates value for customers. Thank you, Carmen. Before we close out, Halliburton delivered an impressive third quarter. And our margin strength demonstrated the power of our strategy. Everything I see today strengthens my conviction and the long duration of this up cycle. So I look forward to speaking with you next quarter, Carmen will close out the call."

Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. \nJeff Miller : Thank you, David, and good morning everyone. In the second quarter Halliburton once again delivered strong results driven by service quality, outstanding execution and strong global demand for high quality and high performance oilfield services. Let's get right to the highlights.  Total company revenue increased 14% year-over-year. Operating income grew 41% compared to second quarter of 2022 adjusted operating income. International revenue grew 17% year-over-year with strong activity in all markets. North America revenue grew 11% year-over-year.  Our Completion and Production division revenue grew 19% year-over-year, while margins expanded by 320 basis points. Our Drilling and Evaluation division revenue grew 7% year-over-year, while margins expanded nearly 300 basis points. Finally, we generated $1.1 billion of cash from operations, $798 million of free cash flow, and repurchased approximately $250 million worth of shares during the quarter.  Halliburton delivered an impressive first half of 2023. I'd like to thank our employees for these outstanding results. Thank you for executing on our mainstays and strategy delivery.  Now, let's turn to what I see in the markets and what I believe is driving this multi-year upcycles duration. Demand for oil and gas is strong as demonstrated by demand growth of 2 million barrels per day in the first half of the year compared to the same period last year. Oil and gas continues to demonstrate its critical role in the global economy and meeting long term demand requires sustained capital investment.  Commodity prices remain attractive. When I talk to customers they expect to work more, not less, and many of their activity plans extend into the next decade. Customers are settling in for a long duration upcycle. Overall, I expect upstream spending to grow in 2023 and beyond. For this year, I expect International and North America customer spending growth in the high teens and around 10% respectively compared to last year, despite reduced rig count and completion activity in the U.S.  Now let's start with our performance in the international markets. Revenue in the second quarter grew 17% compared to the same period of last year with strong activity across both divisions. Today more than 20% of our tender pipeline represents incremental activity, which is as high as I can recall.  Equally important, in addition to strong growth in the Middle East and Latin America, we see steady growth in activity across the globe. In this environment, I expect quality services and equipment to remain tight and pricing to continue to improve.  Halliburton's strategy is to deliver a profitable international growth. We are clear in how we do this, through differentiated technology offerings, selective contract wins, and a unique collaborative approach to working with our customers. Our differentiated technology and digital portfolio deliver high quality and high performance to our customers in all markets. Here are some examples.  Our drilling and LWD technology platforms deliver better reliability, data capture, and efficiency for our customers, while structurally expanding our margins. We build and deploy leading-edge drilling equipment that requires less capital to build and operate, compared to the prior generation of equipment. One example, for a customer in the Middle East, Halliburton achieved a world record for the longest well ever drilled, with a measured depth of over 51,000 feet, using Halliburton's iCruise, iStar and LOGIX Technologies.  Our leading position in Completions Technology is unlocking production for customers. We recently set another world record with the successful installation of the first 12 ZONE intelligent completion for a Middle East offshore customer using Halliburton's SmartWell technology on our eCompletions Platform. In our digital business, Equinor joins several other customers in selecting Landmark\u2019s DecisionSpace 365 as their standard subsurface data interpretation tool.  During the second quarter, our Landmark software business closed on the acquisition of Resoptima, a leader in advanced ensemble modeling at the reservoir level. I'm excited about Resoptima's technology, both standalone and how it accelerates Landmark's roadmap for next-generation reservoir modeling technology.  Now, turning to collaboration. Our value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers and our mainstay processes define how we consistently differentiate our services. This is the source of our competitive advantage. Our value proposition creates an environment where our customers and Halliburton collectively perform better.  A recent example of this is Halliburton and V\u00e5r Energi's announcement of a long-term strategic relationship for drilling services. I expect we will demonstrate with V\u00e5r, as we have with other customers, that our collaborative approach creates significantly better operational and financial performance for both the customer and Halliburton.  Our international strategy works. Our differentiated, cost-effective technologies and collaborative approach with customers empower us to strategically target work where we see a competitive advantage and a clear path to outperform financially.  Turning to North America, we delivered a solid quarter. North America revenue grew 11% versus the same period last year, and margins were sequentially flat versus the last quarter. Looking ahead into the second half, I expect overall market activity in North America will be slightly lower than in the first half.  More importantly, I expect Halliburton's North America margins to remain strong for the balance of the year. Our results in North America clearly demonstrate the success of our strategy to maximize value. We do this through capital efficiency, differentiated technology, and alignment with high-quality customers.  During our last call, I outlined the steps we took in North America land to maintain pricing and deploy service capacity to attractive return opportunities or retire old equipment to further accelerate Halliburton's transition to our electric fleets. Executing on our strategy during the second quarter, we deployed additional Zeus fleets on multi-year contracts, while retiring additional diesel equipment.  Demand for our Zeus e-fleets is strong. In fact, during the second quarter we signed more multi-year Zeus contracts than in any prior quarter. The multi-year duration of these contracts provides both stability and secure economic returns, which furthers my confidence in the strength of our margins. I continue to be impressed by the performance of our Zeus e-fleets and the optimization and efficiencies that come with scale. Our current system is the result of multiple iterations over several years and our continuous improvement processes. Every element of the value chain, from design and manufacturing to operations and maintenance, is continuously improved. Our advances in pump technology and system design result in higher horsepower density and pump efficiency.  With Octave, we are automating equipment operation for consistency and reliability. We work to be the best at getting better. Today, Zeus is a fully integrated system. We deliver new equipment on time that works right out of the box and on average this year our e-fleets pumped over 10% more hours than our high-performance diesel fleets.  For our customers, these improvements mean better performance and even lower total cost of ownership. For Halliburton, these improvements mean we further widen the moat around our growing e-fleet business. In all markets, international and North America, I believe our strategies yield improved financial results.  Let's look at the steady growth and margin expansion in D&E. This is the result of a structural change and technology overhaul that began several years ago.  Our leading drilling platforms are lower cost and higher performance than the prior generation, which drives higher asset velocity and higher returns. In our testing business, our FloConnect Surface well testing service provides a safe, efficient, and automated platform to our customers, while lowering our overall operating costs. In our Wireline business, our Xaminer platform provides high quality reservoir data, reduces subsurface uncertainty, and allows us to win high-value exploration work.  Finally, across all product lines, automation and remote operations are beginning to transform service delivery, driving higher quality and reliability, while lowering total cost of service delivery. Looking through any quarterly fluctuations and seasonality, I fully expect D&E margins will continue to expand over time. Our strategy also generates strong free cash flow, and our capital return framework returns cash to our shareholders. I expect over 50% of free cash flow will be returned to shareholders this year.  I am pleased with where we are today. In the last 18 months we retired $1.2 billion of debt, strengthening our balance sheet; twice increased our quarterly dividend, which forms the stable foundation of our capital return framework; and finally, repurchased approximately $600 million worth of shares, including approximately $250 million this quarter. I fully expect that the execution of our strategy in this long duration upcycle will deliver better returns, more free cash flow, and more cash back to shareholders.  Now, I'll turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric. \nEric Carre : Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Before I begin the financial review, I'd like to discuss one item. In the second quarter, we kicked off our SAP S4 upgrade and recorded a $13 million expense, or about $0.01 per diluted share, in our Q2 operating results. Future expenses will be both included in our operating results and in our quarterly guidance. Here are a few more details on the upgrade.  This upgrade will take place over the next 2.5 years, concluding around Q4, 2025. We expect it to provide efficiencies, cost savings, and advanced analytics that will benefit Halliburton and our customers. The total project investment should be approximately $250 million, $50 million this year, and $100 million in each of the next two years. Upon completion, we expect significant ongoing savings, which will pay back the investment in about three years.  Now, let me move on to our quarterly results. Our second quarter reported net income per diluted share was $0.68. Excluding the effect of the transaction in Argentina, our adjusted net income per diluted share was $0.77.  Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.8 billion, a 2% sequential increase, while operating income was $1 billion, a sequential increase of 4%. Operating margin for the company was 17.4% in the second quarter, a 329 basis points increase over second quarter of 2022 adjusted operating margin. These results were primarily driven by strong international activity across both divisions, along with improved pricing.  Beginning with our completion and production division, revenue in the second quarter was $3.5 billion, a 2% sequential increase, while operating income was $707 million, an increase of 6% sequentially. C&P delivered an operating income margin of 20%. These results were due to increased activity from multiple product lines in international markets and higher artificial lift activity in North America.  In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in the second quarter was $2.3 billion, a sequential increase of 2%, while operating income was $376 million, a sequential increase of 2%. D&E delivered an operating income margin of 16%. These results were driven by higher drilling activity and increased fluid services in key regions including Middle East and Latin America, partially offset by seasonal roll-off of software sales across multiple regions.  Now, let's move on to geographic results. Our second quarter international revenue increased 7% sequentially due to solid product sales, activity increases and pricing gains across multiple product lines. These results were impacted by lower software sales in the eastern hemisphere.  In North America, revenue in the second quarter was $2.7 billion, a 2% decrease sequentially. This decline was primarily driven by decreased stimulation activity in U.S. land, partially offset by increased artificial lift activity in U.S. land and higher activity across multiple product service lines in the Gulf of Mexico.  Latin America revenue in the second quarter was $994 million, a 9% increase sequentially, resulting from higher completion tool sales in Brazil and improved activity across multiple product service lines in Mexico and Argentina. Partially offsetting this increase is reduced activity in the Caribbean across multiple product service lines.  Europe/Africa revenue in the second quarter was $698 million, a 5% increase sequentially. This improvement was primarily driven by increased fluid services across the region and higher completion tool sales in Angola and Norway.  Middle East/Asia revenue in the second quarter was $1.4 billion, a 6% increase sequentially, largely resulting from higher completion tool sales in Saudi Arabia and higher Wireline activity, drilling services, and stimulation activity in the region. This improvement was partially offset by decreased project management activity in Saudi Arabia.  Moving on to other items. In the second quarter, our corporate and other expenses was $59 million. For the third quarter, we expect our corporate expenses to increase by about $5 million to $10 million.  As noted earlier, in the second quarter we spent $13 million or about $0.01 per diluted share on SAP S4 migration, which is included in our operating results. For the third quarter, we expect these expenses to be approximately $20 million or about $0.02 [ph] per diluted share.  Net interest expense for the quarter was $92 million. The increase this quarter was primarily related to the reduction of interest income as a result of the Argentina transaction. For the third quarter, we expect this expense to remain approximately flat. Other net expense for the quarter was $32 million. For the third quarter, we expect this expense to remain approximately flat.  Our effective tax rate for the second quarter came in at approximately 21.3%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our third quarter effective tax rate to increase by approximately 50 basis points. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $303 million. We anticipate that for the full year, capital expenditure will be approximately 6% of our revenue. Our second quarter cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion and free cash flow was $798 million. We expect to generate free cash flow for the full year 2023; that is 30% to 40% higher than last year. Finally, we repurchased $248 million of our common stock during the second quarter.  Now, turning to our near-term operational outlook. Let me provide you with some comments on how we see the third quarter unfolding. In our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to be essentially flat with the second quarter and margins to remain approximately flat. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate sequential revenue to increase in the low single digits and margins to increase 25 to 75 basis points.  I will now turn the call back to Jeff. \nJeff Miller : Thanks, Eric. Let me summarize our discussion today. Our international business is growing at a strong pace across all regions. I expect our differentiated technology offerings, selective contract wins, and our unique collaborative approach to working with our customers to deliver higher international margins and growth for Halliburton.  Our strategy to maximize value in North America is driven by capital efficiency, differentiated technology and alignment with high-quality customers. I expect this will allow us to generate solid financial performance. I expect that the execution of our strategy in this long-duration upcycle will deliver better returns, more free cash flow, and more cash back to shareholders.  And now, let's open it up for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of David Anderson with Barclays. \nDavid Anderson : Hi! Good morning, Jeff. \nA - Jeff Miller: Hey!\nDavid Anderson : So, North America's slowing down a bit. International's starting to accelerate, to be expected. But I was wondering if you could perhaps take a bit of a step back and talk about how you see the primary markets trending in the next kind of 12 to 24 months in terms of NAM [ph], Middle East, and offshore. Maybe set LATAM aside, which has been a steady growth market.  I guess my question is, in terms of the cadence, how do you see the trajectory of each of these markets playing out? You lowered NAM spend. I think you were saying 10% up from down from 15%. So is that kind of flattish in the second half of the year? And then how do you see the ramp up in the Middle East and then the timing of offshore? I know it's a lot, but maybe kind of this bigger picture, how you see those markets trending [inaudible]? \nA - Jeff Miller: Certainly. And look, I'm as confident as I have ever been in the duration, the long duration of this cycle. And that's rooted in attractive commodity price and really the growth in demand for oil, so I'll start there.  I think the offshore piece of this, we're super excited about it. If we include Gulf of Mexico, we're eclipsing 50% of our revenues internationally are offshore, and so all of our service lines are represented there.  I think the cadence as I look over the next year, let's say year or so, I mean it just takes time to get this work underway. I'm just back from a trip and we were looking at projects that, you know they have to get rigs, get plans, get agreement from governments, but it's starting and I expect it continues to build into \u201824 and beyond. I mean, these are the kinds of projects that take a decade to do and so\u2026 You know Middle East, I see the same thing. The number of rigs being mobilized in the Middle East, that takes some time to do. But we are beginning to see it. We are seeing it, but my view is that we\u2019ll continue to build over the next 12 or 24 months.  Coming back to North America, I gave you an outlook on the second half of the year. But I think what's most important is, when I look into \u201824, I mean commodity markets are getting more constructive, oil prices firming up, gas seems to have found its footing you know and expect that ramps. We're seeing some consolidation with customers and that means that bigger customers do more planning through the cycle. They are committed to executing plans over a longer term and service intensity in North America never lets up. In fact, it only gets harder and you can't \u2013 you got to \u2013 you got to work harder just to stand still. So all of this is constructive for Halliburton's business as I look out into \u201824 and beyond. And you know, and some of that in North America, I mean just that it\u2019s backed up by the pace of e-fleet contracts that we're seeing. We've had more contracts last quarter. We've even signed another one this quarter, and that's really for work that starts in \u201824 and goes \u201824, \u201825, \u201826. So, there are a lot of reasons that I see \u201824 looking super strong for us. \nDavid Anderson : And then, Jeff, maybe we can just kind of get into the heart of kind of where a lot of the chatter has been during the quarter. Obviously, rig count has been falling. We've been hearing about pricing and pumping getting softer. Of course, a lot of this is coming from your competitors who would love to pay less for these services.  Can you give us some insight in kind of what you're seeing in the pricing trend? Is the softness kind of really stuck on the Tier 2 side? In your comments you talked about your Zeus fleets holding up. Is the Tier 4 holding up? What do you see on the competitive pricing side? If you can just kind of give us some more context here, because we just kind of hear these kind of generalized comments and I have a feeling there's more to it. I was wondering if you could provide some more context please. \nA - Jeff Miller: Well, I think that \u2013 you know I've told you what we're doing, which is retiring older equipment and transitioning to electric and so I think that's an important factor. We really don't see, we don't participate in the bottom part of that market particularly at all, really where that\u2019s the spot type market. Most of our work, I'd say over 70% of our work is with large privates and publics and so \u2013 you know these are customers that execute their plans and they do execute their plans.  And from our perspective, the performance \u2013 we continue to see our performance improving, okay, even as we add electric, but also even on our diesel fleets. And differentiated service performance, technology is getting better. I mean those are things that drive not only margins, but they are also part of the dialogue around what's it take to actually run a high-performing business that requires engines, transmissions and people. And we really haven't seen any deflation in those things. \nOperator: Our next question comes from a line of Arun Jayaram with JP Morgan.\nArun Jayaram: Hey Jeff, maybe just a follow-up to David's question. One question we get is, how do softer conditions called in the spot market influence pricing on your dedicated fleets or as you start some of your price negotiations on 2024 in North America? \nJeff Miller: Well look, I think that \u2013 you know again, we've got a little exposure to the spot as I described. I would say broadly, as we look ahead, high-performance, high-quality services really matter and we see a lot of bifurcation there and we're going to continue with our e-fleet rollout, which is sort of a whole different category of service. It's actually lower cost or better performance for our clients, but also lowers our total cost of ownership. And so I would say we're planning to deliver high-quality service and we really don't see any point in burning up equipment with no margins, that's not a good direction. It actually has longer-lasting impacts if surface equipment isn't taken care of. \nArun Jayaram: Okay, fair enough. And Jeff, I wanted to get your thoughts on offshore. Obviously, one of the trends the market has been observing is just strength in offshore markets. Could you talk about how it's positioned from a product line perspective offshore and what you're seeing perhaps in the Gulf of Mexico to mitigate maybe some of the risk of lower activity in North America? \nA - Jeff Miller: Well look, we're heavily levered towards the offshore business. In fact, all of our service lines participate in our offshore business and we've got leading positions in cementing and HCT. You know our drilling business, we've talked a lot about where we're going with drilling and Wireline and so that's an important business for us. It is higher service intensity, which means that it takes more equipment to do and so we really like that.  I expect the Gulf of Mexico continues to strengthen. And again, we talked about last quarter, sort of the percentage of our offshore international business anyway as a percentage continues to grow. And so I think that the offshore business is going to be very important for Halliburton, and the Gulf of Mexico and all around the world.\nOperator: Our next question comes from a line of James West with Evercore ISI. \nJames West: Hey! Good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Eric.\nJeff Miller: Morning. \nEric Carre: Good morning, James. \nJames West:\n-:\nJeff Miller: Look, it's not a perfect science in terms of one-in, one-out, but it\u2019s generally one-in, one-out over time. And so the type of equipment for example that we would retire is typically higher cost to maintain, and so when we retire a fleet, we sort of blow the parts back into the current fleet and that lowers the cost or improves the margins of the existing fleet.  But we're replacing \u2013 say replacing \u2013 we're adding equipment only as it's demanded by clients, so that's the difference. We're not building it to replace it. We're building it for contracts where there is commitment to return the capital and also the return on capital inside of the contract, and so that's what's driving the pace of replacement. \nJames West: Okay, okay, that makes sense. And then on the international and particularly offshore side, as these rigs are mobilizing and getting set up, governments, signing contracts, etc., and the companies your customers are sourcing, the Service Equipment and Service Products, what's the conversation like with them around pricing and kind of \u2013 or is there even really much of a concern about pricing, because they just need to get the equipment? \nJeff Miller: Well, I think that we're seeing pricing moving up, whether it comes in the form of a tender or a dialogue, and a lot of that is around tightness, it's also around efficiency and performance of our equipment. We've just done a lot to structurally overhaul and technically overhaul a lot of our drilling business and I talked a bit about some of the Wireline things that we're doing, so you know. The dialogue is certainly price is up and it comes in a few forms, whether it's a negotiation or a discussion or in some cases we call and say we just don't have it, which is again, driving prices up. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta : Yes, thanks so much. Jeff, maybe I\u2019ll start with you to talk a little bit about return of capital to shareholders and I'll let you go anywhere you want with this. You did buy back $250 million worth of stock in the quarter and you've been pretty steady in terms of that dividend coming back to shareholders as well. As you think about the repurchase program, how aggressive do you intend to be? Do you view this as more of a radical program versus \u2013 or an opportunistic one? \nJeff Miller: Look, I think that we've committed to return at least 50% free cash flow back to shareholders. The reality is it's going to be more than that. I think what we do is we build a base case around what we return to shareholders and then we're able to flex up from that and I think that's you know some of what you're seeing. Eric, do you want to add to that? \nEric Carre: I think it\u2019s \u2013 you covered it well, I think. The \u2013 I mean, the main focus in the organization right now is to continue to generate free cash flow. That's really the first priority, and ensure that we have enough and actually we're generating enough free cash flow right now to continue to buyback share, but also to continue to work and further strengthen our balance sheet. So, if we look forward, we intend to do both, even though the buyers right now is clearly on continuing to buy back more shares. \nNeil Mehta : Thanks Eric and the follow up is for you. It's just, I hear you made some comments around this in the script, but any Q3 considerations you want us as a market to keep in mind as we think about and building this sequential model into next quarter.\nEric Carre: No, I think we covered it in the prepared remark and Jeff mentioned it, as well as you look throughout the remainder of the year. I know there's a lot of question on North America, so maybe I'll repeat what we indicated, which is H2 is going to be a little lower than H1 for North America. Q3 is a bit down compared to Q2 and we're expecting Q4 to be flat relative to Q3, considering there were some holidays and seasonality as well. So you combine that with the guidance by division and I think it gives you a really good perspective on how we see the second half of the year unfolding. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. \nScott Gruber : Yes, I wanted to say on the second half outlook, typically frac activity does slow down into the holiday season. But the gas forward curve is actually quite encouraging today Jeff. As you mentioned in your conversation earlier, the conversations with clients today, are they suggesting that they are going to bring back some gas completion activity later this year or is that more likely to wait until next year, after the budget reset process? \nJeff Miller: Look, I think that \u2013 I'm not going to try to call tops and bottoms, I'll let others do that. But I think that, the outlook I described for 2024 is consistent with what you just described and so when we see that, I don't have precision around the date. But there's no question that gas is firming up and that there'll be LNG takeaway and that the gas market will be busy.  It's a question of the date, but I expect that build in \u201824, could it come sooner? Obviously, it could and I would say oil price is quite constructive today as well, which may bring some smaller players back into the market. But all of these things structurally from a cycle standpoint are very, very positive and as I look at \u201824, sometime between now and there, we see improving activity. \nScott Gruber : Got it. That makes sense. Yes, and I did want to touch on the oil side as well. Obviously last year well productivity was down and that was starting this conversation around the need just to drill more wells to kind of offset that productivity loss. This year we do seem to be at maybe a localized plateau on well productivity on the oil side in the U.S.  But is that part of the conversation here with customers that you know over time that they are going to have to be drilling more wells in the U.S. given that productivity decline? Is that kind of top of mind as they kind of start to think about \u201824 needs or is that a kind of off the horizon still? \nJeff Miller: No, I mean let me frame that differently. I think that this is my point around service intensity, meaning it takes more work to produce the same over time unless there are step changes in terms of either efficiency or insight. And so, we talk about our smart fleet offering quite often, but the reality is that's part of our technology portfolio to help customers better understand productivity of rock and where the frac is going and how to design fracs that can be more productive over time, so I think that's an important step.  But there is no question when we think about North America and we even saw that during the COVID when the pace at which North America declined following sort of the near slowdown or near stoppage in North America and so I think those are well understood by the market and our clients.  And so when I think about the way forward in North America, that features in it and is clearly part of our view as to why (a) there'll be more activity over time, even to stand still, and further why e-fleets in our case are so valuable, because they really do help clients achieve better productivity and lower costs. So I think that that's one of the reasons we're so focused on that and I think that's how it plays out. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler. \nLuke Lemoine : Hey! Good morning, Jeff and Eric. \nJeff Miller: Morning, Luke. \nLuke Lemoine : Jeff \u2013 Morning! Jeff, nice job on that North America margins in 2Q, I mean those flat, and you talked about those remaining strong for the balance of the year. It kind of sounded like you're not expecting these to be materially different from the first half. Is that correct? \nJeff Miller: That's correct. \nLuke Lemoine : Okay. And then Eric, 2Q D&E margins for better inter guide. Can you maybe walk us through what changed relative to your expectations? \nEric Carre: Yes, I think, I mean there's a lot of moving parts in the D&E margins. I think we just delivered better across the board in most product lines and in all of the regions. There's really not a lot more to say about that solid execution from all product lines across the globe. \nLuke Lemoine : Okay, got it. Thanks a bunch. \nOperator: Our next question comes from a line of Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. \nStephen Gengaro : Hi! Can you hear me? \nJeff Miller: Yes. \nEric Carre: Yes. \nStephen Gengaro : Oh, sorry. I got cut-off. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Two things to me, the first is, we've written and we've heard from others that, the consolidation in the U.S. frac business and then just the better behavior by you and many others has led to a different dynamic in the business. I\u2019m just curious, as you've seen a little bit of obviously rig count softness and frac spreads have come off a bit, are you seeing \u2013 can you visibly see any different approach to pricing across the industry yet? Is it too early to tell? Just curious if there's any proof of concepts here yet? \nJeff Miller: Look, I think there is quite different, and I think it's different along a couple of dimensions. Number one, quite different in the sense of the type of equipment that we are putting into the market with e-fleet. So that's a very different dynamic than we've seen in the past. And I think that the, pull for those from customers is meaningful and so that's one key difference.  And I think from the other perspective, the bifurcation and performance is an important point. And I think that we've seen quite a difference in our performance and that still matters. In fact, that matters a lot. And I think that, sort of the overall \u2013 we've always replaced our equipment, invested in our equipment and technology. But I think that, the idea that equipment runs in perpetuity or that it can be run to the ground and then somehow rebuild does not realistic. And so I think there's some understanding around that today that there probably wasn't before. \nStephen Gengaro : Thank you. And when you \u2013 you touched on this a little bit earlier, but when we hear from E&Ps and just industry data in general, that well quality is curating a bit. Is that a net positive you think for the completion side of your business? How do you think about the impact that has or is it kind of too gradual to really jump out? \nJeff Miller: Yes look, I mean, what that drives is more technology and more service intensity, both. I mean, that's the upshot of what you just described for our customers and we see that. And so we're \u2013 you know like you said, I'm quite confident about \u2013 I'm confident in North America's contribution to the overall oil and gas supply for the world. It's important and sustaining mass going to require investment and a lot of technology and a lot of just repetitions.  So I think it's not very well for Halliburton. \nOperator: Our next question comes from a line of Marc Bianchi with Cowen. \nMarc Bianchi : Hi! I just want to ask one more on sort of the North America outlook for the back half. I know it's been asked several times, but just because so many people seem to be focused on that. I think people are surprised by fourth quarter being flat quarter-over-quarter and margins seemingly holding in. Would you anticipate that overall the profit for Halliburton or the EPS should be flat to up in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter? \nJeff Miller: Yes. I mean, we're not going to guide Q4, but directionally everything is intact. \nMarc Bianchi : Yes. Okay, great. Thanks for that Jeff. The other one I had is just a bit of a modeling question on the corporate line for you, Eric, because we've got this new software element that we need to include. So if I take those two together, the corporate plus the software, it looks like we should be something in the mid-80\u2019s of a negative number and then that should be sort of on a $20 million to $25 million run rate beyond third quarters. Is that the right way to think about that software impact. \nEric Carre: Yes, I mean we guided the two separately, so as to give you clarity as to what they are. So we guided corporate going into Q3 to be $5 million to $10 million up from Q2, that's essentially a timing issue. We were a bit under guidance in Q2, so that gives you the corporate number. And then in terms of SAP which we guided as a separate line, we guided to $20 million or about $0.02 and what we'll do on that one, we give you the yearly number so $50 million this year, $100 million next year, $100 million the following year, so you can kind of run your models on the yearly basis and then we'll give you more color quarter-to-quarter. Because some of it depends on how the rollout is happening right. So we want to do that on a quarter to quarter basis. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with Benchmark.\nKurt Hallead: Hey! Good morning Jeff and everybody. Hey Jeff, I'm kind of curious. On the international front right, just are you seeing the prospect of maybe an acceleration in an activity whether that be in the Middle East or Latin America, maybe relative to the beginning part of the year.  I know that there is some questions about the OPEC production cuts, and that may be having a negative impact on activity. But I'm kind of curious as to whether that \u2013 you know there's a situation in the Middle East where there's a greater sense of urgency and maybe a push to move some projects a little more quickly. \nJeff Miller: OPEC cuts absolutely do not have an impact on activity. I\u2019m being crystal clear around that. These are customers with plans that are meeting global demand and it is unrelated to cuts and OPEC.  I would say that the growth, I wouldn't describe it as an acceleration, I would describe it as continued growth, and that's very positive. That's a good thing, because that's consistent with the long duration nature of this cycle. So it's not a spike to come at some point in time in the future to then level out. I think what we're going to continue to see is steady growth in activity, kind of like we've seen. Although does the pace pick up? It might some in fits and starts as big projects get started.  But I think overall, this is a great setup for Halliburton in terms of timing and pacing and absolutely consistent with how we see the length of the cycle. Meaning, it's going to take quite a period of time as barrels are invested in and reinvestment is made. \nKurt Hallead: Okay, that's great. I appreciate that color. Now, maybe then focusing again on the North American market, you've given some clear deep expectations on what you see there. With the fact that you guys are getting rid of older equipment, focusing on e-fleet, you mentioned a couple of long-term contracts. How do you see the prospects for Halliburton to continue to outpace the market if the market is just going to be flat? \nJeff Miller: Well, I think I've described what we're going to do and I think that sort of the \u2013 we\u2019re focused on what we're doing in terms of \u2013 you mentioned e-fleet, but that's an important thing, and that's an important opportunity for Halliburton, it's somewhat unique for Halliburton.  I also believe that it's \u2013 as I look out into the future, as I said I see, we talked to extensively about service intensity and technology and I think both of those are going to be very high demand as we get into \u201924, and I would say for what we do, it's an high demand now. And so you know, I think the long term for North America clearly points towards what we do uniquely at Halliburton and so I feel pretty confident about that. \nOperator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Jeff Miller for closing remarks. \nJeff Miller : Yes, thank you and thank you all for participating in today's call. Let me close out the call with this. Halliburton delivered an impressive first half of 2023 and I fully expect that the execution of our strategy in this long duration up cycle will deliver better returns, more free cash flow and more cash to shareholders.  I look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Please close out the call.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Eric Carre",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Before I begin the financial review, I'd like to discuss one item. In the second quarter, we kicked off our SAP S4 upgrade and recorded a $13 million expense, or about $0.01 per diluted share, in our Q2 operating results. Future expenses will be both included in our operating results and in our quarterly guidance. Here are a few more details on the upgrade.  This upgrade will take place over the next 2.5 years, concluding around Q4, 2025. We expect it to provide efficiencies, cost savings, and advanced analytics that will benefit Halliburton and our customers. The total project investment should be approximately $250 million, $50 million this year, and $100 million in each of the next two years. Upon completion, we expect significant ongoing savings, which will pay back the investment in about three years.  Now, let me move on to our quarterly results. Our second quarter reported net income per diluted share was $0.68. Excluding the effect of the transaction in Argentina, our adjusted net income per diluted share was $0.77.  Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.8 billion, a 2% sequential increase, while operating income was $1 billion, a sequential increase of 4%. Operating margin for the company was 17.4% in the second quarter, a 329 basis points increase over second quarter of 2022 adjusted operating margin. These results were primarily driven by strong international activity across both divisions, along with improved pricing.  Beginning with our completion and production division, revenue in the second quarter was $3.5 billion, a 2% sequential increase, while operating income was $707 million, an increase of 6% sequentially. C&P delivered an operating income margin of 20%. These results were due to increased activity from multiple product lines in international markets and higher artificial lift activity in North America.  In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in the second quarter was $2.3 billion, a sequential increase of 2%, while operating income was $376 million, a sequential increase of 2%. D&E delivered an operating income margin of 16%. These results were driven by higher drilling activity and increased fluid services in key regions including Middle East and Latin America, partially offset by seasonal roll-off of software sales across multiple regions.  Now, let's move on to geographic results. Our second quarter international revenue increased 7% sequentially due to solid product sales, activity increases and pricing gains across multiple product lines. These results were impacted by lower software sales in the eastern hemisphere.  In North America, revenue in the second quarter was $2.7 billion, a 2% decrease sequentially. This decline was primarily driven by decreased stimulation activity in U.S. land, partially offset by increased artificial lift activity in U.S. land and higher activity across multiple product service lines in the Gulf of Mexico.  Latin America revenue in the second quarter was $994 million, a 9% increase sequentially, resulting from higher completion tool sales in Brazil and improved activity across multiple product service lines in Mexico and Argentina. Partially offsetting this increase is reduced activity in the Caribbean across multiple product service lines.  Europe/Africa revenue in the second quarter was $698 million, a 5% increase sequentially. This improvement was primarily driven by increased fluid services across the region and higher completion tool sales in Angola and Norway.  Middle East/Asia revenue in the second quarter was $1.4 billion, a 6% increase sequentially, largely resulting from higher completion tool sales in Saudi Arabia and higher Wireline activity, drilling services, and stimulation activity in the region. This improvement was partially offset by decreased project management activity in Saudi Arabia.  Moving on to other items. In the second quarter, our corporate and other expenses was $59 million. For the third quarter, we expect our corporate expenses to increase by about $5 million to $10 million.  As noted earlier, in the second quarter we spent $13 million or about $0.01 per diluted share on SAP S4 migration, which is included in our operating results. For the third quarter, we expect these expenses to be approximately $20 million or about $0.02 [ph] per diluted share.  Net interest expense for the quarter was $92 million. The increase this quarter was primarily related to the reduction of interest income as a result of the Argentina transaction. For the third quarter, we expect this expense to remain approximately flat. Other net expense for the quarter was $32 million. For the third quarter, we expect this expense to remain approximately flat.  Our effective tax rate for the second quarter came in at approximately 21.3%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our third quarter effective tax rate to increase by approximately 50 basis points. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $303 million. We anticipate that for the full year, capital expenditure will be approximately 6% of our revenue. Our second quarter cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion and free cash flow was $798 million. We expect to generate free cash flow for the full year 2023; that is 30% to 40% higher than last year. Finally, we repurchased $248 million of our common stock during the second quarter.  Now, turning to our near-term operational outlook. Let me provide you with some comments on how we see the third quarter unfolding. In our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to be essentially flat with the second quarter and margins to remain approximately flat. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate sequential revenue to increase in the low single digits and margins to increase 25 to 75 basis points.  I will now turn the call back to Jeff. Good morning, James. I think it's \u2013 you covered it well, I think. The \u2013 I mean, the main focus in the organization right now is to continue to generate free cash flow. That's really the first priority, and ensure that we have enough and actually we're generating enough free cash flow right now to continue to buyback share, but also to continue to work and further strengthen our balance sheet. So, if we look forward, we intend to do both, even though the buyers right now is clearly on continuing to buy back more shares. No, I think we covered it in the prepared remark and Jeff mentioned it, as well as you look throughout the remainder of the year. I know there's a lot of question on North America, so maybe I'll repeat what we indicated, which is H2 is going to be a little lower than H1 for North America. Q3 is a bit down compared to Q2 and we're expecting Q4 to be flat relative to Q3, considering there were some holidays and seasonality as well. So you combine that with the guidance by division and I think it gives you a really good perspective on how we see the second half of the year unfolding. Yes, I think, I mean there's a lot of moving parts in the D&E margins. I think we just delivered better across the board in most product lines and in all of the regions. There's really not a lot more to say about that solid execution from all product lines across the globe. Yes. Yes, I mean we guided the two separately, so as to give you clarity as to what they are. So we guided corporate going into Q3 to be $5 million to $10 million up from Q2, that's essentially a timing issue. We were a bit under guidance in Q2, so that gives you the corporate number. And then in terms of SAP which we guided as a separate line, we guided to $20 million or about $0.02 and what we'll do on that one, we give you the yearly number so $50 million this year, $100 million next year, $100 million the following year, so you can kind of run your models on the yearly basis and then we'll give you more color quarter-to-quarter. Because some of it depends on how the rollout is happening right. So we want to do that on a quarter to quarter basis."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Jeff Miller",
            "content": "Thank you, David, and good morning everyone. In the second quarter Halliburton once again delivered strong results driven by service quality, outstanding execution and strong global demand for high quality and high performance oilfield services. Let's get right to the highlights.  Total company revenue increased 14% year-over-year. Operating income grew 41% compared to second quarter of 2022 adjusted operating income. International revenue grew 17% year-over-year with strong activity in all markets. North America revenue grew 11% year-over-year.  Our Completion and Production division revenue grew 19% year-over-year, while margins expanded by 320 basis points. Our Drilling and Evaluation division revenue grew 7% year-over-year, while margins expanded nearly 300 basis points. Finally, we generated $1.1 billion of cash from operations, $798 million of free cash flow, and repurchased approximately $250 million worth of shares during the quarter.  Halliburton delivered an impressive first half of 2023. I'd like to thank our employees for these outstanding results. Thank you for executing on our mainstays and strategy delivery.  Now, let's turn to what I see in the markets and what I believe is driving this multi-year upcycles duration. Demand for oil and gas is strong as demonstrated by demand growth of 2 million barrels per day in the first half of the year compared to the same period last year. Oil and gas continues to demonstrate its critical role in the global economy and meeting long term demand requires sustained capital investment.  Commodity prices remain attractive. When I talk to customers they expect to work more, not less, and many of their activity plans extend into the next decade. Customers are settling in for a long duration upcycle. Overall, I expect upstream spending to grow in 2023 and beyond. For this year, I expect International and North America customer spending growth in the high teens and around 10% respectively compared to last year, despite reduced rig count and completion activity in the U.S.  Now let's start with our performance in the international markets. Revenue in the second quarter grew 17% compared to the same period of last year with strong activity across both divisions. Today more than 20% of our tender pipeline represents incremental activity, which is as high as I can recall.  Equally important, in addition to strong growth in the Middle East and Latin America, we see steady growth in activity across the globe. In this environment, I expect quality services and equipment to remain tight and pricing to continue to improve.  Halliburton's strategy is to deliver a profitable international growth. We are clear in how we do this, through differentiated technology offerings, selective contract wins, and a unique collaborative approach to working with our customers. Our differentiated technology and digital portfolio deliver high quality and high performance to our customers in all markets. Here are some examples.  Our drilling and LWD technology platforms deliver better reliability, data capture, and efficiency for our customers, while structurally expanding our margins. We build and deploy leading-edge drilling equipment that requires less capital to build and operate, compared to the prior generation of equipment. One example, for a customer in the Middle East, Halliburton achieved a world record for the longest well ever drilled, with a measured depth of over 51,000 feet, using Halliburton's iCruise, iStar and LOGIX Technologies.  Our leading position in Completions Technology is unlocking production for customers. We recently set another world record with the successful installation of the first 12 ZONE intelligent completion for a Middle East offshore customer using Halliburton's SmartWell technology on our eCompletions Platform. In our digital business, Equinor joins several other customers in selecting Landmark's DecisionSpace 365 as their standard subsurface data interpretation tool.  During the second quarter, our Landmark software business closed on the acquisition of Resoptima, a leader in advanced ensemble modeling at the reservoir level. I'm excited about Resoptima's technology, both standalone and how it accelerates Landmark's roadmap for next-generation reservoir modeling technology.  Now, turning to collaboration. Our value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers and our mainstay processes define how we consistently differentiate our services. This is the source of our competitive advantage. Our value proposition creates an environment where our customers and Halliburton collectively perform better.  A recent example of this is Halliburton and Va\u030ar Energi's announcement of a long-term strategic relationship for drilling services. I expect we will demonstrate with Va\u030ar, as we have with other customers, that our collaborative approach creates significantly better operational and financial performance for both the customer and Halliburton.  Our international strategy works. Our differentiated, cost-effective technologies and collaborative approach with customers empower us to strategically target work where we see a competitive advantage and a clear path to outperform financially.  Turning to North America, we delivered a solid quarter. North America revenue grew 11% versus the same period last year, and margins were sequentially flat versus the last quarter. Looking ahead into the second half, I expect overall market activity in North America will be slightly lower than in the first half.  More importantly, I expect Halliburton's North America margins to remain strong for the balance of the year. Our results in North America clearly demonstrate the success of our strategy to maximize value. We do this through capital efficiency, differentiated technology, and alignment with high-quality customers.  During our last call, I outlined the steps we took in North America land to maintain pricing and deploy service capacity to attractive return opportunities or retire old equipment to further accelerate Halliburton's transition to our electric fleets. Executing on our strategy during the second quarter, we deployed additional Zeus fleets on multi-year contracts, while retiring additional diesel equipment.  Demand for our Zeus e-fleets is strong. In fact, during the second quarter we signed more multi-year Zeus contracts than in any prior quarter. The multi-year duration of these contracts provides both stability and secure economic returns, which furthers my confidence in the strength of our margins. I continue to be impressed by the performance of our Zeus e-fleets and the optimization and efficiencies that come with scale. Our current system is the result of multiple iterations over several years and our continuous improvement processes. Every element of the value chain, from design and manufacturing to operations and maintenance, is continuously improved. Our advances in pump technology and system design result in higher horsepower density and pump efficiency.  With Octave, we are automating equipment operation for consistency and reliability. We work to be the best at getting better. Today, Zeus is a fully integrated system. We deliver new equipment on time that works right out of the box and on average this year our e-fleets pumped over 10% more hours than our high-performance diesel fleets.  For our customers, these improvements mean better performance and even lower total cost of ownership. For Halliburton, these improvements mean we further widen the moat around our growing e-fleet business. In all markets, international and North America, I believe our strategies yield improved financial results.  Let's look at the steady growth and margin expansion in D&E. This is the result of a structural change and technology overhaul that began several years ago.  Our leading drilling platforms are lower cost and higher performance than the prior generation, which drives higher asset velocity and higher returns. In our testing business, our FloConnect Surface well testing service provides a safe, efficient, and automated platform to our customers, while lowering our overall operating costs. In our Wireline business, our Xaminer platform provides high quality reservoir data, reduces subsurface uncertainty, and allows us to win high-value exploration work.  Finally, across all product lines, automation and remote operations are beginning to transform service delivery, driving higher quality and reliability, while lowering total cost of service delivery. Looking through any quarterly fluctuations and seasonality, I fully expect D&E margins will continue to expand over time. Our strategy also generates strong free cash flow, and our capital return framework returns cash to our shareholders. I expect over 50% of free cash flow will be returned to shareholders this year.  I am pleased with where we are today. In the last 18 months we retired $1.2 billion of debt, strengthening our balance sheet; twice increased our quarterly dividend, which forms the stable foundation of our capital return framework; and finally, repurchased approximately $600 million worth of shares, including approximately $250 million this quarter. I fully expect that the execution of our strategy in this long duration upcycle will deliver better returns, more free cash flow, and more cash back to shareholders.  Now, I'll turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric. Thanks, Eric. Let me summarize our discussion today. Our international business is growing at a strong pace across all regions. I expect our differentiated technology offerings, selective contract wins, and our unique collaborative approach to working with our customers to deliver higher international margins and growth for Halliburton.  Our strategy to maximize value in North America is driven by capital efficiency, differentiated technology and alignment with high-quality customers. I expect this will allow us to generate solid financial performance. I expect that the execution of our strategy in this long-duration upcycle will deliver better returns, more free cash flow, and more cash back to shareholders.  And now, let's open it up for questions. Well look, I think that \u2013 you know again, we've got a little exposure to the spot as I described. I would say broadly, as we look ahead, high-performance, high-quality services really matter and we see a lot of bifurcation there and we're going to continue with our e-fleet rollout, which is sort of a whole different category of service. It's actually lower cost or better performance for our clients, but also lowers our total cost of ownership. And so I would say we're planning to deliver high-quality service and we really don't see any point in burning up equipment with no margins, that's not a good direction. It actually has longer-lasting impacts if surface equipment isn't taken care of. Morning. Look, it's not a perfect science in terms of one-in, one-out, but it's generally one-in, one-out over time. And so the type of equipment for example that we would retire is typically higher cost to maintain, and so when we retire a fleet, we sort of blow the parts back into the current fleet and that lowers the cost or improves the margins of the existing fleet.  But we're replacing \u2013 say replacing \u2013 we're adding equipment only as it's demanded by clients, so that's the difference. We're not building it to replace it. We're building it for contracts where there is commitment to return the capital and also the return on capital inside of the contract, and so that's what's driving the pace of replacement. Well, I think that we're seeing pricing moving up, whether it comes in the form of a tender or a dialogue, and a lot of that is around tightness, it's also around efficiency and performance of our equipment. We've just done a lot to structurally overhaul and technically overhaul a lot of our drilling business and I talked a bit about some of the Wireline things that we're doing, so you know. The dialogue is certainly price is up and it comes in a few forms, whether it's a negotiation or a discussion or in some cases we call and say we just don't have it, which is again, driving prices up. Look, I think that we've committed to return at least 50% free cash flow back to shareholders. The reality is it's going to be more than that. I think what we do is we build a base case around what we return to shareholders and then we're able to flex up from that and I think that's you know some of what you're seeing. Eric, do you want to add to that? Look, I think that \u2013 I'm not going to try to call tops and bottoms, I'll let others do that. But I think that, the outlook I described for 2024 is consistent with what you just described and so when we see that, I don't have precision around the date. But there's no question that gas is firming up and that there'll be LNG takeaway and that the gas market will be busy.  It's a question of the date, but I expect that build in \u201824, could it come sooner? Obviously, it could and I would say oil price is quite constructive today as well, which may bring some smaller players back into the market. But all of these things structurally from a cycle standpoint are very, very positive and as I look at \u201824, sometime between now and there, we see improving activity. No, I mean let me frame that differently. I think that this is my point around service intensity, meaning it takes more work to produce the same over time unless there are step changes in terms of either efficiency or insight. And so, we talk about our smart fleet offering quite often, but the reality is that's part of our technology portfolio to help customers better understand productivity of rock and where the frac is going and how to design fracs that can be more productive over time, so I think that's an important step.  But there is no question when we think about North America and we even saw that during the COVID when the pace at which North America declined following sort of the near slowdown or near stoppage in North America and so I think those are well understood by the market and our clients.  And so when I think about the way forward in North America, that features in it and is clearly part of our view as to why (a) there'll be more activity over time, even to stand still, and further why e-fleets in our case are so valuable, because they really do help clients achieve better productivity and lower costs. So I think that that's one of the reasons we're so focused on that and I think that's how it plays out. Morning, Luke. That's correct. Yes. Look, I think there is quite different, and I think it's different along a couple of dimensions. Number one, quite different in the sense of the type of equipment that we are putting into the market with e-fleet. So that's a very different dynamic than we've seen in the past. And I think that the, pull for those from customers is meaningful and so that's one key difference.  And I think from the other perspective, the bifurcation and performance is an important point. And I think that we've seen quite a difference in our performance and that still matters. In fact, that matters a lot. And I think that, sort of the overall \u2013 we've always replaced our equipment, invested in our equipment and technology. But I think that, the idea that equipment runs in perpetuity or that it can be run to the ground and then somehow rebuild does not realistic. And so I think there's some understanding around that today that there probably wasn't before. Yes look, I mean, what that drives is more technology and more service intensity, both. I mean, that's the upshot of what you just described for our customers and we see that. And so we're \u2013 you know like you said, I'm quite confident about \u2013 I'm confident in North America's contribution to the overall oil and gas supply for the world. It's important and sustaining mass going to require investment and a lot of technology and a lot of just repetitions.  So I think it's not very well for Halliburton. Yes. I mean, we're not going to guide Q4, but directionally everything is intact. OPEC cuts absolutely do not have an impact on activity. I'm being crystal clear around that. These are customers with plans that are meeting global demand and it is unrelated to cuts and OPEC.  I would say that the growth, I wouldn't describe it as an acceleration, I would describe it as continued growth, and that's very positive. That's a good thing, because that's consistent with the long duration nature of this cycle. So it's not a spike to come at some point in time in the future to then level out. I think what we're going to continue to see is steady growth in activity, kind of like we've seen. Although does the pace pick up? It might some in fits and starts as big projects get started.  But I think overall, this is a great setup for Halliburton in terms of timing and pacing and absolutely consistent with how we see the length of the cycle. Meaning, it's going to take quite a period of time as barrels are invested in and reinvestment is made. Well, I think I've described what we're going to do and I think that sort of the \u2013 we're focused on what we're doing in terms of \u2013 you mentioned e-fleet, but that's an important thing, and that's an important opportunity for Halliburton, it's somewhat unique for Halliburton.  I also believe that it's \u2013 as I look out into the future, as I said I see, we talked to extensively about service intensity and technology and I think both of those are going to be very high demand as we get into '24, and I would say for what we do, it's an high demand now. And so you know, I think the long term for North America clearly points towards what we do uniquely at Halliburton and so I feel pretty confident about that. Yes, thank you and thank you all for participating in today's call. Let me close out the call with this. Halliburton delivered an impressive first half of 2023 and I fully expect that the execution of our strategy in this long duration up cycle will deliver better returns, more free cash flow and more cash to shareholders.  I look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Please close out the call."

            "name": "A - Jeff Miller",
            "content": "Hey! Certainly. And look, I'm as confident as I have ever been in the duration, the long duration of this cycle. And that's rooted in attractive commodity price and really the growth in demand for oil, so I'll start there.  I think the offshore piece of this, we're super excited about it. If we include Gulf of Mexico, we're eclipsing 50% of our revenues internationally are offshore, and so all of our service lines are represented there.  I think the cadence as I look over the next year, let's say year or so, I mean it just takes time to get this work underway. I'm just back from a trip and we were looking at projects that, you know they have to get rigs, get plans, get agreement from governments, but it's starting and I expect it continues to build into \u201824 and beyond. I mean, these are the kinds of projects that take a decade to do and so... You know Middle East, I see the same thing. The number of rigs being mobilized in the Middle East, that takes some time to do. But we are beginning to see it. We are seeing it, but my view is that we'll continue to build over the next 12 or 24 months.  Coming back to North America, I gave you an outlook on the second half of the year. But I think what's most important is, when I look into \u201824, I mean commodity markets are getting more constructive, oil prices firming up, gas seems to have found its footing you know and expect that ramps. We're seeing some consolidation with customers and that means that bigger customers do more planning through the cycle. They are committed to executing plans over a longer term and service intensity in North America never lets up. In fact, it only gets harder and you can't \u2013 you got to \u2013 you got to work harder just to stand still. So all of this is constructive for Halliburton's business as I look out into \u201824 and beyond. And you know, and some of that in North America, I mean just that it's backed up by the pace of e-fleet contracts that we're seeing. We've had more contracts last quarter. We've even signed another one this quarter, and that's really for work that starts in \u201824 and goes \u201824, \u201825, \u201826. So, there are a lot of reasons that I see \u201824 looking super strong for us. Well, I think that \u2013 you know I've told you what we're doing, which is retiring older equipment and transitioning to electric and so I think that's an important factor. We really don't see, we don't participate in the bottom part of that market particularly at all, really where that's the spot type market. Most of our work, I'd say over 70% of our work is with large privates and publics and so \u2013 you know these are customers that execute their plans and they do execute their plans.  And from our perspective, the performance \u2013 we continue to see our performance improving, okay, even as we add electric, but also even on our diesel fleets. And differentiated service performance, technology is getting better. I mean those are things that drive not only margins, but they are also part of the dialogue around what's it take to actually run a high-performing business that requires engines, transmissions and people. And we really haven't seen any deflation in those things. Well look, we're heavily levered towards the offshore business. In fact, all of our service lines participate in our offshore business and we've got leading positions in cementing and HCT. You know our drilling business, we've talked a lot about where we're going with drilling and Wireline and so that's an important business for us. It is higher service intensity, which means that it takes more equipment to do and so we really like that.  I expect the Gulf of Mexico continues to strengthen. And again, we talked about last quarter, sort of the percentage of our offshore international business anyway as a percentage continues to grow. And so I think that the offshore business is going to be very important for Halliburton, and the Gulf of Mexico and all around the world."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Coleman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDavid Coleman : Hello, and thank you for joining the Halliburton first quarter 2023 conference call. We will make the recording of today's webcast available on Halliburton's website after this call.  Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Carre, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings.  We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our first quarter earnings release and in the quarterly results and presentation section of our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Miller : Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Halliburton's performance in the first quarter again demonstrated the earnings power of our strategy, strong competitive position and execution for our customers. Here are some highlights from the first quarter. Total company revenue increased 33% compared to the first quarter of 2022 with strong activity in both North America and international markets. Operating income grew 91% year-over-year.  Operating margin was 17%, a strong start to the year and 530 basis points over the first quarter of last year. International revenue grew 23% year-over-year with strong activity in all markets. North America revenue grew 44% year-over-year with growth across every basin. The Completion and Production division posted 20% margins, an increase of nearly 700 basis points year-over-year. The Drilling and Evaluation division grew revenue 17% year-on-year while margins expanded more than 100 basis points. Before we continue, I'd like to recognize the employees of Halliburton for their outstanding execution on every dimension of our business. safety, service quality and financial results. The work you do each day matters to our customers and shareholders. Thank you. I'll start with a few comments on the macro. Everything I see today validates the strength and duration of this multiyear upcycle. The world requires more energy from all sources, including oil and gas, driven by population growth and economic development.  Multiple years of structural underinvestment in oil and gas supply can only be addressed by strong activity over the next several years. The commodity price volatility experienced in the first quarter does not change our view of customer demand and a tight services market. Our customers around the world recognize this, and we expect their spending to grow in 2023 and beyond. Further, we expect much of this investment will be directed towards development activity, which is great for Halliburton as it drives outsized demand for our products and services. My view of this up cycle is confirmed by what I hear from our customers and see in the world's oil and gas markets. The Halliburton outlook for both the current year and the long term is strong. Now let's start with our performance in the international markets.  Our revenue in the first quarter grew 23% compared to the same period of last year, reflecting strong activity in all regions. Halliburton executed its strategy to deliver profitable international growth through leading technology offerings, improved pricing and disciplined capital allocation. I expect international spending to grow high teens for the year 2023, with most new activity coming from the Middle East, Asia and Latin America. I am confident in this outlook because we have a strong pipeline of awards that will commence later this year and beyond. Our completion tool order book grew 40% year-on-year in the first quarter, which generally represents work delivered within the current year. And finally, pricing continues to trend up for all product lines in all regions. I'm excited about all segments of our international business. Today, I'd like to provide more color on our offshore business. We generated nearly 45% of our international revenue in the first quarter from our offshore business.  Here are a few examples of differentiated technologies that drive a higher level of performance, service quality and reliability for our customers. Halliburton's intelligent drilling and logging while drilling platforms, iCruise and iStar in combination with LOGIX, our automation platform, delivered the longest reservoir section in a single run for a customer offshore Norway. Our latest wireline imaging technology, STRATA Examiner, delivered high resolution, borehole imaging data, allowing a customer to increase reserve estimates during a recent exploration campaign in the Mediterranean Sea. Halliburton's digital solutions allow our customers to reduce cost per barrel and increase efficiencies. Hess, Repsol and Petrobras, all recently selected Halliburton Landmark's DecisionSpace 365 applications powered by iEnergy Cloud. Our trusted science and machine learning algorithms enable customers to optimize subsurface, well construction and production-related decisions. Cognitive Halliburton's offshore automated cementing system delivers cement jobs remotely with minimal human direction and intervention. More than 30 cement jobs were completed this quarter in the North Sea alone.  Finally, I'm excited about the progress of our TechnipFMC alliance on all electric completions. I believe this technology will over time, substantially change the cost and performance of deepwater completions and subsea infrastructure. As I look at 2023 and beyond, I am excited about our international business. Our customers are clearly motivated to produce more oil and gas. Service capacity is tight and pricing is increasing. Our differentiated technologies and our execution drive margin improvements and growth across our international business. Turning to North America. As I expected, Halliburton achieved strong results despite volatile commodity prices. We delivered on our strategic priority to maximize value in North America through capital efficiency, differentiated technology and alignment with high-quality customers. I know it's on your minds. So let me briefly discuss the natural gas markets. First, I firmly believe that the gas market softness will be solved the 6 billion cubic feet per day of additional LNG export capacity comes online in the next 24 months. Second, in response to market conditions, we are moving 3 fleets from gas basins to oil basins to satisfy specific customer demands.  Finally, we retired 1 Tier 2 diesel fleet which will reduce our near-term maintenance costs and accelerate Halliburton's transition to e-fleets. These actions reduced our gas market exposure by about 30% and maintain financial returns. I reiterate my expectation that North America customer spending will grow at least 15% in 2023. At today's oil prices, I believe that our customers will execute their activity plans and the market for highly efficient equipment and quality services will remain tight. Our strategy is to maximize value in North America. Let me be crystal clear about what that looks like. First, we improved the performance and utilization of our existing fleet and we align with high-quality customers who value our operational efficiency and consistent execution. Here's what the customers are telling me. Halliburton's performance is different, not only better than your competitors, but even better than your own past performance.  Our step change in performance, safety and operational efficiency comes from our investments in new technologies, crew training and process improvements. As a result, today, we see a 60% improvement in pumping utilization across our entire North America land fleet since 2019. Second, we only deploy service capacity to attractive return opportunities. We are always finding ways to improve average fleet returns.  Finally, we invest in differentiated products and services that improve margins and asset velocity. Our patented Zeus e-fleet and SmartFleet are examples they maximize asset values for our customers and structurally improve returns for Halliburton. Our Zeus e-fleets continue to outperform for our customers and smart fleet adoption is accelerating. We delivered about 6x more smart fleet stages in the first quarter than a year ago. Halliburton's position and outlook in North America is strengthened by the uptake and contract duration of our e-fleets. The contracting structure for e-fleets, which we only deploy on multiyear contracts and our technology road map for the future, create structural strength in Halliburton's North America business. Halliburton's e-fleet technology is proven to deliver better performance, lower total cost of ownership and increased operating efficiency.  For customers with the mandate to produce barrels over the long term, and maximize the value of their investment dollars, the attraction to e-fleets is self-evident. To summarize, I believe Halliburton is uniquely positioned to deliver financial outperformance, our strong execution culture, differentiated technology portfolio and collaborative approach with customers give us a strong competitive advantage. I am confident that we will execute our strategic priorities and deliver shareholder returns by maximizing value in North America, delivering profitable international growth and driving capital efficiency. Before I turn it over to Eric, I'd like to leave you with 2 financial points. First, given my outlook, I expect the execution of our strategy will deliver significant and growing free cash flow. Second, while our previously announced capital return framework provides a minimum of 50% free cash flow back to shareholders, it also gives us the flexibility to return more cash to shareholders in the form of share buybacks. Everything I see today points towards more cash to shareholders.  Now I'll turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric?\nEric Carre : Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Let me begin with a summary of our first quarter results. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.7 billion, a 33% increase over the first quarter of last year while operating income was $977 million, an increase of 91% year-over-year. Operating margin for the company was 17.2% in the first quarter which is an increase of 530 basis points over the first quarter of 2022. These results were primarily driven by increased global activity, improved pricing and strong seasonal product and software sales. Our first quarter reported net income per diluted share was $0.72, which more than doubled from the same period last year. Beginning with our Completion and Production division, revenue in the first quarter was $3.4 billion, a 45% increase when compared to the first quarter of 2022 while operating income was $666 million, an increase of 125% when compared to the first quarter of 2022. C&P delivered an operating income margin of 20%, driven by increased activity, improved pricing and service efficiency in North America. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in the first quarter was $2.3 billion, an increase of 17% when compared to the first quarter of 2022, while operating income was $369 million an increase of 26% when compared to the first quarter of 2022. D&E delivered an operating income margins of 16% and driven by strong wireline, testing and drilling-related services globally and an uptick in international activity. Now let's move on to geographic results. Our first quarter international revenue increased 23% year-over-year due to solid product sales, activity increases and pricing gains across multiple product lines. In North America, revenue in the first quarter was $2.8 billion, a 44% increase when compared to the first quarter of 2022. This increase was primarily driven by increased stimulation activity and efficiencies, higher activity across our well construction product lines in North America land as well as higher activity across multiple product lines in the Gulf of Mexico. Latin America revenue in the first quarter was $915 million, a 40% increase when compared to the first quarter of 2022 due to increased well construction services and stimulation activity in Mexico and Argentina, and higher completion tool sales across the region. Europe Africa revenue in the first quarter was $662 million, a 2% decrease when compared to the first quarter of 2022 as a result of the sale of our Russian operations, along with decreased activity across multiple product service lines in Norway. This decrease was partially offset by increased well construction services and stimulation activity throughout Africa. Middle East Asia revenue in the first quarter was $1.3 billion, a 30% increase when compared to the first quarter of 2022 primarily due to improved activity across multiple product service lines in Saudi Arabia, higher completion tool sales, improved well construction services and increased project management activity across the region. Now I'd like to cover some additional financial items. In the first quarter, our corporate and other expenses was $58 million. For the second quarter, we expect our corporate expenses to be up about $5 million. Net interest expense for the quarter was $79 million. For the second quarter, we expect this expense to be about flat. Other net expense for the quarter was $69 million, primarily related to unfavorable foreign exchange movements. For the second quarter, we expect this expense to decline approximately $15 million. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter came in at approximately 21%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our second quarter effective tax rate to increase about 50 basis points. Capital expenditure for the first quarter were $268 million. We anticipate that our remaining capital expenditures will increase quarter-over-quarter into the end of the year and total capital expenditures to be approximately 6% of our revenue for the full year. Our first quarter cash flow from operations was $122 million, and free cash flow was a use of $105 million. These results were primarily driven by seasonal investments in working capital. As is typical for our business, we anticipate our cash flow will be back-end loaded for the year. We expect to generate strong free cash flow for the rest of 2023. As a step toward achieving Halliburton's capital return policy of returning at least 50% of annual free cash flow to shareholders, we repurchased approximately $100 million of common stock during the first quarter. Finally, turning to our near-term operational outlook. Let me provide you with some comments on how we see the second quarter unfolding. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect the seasonal revenue decline in software sales to be partially offset by further improvements in global drilling activity. As a result, we anticipate sequential D&E revenue to increase low to mid-single digits and margins to decline 50 to 100 basis points. In the Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to increase low to mid-single digits and margins to improve 25 to 75 basis points.  I will now turn the call back to Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Thanks, Eric. Let me summarize our discussion today. Halliburton's performance in the first quarter demonstrated the earnings power of our strategy. My outlook for Halliburton is strong. I expect international year-on-year growth in the high teens North America growth in excess of 15%. And finally, everything I see today points towards more cash to shareholders. And now let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dave Anderson with Barclays.\nDave Anderson : So let's just get right into it. Despite the strong numbers you put up in North America this quarter and the guide for second quarter, we kind of firmed up everything. The bear case has been heating up during the quarter with the rig count softening a bit. A&P suggesting pricing is poised to come down. On the other hand, we're hearing from you, other service companies that you don't see this slowdown. In fact, prices continue to rise. I wonder if you help kind of help us start up the disconnect here. Does the difference line to customer mix? I know you highlighted the gas market and particularly weak. Is the differentiation of equipment just a lot of rhetoric keep during the quarter. I'm just wondering how we should be thinking about your U.S. land activity and the pricing trends in the second half.\nJeff Miller: Yes. Well, thanks, Dave. Look, prices aren't moving down. And I think from our comments, I've told you what we've done and what we plan to do. Overall margin improvement comes from structurally bifurcated market, as you described, demand for high-quality services are very much in demand and hard to deliver. And quite frankly, the cost of the frac hasn't changed. I mean the engines are moving up. There's still inherent inflation in the frac business today. So there's not a connection there. And so as I look out at the rest of the year, we continue to improve the earnings power of our fleet through bifurcation, delivery of these fleets, retirement of -- it needs to be retired, be clear, not stacked, but retired. And then finally, efficiency and sort of repositioning around better pricing.\nDave Anderson : But pricing in your mind, continues to move higher. And I would assume that pricing from last year still continue to roll through your fleets?\nJeff Miller: I would say on average. Yes.\nDave Anderson : And if I could just shift gears over on the international side, your Middle East business doesn't get a ton of credit on the street, despite actually being just as big as kind of 1 of your bigger peers on a relative sense, I was wondering if you could talk about how you see the pace of activity progressing this year in the Middle East. Are you still ramping up on contracts? I think you had kind of alluded to that in your prepared remarks, but what is -- also what is your outlook on tenders in the Middle East this year? And I guess, finally, should we expect to see a lift in D&E margins next year based upon what you're seeing in pricing activity levels this year in the Middle East?\nJeff Miller: Yes. Look, pricing is improving. And so -- and I would expect D&E margins to improve along with that. I would still argue early innings of activity increase in the Middle East I'm pleased with our growth. So thank you for pointing that out. But I see this continuing rig counts aren't necessarily at near peak. And I think we've got a lot of opportunity to continue to run. And then broadly, international, it's beyond the Middle East, pleased with the growth that we saw in the first quarter. And just a reminder to to everyone that in Q1 of '22, Russia was 2% of our business. And so that's really pretty strong growth.\nOperator: We have a question from Arun Jayaram with JP Morgan.\nArun Jayaram: Jeff, just digesting service prints and outlooks thus far, we are seeing or observing more resilient conditions in U.S. frac versus drilling. I wanted to get your thoughts on why do you think this is the case? And how do you see things playing out in terms of your drilling-related segments at Sperry in North America over the balance of the year?\nJeff Miller: Yes. Look, I think wells drilled in North America really a function of DUC count. So as the DUCs get drawn down, more wells have to be drilled. And so I think fluctuation in drilling. And it's interesting that you see fluctuation in drilling, but a very steady march in terms of frac. And I think some of that is managing cost at the margin. but the fact is they don't produce more without fracking wells. And so I'm not surprised to see that. I think our D&E business in North America remains strong. confident on what we're seeing there. We continue to sort of make gains in the drilling part of the business. And I would say the other service lines are very strong.\nArun Jayaram: Great. Great. And just my follow-up, Jeff, you mentioned that you have some sort of relationship with FTI on the electric side. I was wondering if you could maybe give us some more details on that partnership?\nJeff Miller: Yes. Look, this is an opportunity to mine what the 2 companies really do well. And they're particularly areas where we overlap, and we're taking advantage of that. We've been working on a series of things and 1 of which is all electric completions for about 5 years is -- and we just signed up for another 5 years with TSMC. So great partner in this area. What we've delivered ultimately will be, I think, a revolutionary all-electric solution. They really only -- it takes the 2 of us to solve for, it's not the bulk of either 1 of our businesses. But the fact is in this narrow space, we bring some really unique synergies and opportunity to develop technology. And so very pleased with the relationship and the progress that we're making up to and including we're jointly marketing and selling some solutions today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James West with Evercore ISI.\nJames West: So Jeff, I know you spend, guys, probably 60-plus percent of your time on the road seeing customers and a lot of that -- the majority of that internationally could you maybe describe the customer conversations at this point where they are with their sense of urgency, where the pushback is, if any, with pricing? Or is there more concern about availability is kind of how we're thinking about the cycle as it takes off from here. And just curious to hear what you're hearing on the ground.\nJeff Miller: Yes. Thanks, James. The discussion is more around availability than anything else. Whether it's services that we provide capital more importantly, availability of tools and people. And a lot of the planning, we're even doing planning today -- I mean, deep planning today for '24 activity that we expect to ramp up and so there's enough concern around availability in '24 that significant resources are committed now to solving for that. So I've got a lot of confidence in the runway internationally and the amount of work that we've won.\nJames West: Okay. That's great. That's good to hear. And then on North America, the 15% plus growth that you're anticipating in forecasting for this year -- is there -- how much -- I guess, could you describe how much of that you think is just kind of the pure inflation in the market, whether it's rig rates or fractured costs, that kind of stuff versus rig count or activity led growth?\nJeff Miller: Yes, James. It's -- I think it's a combination of the 2 and certainly the more activity you have, the more sort of replacing type you see. But if I just sort of look back to look forward, if I take last year, 5% production growth last year, year-on-year translated into about 50% revenue growth for us. I know in '23, the outlook is for, let's say, 3 production growth. And I think published estimates at least today around operator CapEx or 17% or so. I think it says a couple of things. Number one, producing oil doesn't get easier, meaning it demands more of our services and higher quality services. And so I'm confident that we're going to maximize value in North America. And I think that combination of activity and and price is what delivers the north of 15%.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read: Congrats on the quarter there. Just a couple of things to follow up on, Jeff. Your comment in the opening about 45% of your international coming from offshore and obviously talking a little bit about planning for '24, which greater visibility on offshore, a lot of times than others. I was just curious how you see that potentially changing. Does it increase as a percentage of mix? And how should we think about that in terms of enhanced visibility, top line growth and maybe margin expansion?\nJeff Miller: Yes. Thanks. Look, I'm pleased with the growth on a percentage basis of our position in offshore or the amount of offshore work that we're doing. Look, I think it continues to grow and I expect our position as we continue to bring out the types of technologies I talked about continue to help drive our growth in offshore work. And so we are levered heavily to offshore, and this is all service lines or levered to offshore. And I think that as we see that business grow, I expect, yes, it does translate into top line growth and margin growth. And I think that what's clear though, also is it higher service intensity, but it also requires more equipment to do offshore work. So it has a bit of a double effect in terms of growing revenues and margins, but it also tightens up the rest of the business by virtue of consuming backup tools and additional shifts of people. And so as offshore grows, that has a tightening effect really on everything, which again, helps to drive better margins and better growth.\nRoger Read: Okay. And then mine related follow-up on that. You mentioned the Smart frac had picked up quite a bit in the U.S. I think it was up 6x roughly versus a year ago. Any thoughts to what that growth rate is going forward? And should we anticipate sort of any change in terms of margins as that goes forward, positive, negative or unchanged?\nJeff Miller: Yes. Look, I think that, that growth continues at sort of that pace. This is 1 of those solutions that is very affordable and scalable and provides important data to operators particularly as the focus becomes productivity per foot. And so this is really the best way, maybe the only way to meaningfully measure where the sand goes. And as a result of that, that's the building block of what produces more of what's better complexity, where is the sand, what's the most efficient solution. And so I expect that continues to grow at a very fast pace and we've continued to introduce more technology around that solution so that it's easier to deploy and ultimately -- this is 1 of those things that our target is to be the most efficient solution in the marketplace. And as it scales, it becomes more valuable to us and in my view, it's a very sticky solution because it's 1 of those things that once you have that data, and it becomes part of a working process, then it becomes very sticky over time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta : First question is about the comments about moving 3 frac fleets from gas to oil basins. Can you talk about whether you see more potential for this to happen? What are some of the switching costs associated with that? And is this the beginning of a greater trend?\nJeff Miller: Well, look, I think what we demonstrated is that's what we're going to do. Clearly, gas economics are challenged today. And I don't think it's something that service prices solve. And so I think gas is incredibly important, and I expect that it continues. But -- and even get stronger as we build into the LNG capacity that gets built here in the U.S. But along the way, we see opportunities for unmet demand in oil, and we've made the moves we described. We also want to accelerate our fleet as a percentage of our overall fleet, which requires that we retire fleets along the way. And so from our perspective, that is the path that we take. Now I think it's -- gas operators are continuing to operate, and they are working and really to that end, actually just placed an e-fleet into a gas basin with an operator. So there's clearly an outlook that gas recovers.\nNeil Mehta : And then can you talk about the return of capital comments. You had mentioned you could see a scenario where you go in excess of the 50% of free cash flow back to shareholders. So Talk about how you're thinking about using the buyback as a tool to create value.\nJeff Miller: Well, as I described, our outlook is strong. I expect we generate a lot of free cash flow. And yes, I believe that as we do that, we'll be able to return more cash to shareholders. And so we took a step in Q1. But obviously, the ability to the flex there is going to be with share buybacks.\nOperator: We have a question from Scott Gruber from Citi.\nScott Gruber: Just to understand that same line of inquiry given the appetite to go above the 50% threshold, Jeff, is there an appetite to pursue buybacks with bigger here near term when the stock is is quite attractively priced? Or do you wait until the cash flows show up later this year and risk buying at a higher price if the fundamentals stay tied as you foresee?\nEric Carre: Yes, Scott, it's Eric. So generally speaking, how we think about cash returns today is -- I mean, obviously, we just raised the dividend. We intend to continue to do small bolt-on acquisition, technology-driven type acquisition, continue to chip at the debt as well as we go along. But clearly, today, the bias is towards increasing buyback as we go through the year. So yes, directionally, that's correct.\nScott Gruber: Got it. And then an unrelated follow-up. I'm just looking at your year-on-year incrementals in D&E, and they appear quite strong. And I would guess this is largely driven by operating leverage and mix around offshore and technology, just given previous commentary. And I would guess pricing is less impactful today at this juncture with potentially more of a price contribution in the years ahead. Is that a fair assessment? Or is pricing having a significant impact here already in 2Q if you look year-on-year at D&E margins?\nJeff Miller: Well, pricing certainly has improved year-on-year. But I think more importantly is the the depth of the technology that we're introducing is sort of the duration. And I don't want to get away from that. It's not a point in time. I think we've got pricing improving, but at the same time, we've got substantial capital efficiency happening also in terms of the technology. So the -- we've been pretty clear about the technology that we are investing in is driving capital efficiency, which means that we capture more of the value and cash flow over time. And so I would expect to see the margin improvement that you saw this quarter year-on-year to continue in terms of incrementals. And I say it that way. I've always said that our expectation is that we stack improvement each quarter in terms of margins in D&E. And expect that to continue to happen. Obviously, there's some intra-year cyclicality. But I think the key is if we look at each year by quarter, then we ought to be stacking improvements quarter-on-quarter. And I think we've got a long runway ahead of us in D&E.\nScott Gruber: But it just sounds like it's more of the kind of structural investments you made around technology and driving your asset turns and mix more than pricing today. Is that fair, Jeff?\nJeff Miller: Yes, I think that is reasonable to say.\nOperator: We have a question from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nChase Mulvehill : Jeff. I guess maybe if we can kind of hit on free cash flow. If we think about your outlook, your North America outlook was maintained. And it looks like you kind of bumped up your international outlook so I'm guessing that it would probably imply a bump to your free cash flow outlook. I think last quarter, you said free cash flow should grow at least 20%, which seemed conservative when you gave it so with a better international outlook and still maintain North America. Any updates on how we should be thinking about 2023 free cash flow?\nEric Carre: Yes, This -- it's Eric. So directionally, as you said, we're very confident in the outlook of the business, the kind of profile of free cash flow. Typically, we're going to start generating meaningful free cash flow in Q2 and in H2 as we're done with the buildup of working capital we did in Q1. And directionally, -- you're right. Our outlook right now is more north of 30%, then it was 20% in Q1. So yes, we're revising our projections up.\nChase Mulvehill : Okay. Awesome. And then unrelated follow-up, you highlighted a lot of digital wins in your press release and also in your prepared remarks today. So question around this, and are you starting to see more digital adoption by your customers? And if so, what's been the catalyst for accelerated adoption I'm going to give this 1 to try and in any chance that you could speak to how material digital revenues are today for Halliburton?\nJeff Miller: Yes. I think the adoption is going to always be around business cases and what creates value for customers. And I think the idea that we're just going to go digital has started and stopped because it was proven unsuccessful. And so what we see is now more meaningful adoption around real solutions, software solutions and automation solutions -- it is a big business, but it's not one -- it's one that's sort of spread throughout the business as well. And so I think that we tend to think about it in 2 buckets. We tend to think about it as software is 1 activity and automation as another. And both are generated sort of from the same technical capacity by that, I mean the capacity to do software at scale, a lot of that resident and Landmark, the software business sort of being 1 thing and then the automation, which is many of the same tools maybe buy differently throughout the rest of the business. And it has a meaningful effect on our performance margin outlook, it's going to have -- it will continue to do that. Even in our offshore in the drilling business in terms of automation of the drilling tools can do and probably equally onshore North America in terms of what we can do with frac fleets from a maintenance and performance standpoint. It's not something we necessarily advertise, but it's very inherent in the type of performance and efficiency that we see today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler.\nLuke Lemoine: Jeff you reached your international growth outlook this year from at least mid-teens to high teens. Can you unpack this a little bit? And maybe just talk about what's changed, what's accelerating and what you have more confidence in?\nJeff Miller: Yes. I think I have more confidence in number -- well, really 3 things. One, the indicators that we're looking at things like completion tool order book, which has grown meaningfully and that all focuses on this year. I would say, pricing sort of improvement that we're seeing, pricing and tightness around equipment around the world internationally is another meaningful one. And then finally, just we're winning awards and we're growing. We're selective about the awards we're winning. Again, our strategy is profitable international growth. emphasizing the profit part of that statement. But at the same time, we are seeing success and we're seeing success in a lot of different markets. And so because of that, we see a path to sort of high teens.\nLuke Lemoine: Got it. Good deal. And then maybe on the geo market, you touched on the Middle East growth earlier, but could you expand on what you're seeing in Asia and Latin America for the balance of the year?\nJeff Miller: Yes. I'm seeing Asia, again, pick up, particularly in terms of development type work, which is obviously right there in our wheelhouse. And then also in Latin America, clearly, we see activity growth in Brazil. But really throughout the region, we see the imperative to produce more oil and gas. And clearly, oil and gas is an important part of the economies of Latin America. And so there's a lot of motivation to be more effective and to deliver more oil and gas, partly for economic reasons and for tax revenues. But I think I'm really encouraged by what we see.\nOperator: We have a question from Stephen Gengaro with Stifel.\nStephen Gengaro: So curious, when we look at U.S. pressure pumping world, a lot of the competitors have expanded services at the well site. I mean going through all things from vertical integration to well site integration. How are you seeing it from your eyes as far as how it impacts how, how it impacts pricing and your profitability in the business at the wellsite.\nJeff Miller: Well, we view all of this very strategically in the sense of we're looking at returns, long-term returns and where we create value in terms of competitive advantage. And so we don't -- vertical integration for the sake of vertical integration, in my view, is not necessarily creating more value, what we're doing in the frac space and really, in every business that we're in is focused on where do we create technical differentiation. So what our creates competitive advantage for Halliburton. And so when I think about what we've done with electric fleets, what we've done with the smart fleet really meaningful things. The inputs to the business are the inputs to the business and those are may be good businesses for others. But there are places where we create competitive advantage. So for that reason, it's not just how much volume can we capture around the wellbore. It's really where can we capture volume and create competitive advantage. And so I like where we are in our approach to it.\nStephen Gengaro: And then just as a quick follow-up, are you seeing tightness in sand? And is that a profit center for you and any material movements in that over the last couple of quarters?\nA \u2013Jeff Miller: No. Not a lot of movement in the last few quarters. And again, I view it like all inputs to our business. It\u2019s going to fluctuate at different times, different levels. There\u2019s a lot of sand in the world, and it\u2019s quite available. So I don\u2019t view that as a long-term impediment to anything that we\u2019re trying to do just given the availability and really how to go about producing it.\nOperator: And that's all the time we have for questions. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Jeff Miller for any closing remarks.\nJeff Miller : Yes. Thank you, and thank you all for participating in today's call. Let me close out the call with just a couple of comments. First, Halliburton's performance in the first quarter demonstrated the earnings power of our strategy. And then secondly, my outlook for Halliburton is strong and everything I see today points towards more cash to shareholders. I look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Let's close out the call. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Eric Carre",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Let me begin with a summary of our first quarter results. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.7 billion, a 33% increase over the first quarter of last year while operating income was $977 million, an increase of 91% year-over-year. Operating margin for the company was 17.2% in the first quarter which is an increase of 530 basis points over the first quarter of 2022. These results were primarily driven by increased global activity, improved pricing and strong seasonal product and software sales. Our first quarter reported net income per diluted share was $0.72, which more than doubled from the same period last year. Beginning with our Completion and Production division, revenue in the first quarter was $3.4 billion, a 45% increase when compared to the first quarter of 2022 while operating income was $666 million, an increase of 125% when compared to the first quarter of 2022. C&P delivered an operating income margin of 20%, driven by increased activity, improved pricing and service efficiency in North America. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in the first quarter was $2.3 billion, an increase of 17% when compared to the first quarter of 2022, while operating income was $369 million an increase of 26% when compared to the first quarter of 2022. D&E delivered an operating income margins of 16% and driven by strong wireline, testing and drilling-related services globally and an uptick in international activity. Now let's move on to geographic results. Our first quarter international revenue increased 23% year-over-year due to solid product sales, activity increases and pricing gains across multiple product lines. In North America, revenue in the first quarter was $2.8 billion, a 44% increase when compared to the first quarter of 2022. This increase was primarily driven by increased stimulation activity and efficiencies, higher activity across our well construction product lines in North America land as well as higher activity across multiple product lines in the Gulf of Mexico. Latin America revenue in the first quarter was $915 million, a 40% increase when compared to the first quarter of 2022 due to increased well construction services and stimulation activity in Mexico and Argentina, and higher completion tool sales across the region. Europe Africa revenue in the first quarter was $662 million, a 2% decrease when compared to the first quarter of 2022 as a result of the sale of our Russian operations, along with decreased activity across multiple product service lines in Norway. This decrease was partially offset by increased well construction services and stimulation activity throughout Africa. Middle East Asia revenue in the first quarter was $1.3 billion, a 30% increase when compared to the first quarter of 2022 primarily due to improved activity across multiple product service lines in Saudi Arabia, higher completion tool sales, improved well construction services and increased project management activity across the region. Now I'd like to cover some additional financial items. In the first quarter, our corporate and other expenses was $58 million. For the second quarter, we expect our corporate expenses to be up about $5 million. Net interest expense for the quarter was $79 million. For the second quarter, we expect this expense to be about flat. Other net expense for the quarter was $69 million, primarily related to unfavorable foreign exchange movements. For the second quarter, we expect this expense to decline approximately $15 million. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter came in at approximately 21%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our second quarter effective tax rate to increase about 50 basis points. Capital expenditure for the first quarter were $268 million. We anticipate that our remaining capital expenditures will increase quarter-over-quarter into the end of the year and total capital expenditures to be approximately 6% of our revenue for the full year. Our first quarter cash flow from operations was $122 million, and free cash flow was a use of $105 million. These results were primarily driven by seasonal investments in working capital. As is typical for our business, we anticipate our cash flow will be back-end loaded for the year. We expect to generate strong free cash flow for the rest of 2023. As a step toward achieving Halliburton's capital return policy of returning at least 50% of annual free cash flow to shareholders, we repurchased approximately $100 million of common stock during the first quarter. Finally, turning to our near-term operational outlook. Let me provide you with some comments on how we see the second quarter unfolding. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect the seasonal revenue decline in software sales to be partially offset by further improvements in global drilling activity. As a result, we anticipate sequential D&E revenue to increase low to mid-single digits and margins to decline 50 to 100 basis points. In the Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to increase low to mid-single digits and margins to improve 25 to 75 basis points.  I will now turn the call back to Jeff. Yes, Scott, it's Eric. So generally speaking, how we think about cash returns today is -- I mean, obviously, we just raised the dividend. We intend to continue to do small bolt-on acquisition, technology-driven type acquisition, continue to chip at the debt as well as we go along. But clearly, today, the bias is towards increasing buyback as we go through the year. So yes, directionally, that's correct. Yes, This -- it's Eric. So directionally, as you said, we're very confident in the outlook of the business, the kind of profile of free cash flow. Typically, we're going to start generating meaningful free cash flow in Q2 and in H2 as we're done with the buildup of working capital we did in Q1. And directionally, -- you're right. Our outlook right now is more north of 30%, then it was 20% in Q1. So yes, we're revising our projections up."

            "name": "Jeff Miller",
            "content": "Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Halliburton's performance in the first quarter again demonstrated the earnings power of our strategy, strong competitive position and execution for our customers. Here are some highlights from the first quarter. Total company revenue increased 33% compared to the first quarter of 2022 with strong activity in both North America and international markets. Operating income grew 91% year-over-year.  Operating margin was 17%, a strong start to the year and 530 basis points over the first quarter of last year. International revenue grew 23% year-over-year with strong activity in all markets. North America revenue grew 44% year-over-year with growth across every basin. The Completion and Production division posted 20% margins, an increase of nearly 700 basis points year-over-year. The Drilling and Evaluation division grew revenue 17% year-on-year while margins expanded more than 100 basis points. Before we continue, I'd like to recognize the employees of Halliburton for their outstanding execution on every dimension of our business. safety, service quality and financial results. The work you do each day matters to our customers and shareholders. Thank you. I'll start with a few comments on the macro. Everything I see today validates the strength and duration of this multiyear upcycle. The world requires more energy from all sources, including oil and gas, driven by population growth and economic development.  Multiple years of structural underinvestment in oil and gas supply can only be addressed by strong activity over the next several years. The commodity price volatility experienced in the first quarter does not change our view of customer demand and a tight services market. Our customers around the world recognize this, and we expect their spending to grow in 2023 and beyond. Further, we expect much of this investment will be directed towards development activity, which is great for Halliburton as it drives outsized demand for our products and services. My view of this up cycle is confirmed by what I hear from our customers and see in the world's oil and gas markets. The Halliburton outlook for both the current year and the long term is strong. Now let's start with our performance in the international markets.  Our revenue in the first quarter grew 23% compared to the same period of last year, reflecting strong activity in all regions. Halliburton executed its strategy to deliver profitable international growth through leading technology offerings, improved pricing and disciplined capital allocation. I expect international spending to grow high teens for the year 2023, with most new activity coming from the Middle East, Asia and Latin America. I am confident in this outlook because we have a strong pipeline of awards that will commence later this year and beyond. Our completion tool order book grew 40% year-on-year in the first quarter, which generally represents work delivered within the current year. And finally, pricing continues to trend up for all product lines in all regions. I'm excited about all segments of our international business. Today, I'd like to provide more color on our offshore business. We generated nearly 45% of our international revenue in the first quarter from our offshore business.  Here are a few examples of differentiated technologies that drive a higher level of performance, service quality and reliability for our customers. Halliburton's intelligent drilling and logging while drilling platforms, iCruise and iStar in combination with LOGIX, our automation platform, delivered the longest reservoir section in a single run for a customer offshore Norway. Our latest wireline imaging technology, STRATA Examiner, delivered high resolution, borehole imaging data, allowing a customer to increase reserve estimates during a recent exploration campaign in the Mediterranean Sea. Halliburton's digital solutions allow our customers to reduce cost per barrel and increase efficiencies. Hess, Repsol and Petrobras, all recently selected Halliburton Landmark's DecisionSpace 365 applications powered by iEnergy Cloud. Our trusted science and machine learning algorithms enable customers to optimize subsurface, well construction and production-related decisions. Cognitive Halliburton's offshore automated cementing system delivers cement jobs remotely with minimal human direction and intervention. More than 30 cement jobs were completed this quarter in the North Sea alone.  Finally, I'm excited about the progress of our TechnipFMC alliance on all electric completions. I believe this technology will over time, substantially change the cost and performance of deepwater completions and subsea infrastructure. As I look at 2023 and beyond, I am excited about our international business. Our customers are clearly motivated to produce more oil and gas. Service capacity is tight and pricing is increasing. Our differentiated technologies and our execution drive margin improvements and growth across our international business. Turning to North America. As I expected, Halliburton achieved strong results despite volatile commodity prices. We delivered on our strategic priority to maximize value in North America through capital efficiency, differentiated technology and alignment with high-quality customers. I know it's on your minds. So let me briefly discuss the natural gas markets. First, I firmly believe that the gas market softness will be solved the 6 billion cubic feet per day of additional LNG export capacity comes online in the next 24 months. Second, in response to market conditions, we are moving 3 fleets from gas basins to oil basins to satisfy specific customer demands.  Finally, we retired 1 Tier 2 diesel fleet which will reduce our near-term maintenance costs and accelerate Halliburton's transition to e-fleets. These actions reduced our gas market exposure by about 30% and maintain financial returns. I reiterate my expectation that North America customer spending will grow at least 15% in 2023. At today's oil prices, I believe that our customers will execute their activity plans and the market for highly efficient equipment and quality services will remain tight. Our strategy is to maximize value in North America. Let me be crystal clear about what that looks like. First, we improved the performance and utilization of our existing fleet and we align with high-quality customers who value our operational efficiency and consistent execution. Here's what the customers are telling me. Halliburton's performance is different, not only better than your competitors, but even better than your own past performance.  Our step change in performance, safety and operational efficiency comes from our investments in new technologies, crew training and process improvements. As a result, today, we see a 60% improvement in pumping utilization across our entire North America land fleet since 2019. Second, we only deploy service capacity to attractive return opportunities. We are always finding ways to improve average fleet returns.  Finally, we invest in differentiated products and services that improve margins and asset velocity. Our patented Zeus e-fleet and SmartFleet are examples they maximize asset values for our customers and structurally improve returns for Halliburton. Our Zeus e-fleets continue to outperform for our customers and smart fleet adoption is accelerating. We delivered about 6x more smart fleet stages in the first quarter than a year ago. Halliburton's position and outlook in North America is strengthened by the uptake and contract duration of our e-fleets. The contracting structure for e-fleets, which we only deploy on multiyear contracts and our technology road map for the future, create structural strength in Halliburton's North America business. Halliburton's e-fleet technology is proven to deliver better performance, lower total cost of ownership and increased operating efficiency.  For customers with the mandate to produce barrels over the long term, and maximize the value of their investment dollars, the attraction to e-fleets is self-evident. To summarize, I believe Halliburton is uniquely positioned to deliver financial outperformance, our strong execution culture, differentiated technology portfolio and collaborative approach with customers give us a strong competitive advantage. I am confident that we will execute our strategic priorities and deliver shareholder returns by maximizing value in North America, delivering profitable international growth and driving capital efficiency. Before I turn it over to Eric, I'd like to leave you with 2 financial points. First, given my outlook, I expect the execution of our strategy will deliver significant and growing free cash flow. Second, while our previously announced capital return framework provides a minimum of 50% free cash flow back to shareholders, it also gives us the flexibility to return more cash to shareholders in the form of share buybacks. Everything I see today points towards more cash to shareholders.  Now I'll turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric? Thanks, Eric. Let me summarize our discussion today. Halliburton's performance in the first quarter demonstrated the earnings power of our strategy. My outlook for Halliburton is strong. I expect international year-on-year growth in the high teens North America growth in excess of 15%. And finally, everything I see today points towards more cash to shareholders. And now let's open it up for questions. Yes. Well, thanks, Dave. Look, prices aren't moving down. And I think from our comments, I've told you what we've done and what we plan to do. Overall margin improvement comes from structurally bifurcated market, as you described, demand for high-quality services are very much in demand and hard to deliver. And quite frankly, the cost of the frac hasn't changed. I mean the engines are moving up. There's still inherent inflation in the frac business today. So there's not a connection there. And so as I look out at the rest of the year, we continue to improve the earnings power of our fleet through bifurcation, delivery of these fleets, retirement of -- it needs to be retired, be clear, not stacked, but retired. And then finally, efficiency and sort of repositioning around better pricing. I would say on average. Yes. Yes. Look, pricing is improving. And so -- and I would expect D&E margins to improve along with that. I would still argue early innings of activity increase in the Middle East I'm pleased with our growth. So thank you for pointing that out. But I see this continuing rig counts aren't necessarily at near peak. And I think we've got a lot of opportunity to continue to run. And then broadly, international, it's beyond the Middle East, pleased with the growth that we saw in the first quarter. And just a reminder to to everyone that in Q1 of '22, Russia was 2% of our business. And so that's really pretty strong growth. Yes. Look, I think wells drilled in North America really a function of DUC count. So as the DUCs get drawn down, more wells have to be drilled. And so I think fluctuation in drilling. And it's interesting that you see fluctuation in drilling, but a very steady march in terms of frac. And I think some of that is managing cost at the margin. but the fact is they don't produce more without fracking wells. And so I'm not surprised to see that. I think our D&E business in North America remains strong. confident on what we're seeing there. We continue to sort of make gains in the drilling part of the business. And I would say the other service lines are very strong. Yes. Look, this is an opportunity to mine what the 2 companies really do well. And they're particularly areas where we overlap, and we're taking advantage of that. We've been working on a series of things and 1 of which is all electric completions for about 5 years is -- and we just signed up for another 5 years with TSMC. So great partner in this area. What we've delivered ultimately will be, I think, a revolutionary all-electric solution. They really only -- it takes the 2 of us to solve for, it's not the bulk of either 1 of our businesses. But the fact is in this narrow space, we bring some really unique synergies and opportunity to develop technology. And so very pleased with the relationship and the progress that we're making up to and including we're jointly marketing and selling some solutions today. Yes. Thanks, James. The discussion is more around availability than anything else. Whether it's services that we provide capital more importantly, availability of tools and people. And a lot of the planning, we're even doing planning today -- I mean, deep planning today for '24 activity that we expect to ramp up and so there's enough concern around availability in '24 that significant resources are committed now to solving for that. So I've got a lot of confidence in the runway internationally and the amount of work that we've won. Yes, James. It's -- I think it's a combination of the 2 and certainly the more activity you have, the more sort of replacing type you see. But if I just sort of look back to look forward, if I take last year, 5% production growth last year, year-on-year translated into about 50% revenue growth for us. I know in '23, the outlook is for, let's say, 3 production growth. And I think published estimates at least today around operator CapEx or 17% or so. I think it says a couple of things. Number one, producing oil doesn't get easier, meaning it demands more of our services and higher quality services. And so I'm confident that we're going to maximize value in North America. And I think that combination of activity and and price is what delivers the north of 15%. Yes. Thanks. Look, I'm pleased with the growth on a percentage basis of our position in offshore or the amount of offshore work that we're doing. Look, I think it continues to grow and I expect our position as we continue to bring out the types of technologies I talked about continue to help drive our growth in offshore work. And so we are levered heavily to offshore, and this is all service lines or levered to offshore. And I think that as we see that business grow, I expect, yes, it does translate into top line growth and margin growth. And I think that what's clear though, also is it higher service intensity, but it also requires more equipment to do offshore work. So it has a bit of a double effect in terms of growing revenues and margins, but it also tightens up the rest of the business by virtue of consuming backup tools and additional shifts of people. And so as offshore grows, that has a tightening effect really on everything, which again, helps to drive better margins and better growth. Yes. Look, I think that, that growth continues at sort of that pace. This is 1 of those solutions that is very affordable and scalable and provides important data to operators particularly as the focus becomes productivity per foot. And so this is really the best way, maybe the only way to meaningfully measure where the sand goes. And as a result of that, that's the building block of what produces more of what's better complexity, where is the sand, what's the most efficient solution. And so I expect that continues to grow at a very fast pace and we've continued to introduce more technology around that solution so that it's easier to deploy and ultimately -- this is 1 of those things that our target is to be the most efficient solution in the marketplace. And as it scales, it becomes more valuable to us and in my view, it's a very sticky solution because it's 1 of those things that once you have that data, and it becomes part of a working process, then it becomes very sticky over time. Well, look, I think what we demonstrated is that's what we're going to do. Clearly, gas economics are challenged today. And I don't think it's something that service prices solve. And so I think gas is incredibly important, and I expect that it continues. But -- and even get stronger as we build into the LNG capacity that gets built here in the U.S. But along the way, we see opportunities for unmet demand in oil, and we've made the moves we described. We also want to accelerate our fleet as a percentage of our overall fleet, which requires that we retire fleets along the way. And so from our perspective, that is the path that we take. Now I think it's -- gas operators are continuing to operate, and they are working and really to that end, actually just placed an e-fleet into a gas basin with an operator. So there's clearly an outlook that gas recovers. Well, as I described, our outlook is strong. I expect we generate a lot of free cash flow. And yes, I believe that as we do that, we'll be able to return more cash to shareholders. And so we took a step in Q1. But obviously, the ability to the flex there is going to be with share buybacks. Well, pricing certainly has improved year-on-year. But I think more importantly is the the depth of the technology that we're introducing is sort of the duration. And I don't want to get away from that. It's not a point in time. I think we've got pricing improving, but at the same time, we've got substantial capital efficiency happening also in terms of the technology. So the -- we've been pretty clear about the technology that we are investing in is driving capital efficiency, which means that we capture more of the value and cash flow over time. And so I would expect to see the margin improvement that you saw this quarter year-on-year to continue in terms of incrementals. And I say it that way. I've always said that our expectation is that we stack improvement each quarter in terms of margins in D&E. And expect that to continue to happen. Obviously, there's some intra-year cyclicality. But I think the key is if we look at each year by quarter, then we ought to be stacking improvements quarter-on-quarter. And I think we've got a long runway ahead of us in D&E. Yes, I think that is reasonable to say. Yes. I think the adoption is going to always be around business cases and what creates value for customers. And I think the idea that we're just going to go digital has started and stopped because it was proven unsuccessful. And so what we see is now more meaningful adoption around real solutions, software solutions and automation solutions -- it is a big business, but it's not one -- it's one that's sort of spread throughout the business as well. And so I think that we tend to think about it in 2 buckets. We tend to think about it as software is 1 activity and automation as another. And both are generated sort of from the same technical capacity by that, I mean the capacity to do software at scale, a lot of that resident and Landmark, the software business sort of being 1 thing and then the automation, which is many of the same tools maybe buy differently throughout the rest of the business. And it has a meaningful effect on our performance margin outlook, it's going to have -- it will continue to do that. Even in our offshore in the drilling business in terms of automation of the drilling tools can do and probably equally onshore North America in terms of what we can do with frac fleets from a maintenance and performance standpoint. It's not something we necessarily advertise, but it's very inherent in the type of performance and efficiency that we see today. Yes. I think I have more confidence in number -- well, really 3 things. One, the indicators that we're looking at things like completion tool order book, which has grown meaningfully and that all focuses on this year. I would say, pricing sort of improvement that we're seeing, pricing and tightness around equipment around the world internationally is another meaningful one. And then finally, just we're winning awards and we're growing. We're selective about the awards we're winning. Again, our strategy is profitable international growth. emphasizing the profit part of that statement. But at the same time, we are seeing success and we're seeing success in a lot of different markets. And so because of that, we see a path to sort of high teens. Yes. I'm seeing Asia, again, pick up, particularly in terms of development type work, which is obviously right there in our wheelhouse. And then also in Latin America, clearly, we see activity growth in Brazil. But really throughout the region, we see the imperative to produce more oil and gas. And clearly, oil and gas is an important part of the economies of Latin America. And so there's a lot of motivation to be more effective and to deliver more oil and gas, partly for economic reasons and for tax revenues. But I think I'm really encouraged by what we see. Well, we view all of this very strategically in the sense of we're looking at returns, long-term returns and where we create value in terms of competitive advantage. And so we don't -- vertical integration for the sake of vertical integration, in my view, is not necessarily creating more value, what we're doing in the frac space and really, in every business that we're in is focused on where do we create technical differentiation. So what our creates competitive advantage for Halliburton. And so when I think about what we've done with electric fleets, what we've done with the smart fleet really meaningful things. The inputs to the business are the inputs to the business and those are may be good businesses for others. But there are places where we create competitive advantage. So for that reason, it's not just how much volume can we capture around the wellbore. It's really where can we capture volume and create competitive advantage. And so I like where we are in our approach to it. Yes. Thank you, and thank you all for participating in today's call. Let me close out the call with just a couple of comments. First, Halliburton's performance in the first quarter demonstrated the earnings power of our strategy. And then secondly, my outlook for Halliburton is strong and everything I see today points towards more cash to shareholders. I look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Let's close out the call. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2024 Halliburton Company Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I will pass the call over to the Senior Director of Investor Relations, David Coleman. Please go ahead.\nDavid Coleman: Hello, and thank you for joining the Halliburton third quarter 2024 conference call. We will make a recording of today's webcast available for seven days on Halliburton's website after this call. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO; and Eric Carre, Executive Vice President and CFO. Some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our third quarter earnings release and in the quarterly results and presentation section of our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin today's discussion with our highlights from the third quarter. We delivered total company revenue of $5.7 billion and adjusted operating margin of 17%. International revenue was $3.3 billion and grew by 4% year-over-year, led by Middle East Asia, which delivered an increase of 9%. North America revenue was $2.4 billion, a decrease of 9% year-over-year. Finally, during the third quarter, we generated $841 million of cash flow from operations, $543 million of free cash flow and repurchased approximately $200 million of our common stock. The August cybersecurity event has not had a material effect on our financial condition or operating results. However, that event, together with the effect of storms in the Gulf of Mexico, did reduce our adjusted earnings for the quarter by roughly $0.02 per share due to lost or delayed revenue. The cybersecurity event also had an impact on our free cash flow during the quarter due to delayed billing and collections and caused us to pause our share repurchase program while we assess the impact of the event. Importantly, our full year expectations for free cash flow and cash returned to shareholders remain unchanged, and we expect both to accelerate in the fourth quarter. Before we move on, I would like to take a moment and thank our employees for their extraordinary work while we navigated the cybersecurity event this quarter. Our employees maintained operational continuity under challenging conditions, and I celebrate their effort and grit as they work through the event. I would also like to extend my thanks and appreciation to our customers for their support and close collaboration through this time. Turning to our geographic results. I'll begin with the international markets where Halliburton's revenue grew 4% year-over-year, led by the Middle East Asia region. For the full year, I expect international revenue growth to be in line with the overall market and below our prior guidance. I am pleased with our performance and the continued growth of our business. Next year, directionally, we see international growth in the low- to mid-single digits. I'm encouraged by projects I see in the pipeline, and I am confident that Halliburton will deliver on these opportunities and create value for both us and our customers. My confidence comes from the strength of our largest international business lines, the depth of our technology portfolio, the breadth of our global reach and the power of our value proposition. Halliburton's largest international business lines, cementing, completion tools and drilling fluids form the backbone of oil and gas development spending globally and each is a leader in their market. We've earned these leadership positions through our legacy of execution, consistent service quality and our digital and technology developments. The transformation of our Sperry Drilling business clearly demonstrates the impact technology developments have on our business. The success of our organically developed iCruise and iStar directional drilling and logging tools, LOGIX automation and remote operation platform and ultra-deep resistivity and look ahead tools create a step change in Halliburton's international competitiveness and return profile. Year-to-date, Sperry has delivered the highest international revenue growth of any major product line. Further, Halliburton today is present in all major international basins as well as select frontier areas with promising future development potential. Our international business operates both on and offshore with roughly 50% of our revenue outside of North America land earned from offshore operations. Finally, our value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers drives our unique approach to creating value for our customers and Halliburton. Our collaborative approach wins with our customers and is exemplified by our alliances in the North Sea and elsewhere. These alliances have pioneered new ways of working to consistently deliver industry-leading performance on integrated projects. I am confident in our international business. I am confident because of the strength of our technology portfolio, our unique value proposition, our clear strategy, our experienced workforce and deep customer relationships. I expect that Halliburton's international franchise will continue to deliver growth and returns. Today, I would like to spend some time describing a few areas where I expect outsized international growth for Halliburton in 2025 and beyond. These are unconventionals, artificial lift and intervention. Two things are clear to me. One, unconventional developments are becoming more important, and I expect they will grow faster than other market segments over the next few years. Two, Halliburton is the clear leader in unconventionals, both in technology and execution, and I expect Halliburton to play the same leadership role internationally as we have in the U.S. We see evidence of this in the Middle East, where Halliburton was awarded a multiyear unconventional drilling services contract and started up an unconventional hydraulic fracturing fleet, both of which grow Halliburton's market share in a strategically important customer asset. Elsewhere in the region, we see several other growth opportunities for Halliburton in emerging unconventional plays. Turning to Halliburton's international artificial lift business, we saw over 30% year-on-year revenue growth this quarter, and we expect to continue to outgrow the market on the strength of our leading technology portfolio. One such technology is our TrueSync hybrid motor, which combines the reliability of an induction motor with the efficiency of a permanent magnet motor. Initially deployed in North America, we anticipate strong international demand, especially in Latin America and the Middle East, where its economic benefits can be realized at scale. Another key technology is our Intelevate service, which uses AI to process real-time data and remotely manage pumps for optimal performance. We saw a 50% increase in international wells monitored since the start of the year. In North America, Halliburton performed over 160,000 remote interventions this year, and we expect Intelevate to deliver similar value internationally as we expand our installed ESP base. Well intervention is another segment, I believe, will outgrow the overall market. We have seen this already with our Production Solutions product line, which this year alone has grown at twice the rate of our overall international business. Well intervention has long been an area of focus for Halliburton's organic investment and technology development. For example, Halliburton and alliance with TechnipFMC achieved the world's first riserless coiled tubing intervention service. This technology means Halliburton's full suite of subsea well intervention services can be deployed without the requirement for a riser equipped deepwater rig. Customers can now intervene in thousands of marginal or end-of-life offshore wells that otherwise could not be economically serviced. These are a few examples that describe the unique above-market growth opportunities we see for Halliburton. To summarize international markets, I am confident in the strength of our international business. I believe our technology portfolio, value proposition, and strategy will drive profitable growth in 2025. Turning to North America. Our third quarter revenue declined 4% compared to the second quarter, primarily due to lower hydraulic fracturing activity in U.S. land. I expect the combination of seasonality and budget exhaustion will result in a full year revenue decline at the low end of our prior guidance. Our strategy to maximize value in North America remains unchanged, and I expect we will continue to outperform our competitors. Here's how I expect to maximize value in North America as I look to 2025. In our Completion business, maximizing value means unique technology leading service quality and efficiencies and disciplined capital deployment. The success of this strategy is clear. And today, I am pleased that 90% of our fracturing fleets are committed for work in 2025, with multiple opportunities for the remaining 10%. Further, the unique completion technologies we deploy in this market are key differentiators for Halliburton and our customers. Together, they comprise the Zeus platform, electric pumping units, Octiv Auto Frac and Sensori subsurface measurement. Each of these technologies is commercial, and we are seeing accelerated adoption into customer workflows. This quarter, we signed contracts for two new e-fleets and also secured extensions on several existing fleets at prices commensurate with the leading performance of our platform. We believe the performance of our e-fleets and their integration with other unique components of the Zeus platform will continue to drive demand for this equipment, which we expect exceeds 50% of our active fleet next year. Turning to Octiv Auto Frac. Customers have contracted this automation technology at a remarkable pace. Since launch in Q3, we've deployed Auto Frac on 20% of our e-fleets and expect to expand to 50% in the next two months. In 2025, we expect the vast majority of our e-fleets to operate with Auto Frac contracts. I am also pleased with the deployment progress of Sensori fracture diagnostics, which provide the building blocks for improved per foot recovery for our customers. During the third quarter, we embedded Halliburton's Sensori fracture monitoring technology into a number of our customers' well completion workflows and expect to further expand our customer base for this unique technology in the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, I expect the Zeus' platform and its constituent technologies to see continued adoption. I believe these technologies, working together seamlessly in an automated real-time environment will create a path to greater fracture consistency, ever higher levels of efficiency and ultimately improved recovery. The potential value creation related to these technologies is significant. We are working today with several market-leading operators to advance this integrated application of the Zeus platform. I believe we are just at the beginning of what this technology will accomplish. Shifting to Drilling and Evaluation. Our North America drilling services business demonstrated nearly 20% year-on-year growth this quarter despite a rig count decline of 5% over the same period. I expect this unique growth to continue in 2025. In unconventional basins, our iCruise rotary steerable tool and LOGIX drilling automation platform, reliably deliver curve and lateral sections in a single run. We delivered revenue growth this year in each of our commercial models. Rental, sales and full service, and I expect further expansion next year. In Canada, Halliburton's leading portfolio of well ranging technologies, such as our Aurora magnetic ranging service, is the preferred solution for steam-assisted gravity drainage wells. Expanded midstream infrastructure has improved market access for oil producers in Canada, which creates a strong future runway for these technologies. In Alaska, our EarthStar ultra-deep resistivity tool and reservoir mapping service deliver unmatched performance and unique insights for customers drilling extended reach wells on the North Slope. We see significant growth opportunities for our logging while drilling and directional drilling services as activity increases in multiple projects in the area over the next few years. Across a broad spectrum of North America drilling applications, Halliburton's technology delivers performance, precision and unique insights for our customers that have driven meaningful share growth and strong returns, and I expect further revenue growth in 2025. To finish my thoughts on North America. Our strategy to maximize value is unchanged. The strategy means we focus on returns, not share. We deliver leading service quality and efficiency, and we develop differentiated technologies that create value for our customers and Halliburton. I believe Halliburton's execution of this strategy has transformed the resilience and profitability of our North America business. Let me close with this. I see solid opportunities across business lines and geographies for Halliburton. As we execute on our strategies, profitable international growth and maximize value in North America, we will target opportunities to deliver unique value, allocate capital to the highest return opportunities, and prioritize free cash flow generation and shareholder returns. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric?\nEric Carre: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Our Q3 reported net income per diluted share was $0.65. Adjusted net income per diluted share was $0.73. Before we turn to our detailed results, I want to take a moment to discuss the impacts of the cybersecurity event this quarter on our earnings, free cash flow, stock buybacks and SAP deployment. Starting with earnings, the lost revenue resulting from the cybersecurity event and the storms in the Gulf of Mexico impacted our adjusted results by approximately $0.02 per diluted share. In addition, we incurred $35 million of cybersecurity event related expenses, which is excluded from our adjusted results. In Q4, we do not expect to incur significant further expenses related to the event. Our free cash flow was impacted by system outages, which affected our ability to invoice and collect receivables during the quarter. We work closely with our customers and expect to collect those amounts in Q4. We maintain our expectation of greater than 10% growth in full year free cash flow compared to last year. We paused our stock repurchase program as we assess the impact of the event and repurchased fewer shares this quarter than targeted. Our plan is to catch up on buybacks in Q4. Finally, this quarter, we successfully completed the implementation of SAP S4 in our first country. Based on lessons learned there, and the cybersecurity event, I now expect the project to be delayed three to six months and cost approximately $20 million to $30 million more than our initial estimate. Turning now to our company results. Total company revenue for Q3 '24 was $5.7 billion, a decrease of 2% sequentially. Adjusted operating income was $987 million, and adjusted operating margin was 17%. Now turning to the segment results. Beginning with our Completion and Production division, revenue in Q3 was $3.3 billion, a decrease of 3% sequentially. Operating income was $669 million, a decrease of 7% sequentially and operating income margin was 20%. These results were driven by lower hydraulic fracturing services in U.S. land and Latin America. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in Q3 was $2.4 billion, while operating income was $406 million, both sequentially flat. Operating margin was 17%, a sequential increase of 36 basis points. These results were driven by improvement in fluid activity in Latin America and higher software sales globally, offset by greater-than-anticipated rig count reductions in the Middle East and project delays in the North Sea, two of our largest well construction markets. Now let's move on to geographic results. Our Q3 international revenue was flat sequentially. Europe Africa revenue in Q3 was $722 million, a decrease of 5% sequentially. This decline was primarily due to decreased drilling-related services in the North Sea, and lower completion tool sales in West Africa. Partially offsetting these decreases were higher cementing activity in the North Sea. Middle East Asia revenue in Q3 was $1.5 billion, an increase of 3% sequentially. This increase was primarily due to increased pressure pumping services in Saudi Arabia, higher completion tool sales and fluid services in the Middle East, and higher wireline activity in Asia. Partially offsetting these improvements were lower drilling services and project management activity in the Middle East. Latin America revenue in Q3 was $1.1 billion, a 4% decrease sequentially. This decrease was primarily due to lower hydraulic fracturing activity in Argentina, partially offset by increased drilling-related services and improved project management activity in the region. In North America, Q3 revenue was $2.4 billion, a 4% decrease sequentially. This decline was primarily driven by decreased pressure pumping services in U.S. land in addition to lower activity across multiple product service lines in the Gulf of Mexico, partly due to the impact of storms. Moving on to other items. In Q3, our corporate and other expense was $60 million, which was below our prior guidance. As a result, we expect our Q4 corporate expenses to increase about $10 million. In Q3, we spent $28 million or about $0.03 per diluted share on SAPS for migration, which is included in our results. For Q4, we expect SAP expenses to increase about $5 million. Net interest expense for the quarter was $85 million. For Q4, we expect net interest expense to increase about $5 million. Other net expense for Q3 was $52 million, which was higher than anticipated, driven by unfavorable foreign exchange movements in multiple currencies. For Q4, we expect this expense to be approximately $35 million. Our effective tax rate for Q3 was 21%, and our normalized effective tax rate was 23.5%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 23.5%. Capital expenditures for Q3 were $339 million. For the full year of 2024, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 6.4% of revenue. Our Q3 cash flow from operations was $841 million, and free cash flow was $543 million. For the full year 2024, we expect free cash flow to be at least 10% higher than 2023. Now let me provide you with comments on our expectations for Q4. In our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to decline 1% to 3% and margins to decline 75 to 125 basis points. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect sequential revenue to be flat to up 2% and margins to be flat to up 50 basis points. I will now turn the call back to Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Thanks, Eric. Here are the key points I would like you to take away from our discussion today. I am confident in our international business. I believe the strength of our technology portfolio, unique value proposition, and clear strategy will continue to deliver growth and returns. I'm excited about the emerging trends in the international market, where I believe Halliburton will demonstrate unique growth. And in North America, we are widening the moat around our Zeus platform and expect to keep growing our drilling business. And now, let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First question is from the line of Dave Anderson with Barclays. Please proceed.\nDave Anderson: So maybe let's just start with the obvious, and how you think the election might impact your business? Is the thesis out there, obviously, the market sort of buying first asking questions later? But that reduced regulation, faster permitting is going to result in higher onshore activity kind of going forward. Is that a valid assumption? I mean, is that the way you're thinking about the market for the next couple of years? I could certainly see how complete the Gulf of Mexico, which seems to be mired in red tape. But how do you think this impacts your North America onshore business?\nJeff Miller: Look, Dave, it's only positive. It could only be positive. In fact, I'm quite optimistic about that outlook. And here's why. I mean, I think what you saw was a reflection of a commonsense view of economics and resource development, which are incredibly important in this country. And then more importantly, it's the way it was rolled out. I mean it reflects the majority of people that have a rational view about how important energy is to our country. And so, when I think about that, I think every dollar that is not spent defending and debating the industry, but rather being invested in this industry, are absolutely good for Halliburton's business.\nDave Anderson: What about the Gulf of Mexico? Do you think this could -- you could start to see a pickup in activity out there? I mean I know there's been some issues kind of getting permits and things like that. Do you think that could potentially free that up?\nJeff Miller: Yes. I think -- look, Dave, yes. I mean I think that there's a lot of risk that's been painted over this industry, particularly regulatory risk, and it's probably even more acute in the Gulf of Mexico, given the significance of the investments and the types of decisions that get made that are long term in nature by operators. And I think the more that those are derisked either through regulation or legislation creates an even better runway. I mean operators don't operate in a vacuum. I mean they are digesting risk every day. And I think what we saw was directionally, hey, energy is extremely important. There's absolutely no reason we should be -- anyway, I think that we're in a good place with energy development in this country.\nDave Anderson: Understood. And if I could maybe shift to just more specifically kind of the here and now and U.S. onshore. It's clearly slowing as we approach year-end, we've all sort of seen this. It does look like you faced a ton of pricing pressure so far, but you're kind of guiding down to margins kind of moving down a little bit in the fourth quarter. I was wondering if you could talk about sort of potential widening spread of pricing amongst say conventional diesel, Tier 4 and e-frac. Are you seeing that kind of spread happening here? And if so, does this kind of -- are you thinking about accelerating your Zeus? You talked about this towards Zeus platform, which really does sound very differentiated. I just wanted to accelerate that program because that should, therefore, kind of drive into higher pricing going forward?\nJeff Miller: Well, Dave, we still see demand for our Zeus platform and growing demand for that Zeus platform. So, we'll be consistent with in terms of acceleration is more a matter of customers that see the value and contract them. And we've seen that actually this quarter, and we've seen renewals. So, I feel really confident in that. And I think it will accelerate almost just by virtue of making that available in the market and having more opportunities to put it to work, as opposed to when you think acceleration, that means we push the pedal and spend and do. I really think we're going to stick with our maximize value approach and let the diesel, retire or move outside the country, that will be replaced with electric and also -- as important as the electric is, quite frankly, the entire platform that is creating outsized value for customers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Securities. Please proceed.\nArun Jayaram: Jeff and Eric, I really want to get your thoughts on how you see North America and Completion and Production kind of trending next year? You mentioned that 90% of your frac fleets is committed for '25 and perhaps 50% of that capacity up to that could be Zeus fleets. So, it sounds like you've kind of navigated through the RFP season, and you got a lot of equipment kind of committed. You also mentioned that you've announced some extensions on some Zeus fleet that's maybe a little bit earlier than we're thinking. So, I was just wondering, given that amount of capacity that's been committed, what's your just outlook for non-frac next year? And I'm trying to think about how margins could play out over the next 12 months.\nJeff Miller: Well, look, look, I feel good about 2025, and we talk to customers -- I talk to customers every day, and they are clearly planning to work. But they're also planning to be more efficient and improve recovery at the same time. Now that's plays directly into our strengths, whether it's more silo frac, longer laterals, faster wells and obviously the Zeus platform. So, when I think about 2025, I think about maximizing value, and that means solving the hardest problems are unconventionals with better recovery, widening the moat around our Zeus platform, the drilling performance that I described in the outsized adoption that we're seeing for our drilling solution. And yes, having 90 fleets committed -- 90% of our fleets committed today, does form a view about 2025, and I've described those things that we're going to be doing in the market that are consistent with the performance as you've seen till now. So, I think about the market today. I mean we've arguably been arguably have been in a downturn for 18 months. And the tools and the approach that we've taken are the tools and approach that we will take.\nArun Jayaram: Okay. Fair enough, Jeff. Maybe -- it does help us think about '25. This is kind of a consistent buy side question that we've gotten, Jeff. Is the dynamic in North American frac is the fact that companies like Halliburton are pumping more hours per day doing more completion footage completed per day? And so, a lot of my E&P coverage now is highlighting the ability, for example, one operator mentioned that they could do -- in '25, they could use four frac fleets to do what five frac fleets did in '24. Does that make sense? So, you're using less equipment. And the question we're asking ourselves is how does this impact your profitability if these four frac fleets are doing a similar amount of footage? How does that impact Halliburton, were thinking maybe you lose some margins or some revenues through pass-through, but how does that impact your base frac business using that example?\nJeff Miller: Well, look, number one, we're at the leading edge of that efficiency, which means that we're getting more reps, and in most cases, based on sort of our equipment, we get more reps on less capital. So, from a maximized value standpoint, it doesn't take 2x the equipment to do a simul-frac. In fact, it takes less than half more. And so, generating the same or more revenue with less equipment is positive and strategically why we build the equipment the way that we do. At the same time, creating more value by pumping, which just takes me to the Zeus solution and the platform. That's also part of how the operators get better. And I'll tell you, I would much rather be on the front end of this than somewhere else. So, leading this charge is where we want to be. It keeps us busy and creating opportunities to create more value. So, you're thinking about it the right way. Yes, this industry gets more efficient. I think it gets harder to get more efficient from here. But I expect Halliburton plays at the front end of that and as a leader. So, in some ways, the capital efficiency. I mean, we're driving capital efficiency, which ultimately does support margins. And look, there's a -- we are where we are today. If I look forward into the future, we know how to operate in that environment, and we're doing it, and we're successful at it. But I also think it's unreasonable to ignore future catalysts, whether Tier 1 rock becomes Tier 2, becomes Tier 3. There are other things that happened that I think would be positive.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.\nJames West: You highlighted a lot on intervention this quarter. I think maybe investors that aren't following you as closely as myself or Dave or Arun would know about the tremendous amount of, not capital, but just R&D and work you guys have done in building that business out as a big strength of yours. Could you maybe talk through kind of -- I guess, why highlight now? I guess first and then kind of where you were, where you've been, where you are today, and how you view that as one of the kind of huge strength of the Company?\nJeff Miller: Yes. Thanks, James. Look, this has always been an important business for Halliburton intervention, whether it's stimulation, it's entering wellbores, and those are the markets that maintain the baseload of oil and gas production around the world. And so, we've been in that business, but I'm highlighting it partly because I don't anyone to forget how important predicting that base load is, and how much work that generates. But I also would like to characterize that in terms of the R&D effort that we're putting in around that. And so, if I go sort of contextually over look over some history. In Halliburton when we invest in a direction, it's important for us. So, I think unconventionals, if you go back a number of years, then we've talked about what we've done around Sperry drilling from an R&D and creating critical mass and a bigger business doing the same thing with intervention. And we've done it for a number of years. However, you're going to see us developing things like we described on the call today, riserless intervention is an incredible step forward in terms of making wells economic. We've talked about it for a decade probably worked hard on it with a technique FMC for five years, and now we're here. But those are the kind of things I expect to see us do more of and create a bigger growing market for us. And so, from our perspective, this is where we will see outsized growth internationally.\nJames West: Okay. Very good to hear. And then, Jeff, the growth in the interventions part of the business make earnings a little bit less cyclical than perhaps they've been previously and therefore, a higher multiple.\nJeff Miller: I think so. I mean these are completely agree with you, and it's part of the reason we want to continue to invest and generate that outsized growth. But it's the kind of growth that decline curves never go away. And so, everything is obviously declining. Therefore, there is always demand for intervention as we described.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.\nRoger Read: Jeff, can I get your take, you talk a lot here about the opportunities international. And obviously, everybody talks about the productivity and efficiency that's going on in North America. Could you give us a little bit of a contrast of what you see happening globally? I mean, not just your products and services that improve it. But if you were to just say, what you think your customers are getting right now in terms of productivity and efficiency, how that's affecting your business question asked earlier, I think, by Arun, right, five frac crews goes to four, what the impacts are. So, as you think about the opportunity internationally, how does that compare? What kind of headwinds are you facing on the productivity front there?\nJeff Miller: Well, look, North America fantastic resource, fantastic market and a place where operators can implement technology in a fairly straightforward way. I would say that internationally, we're much further behind in terms of technology application. In fact, I would argue some are just moving into maturity in Argentina where we will start to see more and more. But the Middle East, for example, has worked to a point, but I think that the opportunity -- we'll actually see growth in terms of consumption of equipment well before we see efficiency cresting just because there's so much work to do. And I think what those markets get the benefit of, particularly with Halliburton is a lot of the technology that creates better wells. I mean, if you go back in time in the U.S., they're well designed, there are a lot of wells that we would like to go back and refrac. But today, armed with the technology that we have, I believe we'll make better wells. But to say that -- but to get specifically to your question, we're not even close to that point of efficiency, reducing demand internationally. In fact, we're at the opposite end of that. We're back like it looked in the U.S., early days, where add-add, let's do more. Hope that helps, Roger?\nRoger Read: Yes, it does. I'd say kind of what we look at, the evidence seems similar that way, but I just wanted to talk to the experts about it. The other question I had, one of the things we hear about is a way to potentially accelerate drilling speeds going forward in the U.S. might be greater expansion of rotary steerable type and other types of advanced drilling devices. You mentioned that in your introductory part of the call as something to roll out to Latin America. But I was just curious how that's -- how do you see that in North America in terms of additional penetration over the coming years?\nJeff Miller: Yes. Thanks. Look, I'm crystal clear that this is a market that continues to grow in rotary steerables, just the efficiency, precision, the types of wells that are being drilled in terms of length, tortuosity, everything I see in North America says, over time, the trend is that rotary steerables are a bigger and bigger part of this market, both from the ability to execute the drilling in terms of the complexity and length, but also the speed in terms of curve lateral. And that's really where we're getting so much traction with our iCruise tools in North America has been the reliability around drilling that curve lateral. And I see the exact same thing internationally. In fact, we're already -- we've described the contract that we've won in the Middle East for Sperry, same type of thing. I would expect to see growth in really any unconventional market around the world that -- iCruise CX is a terrific tool. I mean it's the performance is what's causing the growth in and share. And so very pleased with where we are, but I also think we're in the right spot from a secular growth standpoint, in the sense that, that is directionally where the market has to go in order to continue to get better both in time, but also in terms of the types of wells and the lengths that are being drilled.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNeil Mehta: I had a couple of company-specific items here, which is around the cybersecurity incident what are, Jeff, lessons learned around that certainly something that all Fortune-500 companies are having to contend with. But how do you ensure protection of this going forward? And help us understand it sounds like, it could create some delays to the ERP system rollout. Can you talk a little bit about what those impacts were?\nJeff Miller: Yes. Thanks. Look, I think from lessons learned standpoint, I cannot overemphasize the importance of preparedness in terms of desktop drills, contracting with the absolute best professionals in the industry. And I'm so appreciative of the companies have supported us, Mandiant and others. But I would say that is probably one of the most important things any company can do is be absolutely prepared in advance for that.\nEric Carre: So, in terms of the SAP ERP rollout, Neil, there's really a couple of things. So, the first one is what relates directly to the cyber incidents. And there, obviously, once the incident started most of our IT folks went on to helping fix the problem, restore the systems and everything. They were unavailable, obviously, to continue to participate in the rollout. And when that was done and the systems were restored, what you had is the finance and procurement organization when you do a catch-up mode basically restoring in the system or of the transaction that were made when we were operating in a manual mode. The second impact from the incident was the fact that as we roll out a big system like this, we do what's called localization events, which when we go and roll out the system in a new country, we sent a team ahead of time to really understand the details of statutories differences, tax differences and everything so that we get ready for any particular specifics of a given country. And then in parallel to that, we had the rollout in our -- first country we rolled out the system in Canada that was successful. We closed the quarter on S4. We closed October on S4, but as we did all of that, we learned a few things around the structure of our training around what it means to manage processes in two different systems and everything. So, all of that resulted in a replanning of the rollout, which we think now is going to be about three to six months over the initial plan. So, we'll get into H1 2026.\nNeil Mehta: Okay. Great. I'm glad you guys navigated. The follow-up is just around the stock buybacks. Again, you did $250 million in March and then $250 million in June in this quarter, it was closer to $200 million, and you explained why. But is 250 the right run rate, all else equal, as we think about 2025 and given the pullback in the share price given the macro environment, is there an argument to really lean into the share repurchase and take it to another level and really drive that free cash flow per share? So, I'll turn it over to you guys on that.\nEric Carre: Yes. So, to address first part of your question, that's what we plan ahead, guided to an average $250 million per quarter that would lead to something around $1 billion for the year, significantly up from 2023. So, what happened in Q3 is, I mean, the mechanism that we use to go and buy back share, we do it in two parallel ways. So, one, we filed a 10b5-1 plan; and two, we do open purchase in the market. So, when the cyber incident started, we basically were cautious and we stopped all the open purchases because we didn't want to end up in a situation where the investigation would lead to the discovery of MDI. So, we paused that continued with the 10b5 plan. So, all of that landed in a number that was below what we were targeted initially and as we said in the remarks, the intent is to catch up a bit on that in Q4. Directionally, on the second part of your question, we really view buybacks as a systematic mechanism to return cash to shareholders. We look at it through cycles. So, while there might be some short-term opportunities, to your point, around the current share prices, we tried not to be opportunistic per se, but view -- again, stock buyback more as a through cycle mechanism to return cash. So, we might weigh in a bit more, but directionally, we want to be fairly steady. And as we look into next year, while we haven't worked our plan through, the general view would be to up what we've done so far in 2024.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Saurabh Pant with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nSaurabh Pant: Jeff, maybe I have a couple of questions, one on offshore, one on North America. Let me just start on the offshore side of things because that's one place where there is a lot of optimism and structural optimism, not just short-term optimism. I want to just come back to that I know in the past, you have talked about upside in '25, particularly in West Africa and Norway and obviously offshore in general. But amongst the conversation from the offshore drillers and delay in contracting, maybe some projects being delayed due to the macro supply chain delays, given all of those headlines on the offshore driller side of things, is there anything we should be mindful of for the offshore side of your business as we think about 2025?\nJeff Miller: No. Look, we see stability in our biggest markets, whether the Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, Guyana, Norway, Black Sea, as we described this morning, positive elements of those. From our perspective, we move equipment between rigs. And so, the actual -- we're not in the rig business. So, the rig contracted status of rigs is not really impactful to us. The key is operators focus on continuing to drill and develop offshore resources, which we see a lot of strength around that, whether it's 20,000 in the Gulf of Mexico, I mean, there's just a lot of foot, and so there's a lot of probably back and forth in the rig business in terms of contracting and gaps and managing timing, but that doesn't impact us. We're working with clients. They have rigs available and they are either executing work or planning work and really bought a bit of exciting work around the world and in the Gulf of Mexico.\nSaurabh Pant: Okay. Fantastic. No, that's good color, Jeff. And then just one quick clarification on, Jeff, I think you made the comment in your prepared remarks about 90% of your fleet committed for [indiscernible]. That's really impressive like I think [indiscernible] Q&A ask. But my follow-up is, do we know at least roughly what the pricing on those fleets are going to look like, right? So basically, do we have line of sight on the profitability as well versus just activity on those fleets?\nJeff Miller: Look, yes, we do have some of that, but we obviously work through that as well. What I would say about without getting into details because I won't. We're sticking with our strategy, which is to stay out of the spot market size the fleet to the market that we see as we've described, and we've been successful in getting things to work. We obviously don't exist in a vacuum. But at the same time, I believe Halliburton, and I know Halliburton reflects the performance and the technology that we bring to the market, which puts us at the high end of the range, and I get told that every single day. So, I'm well aware of where we are from that perspective. But confident that our strategies in place, and we're executing on the strategy that's gotten us to hear.\nSaurabh Pant: Okay. No, fantastic. As a market leader, what do you do in that industry, obviously decides where the market goes? So, it's good to hear that. And if I may, Eric, very quick one. I know you're not guiding to '25 CapEx yet. But broad strokes, can we still think about 6% of revenue for next year?\nEric Carre: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with Benchmark. Please go ahead.\nKurt Hallead: Jeff, as you -- as we all know, right, you're in constant communication with your cohorts at the oil and gas companies, and there's been a lot of noise, right, concerns about oil demand growth, concerns about excess OPEC capacity. And obviously, in the broader markets, that's weighed on the price of crude, right? So, in the conversations that you've had of late, right, it sounds like there's a bit more optimism or a constructive outlook that your customer base has maybe relative to the commodity market or the equity market. So just hoping you can give us some insights on how you're assessing those conversations, what you've seen risk things to give that sense of optimism, and what you could potentially help translate to the people on this call?\nJeff Miller: Certainly. Look, I think that some of this is around the types of players in the market today. And I mean, these are very serious, large, well-capitalized operators. And so, as part of the E&P consolidation, it's gone sort of as expected in the sense that customers clearly want technology and efficiency. These large players have a larger baseload of work, they're stable. They plan to work through the cycle. It does create more contractable opportunities for us in terms of Zeus fleet and Zeus platform. But I think some of the optimism that you hear is; a, these aren't customers that ever react to short swings in commodity pricing. These are operators that build a plan, execute a plan, and I'm so pleased to work with these customers because that kind of clarity helps us run our business. I think probably some of that optimism you hear is we are getting better at what we do. They see paths to be more productive and they've got capital to go do it. And the commodity price today is clearly well within a range that drives consistent activity. And so -- and I think that there'll be a lot of interest in keeping oil and gas in a range that creates profitability for our clients and profitability for us. And that this industry continues to grow and just get -- becoming more and more effective, productive, profitable industry.\nKurt Hallead: Great. I always appreciate the color, Jeff. Now maybe a follow-up for Eric, just on that CapEx question, right? So, in the fourth quarter, if the math maps out correctly, it looks like you're going to be about $450 million in CapEx, which is about $100 million higher than what you had been for quarterly run rate. You mentioned a couple of new e-fleets. So can we connect the dots and suggests that the incremental CapEx is -- the bulk of that is going to go toward the e-fleet rollout. And then just as an extension to that, you referenced 6% of CapEx for next year. In that 6% of CapEx of revenue for next year, how many e-fleets or are you assuming any additional et additions?\nJeff Miller: Yes, I'll take that. Let me take that in terms of e-fleets going forward. E-fleets, again, we look at that from a pull standpoint, not a push the endpoint. So, we do expect deliveries in 2025. We've got some of those already planned and expect to do that, and we've also -- anyway. So that's where we are. I think the CapEx, I'm going to hand the forecasting to Eric.\nEric Carre: As I mentioned earlier, the CapEx still intended to be 6%. Look, it's going to be a little higher than 6% this year as we revised revenue compared to the projection we had at the beginning of the year, and we had a lot of equipment and flat. I mean, we're still dealing with lead time on big pieces of capital equipment between six months and over a year. But as we look into next year, it's 6%. It's a balance between CD&E balance between the projection that we have for revenue in North America and international and the overall ratios continue to evolve as our business evolves and becomes more and more internationally weighted.\nOperator: Thank you. And that is all the time we have for Q&A today. I will turn the call back to Jeff Miller for his final comments.\nJeff Miller: Yes, Carmen, thank you. As we close out today's call, I just want to leave you with this. I see solid growth opportunities for Halliburton across our business lines and geographies. I'm confident in our international business and its strong technology portfolio, unique value proposition and clear strategy. In North America, we are widening the moat around our Zeus platform, and we expect to keep growing our drilling business services in North America. So, I look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And with that, we close today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Eric Carre",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Our Q3 reported net income per diluted share was $0.65. Adjusted net income per diluted share was $0.73. Before we turn to our detailed results, I want to take a moment to discuss the impacts of the cybersecurity event this quarter on our earnings, free cash flow, stock buybacks and SAP deployment. Starting with earnings, the lost revenue resulting from the cybersecurity event and the storms in the Gulf of Mexico impacted our adjusted results by approximately $0.02 per diluted share. In addition, we incurred $35 million of cybersecurity event related expenses, which is excluded from our adjusted results. In Q4, we do not expect to incur significant further expenses related to the event. Our free cash flow was impacted by system outages, which affected our ability to invoice and collect receivables during the quarter. We work closely with our customers and expect to collect those amounts in Q4. We maintain our expectation of greater than 10% growth in full year free cash flow compared to last year. We paused our stock repurchase program as we assess the impact of the event and repurchased fewer shares this quarter than targeted. Our plan is to catch up on buybacks in Q4. Finally, this quarter, we successfully completed the implementation of SAP S4 in our first country. Based on lessons learned there, and the cybersecurity event, I now expect the project to be delayed three to six months and cost approximately $20 million to $30 million more than our initial estimate. Turning now to our company results. Total company revenue for Q3 '24 was $5.7 billion, a decrease of 2% sequentially. Adjusted operating income was $987 million, and adjusted operating margin was 17%. Now turning to the segment results. Beginning with our Completion and Production division, revenue in Q3 was $3.3 billion, a decrease of 3% sequentially. Operating income was $669 million, a decrease of 7% sequentially and operating income margin was 20%. These results were driven by lower hydraulic fracturing services in U.S. land and Latin America. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in Q3 was $2.4 billion, while operating income was $406 million, both sequentially flat. Operating margin was 17%, a sequential increase of 36 basis points. These results were driven by improvement in fluid activity in Latin America and higher software sales globally, offset by greater-than-anticipated rig count reductions in the Middle East and project delays in the North Sea, two of our largest well construction markets. Now let's move on to geographic results. Our Q3 international revenue was flat sequentially. Europe Africa revenue in Q3 was $722 million, a decrease of 5% sequentially. This decline was primarily due to decreased drilling-related services in the North Sea, and lower completion tool sales in West Africa. Partially offsetting these decreases were higher cementing activity in the North Sea. Middle East Asia revenue in Q3 was $1.5 billion, an increase of 3% sequentially. This increase was primarily due to increased pressure pumping services in Saudi Arabia, higher completion tool sales and fluid services in the Middle East, and higher wireline activity in Asia. Partially offsetting these improvements were lower drilling services and project management activity in the Middle East. Latin America revenue in Q3 was $1.1 billion, a 4% decrease sequentially. This decrease was primarily due to lower hydraulic fracturing activity in Argentina, partially offset by increased drilling-related services and improved project management activity in the region. In North America, Q3 revenue was $2.4 billion, a 4% decrease sequentially. This decline was primarily driven by decreased pressure pumping services in U.S. land in addition to lower activity across multiple product service lines in the Gulf of Mexico, partly due to the impact of storms. Moving on to other items. In Q3, our corporate and other expense was $60 million, which was below our prior guidance. As a result, we expect our Q4 corporate expenses to increase about $10 million. In Q3, we spent $28 million or about $0.03 per diluted share on SAPS for migration, which is included in our results. For Q4, we expect SAP expenses to increase about $5 million. Net interest expense for the quarter was $85 million. For Q4, we expect net interest expense to increase about $5 million. Other net expense for Q3 was $52 million, which was higher than anticipated, driven by unfavorable foreign exchange movements in multiple currencies. For Q4, we expect this expense to be approximately $35 million. Our effective tax rate for Q3 was 21%, and our normalized effective tax rate was 23.5%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 23.5%. Capital expenditures for Q3 were $339 million. For the full year of 2024, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 6.4% of revenue. Our Q3 cash flow from operations was $841 million, and free cash flow was $543 million. For the full year 2024, we expect free cash flow to be at least 10% higher than 2023. Now let me provide you with comments on our expectations for Q4. In our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to decline 1% to 3% and margins to decline 75 to 125 basis points. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect sequential revenue to be flat to up 2% and margins to be flat to up 50 basis points. I will now turn the call back to Jeff. So, in terms of the SAP ERP rollout, Neil, there's really a couple of things. So, the first one is what relates directly to the cyber incidents. And there, obviously, once the incident started most of our IT folks went on to helping fix the problem, restore the systems and everything.

I mean, we're still dealing with lead time on big pieces of capital equipment between six months and over a year. But as we look into next year, it's 6%. It's a balance between CD&E balance between the projection that we have for revenue in North America and international and the overall ratios continue to evolve as our business evolves and becomes more and more internationally weighted."

            "name": "Jeff Miller",
            "content": "Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin today's discussion with our highlights from the third quarter. We delivered total company revenue of $5.7 billion and adjusted operating margin of 17%. International revenue was $3.3 billion and grew by 4% year-over-year, led by Middle East Asia, which delivered an increase of 9%. North America revenue was $2.4 billion, a decrease of 9% year-over-year. Finally, during the third quarter, we generated $841 million of cash flow from operations, $543 million of free cash flow and repurchased approximately $200 million of our common stock. The August cybersecurity event has not had a material effect on our financial condition or operating results. However, that event, together with the effect of storms in the Gulf of Mexico, did reduce our adjusted earnings for the quarter by roughly $0.02 per share due to lost or delayed revenue. The cybersecurity event also had an impact on our free cash flow during the quarter due to delayed billing and collections and caused us to pause our share repurchase program while we assess the impact of the event. Importantly, our full year expectations for free cash flow and cash returned to shareholders remain unchanged, and we expect both to accelerate in the fourth quarter. Before we move on, I would like to take a moment and thank our employees for their extraordinary work while we navigated the cybersecurity event this quarter. Our employees maintained operational continuity under challenging conditions, and I celebrate their effort and grit as they work through the event. I would also like to extend my thanks and appreciation to our customers for their support and close collaboration through this time. Turning to our geographic results. I'll begin with the international markets where Halliburton's revenue grew 4% year-over-year, led by the Middle East Asia region. For the full year, I expect international revenue growth to be in line with the overall market and below our prior guidance. I am pleased with our performance and the continued growth of our business. Next year, directionally, we see international growth in the low- to mid-single digits. I'm encouraged by projects I see in the pipeline, and I am confident that Halliburton will deliver on these opportunities and create value for both us and our customers. My confidence comes from the strength of our largest international business lines, the depth of our technology portfolio, the breadth of our global reach and the power of our value proposition. Halliburton's largest international business lines, cementing, completion tools and drilling fluids form the backbone of oil and gas development spending globally and each is a leader in their market. We've earned these leadership positions through our legacy of execution, consistent service quality and our digital and technology developments. The transformation of our Sperry Drilling business clearly demonstrates the impact technology developments have on our business. The success of our organically developed iCruise and iStar directional drilling and logging tools, LOGIX automation and remote operation platform and ultra-deep resistivity and look ahead tools create a step change in Halliburton's international competitiveness and return profile. Year-to-date, Sperry has delivered the highest international revenue growth of any major product line. Further, Halliburton today is present in all major international basins as well as select frontier areas with promising future development potential. Our international business operates both on and offshore with roughly 50% of our revenue outside of North America land earned from offshore operations. Finally, our value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers drives our unique approach to creating value for our customers and Halliburton. Our collaborative approach wins with our customers and is exemplified by our alliances in the North Sea and elsewhere. These alliances have pioneered new ways of working to consistently deliver industry-leading performance on integrated projects. I am confident in our international business. I am confident because of the strength of our technology portfolio, our unique value proposition, our clear strategy, our experienced workforce and deep customer relationships. I expect that Halliburton's international franchise will continue to deliver growth and returns. Today, I would like to spend some time describing a few areas where I expect outsized international growth for Halliburton in 2025 and beyond. These are unconventionals, artificial lift and intervention. Two things are clear to me. One, unconventional developments are becoming more important, and I expect they will grow faster than other market segments over the next few years. Two, Halliburton is the clear leader in unconventionals, both in technology and execution, and I expect Halliburton to play the same leadership role internationally as we have in the U.S. We see evidence of this in the Middle East, where Halliburton was awarded a multiyear unconventional drilling services contract and started up an unconventional hydraulic fracturing fleet, both of which grow Halliburton's market share in a strategically important customer asset. Elsewhere in the region, we see several other growth opportunities for Halliburton in emerging unconventional plays. Turning to Halliburton's international artificial lift business, we saw over 30% year-on-year revenue growth this quarter, and we expect to continue to outgrow the market on the strength of our leading technology portfolio. One such technology is our TrueSync hybrid motor, which combines the reliability of an induction motor with the efficiency of a permanent magnet motor. Initially deployed in North America, we anticipate strong international demand, especially in Latin America and the Middle East, where its economic benefits can be realized at scale. Another key technology is our Intelevate service, which uses AI to process real-time data and remotely manage pumps for optimal performance. We saw a 50% increase in international wells monitored since the start of the year. In North America, Halliburton performed over 160,000 remote interventions this year, and we expect Intelevate to deliver similar value internationally as we expand our installed ESP base. Well intervention is another segment, I believe, will outgrow the overall market. We have seen this already with our Production Solutions product line, which this year alone has grown at twice the rate of our overall international business. Well intervention has long been an area of focus for Halliburton's organic investment and technology development. For example, Halliburton and alliance with TechnipFMC achieved the world's first riserless coiled tubing intervention service. This technology means Halliburton's full suite of subsea well intervention services can be deployed without the requirement for a riser equipped deepwater rig. Customers can now intervene in thousands of marginal or end-of-life offshore wells that otherwise could not be economically serviced. These are a few examples that describe the unique above-market growth opportunities we see for Halliburton. To summarize international markets, I am confident in the strength of our international business. I believe our technology portfolio, value proposition, and strategy will drive profitable growth in 2025. Turning to North America. Our third quarter revenue declined 4% compared to the second quarter, primarily due to lower hydraulic fracturing activity in U.S. land. I expect the combination of seasonality and budget exhaustion will result in a full year revenue decline at the low end of our prior guidance. Our strategy to maximize value in North America remains unchanged, and I expect we will continue to outperform our competitors. Here's how I expect to maximize value in North America as I look to 2025. In our Completion business, maximizing value means unique technology leading service quality and efficiencies and disciplined capital deployment. The success of this strategy is clear. And today, I am pleased that 90% of our fracturing fleets are committed for work in 2025, with multiple opportunities for the remaining 10%. Further, the unique completion technologies we deploy in this market are key differentiators for Halliburton and our customers. Together, they comprise the Zeus platform, electric pumping units, Octiv Auto Frac and Sensori subsurface measurement. Each of these technologies is commercial, and we are seeing accelerated adoption into customer workflows. This quarter, we signed contracts for two new e-fleets and also secured extensions on several existing fleets at prices commensurate with the leading performance of our platform. We believe the performance of our e-fleets and their integration with other unique components of the Zeus platform will continue to drive demand for this equipment, which we expect exceeds 50% of our active fleet next year. Turning to Octiv Auto Frac. Customers have contracted this automation technology at a remarkable pace. Since launch in Q3, we've deployed Auto Frac on 20% of our e-fleets and expect to expand to 50% in the next two months. In 2025, we expect the vast majority of our e-fleets to operate with Auto Frac contracts. I am also pleased with the deployment progress of Sensori fracture diagnostics, which provide the building blocks for improved per foot recovery for our customers. During the third quarter, we embedded Halliburton's Sensori fracture monitoring technology into a number of our customers' well completion workflows and expect to further expand our customer base for this unique technology in the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, I expect the Zeus' platform and its constituent technologies to see continued adoption. I believe these technologies, working together seamlessly in an automated real-time environment will create a path to greater fracture consistency, ever higher levels of efficiency and ultimately improved recovery. The potential value creation related to these technologies is significant. We are working today with several market-leading operators to advance this integrated application of the Zeus platform. I believe we are just at the beginning of what this technology will accomplish. Shifting to Drilling and Evaluation. Our North America drilling services business demonstrated nearly 20% year-on-year growth this quarter despite a rig count decline of 5% over the same period. I expect this unique growth to continue in 2025. In unconventional basins, our iCruise rotary steerable tool and LOGIX drilling automation platform, reliably deliver curve and lateral sections in a single run. We delivered revenue growth this year in each of our commercial models. Rental, sales and full service, and I expect further expansion next year. In Canada, Halliburton's leading portfolio of well ranging technologies, such as our Aurora magnetic ranging service, is the preferred solution for steam-assisted gravity drainage wells. Expanded midstream infrastructure has improved market access for oil producers in Canada, which creates a strong future runway for these technologies. In Alaska, our EarthStar ultra-deep resistivity tool and reservoir mapping service deliver unmatched performance and unique insights for customers drilling extended reach wells on the North Slope. We see significant growth opportunities for our logging while drilling and directional drilling services as activity increases in multiple projects in the area over the next few years. Across a broad spectrum of North America drilling applications, Halliburton's technology delivers performance, precision and unique insights for our customers that have driven meaningful share growth and strong returns, and I expect further revenue growth in 2025. To finish my thoughts on North America. Our strategy to maximize value is unchanged. The strategy means we focus on returns, not share. We deliver leading service quality and efficiency, and we develop differentiated technologies that create value for our customers and Halliburton. I believe Halliburton's execution of this strategy has transformed the resilience and profitability of our North America business. Let me close with this. I see solid opportunities across business lines and geographies for Halliburton. As we execute on our strategies, profitable international growth and maximize value in North America, we will target opportunities to deliver unique value, allocate capital to the highest return opportunities, and prioritize free cash flow generation and shareholder returns. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric? Thanks, Eric. Here are the key points I would like you to take away from our discussion today. I am confident in our international business. I believe the strength of our technology portfolio, unique value proposition, and clear strategy will continue to deliver growth and returns. I'm excited about the emerging trends in the international market, where I believe Halliburton will demonstrate unique growth. And in North America, we are widening the moat around our Zeus platform and expect to keep growing our drilling business. And now, let's open it up for questions. Look, Dave, it's only positive. It could only be positive. In fact, I'm quite optimistic about that outlook. And here's why. I mean, I think what you saw was a reflection of a commonsense view of economics and resource development, which are incredibly important in this country. And then more importantly, it's the way it was rolled out. I mean it reflects the majority of people that have a rational view about how important energy is to our country. And so, when I think about that, I think every dollar that is not spent defending and debating the industry, but rather being invested in this industry, are absolutely good for Halliburton's business. Yes. I think -- look, Dave, yes. I mean I think that there's a lot of risk that's been painted over this industry, particularly regulatory risk, and it's probably even more acute in the Gulf of Mexico, given the significance of the investments and the types of decisions that get made that are long term in nature by operators. And I think the more that those are derisked either through regulation or legislation creates an even better runway. I mean operators don't operate in a vacuum. I mean they are digesting risk every day. And I think what we saw was directionally, hey, energy is extremely important. There's absolutely no reason we should be -- anyway, I think that we're in a good place with energy development in this country. Well, Dave, we still see demand for our Zeus platform and growing demand for that Zeus platform. So, we'll be consistent with in terms of acceleration is more a matter of customers that see the value and contract them. And we've seen that actually this quarter, and we've seen renewals. So, I feel really confident in that. And I think it will accelerate almost just by virtue of making that available in the market and having more opportunities to put it to work, as opposed to when you think acceleration, that means we push the pedal and spend and do. I really think we're going to stick with our maximize value approach and let the diesel, retire or move outside the country, that will be replaced with electric and also -- as important as the electric is, quite frankly, the entire platform that is creating outsized value for customers. Well, look, look, I feel good about 2025, and we talk to customers -- I talk to customers every day, and they are clearly planning to work. But they're also planning to be more efficient and improve recovery at the same time. Now that's plays directly into our strengths, whether it's more silo frac, longer laterals, faster wells and obviously the Zeus platform. So, when I think about 2025, I think about maximizing value, and that means solving the hardest problems are unconventionals with better recovery, widening the moat around our Zeus platform, the drilling performance that I described in the outsized adoption that we're seeing for our drilling solution. And yes, having 90 fleets committed -- 90% of our fleets committed today, does form a view about 2025, and I've described those things that we're going to be doing in the market that are consistent with the performance as you've seen till now. So, I think about the market today. I mean we've arguably been arguably have been in a downturn for 18 months. And the tools and the approach that we've taken are the tools and approach that we will take. Well, look, number one, we're at the leading edge of that efficiency, which means that we're getting more reps, and in most cases, based on sort of our equipment, we get more reps on less capital. So, from a maximized value standpoint, it doesn't take 2x the equipment to do a simul-frac. In fact, it takes less than half more. And so, generating the same or more revenue with less equipment is positive and strategically why we build the equipment the way that we do. At the same time, creating more value by pumping, which just takes me to the Zeus solution and the platform. That's also part of how the operators get better. And I'll tell you, I would much rather be on the front end of this than somewhere else. So, leading this charge is where we want to be. It keeps us busy and creating opportunities to create more value. So, you're thinking about it the right way. Yes, this industry gets more efficient. I think it gets harder to get more efficient from here. But I expect Halliburton plays at the front end of that and as a leader. So, in some ways, the capital efficiency. I mean, we're driving capital efficiency, which ultimately does support margins. And look, there's a -- we are where we are today. If I look forward into the future, we know how to operate in that environment, and we're doing it, and we're successful at it. But I also think it's unreasonable to ignore future catalysts, whether Tier 1 rock becomes Tier 2, becomes Tier 3. There are other things that happened that I think would be positive. Yes. Thanks, James. Look, this has always been an important business for Halliburton intervention, whether it's stimulation, it's entering wellbores, and those are the markets that maintain the baseload of oil and gas production around the world. And so, we've been in that business, but I'm highlighting it partly because I don't anyone to forget how important predicting that base load is, and how much work that generates. But I also would like to characterize that in terms of the R&D effort that we're putting in around that. And so, if I go sort of contextually over look over some history. In Halliburton when we invest in a direction, it's important for us. So, I think unconventionals, if you go back a number of years, then we've talked about what we've done around Sperry drilling from an R&D and creating critical mass and a bigger business doing the same thing with intervention. And we've done it for a number of years. However, you're going to see us developing things like we described on the call today, riserless intervention is an incredible step forward in terms of making wells economic. We've talked about it for a decade probably worked hard on it with a technique FMC for five years, and now we're here. But those are the kind of things I expect to see us do more of and create a bigger growing market for us. And so, from our perspective, this is where we will see outsized growth internationally. I think so. I mean these are completely agree with you, and it's part of the reason we want to continue to invest and generate that outsized growth. But it's the kind of growth that decline curves never go away. And so, everything is obviously declining. Therefore, there is always demand for intervention as we described. Well, look, North America fantastic resource, fantastic market and a place where operators can implement technology in a fairly straightforward way. I would say that internationally, we're much further behind in terms of technology application. In fact, I would argue some are just moving into maturity in Argentina where we will start to see more and more. But the Middle East, for example, has worked to a point, but I think that the opportunity -- we'll actually see growth in terms of consumption of equipment well before we see efficiency cresting just because there's so much work to do. And I think what those markets get the benefit of, particularly with Halliburton is a lot of the technology that creates better wells. I mean, if you go back in time in the U.S., they're well designed, there are a lot of wells that we would like to go back and refrac. But today, armed with the technology that we have, I believe we'll make better wells. But to say that -- but to get specifically to your question, we're not even close to that point of efficiency, reducing demand internationally. In fact, we're at the opposite end of that. We're back like it looked in the U.S., early days, where add-add, let's do more. Hope that helps, Roger? Yes. Thanks. Look, I'm crystal clear that this is a market that continues to grow in rotary steerables, just the efficiency, precision, the types of wells that are being drilled in terms of length, tortuosity, everything I see in North America says, over time, the trend is that rotary steerables are a bigger and bigger part of this market, both from the ability to execute the drilling in terms of the complexity and length, but also the speed in terms of curve lateral. And that's really where we're getting so much traction with our iCruise tools in North America has been the reliability around drilling that curve lateral. And I see the exact same thing internationally. In fact, we're already -- we've described the contract that we've won in the Middle East for Sperry, same type of thing. I would expect to see growth in really any unconventional market around the world that -- iCruise CX is a terrific tool. I mean it's the performance is what's causing the growth in and share. And so very pleased with where we are, but I also think we're in the right spot from a secular growth standpoint, in the sense that, that is directionally where the market has to go in order to continue to get better both in time, but also in terms of the types of wells and the lengths that are being drilled. Yes. Thanks. Look, I think from lessons learned standpoint, I cannot overemphasize the importance of preparedness in terms of desktop drills, contracting with the absolute best professionals in the industry. And I'm so appreciative of the companies have supported us, Mandiant and others. But I would say that is probably one of the most important things any company can do is be absolutely prepared in advance for that. No. Look, we see stability in our biggest markets, whether the Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, Guyana, Norway, Black Sea, as we described this morning, positive elements of those. From our perspective, we move equipment between rigs. And so, the actual -- we're not in the rig business. So, the rig contracted status of rigs is not really impactful to us. The key is operators focus on continuing to drill and develop offshore resources, which we see a lot of strength around that, whether it's 20,000 in the Gulf of Mexico, I mean, there's just a lot of foot, and so there's a lot of probably back and forth in the rig business in terms of contracting and gaps and managing timing, but that doesn't impact us. We're working with clients. They have rigs available and they are either executing work or planning work and really bought a bit of exciting work around the world and in the Gulf of Mexico. Look, yes, we do have some of that, but we obviously work through that as well. What I would say about without getting into details because I won't. We're sticking with our strategy, which is to stay out of the spot market size the fleet to the market that we see as we've described, and we've been successful in getting things to work. We obviously don't exist in a vacuum. But at the same time, I believe Halliburton, and I know Halliburton reflects the performance and the technology that we bring to the market, which puts us at the high end of the range, and I get told that every single day. So, I'm well aware of where we are from that perspective. But confident that our strategies in place, and we're executing on the strategy that's gotten us to hear. Certainly. Look, I think that some of this is around the types of players in the market today. And I mean, these are very serious, large, well-capitalized operators. And so, as part of the E&P consolidation, it's gone sort of as expected in the sense that customers clearly want technology and efficiency. These large players have a larger baseload of work, they're stable. They plan to work through the cycle. It does create more contractable opportunities for us in terms of Zeus fleet and Zeus platform. But I think some of the optimism that you hear is; a, these aren't customers that ever react to short swings in commodity pricing. These are operators that build a plan, execute a plan, and I'm so pleased to work with these customers because that kind of clarity helps us run our business. I think probably some of that optimism you hear is we are getting better at what we do. They see paths to be more productive and they've got capital to go do it. And the commodity price today is clearly well within a range that drives consistent activity. And so -- and I think that there'll be a lot of interest in keeping oil and gas in a range that creates profitability for our clients and profitability for us. And that this industry continues to grow and just get -- becoming more and more effective, productive, profitable industry. Yes, I'll take that. Let me take that in terms of e-fleets going forward. E-fleets, again, we look at that from a pull standpoint, not a push the endpoint. So, we do expect deliveries in 2025. We've got some of those already planned and expect to do that, and we've also -- anyway. So that's where we are. I think the CapEx, I'm going to hand the forecasting to Eric. Yes, Carmen, thank you. As we close out today's call, I just want to leave you with this. I see solid growth opportunities for Halliburton across our business lines and geographies. I'm confident in our international business and its strong technology portfolio, unique value proposition and clear strategy. In North America, we are widening the moat around our Zeus platform, and we expect to keep growing our drilling business services in North America. So, I look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thank you."

Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Halliburton delivered solid second quarter results that demonstrated the strength of our international business and the differentiation of our North America service offerings. Here are the quarter highlights. We delivered total company revenue of $5.8 billion and operating margin of 18%. International revenue was $3.4 billion and grew 8% year-over-year, led by Latin America, which delivered a 10% increase. North America revenue was $2.5 billion, an 8% decrease year-over-year compared to a 12% decline in rig count over the same period. Our Drilling and Evaluation division and our Completion and Production division both demonstrated margin improvement year-over-year. Finally, during the second quarter we generated $1.1 billion of cash flow from operations and about $800 million of free cash flow and repurchased $250 million of our common stock. I'll begin our discussion with the international markets, where Halliburton's strategy of profitable growth delivered another solid quarter. International revenue grew 8% year-over-year, with growth demonstrated by each region. This marks the 12th consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth in our international business. As I look ahead for the remainder of this year, my outlook today is consistent with our expectations at the start of the year. I expect steady growth for Halliburton throughout the remainder of 2024. In our international markets, we see strong demand for Halliburton services, high activity levels, and equipment tightness across all major basins. We expect our international business to deliver about 10% revenue growth for the full year. I am pleased with the profitable growth we're seeing across our product lines. And today, I would like to highlight three specific ones in more detail. The first is our Landmark Software business. I recently attended our Landmark Forum, LIFE2024, in Athens, Greece. It is an annual event where we share our latest software innovations and our customers share their successes and future opportunities. While in Athens, I had the opportunity to meet with dozens of customers and they told me how excited they were about our latest offerings like unified ensemble modeling, scalable earth model, and our latest developments in AI and machine learning. These tools change the way customers work by driving efficiencies from asset level planning through production. The conference included customer presentations that showcased their business transformation and their use of Halliburton Landmark\u2019s tools. Our customers tell us we create unique value with our iEnergy cloud platform, which seamlessly integrates into their workflows. I am confident that Landmark's DecisionSpace 365 will expand and add to our customers' productivity and innovation journey. Next, Halliburton's artificial lift product line is growing in the international markets at double the rate of our overall international business. It embodies our successful M&A strategy of bolt-on acquisitions that bring leading technology into our portfolio. We organically grow new technologies through our global footprint and through collaboration with our customers to engineer solutions that maximize their assets value. As one example, this quarter we launched our GeoESP line, which is engineered for the harsh geothermal environment. The GeoESP line solves for extreme thermal cycling, scale development, abrasion, and corrosion. While geothermal ESP technology has applications across the globe, Halliburton sees substantial growth opportunities in Europe where customers require advanced technology to bring geothermal to scale. Finally, Halliburton's drilling services are key to our success in the international markets. We had another strong quarter in unconventional drilling with our iCruise X rotary steerable system and our LOGIX autonomous drilling platform. We deployed advancements that improved drilling speed and reliability and set several [general] (ph) records during the quarter. We invest in differentiated drilling technology and we expect our strong performance and reliable execution to drive above-market growth. For example, in the Middle East, our drilling services revenue grew about 30% year-over-year. I am pleased with our international business and look forward to deepening our strategy and delivering additional profitable growth. Turning to North America, our second quarter revenue declined 3% compared to the first quarter. Halliburton's first half 2024 results were largely as we expected. However, as we have seen, rig counts and overall service activity declined through the quarter. As I look to the second half of 2024, I now expect full year North America revenues to decline 6% to 8% versus last year, driven by lower activity. I expect that the second half of 2024 will be near the low point of activity levels this cycle, and while it's too early to give specific guidance for 2025 in North America, I expect activity to be directionally higher than the second half of 2024. Here's how I think about this. First, I expect an increase in activity after E&P companies complete their acquisitions and establish new development plans. Second, some of the merged assets will be divested to smaller operators who will put them to work. Finally, I expect some recovery in natural gas activity. Six years ago, when we set our strategy to maximize value in North America, I understood it may take a market like we see today where North America activity declined by over 200 rigs in the last 18 months to demonstrate the margin resilience and earnings power of our strategy. I am pleased that Halliburton delivered strong C&P margins through this period and I am confident that our strategy will deliver strong results in the future. We're committed to our strategy to maximize value in North America because it delivers shareholder value and it is the right strategy for this market. For Halliburton, we focused on returns. We allocate capital to the markets and products that drive superior returns and margins. We prioritize returns over market share, and to that end, we retired a few fleets this quarter. We developed differentiated technologies to solve for the unique requirements of the North America market. And lastly, we improve efficiencies for our customers through those technologies, service quality, and execution. I expect this strategy will deliver leading performance for our customers and a structurally more resilient North America business for Halliburton. A key part of how we do this is our strategic investment in technology. One technology I'm excited about is the latest addition to Octiv, a key component of the ZEUS platform. Today, Octiv is a cornerstone of how we deliver large multi-well pads with unmatched precision and consistency. As our customers execute completions with ever-increasing size and intensity, automation, as delivered by Octiv, provides better control and more effective delivery for simul-frac and trimulfrac operations. During the second quarter, we completed field trials of the latest level of Octiv automation called AutoFrac. With the single click of a button, AutoFrac executes the entire frac job from ramp up at the start to ramp down at the end, making autonomous fracturing a reality. This new level of automation gives customers control to execute the frac design exactly how they want it without human intervention. Following our commercial trials, AutoFrac is ready to scale and I'm excited about what this technology means for our customers and for Halliburton. Lastly, we see rapid adoption in North America of our iCruise rotary steerable system. We consistently reduce drilling times for our customers and create significant value. In the Permian Basin, the number of rigs running the system has increased by almost 45% since the start of this year. We are on pace to triple our footage drilled in North America this year and I'm excited about the market adoption of iCruise. North America is the largest oilfield services market in the world. We are crystal clear on how we maximize value in North America. We have demonstrated that this strategy works. And that's why I am confident that we will continue to deliver strong returns through this cycle. To step back, Halliburton's returns and cash flows are strong and I am pleased with our performance this quarter. I'm just back from a few weeks in Europe/Africa. What I saw is a microcosm of Halliburton around the world. The quality of our people, the clarity of our strategy, our leading technologies, the depth of our pipeline of opportunities, and the competitiveness of our business segments all give me incredible confidence in Halliburton's future. Now, I'll turn the call over to Eric to provide a few more details on our financial results. Eric?\nEric Carre: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Our Q2 reported net income per diluted share was $0.80. Total company revenue for the second quarter of 2024 was $5.8 billion, flat sequentially. Operating income was $1 billion, a sequential increase of 5%, and operating margin was 18%, a sequential increase of 69 basis points. Beginning with our Completion and Production division, revenue in Q2 was $3.4 billion, sequentially flat. Operating income was $723 million, up 5% when compared to Q1 2024, and operating income margin was 21%. These results were primarily driven by strong international completion and production performance, offsetting softer results in North America. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in Q2 was $2.4 billion, while operating income was $403 million, both sequentially flat from Q1 2024. Operating margin was 17%, a sequential increase of 20 basis points. These results reflect the strength of our global D&E business despite the roll-off of seasonal software sales in Q2 which affected every region. Now, let's move on to geographic results. Our Q2 international revenue increased 3% sequentially. Europe/Africa revenue in the second quarter of 2024 was $757 million, an increase of 4% sequentially. This increase was primarily driven by higher well construction activity and improved wireline activity in Norway, along with increased completion tool sales and higher stimulation activity in West Africa. Middle East Asia revenue in the second quarter of 2024 was $1.5 billion, an increase of 5% sequentially. This increase was primarily related to higher activity in the Middle East across multiple product lines and higher fluid services in Asia. Latin America revenue in the second quarter of 2024 was $1.1 billion, sequentially flat. In North America, revenue was $2.5 billion, representing a 3% decrease sequentially. This decline was primarily driven by decreased pressure pumping services in US land and decreased completion tool sales and testing services in the Gulf of Mexico. Moving on to other items. In Q2, our corporate and other expense was $65 million. For the third quarter of 2024, we expect our corporate expenses to increase slightly. Our SAP deployment remains on budget and is on schedule to conclude in 2025. In Q2, we spend $29 million, or about $0.03 per diluted share, on SAP S4 migration, which is included in our results. For the third quarter, we expect SAP expenses to increase slightly. Net interest expense for the quarter was $92 million. For the third quarter 2024, we expect net interest expense to be roughly flat. Other, net expense for Q2 was $20 million, which was lower than anticipated, driven by favorable FX movements. For the third quarter of 2024, we expect this expense to be approximately $35 million. Our effective tax rate for Q2 was 22.5%, lower than expected due to discrete items. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our third quarter of 2024 effective tax rate to increase approximately 1%. Capital expenditures for Q2 were $347 million. For the full year of 2024, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 6% of revenue. Our Q2 cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion and free cash flow was $793 million. During the quarter, we repurchased $250 million of our common stock. For the full year 2024, we expect free cash flow to be at least 10% higher than in 2023. Now, let me provide you with some comments on our expectations for the third quarter. In our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to be down 1% to 3% and margins to decrease by 75 basis points to 125 basis points. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect sequential revenue to increase 2% to 4% and margins to increase by 25 basis points to 75 basis points. I will now turn the call back to Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Thanks, Eric. Here are a few key points I would like you to take away from our discussion today. I am pleased with our 18% margins and about $800 million of free cash flow in the second quarter. We are well on track to deliver over 10% free cash flow growth this year. I'm excited about our international business where our technology portfolio has never been stronger. I am confident that our strategy to maximize value in North America is working, and I expect it continues to deliver strong returns. Finally, I am convinced that our collaborative approach and value proposition differentiate us from our competitors and are directly aligned with how our customers expect to drive improved performance. And now, let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Dave Anderson with Barclays.\nDave Anderson: Hi, good morning, Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Good morning, Dave.\nDave Anderson: So, North America is softening a little bit, not a surprise. A lot of your fleet, though, is under contract with e-fleet. I think it's around 40% or so. And you're continuing to roll out equipment. So I'm just wondering about the re-contracting of those. I think you typically have like two to three year contracts. I would assume, like, maybe a third of that gets repriced each year or something like that. So what does that look like right now in terms of contracting? I think -- I'm assuming demand still outstrips supply here. So, is pricing able to still move higher in there? Are you doing to blend in, extend deals with some customers who want more? Just a little color around the repricing of that, on the e-fleets.\nJeff Miller: Yeah, well let's -- still see a lot of demand, Dave, for e-fleets. I mean, clearly it's a leading technology and we rolled a couple out this quarter and signed some more contracts. And so, that's a runway through the end of this year and into \u201825 that we see today. We don't have any contracts that expires early till next year. And so, that's a process that we're working through. I'm not going to go through all that on this call, but we're signing up with repeat customers, which is a pretty good indicator of the value that they're creating. So, feel confident about that process, but really don't want to go through it on the call.\nDave Anderson: Totally understand. But would you expect that most of those fleets stay with existing customers?\nJeff Miller: Yeah, I feel -- yes. Yes, still confident. I mean, these are the same customers in some cases that are signing up the second and even beyond their fleets. And so, no reason to believe that they would not. And we\u2019re clearly on the path to the 40% in 2024 and 2025 as well. I mean, I think that's just that trajectory gets clearer every day.\nDave Anderson: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And if I shift over to your international story here, and within the 10% revenue growth, you highlighted Middle East up 5% this quarter sequentially. Can you just talk about that part of the international story for you and kind of how you see that growth? Should growth start to accelerate here? There's big unconventional play over there that I know you're involved in. I don't know if you can talk about any other contracting opportunities with that, but I would -- am I wrong to think that that growth should start to accelerate in the Middle East, even, I mean, within the 10%, I know, but really into next year as well?\nJeff Miller: No, you're not wrong. Look, I'm very confident around our business in the Middle East and as you say, I'm not going to talk about contracts, but Aramco obviously is a fantastic operator and we've got a lot of exposure to both the unconventional and the gas work in Saudi Arabia. We've got -- our typical services, a lot of exposure and even some creative sort of new things. So, I'm very optimistic, actually bullish around Middle East.\nDave Anderson: All right, it's good to hear. Thanks, Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.\nArun Jayaram: Yeah, good morning. Jeff, my first question is on North America. You now expect revenues down 6% to 8% year-over-year. How would you characterize the declines in terms of impact from lower activity levels versus, call it, pricing impacts?\nJeff Miller: Look, it's -- primarily this is activity based. The fact that we -- and then we retired a few fleets during the quarter as well, but this is activity and that's, as we look at activity for the year, gas market actually took a leg down. I didn't think it would come up, but I didn't really expect it to take a leg down either, so it's not flat. And I think M&A takes some time to digest, and so that has an impact on activity broadly and clearly efficiencies. I mean, we've got terrific technology. We talk about efficiencies all the time, but we also catch up to rigs. Glad we're at the leading edge of that technology and that performance makes Halliburton more value, but it really doesn't change the activity outlook.\nArun Jayaram: Understood, understood. Jeff, you've obviously been on the road quite a bit internationally. You expect 10% year-over-year growth this year. I was wondering if you could give us any qualitative or even quantitative thoughts on how you think international spending trends in 2025 for industry and how is growth prospects internationally next year?\nJeff Miller: Look, they look strong for next year internationally. I mean, we see a lot of projects that are either just now being hindered or activity going into next year and in some cases, it takes a while to get the international up and going. And so, probably the activity that picks up [indiscernible] will be where it's sort of NOC driven, which would look in some cases like obviously the Middle East. Others where IOCs are engaged, it takes a lot of negotiation, contract extensions for them. And so, I'm seeing meaningful work. I just talked about my trip to Europe, Africa, and I see meaningful step-up there. Still excited about Latin America and what's possible there. And so, no, I feel really confident both in Halliburton's outlook for \u201825 and the industries.\nArun Jayaram: Great. Thanks a lot.\nJeff Miller: Yeah, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: Yeah, good morning, team. Jeff, I guess the first question just building on North America, what do you think is going to be the driver that forms the bottom in activity? I think you alluded to some of those points around M&A and natural gas, but maybe you can unpack that more. And are you seeing any green shoots in customer conversations that would suggest that $2.8 trillion is the bottom?\nJeff Miller: Yeah, look, I think that customers, in a lot of cases, are working through plans for 2025 now. And, let me maybe just step back and give you kind of where I see capacity and industry structure, because I think that's really important from a services standpoint. We've got -- new equipment is not being built. The old equipment is attriting. And I think that, I talked about retiring fleets this quarter. I mean, this is sort of shrinking of capacity availability and it's happening pretty much in real time, I think, across the board. And clearly as we look at next year, I say all that to say, I do expect an increase in activity around companies that get sort of new plans in place. I expect assets end up in the hands of new teams, which is -- I never bet against North America entrepreneurs. That will happen. I do expect some pick up in gas next year, at least not a leg down from here. So, clearly, I would expect a leg up. And I don't think it takes a lot of activity to firm things up, I think, is the point I'm making here.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks, Jeff. And then just to follow up, it was a very good quarter for free cash flow and the company has been very consistent around $250 million of return of capital. So there's probably two parts to that question. One is, how should we think about working capital in the balance of the year and how should we think about your commitment to returning capital to shareholders?\nEric Carre: Yeah, Neil, it's Eric. So as we said in terms of the working capital, I mean the working capital will evolve in a way that is consistent with our overall guidance of free cash flow being up over 10% compared to last year. We had more of a working capital headwinds in 2023, so that's a significant delta between the two years. And as an organization, we continue to focus on the overall efficiency of working capital as a whole. In terms of cash return, we bought back $250 million in Q1, $250 million in Q2, and I think generally speaking, it's a good kind of guiding point in terms of what we intend at this stage to do for the remaining of 2024.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI.\nJames West: Hey, good morning, Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Good morning, James.\nJames West: So, Jeff, as you think about -- and I don't want to beat a dead horse too much, but if you think about North America going into next year, I'm increasingly bullish on the outlook for \u201825 and certainly for \u201826, both with oil prices where they are and gas prices which should rebound nicely. And we have this huge power demand pull coming from the tech industry. And I think the tech industry is more fully aligned with the oil and gas industry than it's probably ever been. So I'm curious about your customer conversations, how they're thinking about, how do we get this gas to market, how do we size up crews or size up equipment and get ready for what's going to be a surge in demand and kind of pair that with constructing more natural gas-fired power generation and things of that nature to meet data centers and AI demand? How are your conversations kind of evolving there?\nJeff Miller: Look, there's a lot of discussion around what to do with gas. I think your point around data centers and alignment, it just -- in my view, that will be takeaway for gas at some point. Seems easier to lay data lines and gas pipelines. And the -- gas is such a fantastic fuel and resource for this country that I think it's directionally absolutely correct. In terms of timing, I think that will come on. I think it's early to still work through the mechanics of what that means to plants but I expect all that's coming together in the degree to which gas gets taken away that only creates more runway for oil in the Permian Basin. So I'm like -- I'm -- share your excitement around what data centers and AI mean for our industry in terms of natural gas takeaway and we've got a pretty good seat at that and get to watch it really closely and excited.\nJames West: Got it. Okay. That makes a lot of sense. And then iCruise, you mentioned adoption. Now, I mean, we had great adoption internationally, but it sounds like you're getting better adoption in the US as well. Could you maybe highlight, kind of, what you're seeing with the iCruise and technology and how that's unfolding?\nJeff Miller: Yeah, thanks. Look, man, I'm really pleased with the technology in North America and I really like the way we're going to market with it because you were going to market with full services, our own services, we\u2019re also selling direct sales and some rentals and that tells me three things about the technology. It tells me, A, it's in high demand. B, it tells me that it's very reliable because we could sell it that way and C, it's delivering performance And I'm really pleased with the customers that are adopting it because in my view, this kind of adoption is really, these are the gold standard of, in my view, drillers that, good drilling organizations that pick this tool up and say, wow, we really like it. We want more of it. And so, like I said, I think we've got a really good runway around drilling in North America and it's all rooted in sort of investments we've made over quite a few years, but I believe we're there today.\nJames West: Got it. North America is a nice cash flow machine for you guys. Thanks, Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler.\nLuke Lemoine: Hey, good morning.\nJeff Miller: Good morning, Luke.\nLuke Lemoine: Hey, morning. If you kind of revised the international outlook a little bit for this year, could you walk us through some of the puts and takes that have unfolded, or is some of this just a push into \u201825 on the spend?\nJeff Miller: Well, look, we're sort of halfway through the year and we've got really good visibility into the balance of the year. And so I didn't think we'd hit the high end of the range. So wanted to tighten that up for you guys as we look out. Q4 will be the highest international quarter we have, typically with software sales and tool sales. But day in and day out, we're continuing to grow, and we're very focused on profitable growth. And as I think I alluded to earlier, my expectation is that we see a continuing march internationally of growth. And oil price says that, our clients are saying that, my own project inventory is saying that. So if you describe it as a push, that's one way to think about it. But just from where we sit today, I know what we can get done and I thought it would be worthwhile to narrow that a bit.\nLuke Lemoine: Okay. And then you touched on it a little bit earlier, but could you walk through some of the various unconventional international opportunities you're seeing develop over the next two or three years?\nJeff Miller: Certainly. Look, Saudi Arabia and Argentina today are meaningful markets that are -- really have heft and are executing. The -- and I think what has changed and so the rest of the middle east I'm excited about and Middle East is a pretty big place if you think about it in terms of sort of from the Mediterranean all the way to back into Saudi, that's a long way. But there's a lot of activity being talked about. And I think we're right in the middle of those, I think. I know we're in the middle of those discussions. We've got a lot of experience in this. And I think what's different today is the sort of ability to accept sort of what the testing is. The early days activity of this, I think there's a lot of sort of we've seen starts and stops internationally, but now we have a proven model in two international markets where you get through the initial phase and then it becomes a meaningful contributor to production and I think that's being sort of seen by other places where they have good reservoirs, good rock and working through, I think, very thoughtfully and pragmatically what does it take to get from A to B. And so from my perspective, that's a much better discussion than sort of a scramble or wildcat sort of move all over the world. These are very serious operators that are taking a long view.\nLuke Lemoine: Okay. Thanks, Jeff.\nJeff Miller: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Saurabh Pant with Bank of America.\nSaurabh Pant: Hi. Good morning, Jeff and Eric.\nJeff Miller: Good morning, Saurabh.\nEric Carre: Hey, Saurabh. How are you?\nSaurabh Pant: Good. Thank you. Maybe, Jeff, I'll start with a question on D&E margin. Obviously, Eric, you guided to the third quarter, but anything beyond that, not just fourth quarter, but \u201825, how should we think about margin expansion opportunity because this is a primarily international driven business, right? How should we think about the impact from net pricing improvement, technology uptake? I know you talked about Landmark, right? But just help us a little bit with the margin expansion opportunity in D&E.\nEric Carre: Yeah, I think the way to look at D&E margins is really the progression on year-on-year basis. There tends to be quite a bit of difference between different quarters as we recognize revenue around software impacts mostly Q1, Q4, et cetera. So it's really the year-on-year progression by quarter that you need to pay attention to from that perspective. We continue to improve the margins in D&E. We firmly believe that it continues as we get into next year. Jeff talked about the progression of the directional drilling business in North America. We continue to see progression and adoption of the new drilling technologies in the international markets as well. So directionally, we continue to be very confident in the growth of our D&E margins as we go into 2025.\nJeff Miller: Maybe a little more color on that, because when I think about our drilling business, we rolled out iCruise, which is the drilling tool, the BHA, and then, that penetration has grown to -- we're drilling a lot more feet with our iCruise than we are our legacy tools. Probably, 60%, 70% percent of our fleet is that today. But what follows on that is an equal sort of step-up in efficiency, performance and actually margin for us around our iStar technology, which is basically the LWD technology that goes with it. And that adoption or actually implementation is much less, I want to say, in the 20% range. So we've got a very good glide path of things that structurally improve margins for the most part D&E. And so I see that as part of my confidence around, look, we just need to continue to retire the old as it's time and replace it with the new. And that is structurally improving our capital efficiency.\nSaurabh Pant: Okay, fantastic. Now that's helpful. And just one on the production side of things. I know you talked about artificial lifting in your prepared remarks. Good to see international growing at a much faster pace than the overall international market for lift. But if we focus on the production chemicals side of things, I know you acquired Athlon, you've been investing time and money to expand that business, right? Maybe just update us on that, Jeff, where does the production chemicals fit and what's the opportunity just on that side for Halliburton?\nJeff Miller: Well, according to that business, it's clearly part of our portfolio, but it's also an inherently sort of lower returning business than the balance of our business. So we run it like all of our business with a focus on profitability and returns. I'm pleased at the pace we're filling our plant in Saudi Arabia. And that business has a long sales cycle. But we know a lot about chemicals and continue to execute that.\nSaurabh Pant: Okay, fantastic. Okay, Jeff, Eric, thank you. I\u2019ll turn it back.\nJeff Miller: Thank you.\nEric Carre: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citi.\nScott Gruber: Yes, good morning.\nJeff Miller: Good morning.\nEric Carre: Good morning.\nScott Gruber: Good morning. I'm curious, diesel prices have come off a little bit and there's hopes for a natural gas price recovery next year. So, Jeff, I'm curious, what gas price would close the cost of fuel delta between e-frac when using CNG and traditional diesel? I don't think it's $4 or $5 gas. I want to check that with you and just overall how would you describe e-frac economics even in an environment of healthier gas?\nJeff Miller: It's a couple things. It's a lot higher than that to start with. I mean if we just use sort of Btu 6 times, 6 times 4, at $4, you're still a long way from diesel prices. The other thing is the efficiency of the mousetrap. I mean, it's just -- our e-fleets are creating value well beyond the economic trade-off with gas. That's not to say there isn't a lot of runway around economic trade-off with gas, but that platform in and of itself is just a better operating machine and it provides technology for clients that really they can't get -- that's not available in another form. And whether that's AutoFrac, Octiv, what we're doing with sensory in terms of understanding recovery, a lot of this. And so we're able to help solve for delivering what was planned with precision and in measuring performance of what was placed in the reservoir. That's a whole different kettle of fish, but it's all attached to the ZEUS platform. And so all of that runs together. So when I think about e-fleets broadly, yes, there is the gas arbitrage which is happening all the time and like I said, long way to go on gas arbitrage before that ever comes up. But I think more importantly is what we're able to achieve with that technology for our customers.\nScott Gruber: Makes a lot of sense. And ultimately it sounds like Octiv and AutoFrac are going to help kind of further that ultimate penetration for e-frac with your customers and kind of extend any type of saturation point that ultimately could be hit. Just as you think a few years out, as you develop these softwares, develop a platform for a more efficient operation, where do you think e-frac goes as a percent of Halliburton\u2019s fleet? And kind of when do you get there?\nJeff Miller: Well, look, I think we talked about this. We'll eclipse 40% this year. I expect we're at 50% next year. And we continue to invest both in the -- we're at scale today. And that allows us then to both improve or continue to extend the technology around the pump itself and the power systems, and then also the software that we're talking about that really addresses in my view what operators are focused on which is recovery and placement and a whole lot of things that affect productivity over time. And so we're extending that moat around that technology every day. And so I'm confident that as we continue into the future, we've got quite a glide path of ideas and things that will make that, yet again, even more effective for customers over time. So, pleased with where we are there.\nScott Gruber: I appreciate the color, Jeff. Thank you.\nJeff Miller: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Becker with Capital One.\nDoug Becker: Hello?\nJeff Miller: Doug?\nDoug Becker: Yes, can you hear me?\nJeff Miller: I can, good morning.\nDoug Becker: So, Halliburton's North America revenue is regularly outperforming the North America rig count. Just wondering if you could just highlight some of the key drivers of that outperformance that you expect going forward and really asking to try and calibrate how Halliburton's North American revenue might outperform the rig count next year.\nJeff Miller: I think a lot of it, it's -- e-fleets are contracted. That's a large part of our business. The performance is leading in terms of efficiency and technology and we continue to invest in technology that differentiates Halliburton. And that's one of the key things. I mean, it's consistent with our strategy. I'll pivot back to our strategy just for a minute but we want to -- maximizing value in North America means that we're very targeted about what we do, what we invest in, where we spend money and on those things that we know will create differentiation. And clearly, technology is one of those key areas and not technology for the sake of technology but targeted technology that can solve for automation, that can solve for subsurface understanding and measurements, direct measurements. And so, that focus allows us to outperform on the revenue side of that and the maximize value again. That strategy hasn't changed at all and gives me a lot of confidence into \u201825 and beyond in terms of where Halliburton is in the market.\nDoug Becker: I mean, is it too aggressive to think about in a flat North America rig count environment? Halliburton\u2019s revenue is still growing 5% next year in that type of environment.\nJeff Miller: Yeah, I mean, it could be. We need to watch it unfold next year. But look, I -- again, I'll go back to -- our performance in the market is going to outperform. It's early on \u201825 but I\u2019ve got confidence in the technology and the solutions that we provide for our customers that are unique and that puts us in the position to outperform.\nDoug Becker: Right. That completely makes sense. And then just a quick one on the e-fleets. We've been hearing more talk about white space even on dedicated or contracted fleets. Just wanted to get a little bit better sense for your e-fleets. Is there any risk of white space? I fully appreciate that they're long-term contracts and they justify the returns, but just thinking about any potential white space risk on those contracts.\nJeff Miller: No, not the case. Our clients -- that contract -- again, these are contracted with customers with long programs, they're going to use these e-fleets. It will be always -- if there were white space, this is the fleet that they will keep working no matter what. It is -- when you're delivering lower cost of ownership, you are -- and delivering the technology and the client is committed to the fleet, that's the fleet that's always working. And so, no, not worried about that.\nDoug Becker: That's what I wanted to hear. Thank you.\nJeff Miller: Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question today will come from Marc Bianchi with TD Cowen.\nMarc Bianchi: Hey, thank you. The first one I had was on the activity outlook. Jeff, you mentioned that it could improve here from the second half of \u201824, but it sounds like you're stopping short of talking about revenue. And I guess maybe following on some of Doug's question, when you look at how hard it is to call revenue, is price -- uncertainty about price the main thing or maybe talk about the top one, two or three things that are uncertain around revenue versus activity.\nJeff Miller: No, I think the uncertainty around activity is really the driver here. And when we look at the second half of the year, we've had some customers that did -- we caught up with them and they're still customers and they plan to go to work again next year and maybe even later this year. So no, that's not my concern. It is, again, I'll pivot back to our strategy in terms of maximizing value. We've got a lot of tools that allow us to do that technically. And, I think it's just a question of pacing of things happening in -- whether it's setting plans or other things. But, the \u201825 will be, in my view, clearly higher than the second half of 2024.\nMarc Bianchi: Okay, great. And then the other one I had, maybe this one's for Eric, but just looking at the third quarter guide for C&P, the margin reduction sequentially seems pretty steep for the revenue reduction we're getting. Could you talk about maybe some of the moving pieces there, what might be driving that margin weakness?\nEric Carre: Yes, I mean, there's the -- the margin guidance is actually a combination of what we talked about for North America, but really Q3 margins in the international business are going to be lower than Q2 as well. So there's just not too much to read into this except there's a lot of moving parts in the business. It's not just North America. It's multiple product lines as well. So it is not all related to North America.\nMarc Bianchi: Yeah. Great. Thank you. I'll turn it back.\nOperator: That concludes today's question\u2026\nJeff Miller: Okay. Well, thank you. Let's wrap up the call here. I know all of you have a very busy day ahead of you, and maybe I'll give you a few minutes back before your next call. But as we close out today's call, it's important to step back and remember this. Halliburton delivered 18% margins and about $800 million of free cash flow in the second quarter. We're well on track to deliver 10% free cash flow growth this year. Our international business and its technology portfolio have never been stronger. Our strategy to maximize value in North America is working. We are committed to maximizing value, not market share, and I expect that strategy continues to deliver strong returns. Look forward to speaking with you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Eric Carre",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Our Q2 reported net income per diluted share was $0.80. Total company revenue for the second quarter of 2024 was $5.8 billion, flat sequentially. Operating income was $1 billion, a sequential increase of 5%, and operating margin was 18%, a sequential increase of 69 basis points. Beginning with our Completion and Production division, revenue in Q2 was $3.4 billion, sequentially flat. Operating income was $723 million, up 5% when compared to Q1 2024, and operating income margin was 21%. These results were primarily driven by strong international completion and production performance, offsetting softer results in North America. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in Q2 was $2.4 billion, while operating income was $403 million, both sequentially flat from Q1 2024. Operating margin was 17%, a sequential increase of 20 basis points. These results reflect the strength of our global D&E business despite the roll-off of seasonal software sales in Q2 which affected every region. Now, let's move on to geographic results. Our Q2 international revenue increased 3% sequentially. Europe/Africa revenue in the second quarter of 2024 was $757 million, an increase of 4% sequentially. This increase was primarily driven by higher well construction activity and improved wireline activity in Norway, along with increased completion tool sales and higher stimulation activity in West Africa. Middle East Asia revenue in the second quarter of 2024 was $1.5 billion, an increase of 5% sequentially. This increase was primarily related to higher activity in the Middle East across multiple product lines and higher fluid services in Asia. Latin America revenue in the second quarter of 2024 was $1.1 billion, sequentially flat. In North America, revenue was $2.5 billion, representing a 3% decrease sequentially. This decline was primarily driven by decreased pressure pumping services in US land and decreased completion tool sales and testing services in the Gulf of Mexico. Moving on to other items. In Q2, our corporate and other expense was $65 million. For the third quarter of 2024, we expect our corporate expenses to increase slightly. Our SAP deployment remains on budget and is on schedule to conclude in 2025. In Q2, we spend $29 million, or about $0.03 per diluted share, on SAP S4 migration, which is included in our results. For the third quarter, we expect SAP expenses to increase slightly. Net interest expense for the quarter was $92 million. For the third quarter 2024, we expect net interest expense to be roughly flat. Other, net expense for Q2 was $20 million, which was lower than anticipated, driven by favorable FX movements. For the third quarter of 2024, we expect this expense to be approximately $35 million. Our effective tax rate for Q2 was 22.5%, lower than expected due to discrete items. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our third quarter of 2024 effective tax rate to increase approximately 1%. Capital expenditures for Q2 were $347 million. For the full year of 2024, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 6% of revenue. Our Q2 cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion and free cash flow was $793 million. During the quarter, we repurchased $250 million of our common stock. For the full year 2024, we expect free cash flow to be at least 10% higher than in 2023. Now, let me provide you with some comments on our expectations for the third quarter. In our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to be down 1% to 3% and margins to decrease by 75 basis points to 125 basis points. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect sequential revenue to increase 2% to 4% and margins to increase by 25 basis points to 75 basis points. I will now turn the call back to Jeff. Yeah, Neil, it's Eric. So as we said in terms of the working capital, I mean the working capital will evolve in a way that is consistent with our overall guidance of free cash flow being up over 10% compared to last year. We had more of a working capital headwinds in 2023, so that's a significant delta between the two years. And as an organization, we continue to focus on the overall efficiency of working capital as a whole. In terms of cash return, we bought back $250 million in Q1, $250 million in Q2, and I think generally speaking, it's a good kind of guiding point in terms of what we intend at this stage to do for the remaining of 2024. Hey, Saurabh. How are you? Yeah, I think the way to look at D&E margins is really the progression on year-on-year basis. There tends to be quite a bit of difference between different quarters as we recognize revenue around software impacts mostly Q1, Q4, et cetera. So it's really the year-on-year progression by quarter that you need to pay attention to from that perspective. We continue to improve the margins in D&E. We firmly believe that it continues as we get into next year. Jeff talked about the progression of the directional drilling business in North America. We continue to see progression and adoption of the new drilling technologies in the international markets as well. So directionally, we continue to be very confident in the growth of our D&E margins as we go into 2025. Thank you. Good morning. Yes, I mean, there's the -- the margin guidance is actually a combination of what we talked about for North America, but really Q3 margins in the international business are going to be lower than Q2 as well. So there's just not too much to read into this except there's a lot of moving parts in the business. It's not just North America. It's multiple product lines as well. So it is not all related to North America."

            "content": "Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Halliburton delivered solid second quarter results that demonstrated the strength of our international business and the differentiation of our North America service offerings. Here are the quarter highlights. We delivered total company revenue of $5.8 billion and operating margin of 18%. International revenue was $3.4 billion and grew 8% year-over-year, led by Latin America, which delivered a 10% increase. North America revenue was $2.5 billion, an 8% decrease year-over-year compared to a 12% decline in rig count over the same period. Our Drilling and Evaluation division and our Completion and Production division both demonstrated margin improvement year-over-year. Finally, during the second quarter we generated $1.1 billion of cash flow from operations and about $800 million of free cash flow and repurchased $250 million of our common stock. I'll begin our discussion with the international markets, where Halliburton's strategy of profitable growth delivered another solid quarter. International revenue grew 8% year-over-year, with growth demonstrated by each region. This marks the 12th consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth in our international business. As I look ahead for the remainder of this year, my outlook today is consistent with our expectations at the start of the year. I expect steady growth for Halliburton throughout the remainder of 2024. In our international markets, we see strong demand for Halliburton services, high activity levels, and equipment tightness across all major basins. We expect our international business to deliver about 10% revenue growth for the full year. I am pleased with the profitable growth we're seeing across our product lines. And today, I would like to highlight three specific ones in more detail. The first is our Landmark Software business. I recently attended our Landmark Forum, LIFE2024, in Athens, Greece. It is an annual event where we share our latest software innovations and our customers share their successes and future opportunities. While in Athens, I had the opportunity to meet with dozens of customers and they told me how excited they were about our latest offerings like unified ensemble modeling, scalable earth model, and our latest developments in AI and machine learning. These tools change the way customers work by driving efficiencies from asset level planning through production. The conference included customer presentations that showcased their business transformation and their use of Halliburton Landmark's tools. Our customers tell us we create unique value with our iEnergy cloud platform, which seamlessly integrates into their workflows. I am confident that Landmark's DecisionSpace 365 will expand and add to our customers' productivity and innovation journey. Next, Halliburton's artificial lift product line is growing in the international markets at double the rate of our overall international business. It embodies our successful M&A strategy of bolt-on acquisitions that bring leading technology into our portfolio. We organically grow new technologies through our global footprint and through collaboration with our customers to engineer solutions that maximize their assets value. As one example, this quarter we launched our GeoESP line, which is engineered for the harsh geothermal environment. The GeoESP line solves for extreme thermal cycling, scale development, abrasion, and corrosion. While geothermal ESP technology has applications across the globe, Halliburton sees substantial growth opportunities in Europe where customers require advanced technology to bring geothermal to scale. Finally, Halliburton's drilling services are key to our success in the international markets. We had another strong quarter in unconventional drilling with our iCruise X rotary steerable system and our LOGIX autonomous drilling platform. We deployed advancements that improved drilling speed and reliability and set several [general] (ph) records during the quarter. We invest in differentiated drilling technology and we expect our strong performance and reliable execution to drive above-market growth. For example, in the Middle East, our drilling services revenue grew about 30% year-over-year. I am pleased with our international business and look forward to deepening our strategy and delivering additional profitable growth. Turning to North America, our second quarter revenue declined 3% compared to the first quarter. Halliburton's first half 2024 results were largely as we expected. However, as we have seen, rig counts and overall service activity declined through the quarter. As I look to the second half of 2024, I now expect full year North America revenues to decline 6% to 8% versus last year, driven by lower activity. I expect that the second half of 2024 will be near the low point of activity levels this cycle, and while it's too early to give specific guidance for 2025 in North America, I expect activity to be directionally higher than the second half of 2024. Here's how I think about this. First, I expect an increase in activity after E&P companies complete their acquisitions and establish new development plans. Second, some of the merged assets will be divested to smaller operators who will put them to work. Finally, I expect some recovery in natural gas activity. Six years ago, when we set our strategy to maximize value in North America, I understood it may take a market like we see today where North America activity declined by over 200 rigs in the last 18 months to demonstrate the margin resilience and earnings power of our strategy. I am pleased that Halliburton delivered strong C&P margins through this period and I am confident that our strategy will deliver strong results in the future. We're committed to our strategy to maximize value in North America because it delivers shareholder value and it is the right strategy for this market. For Halliburton, we focused on returns. We allocate capital to the markets and products that drive superior returns and margins. We prioritize returns over market share, and to that end, we retired a few fleets this quarter. We developed differentiated technologies to solve for the unique requirements of the North America market. And lastly, we improve efficiencies for our customers through those technologies, service quality, and execution. I expect this strategy will deliver leading performance for our customers and a structurally more resilient North America business for Halliburton. A key part of how we do this is our strategic investment in technology. One technology I'm excited about is the latest addition to Octiv, a key component of the ZEUS platform. Today, Octiv is a cornerstone of how we deliver large multi-well pads with unmatched precision and consistency. As our customers execute completions with ever-increasing size and intensity, automation, as delivered by Octiv, provides better control and more effective delivery for simul-frac and trimulfrac operations. During the second quarter, we completed field trials of the latest level of Octiv automation called AutoFrac. With the single click of a button, AutoFrac executes the entire frac job from ramp up at the start to ramp down at the end, making autonomous fracturing a reality. This new level of automation gives customers control to execute the frac design exactly how they want it without human intervention. Following our commercial trials, AutoFrac is ready to scale and I'm excited about what this technology means for our customers and for Halliburton. Lastly, we see rapid adoption in North America of our iCruise rotary steerable system. We consistently reduce drilling times for our customers and create significant value. In the Permian Basin, the number of rigs running the system has increased by almost 45% since the start of this year. We are on pace to triple our footage drilled in North America this year and I'm excited about the market adoption of iCruise. North America is the largest oilfield services market in the world. We are crystal clear on how we maximize value in North America. We have demonstrated that this strategy works. And that's why I am confident that we will continue to deliver strong returns through this cycle. To step back, Halliburton's returns and cash flows are strong and I am pleased with our performance this quarter. I'm just back from a few weeks in Europe/Africa. What I saw is a microcosm of Halliburton around the world. The quality of our people, the clarity of our strategy, our leading technologies, the depth of our pipeline of opportunities, and the competitiveness of our business segments all give me incredible confidence in Halliburton's future. Now, I'll turn the call over to Eric to provide a few more details on our financial results. Eric? Thanks, Eric. Here are a few key points I would like you to take away from our discussion today. I am pleased with our 18% margins and about $800 million of free cash flow in the second quarter. We are well on track to deliver over 10% free cash flow growth this year. I'm excited about our international business where our technology portfolio has never been stronger. I am confident that our strategy to maximize value in North America is working, and I expect it continues to deliver strong returns. Finally, I am convinced that our collaborative approach and value proposition differentiate us from our competitors and are directly aligned with how our customers expect to drive improved performance. And now, let's open it up for questions. Good morning, Dave. Yeah, well let's -- still see a lot of demand, Dave, for e-fleets. I mean, clearly it's a leading technology and we rolled a couple out this quarter and signed some more contracts. And so, that's a runway through the end of this year and into \u201825 that we see today. We don't have any contracts that expires early till next year. And so, that's a process that we're working through. I'm not going to go through all that on this call, but we're signing up with repeat customers, which is a pretty good indicator of the value that they're creating. So, feel confident about that process, but really don't want to go through it on the call. Yeah, I feel -- yes. Yes, still confident. I mean, these are the same customers in some cases that are signing up the second and even beyond their fleets. And so, no reason to believe that they would not. And we're clearly on the path to the 40% in 2024 and 2025 as well. I mean, I think that's just that trajectory gets clearer every day. No, you're not wrong. Look, I'm very confident around our business in the Middle East and as you say, I'm not going to talk about contracts, but Aramco obviously is a fantastic operator and we've got a lot of exposure to both the unconventional and the gas work in Saudi Arabia. We've got -- our typical services, a lot of exposure and even some creative sort of new things. So, I'm very optimistic, actually bullish around Middle East. Thank you. Look, it's -- primarily this is activity based. The fact that we -- and then we retired a few fleets during the quarter as well, but this is activity and that's, as we look at activity for the year, gas market actually took a leg down. I didn't think it would come up, but I didn't really expect it to take a leg down either, so it's not flat. And I think M&A takes some time to digest, and so that has an impact on activity broadly and clearly efficiencies. I mean, we've got terrific technology. We talk about efficiencies all the time, but we also catch up to rigs. Glad we're at the leading edge of that technology and that performance makes Halliburton more value, but it really doesn't change the activity outlook. Look, they look strong for next year internationally. I mean, we see a lot of projects that are either just now being hindered or activity going into next year and in some cases, it takes a while to get the international up and going. And so, probably the activity that picks up [indiscernible] will be where it's sort of NOC driven, which would look in some cases like obviously the Middle East. Others where IOCs are engaged, it takes a lot of negotiation, contract extensions for them. And so, I'm seeing meaningful work. I just talked about my trip to Europe, Africa, and I see meaningful step-up there. Still excited about Latin America and what's possible there. And so, no, I feel really confident both in Halliburton's outlook for \u201825 and the industries. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, look, I think that customers, in a lot of cases, are working through plans for 2025 now. And, let me maybe just step back and give you kind of where I see capacity and industry structure, because I think that's really important from a services standpoint. We've got -- new equipment is not being built. The old equipment is attriting. And I think that, I talked about retiring fleets this quarter. I mean, this is sort of shrinking of capacity availability and it's happening pretty much in real time, I think, across the board. And clearly as we look at next year, I say all that to say, I do expect an increase in activity around companies that get sort of new plans in place. I expect assets end up in the hands of new teams, which is -- I never bet against North America entrepreneurs. That will happen. I do expect some pick up in gas next year, at least not a leg down from here. So, clearly, I would expect a leg up. And I don't think it takes a lot of activity to firm things up, I think, is the point I'm making here. Good morning, James. Look, there's a lot of discussion around what to do with gas. I think your point around data centers and alignment, it just -- in my view, that will be takeaway for gas at some point. Seems easier to lay data lines and gas pipelines. And the -- gas is such a fantastic fuel and resource for this country that I think it's directionally absolutely correct. In terms of timing, I think that will come on. I think it's early to still work through the mechanics of what that means to plants but I expect all that's coming together in the degree to which gas gets taken away that only creates more runway for oil in the Permian Basin. So I'm like -- I'm -- share your excitement around what data centers and AI mean for our industry in terms of natural gas takeaway and we've got a pretty good seat at that and get to watch it really closely and excited. Yeah, thanks. Look, man, I'm really pleased with the technology in North America and I really like the way we're going to market with it because you were going to market with full services, our own services, we're also selling direct sales and some rentals and that tells me three things about the technology. It tells me, A, it's in high demand. B, it tells me that it's very reliable because we could sell it that way and C, it's delivering performance And I'm really pleased with the customers that are adopting it because in my view, this kind of adoption is really, these are the gold standard of, in my view, drillers that, good drilling organizations that pick this tool up and say, wow, we really like it. We want more of it. And so, like I said, I think we've got a really good runway around drilling in North America and it's all rooted in sort of investments we've made over quite a few years, but I believe we're there today. Thank you. Good morning, Luke. Well, look, we're sort of halfway through the year and we've got really good visibility into the balance of the year. And so I didn't think we'd hit the high end of the range. So wanted to tighten that up for you guys as we look out. Q4 will be the highest international quarter we have, typically with software sales and tool sales. But day in and day out, we're continuing to grow, and we're very focused on profitable growth. And as I think I alluded to earlier, my expectation is that we see a continuing march internationally of growth. And oil price says that, our clients are saying that, my own project inventory is saying that. So if you describe it as a push, that's one way to think about it. But just from where we sit today, I know what we can get done and I thought it would be worthwhile to narrow that a bit. Certainly. Look, Saudi Arabia and Argentina today are meaningful markets that are -- really have heft and are executing. The -- and I think what has changed and so the rest of the middle east I'm excited about and Middle East is a pretty big place if you think about it in terms of sort of from the Mediterranean all the way to back into Saudi, that's a long way. But there's a lot of activity being talked about. And I think we're right in the middle of those, I think. I know we're in the middle of those discussions. We've got a lot of experience in this. And I think what's different today is the sort of ability to accept sort of what the testing is. The early days activity of this, I think there's a lot of sort of we've seen starts and stops internationally, but now we have a proven model in two international markets where you get through the initial phase and then it becomes a meaningful contributor to production and I think that's being sort of seen by other places where they have good reservoirs, good rock and working through, I think, very thoughtfully and pragmatically what does it take to get from A to B. And so from my perspective, that's a much better discussion than sort of a scramble or wildcat sort of move all over the world. These are very serious operators that are taking a long view. Thank you. Good morning, Saurabh. Maybe a little more color on that, because when I think about our drilling business, we rolled out iCruise, which is the drilling tool, the BHA, and then, that penetration has grown to -- we're drilling a lot more feet with our iCruise than we are our legacy tools. Probably, 60%, 70% percent of our fleet is that today. But what follows on that is an equal sort of step-up in efficiency, performance and actually margin for us around our iStar technology, which is basically the LWD technology that goes with it. And that adoption or actually implementation is much less, I want to say, in the 20% range. So we've got a very good glide path of things that structurally improve margins for the most part D&E. And so I see that as part of my confidence around, look, we just need to continue to retire the old as it's time and replace it with the new. And that is structurally improving our capital efficiency. Well, according to that business, it's clearly part of our portfolio, but it's also an inherently sort of lower returning business than the balance of our business. So we run it like all of our business with a focus on profitability and returns. I'm pleased at the pace we're filling our plant in Saudi Arabia. And that business has a long sales cycle. But we know a lot about chemicals and continue to execute that. Thank you. Good morning. It's a couple things. It's a lot higher than that to start with. I mean if we just use sort of Btu 6 times, 6 times 4, at $4, you're still a long way from diesel prices. The other thing is the efficiency of the mousetrap. I mean, it's just -- our e-fleets are creating value well beyond the economic trade-off with gas. That's not to say there isn't a lot of runway around economic trade-off with gas, but that platform in and of itself is just a better operating machine and it provides technology for clients that really they can't get -- that's not available in another form. And whether that's AutoFrac, Octiv, what we're doing with sensory in terms of understanding recovery, a lot of this. And so we're able to help solve for delivering what was planned with precision and in measuring performance of what was placed in the reservoir. That's a whole different kettle of fish, but it's all attached to the ZEUS platform. And so all of that runs together. So when I think about e-fleets broadly, yes, there is the gas arbitrage which is happening all the time and like I said, long way to go on gas arbitrage before that ever comes up. But I think more importantly is what we're able to achieve with that technology for our customers. Well, look, I think we talked about this. We'll eclipse 40% this year. I expect we're at 50% next year. And we continue to invest both in the -- we're at scale today. And that allows us then to both improve or continue to extend the technology around the pump itself and the power systems, and then also the software that we're talking about that really addresses in my view what operators are focused on which is recovery and placement and a whole lot of things that affect productivity over time. And so we're extending that moat around that technology every day. And so I'm confident that as we continue into the future, we've got quite a glide path of ideas and things that will make that, yet again, even more effective for customers over time. So, pleased with where we are there. Thank you. Doug? I can, good morning. I think a lot of it, it's -- e-fleets are contracted. That's a large part of our business. The performance is leading in terms of efficiency and technology and we continue to invest in technology that differentiates Halliburton. And that's one of the key things. I mean, it's consistent with our strategy. I'll pivot back to our strategy just for a minute but we want to -- maximizing value in North America means that we're very targeted about what we do, what we invest in, where we spend money and on those things that we know will create differentiation. And clearly, technology is one of those key areas and not technology for the sake of technology but targeted technology that can solve for automation, that can solve for subsurface understanding and measurements, direct measurements. And so, that focus allows us to outperform on the revenue side of that and the maximize value again. That strategy hasn't changed at all and gives me a lot of confidence into \u201825 and beyond in terms of where Halliburton is in the market. Yeah, I mean, it could be. We need to watch it unfold next year. But look, I -- again, I'll go back to -- our performance in the market is going to outperform. It's early on \u201825 but I've got confidence in the technology and the solutions that we provide for our customers that are unique and that puts us in the position to outperform. No, not the case. Our clients -- that contract -- again, these are contracted with customers with long programs, they're going to use these e-fleets. It will be always -- if there were white space, this is the fleet that they will keep working no matter what. It is -- when you're delivering lower cost of ownership, you are -- and delivering the technology and the client is committed to the fleet, that's the fleet that's always working. And so, no, not worried about that. Thank you. No, I think the uncertainty around activity is really the driver here. And when we look at the second half of the year, we've had some customers that did -- we caught up with them and they're still customers and they plan to go to work again next year and maybe even later this year. So no, that's not my concern. It is, again, I'll pivot back to our strategy in terms of maximizing value. We've got a lot of tools that allow us to do that technically. And, I think it's just a question of pacing of things happening in -- whether it's setting plans or other things. But, the \u201825 will be, in my view, clearly higher than the second half of 2024. Okay. Well, thank you. Let's wrap up the call here. I know all of you have a very busy day ahead of you, and maybe I'll give you a few minutes back before your next call. But as we close out today's call, it's important to step back and remember this. Halliburton delivered 18% margins and about $800 million of free cash flow in the second quarter. We're well on track to deliver 10% free cash flow growth this year. Our international business and its technology portfolio have never been stronger. Our strategy to maximize value in North America is working. We are committed to maximizing value, not market share, and I expect that strategy continues to deliver strong returns. Look forward to speaking with you next quarter."

We will make the recording of today's webcast available for seven days on Halliburton's website after this call. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO; and Eric Carre, Executive Vice President, and CFO. Some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, recent current reports on Form 8-K, and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our first quarter earnings release and in the Quarterly Results & Presentation section of our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeffrey Miller: Thank you, David, and good morning everyone. Halliburton delivered solid first quarter results that again demonstrated the power of our strategy and the strength of our execution. Here are the quarter highlights. We delivered total company revenue of $5.8 billion, and operating margin of 17%. Both divisions demonstrated margin improvement year-over-year. International revenue was $3.3 billion, and grew 12% year-over-year, led by Latin America, which delivered a 21% increase. North America revenue was $2.5 billion, a 5% increase over the fourth quarter of 2023. Finally, during the first quarter, we generated $487 million of cash flow from operations, $206 million of free cash flow, and repurchased $250 million of our common stock. Let me begin today's discussion with my views on the strength of the oilfield services market. Global energy use is on the rise, with crude oil demand projected to grow between 1.2 million and 2.3 million barrels per day in 2024. This demand growth is greatest in non-OECD countries, where we expect more per capita energy consumption, not less as they develop their economies and improve their quality of life. Globally, secure, reliable hydrocarbon production powers industries, moves people, and advances economies. In the U.S., after stable electricity demand for nearly two decades, we now expect it to grow more than 15% by 2030. Today, over 40% of United States electricity is supplied by natural gas, and we expect strong demand for natural gas as a base fuel well into the future. The world requires more energy, not less, and I'm more convinced than ever that oil and gas will fill a critical role in the global energy mix for decades to come. My outlook is confirmed by our customers' multiyear activity plans across multiple markets and asset types. Everything I see points towards long-term growth for Halliburton's services. My outlook for the industry is not new, and it drives our focus on oilfield services, and sets our strategy. This focus is the basis for our technology investment, capital allocation, and culture. This multiyear upcycle together with our successful strategy execution make this a great time for Halliburton. Now, let's turn to international markets, where Halliburton's strategy of profitable growth delivered another solid quarter. International revenue grew 12% year-over-year with growth demonstrated by each region. This marks the 11th consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth in our international business. For 2024, I expect full-year revenue growth in the low double-digits. Equally important, the international market remains tight for equipment, and people, and therefore, we expect to see margin expansion over last year. One of the many things that excites me about our international business is our technology that creates meaningful value for our customers, and drives above-market growth for Halliburton. In the Drilling and Evaluation Division, our leading formation evaluation tools such as the EarthStar X logging-while-drilling system, and our Reservoir Xaminer Formation Sampling Service, both see strong adoption and increasing levels of demand. The advanced measurements these systems provide create unique insights for our customers and drive profitable growth for Halliburton. In the Completion and Production division, our Artificial Lift technology continues to generate profitable growth throughout each of our international regions. Our electric submersible pump portfolio proved to be a market leader in the competitive North America market, and we expect to deliver similar results over time in the international markets. Our complete solution, which includes downhole motors, pumps, and surface systems with remote monitoring and automation, provides an end-to-end solution, and the ability to operate at scale. A great example is in Kuwait, where in less than three years, we captured a nearly 20% market share with over 700 ESP installs. Before we move on, I want to share an observation. I'm consistently seeing more global interest in unconventionals. I can recall over a decade ago, the global scramble to find unconventionals with limited success. Today, two significant markets outside of North America achieve scale, which serves as a proof point for what is possible, and drives interest by others. As global markets grow, the technologies and processes Halliburton developed as the leader in North America over the last three decades have broad applications to unconventional reservoirs throughout the world, which makes this a fantastic long-term opportunity for Halliburton. I'm confident in the duration of this international upcycle in 2024 and beyond. Turning to North America, our first quarter revenue grew 5% over last quarter. As expected, North America land completion activity bottomed in the fourth quarter of last year and rebounded in the first quarter as our customers quickly resumed operations after the holidays. Looking ahead for the rest of 2024 in North America, we expect steady activity levels for Halliburton. Our customers are planning for the long-term and I expect they will execute work throughout the year as planned. This is consistent with a more industrialized approach to asset development in North America. And while we expect an eventual recovery in natural gas activity driven by demand from LNG expansions, our 2024 plan does not anticipate this recovery. Overall, we expect that full-year North America revenue and margins will be flattish compared with 2023 levels. Clearly, our strategy is to maximize value in North America. We do it in multiple ways. Today, I want to talk about two of them. The first is the ZEUS platform and the second is our new North America focused directional drilling system. The ZEUS platform, its electrification, automation and subsurface diagnostics continue to advance. This quarter, we introduced Sensory, which is the latest generation of our subsurface measurement technology. Sensory provides an easy to deploy, cost effective and automated system for real time subsurface measurement of fracturing operations. Additionally, our automation technologies are at the heart of our highly efficient simul-frac and trimul-frac operations and they continue to expand their capabilities creating value for Halliburton and our customers. The ZEUS platform demonstrates its uniqueness every day. And importantly, it's deployed at scale. Our scale allows for rapid technology innovation. Each technology improvement to the ZEUS platform widens the moat around our leading position in the fracturing market. This creates outsized value for Halliburton and our customers. I am pleased with the results we see in North America from our drilling services product line, which late last year launched a new version of our iCruise Rotary Steerable System specifically engineered for the North America unconventional market. The new iCruise CX system is designed for the challenging curve and lateral applications in North America. The system's performance is driving strong uptake and this quarter, our iCruise footage drilled in North America more than doubled over last year. We also coupled this high performing system with an asset light sales and rental model that increases the addressable market when compared to a full-service model. This is how iCruise CX both participates in new market segments and increases its speed of market penetration. The key trend that I see in North America drilling is the move to longer laterals and more complex wells which customers drill to improve economics. iCruise CX is specifically designed for these applications. And its performance is why I am excited about Halliburton's growth in the North America drilling market. To close out, I would like to thank our employees. I regularly hear from our customers about the work you do. How much it means to them, and how your execution of our value proposition differentiates Halliburton from our competitors. Well done. I am excited about the business outlook for Halliburton. Energy demand growth is strong and so is demand for our services. I expect that our focus on oilfield services and execution of our strategy will generate strong free cash flow and shareholder returns. This quarter, Halliburton repurchased $250 million of our common stock, a solid start to the year and a good benchmark for our expectations going forward. Now, I'll turn the call over to Eric to provide more details of our financial results. Eric?\nEric Carre: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Our Q1 reported net income per diluted share was $0.68. Adjusted net income per diluted share was $0.76. Total company revenue for the first quarter of 2024 was $5.8 billion. Operating income was $987 million. And operating margin was 17%; flat compared to Q1 2023. Beginning with our Completion and Production division; revenue in Q1 was $3.4 billion, down slightly from Q1 2023. Operating income was $688 million, up 3% when compared to Q1 2023. And operating income margin was 20%. Compared to Q1 of last year, these results were primarily driven by reduced pressure pumping services in U.S. land. Partially offset by higher activity in international markets. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in Q1 was $2.4 billion, an increase of 7% compared to Q1 2023. Operating income was $398 million, up 8%, and operating margin was 16%, an increase of 10 basis points over Q1 last year. These results were primarily driven by higher drilling-related services in the Middle East and North America as well as improvements across multiple product lines in Latin America. Now let's move on to geographic results. Our Q1 international revenue increased 12% year over year. Europe/Africa revenue in the first quarter of 2024 was $729 million, an increase of 10% year over year. This increase was primarily driven by higher completion tool sales in the region and fluid services in Norway and the Caspian area. Middle East/Asia revenue in the first quarter of 2024 was $1.4 million, an increase of 6% year over year. This increase was primarily related to improved activity in multiple product service lines in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Oman. Latin America revenue in the first quarter of 2024 was $1.1 billion, an increase of 21% year over year. This improvement was primarily related to higher drilling-related services and increased software sales in Mexico, improved pressure pumping service and fluid services in Argentina, and increased activity in multi-product service lines in Brazil and Ecuador. In North America, revenue was $2.5 billion, representing an 8% decrease year over year, but a 5% increase from the last quarter. This year-over-year decline was primarily driven by lower pressure pumping services in U.S. land as well as lower wireline activity. Moving on to other items, in Q1, our corporate and other expense was $65 million. For the second quarter of 2024, we expect our corporate expenses to be approximately flat. Our SAP deployment remains on budget and is on schedule to conclude in 2025. In Q1, we spent $34 million, or about $0.04 per diluted share, on SAP S4 migration, which is included in our results. For the second quarter, we expect SAP expenses to be approximately flat. Net interest expense for the quarter was $92 million. For the second quarter 2024, we expect net interest expense to be roughly flat. Other net expense for Q1 was $108 million, higher than expected, primarily due to impairment of an investment in Argentina and currency devaluation in Egypt. For the second quarter 2024, we expect this expense to be approximately $35 million. Our adjusted effective tax rate for Q1 was 21.5%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our second quarter 2024 effective tax rate to increase approximately 75 basis points. Capital expenditures for Q1 were $330 million. For the full year of 2024, we expect capital expenditures to remain approximately 6% of revenue. Our Q1 cash flow from operations was $487 million, and free cash flow was $206 million. During the quarter, we repurchased $250 million of our common stock. For the full year 2024, we expect free cash flow to be at least 10% higher than 2023. Now let me provide you with some comments on our expectations for the second quarter. In our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to be up 2% to 4% and margins to increase by 25 to 75 basis points. In our drilling and evaluation division, we expect sequential revenue to increase 1% to 3% and margins to increase by 25 to 75 basis points. I will now turn the call back to Jeff.\nJeffrey Miller: Thanks, Eric. Let me summarize our discussion today. Halliburton delivered solid first quarter results. I am confident in the strength and duration of this up cycle. We expect our North America business to deliver flattish revenues and margins year-on-year despite lower activity levels. We also expect our international business revenue to grow at low double digits year-on-year. I'm excited about the outlook for Halliburton and expect Halliburton to deliver strong free cash flow and shareholder returns. And now let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment for our first question, and it comes from the line of David Anderson with Barclays. Please proceed.\nDavid Anderson: Thanks. Good morning, Jeff. I want to ask you about a couple of things that you talked about in your prepared remarks. And the first is on the ZEUS fleet. You had an impressive 5% sequential increase in North America this quarter, despite the flat rate count. I have to think it's probably attributed to these e-fleets being rolled out. It's pretty clear, this is a big step change in efficiency for your customer, and demand seems to be exceeding supply at least for the next couple of years, but I guess, the question is what prevents the industry from building out? And can you talk about your competitive advantage today and how you maintain that? You were first to market, establish leadership, but is there differentiated technology? Is it more about relationships? I guess, the question is really on the moat on this business as you see it over the next few years.\nJeffrey Miller: Yes. Thank you, Dave. Look, the most important point is this is a comprehensive platform. ZEUS is a platform. Clearly, it's electric. Yes, it drives efficiency, but the embedded automation actually really changes the dynamics of how it performs. And then, also the subsurface measurements with Sensory that are embedded in this system, and uniquely embedded. And so, that widens the moat. And I think equally important is being at scale. So, it's one thing to do a research project around a thing, but when we're working at scale, these are solutions that can be pushed to the platform at any point in time. So, it's really the ability to grow the moat on existing equipment as well as any new turns on the science as it goes forward. So, I'm super excited about it. Yes, obviously lowest TCO, but it's the technology differentiation as well that widens the moat.\nDavid Anderson: And then, just to touch on something else, you had talked about some unconventional fields in international markets. Clearly, one of the big stories this year has been the Saudi shift in CapEx from offshore towards those unconventionals, specifically around Jafurah. You have a toehold in that field with that liquid mud plant facility, but this is just starting development. My understanding is there's a bunch of tenders on the way more coming. Can you talk about sort of the opportunity set for Halliburton on this field in the near-term, maybe incremental growth you see in '25? And how do you support these build-outs? You said capacity is really tight in the market. Is this a market maybe you bring some diesel fleets in there? Is there other equipment in the region, or how do you think about that, the tightness and the capacity as it relates to building out to some conventional field?\nJeffrey Miller: Thank you, David. And I'm really excited about it. And there's a lot of opportunity for Halliburton around unconventionals, as you know. How we address it, we've got a lot of ways to address it, including some of the technology we've talked about today. We've got a good position in there, but I think with even more opportunity to grow, particularly with drilling technology that continues to advance. You mentioned mud, but also other aspects of that where we'll be very competitive. So, I think that's a big move forward. And I think more broadly, so good for Halliburton, but I think that more broadly, just the discussion around unconventionals internationally, what can you see today are two markets, at least outside the U.S., that are truly at scale. And I think that serves as a bit of a template for how that can be done, because it was really unclear a decade ago, as you recall. But I think we're in a different place with unconventionals today. And so, we do hear more discussion around, hey, this is possible, and how Halliburton would play a more meaningful role in that in additional markets, so super encouraged.\nDavid Anderson: Thank you, Jeff.\nJeffrey Miller: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. One moment, it comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning, Jeff, and team. Jeff, you've talked about wanting to drive your free cash flow per share higher. And so, it's great to see the share repurchases for a couple quarters run rating at this $250 million mark. Can you talk about why you think that's the right number to use going forward? And how does share repurchase fit in the seriatim of capital allocation?\nEric Carre: Yes, Neil, it's Eric. So, the baseline that we use is the framework that we announced several quarters ago to return a minimum of 50% of free cash flow to shareholders. We actually returned over that at just about 60% in 2023. So, when we look at the improvements in free cash flow year-over-year, which we mentioned to be about 10%. So, when we think through that, we think that the $250 million of buyback is a good base load for us to be repurchasing shares. So, expect more buybacks in dollars, expect more overall returns to shareholder dollar-wise, and then, we see where the overall percentage lands, but it should be pretty close to what we did last year. Yes.\nNeil Mehta: Okay. That's really helpful. And then, the follow-up is, we are seeing signs of industry consolidation, certainly more in E&P and services, but we start to see some in services as well. Halliburton always struck us as more of a organically driven business, but be curious on how you're thinking about M&A as you plan to go forward for the business?\nJeffrey Miller: Look, Neil, no change to our strategy. You're correct. We like bolt-on M&A technology acquisitions. We think about M&A in terms really of research and development. Is it something that advances research? Does it move it more quickly so that we get to market more quickly? But we see significant organic growth in the businesses that we're in. And so, we like where we are and we see plenty of growth. And we also, I believe that organic growth generates more value for shareholders. And we've seen that with other things that we've done in the past in terms of small acquisitions that we're able to then grow and push through our channel. But we like the space where we compete and we like the technology and how we develop that. And so, you shouldn't expect any change from Halliburton.\nNeil Mehta: All right. Thanks, team.\nJeffrey Miller: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And it comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JP Morgan Securities. Please proceed.\nArun Jayaram: Yes. Good morning, Jeff. I wanted to see if you could characterize your thoughts on the future prospects of the OpEx versus the D&C cycle on a go forward basis. Can you talk about your current leverage to OpEx and production? And is this an area strategically you'd like to grow either organically or inorganically over time?\nJeffrey Miller: Yes. Well, I want to answer the second part of that first in terms of organically. Yes. So, we don't see a change to our strategy or approach to markets. So, yes, we do see quite a bit of organic growth for us in the OpEx part of the market. We're in that business today. We've got strong, I mean, strong lift business today. We're in the chemicals business today. And we're in the intervention business today in a pretty big way. And we continue to develop technology similar to as we've done in the past. And so, it's my outlook for OpEx cycle. We've got plenty of exposure to that and have had. Now, I want to be careful and say the D&C cycle is very strong and continues to grow. And I suspect that it continues to grow also. So, I think we're well balanced across really all elements of this, whether it's exploration, development, drilling, and OpEx today. Some of the things we've done in the past, again, we bought smaller businesses that we've grown into bigger businesses. And so, again, a strategy that works for us and it delivers the organic growth that we believe is really good for our shareholders.\nArun Jayaram: Great. Jeff, second question is, I wanted to see if you could give us your perspective on any potential impact to how from the changing mix of activity in Saudi Arabia, which looks to be a little bit more onshore versus shallow water. And maybe you could just talk about the year over growth in MENA, which at 6% seemed a little bit lower than we were expecting.\nJeffrey Miller: Well, I think the first part of that in terms of Saudi growth, '24 is still growing, by the way. We expect growth in Saudi in '24. And the rebalancing, the gas and unconventionals is very good for Halliburton. We've got a very strong onshore business in Saudi Arabia. We participate in all aspects of that market. And that market remains tight for equipment. So, I feel good about that market. And I'm very confident in the long-term growth of that market. The rebalancing again to gas is, we're meaningful players in that part of the market and expect that will only be good for Halliburton. Pivot to growth, look, a couple of things. Number one, international business grew 12% overall. So, I want to start there. Clearly, I'd expect more growth in the region, but here's what we're doing. I want to be really clear that profitable growth has been our primary focus. We see a good pipeline of opportunities. We expect to continue to see growth in MENA. But at the same time, we want to make certain we're building a foundation shipment for growth. That means that we are delivering the technology, we're making the investment while expanding margins and growing, and that's been sort of our mantra, our strategy is profitable international growth. And that's what we saw this quarter.\nArun Jayaram: Thanks, Jeff.\nJeffrey Miller: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment for our next question, please. And it comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.\nRoger Read: Yes, thanks. Good morning. Jeff, I'd like to get back in on the international growth. So, double digits, what you've delivered, double digits, where you're guiding or where you're headed. How much of this would you describe as due to new products or products and services or new markets and how much of it to just underlying expansion? Why don't you get kind of an -- you've talked about a lot of the new stuff you're putting in, just how effective that is in driving some of this growth?\nJeffrey Miller: Yes, thanks. Look, I think the growth is broad based, but the technology matters. It's not necessarily new products. It's actually an expanding market. A couple of things are happening at one time, yes, activity is growing, but we're participating in a larger share of that growth than maybe in the past based on some of the technology I described. So, we're competing differently technically, and so we get a bigger part of that growth. We've added some new things, yes, like Lift internationally, that's a new product for growth, a new product that's a whole business, but it's growth end markets, and we're really pleased with the progress that that's making. And then, obviously, pricing in the tight market internationally helps us well because that's helping growth all around. But I would not overlook the importance of the improvement in drilling technology, particularly just because it's more access to a larger market and at a much better rate of return for us given the improvement over legacy technology. The capital efficiency of the new technology is probably is right about 40% more capital efficient than the legacy tools. So, getting sort of improvement along several dimensions there, growing market, bigger share, better pricing and better capital efficiency.\nRoger Read: Thanks for that. And then, just to pivot back real quick to North America, you mentioned not really anticipating or certainly not built into the expectations for recovery in gas this year. Presuming that that's kind of a well completions way you're thinking about it, at what point of the year would you have to see an increase maybe in activity spending rig count in gas to think that there was a chance that you could outperform I say you, but the market could outperform your expectation. Like if we get to the third quarter and we haven't seen an improvement, we should close the books on '24 having any improvements to dig about '25?\nJeffrey Miller: Yes, look thanks. I think that's the next big leg of growth in North America. It's a question of timing, but it is no question going to drive a lot of growth in North America. And I expect it will drive market growth '25 and beyond. And I think what's overlooked, look through the current timing and look forward to what's coming, attrition has really shrunk the fleet. The fleet for the market is shrinking to meet the demand that is there today and that happens every day. Equipment is not being built, new equipment. So, when we get to that point in time, it will be an incredibly tight market. And so, I'm actually quite excited and confident about what gas means to the North America market. Just saying, yes, the leading indicators of that will be well construction, it will be offtake contracts for LNG. There will be a number of things that sort of happen, but it will happen just given the capital has been invested on the export side. There's no question that the gas will be developed to meet that.\nRoger Read: Great.\nJeffrey Miller: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And it's from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.\nJames West: Hey, good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Eric.\nJeffrey Miller: Good morning, James.\nEric Carre: Good morning, James.\nJames West: So, Jeff, one of the areas that we haven't discussed in detail yet in the Q&A is really deepwater where you guys have an advantage position this cycle, I think relative to prior cycles even though you've been strong there for a while. But the technology enhancements that have happened at Halliburton puts you in a unique position to have more share, better profitability. And I'm curious kind of where you're seeing right now the biggest growth? And I think we know kind of Brazil and some other places, but where do you think we're going to be surprised as we go into kind of probably '25 and '26?\nJeffrey Miller: Look, I think the surprise will be West Africa and North Sea in terms of '25 and beyond. I think really we're planning work now. There are great opportunities today that are being planned by clients with the full expectation that we see a meaningful step up as we go into '25 and beyond. And these are all long-term type projects that will extend into the end of the decade. So, but I do think that's where we'll see a lot of activity.\nJames West: Okay. Okay. That makes sense. And then, maybe just back to North America to pivot back there. Again, I don't want to beat a dead horse, but you guys are dramatically outperforming some of the peers in North America. And where do you hold the line, I guess on kind of pricing? And where do you sacrifice utilization in a market that may be down a little bit? Is it -- we just we'll give up the utilization to keep our pricing, or do you -- are you willing to give some discount to keep utilization high?\nJeffrey Miller: Yes. Look, James, do we see some pressure? Yes. But does that affect our strategy? Absolutely not. We've got a strategy with maximized value in North America. 40% of our equipment is contracted under long-term contracts, and we're not terribly exposed where we do see that pressure. And I think maybe more answer than you want, but I think it's important that we keep central as our strategy is delivering unique technologies that create real value for customers. And so, that's what lowest TCO looks like and that's why we're also work solving for recovery with ZEUS platform and Sensory. We think those two things alone create significant value for customers and so we keep that central.\nJames West: Right, right. Totally get it. Thanks, Jeff.\nJeffrey Miller: Thank you, James.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And it comes from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please proceed.\nScott Gruber: Yes. Good morning.\nJeffrey Miller: Good morning, Scott.\nEric Carre: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Gruber: Well, it's getting later in the call, so I'll give you a chance to mention AI a few times. Not that it's needed. But are global customers starting to discuss additional demands from power for data centers? And do you think this has the potential to pull forward additional gas developments over the next few years around the world? Or is this still off the horizon?\nJeffrey Miller: I think gas is a critical fuel. And look, yes, I think we mentioned in the prepared remarks that the growth in demand for gas or gas and electricity and that being the most effective way to deliver power certainly today in the most reliable. So, I think that this is almost becoming, it's one of those things that you don't see it until it's on top of you. And I think that right now that demand is on top of us. And so, I think that can only be additive to demand. I have no question that will be additive. And clearly, AI consumes more power than traditional data centers. So, I think all of that combined, there's almost it's not almost, it is a secular trend towards demanding more power and that can only be good for our industry and for Halliburton.\nScott Gruber: Yes, it'll be interesting to watch. Just turning back to the near-term, Latin America was a big outperformer versus our expectation. Can you just provide some more color on the details of what drove the outperformance in Latin America? And overall, what type of growth would you anticipate from the market this year?\nJeffrey Miller: Look, Latin America performed very well. It's broad based growth in Latin America. So, really it's several geographies and types of markets, whether Argentina, Mexico, Caribbean, Ecuador. So, we saw strong growth all over. And important to say, our team in Latin America is doing an exceptional job. I'm very appreciative and pleased with the work that team does. And I think it also demonstrates how oil and gas is critical to economies. Those are economies that require oil and gas. They view oil and gas as critical to both security and economic growth, things that are important in Latin America. And so, I expect there's more to come.\nScott Gruber: Got it. Appreciate it, Jeff. Thank you.\nJeffrey Miller: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And it comes from the line of Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler. Please proceed.\nLuke Lemoine: Hey, good morning. Jeff, you've reiterated your full-year international revs up low-double-digits with margins expanding this year. But could you maybe talk more specifically about how you see the D&E margins unfolding on a full-year basis? And then also, as we kind of look over the next couple of years as international continues to unfold, you roll out new products and services like iStar and iCruise, what are kind of the aspirational targets here in D&E?\nJeffrey Miller: Yes. Look, I like the trajectory that we're seeing in D&E. And I say that because we're growing the business, but we're growing the business at a pace that's profitable and building the kind of foundation that we can use the technology in markets where we know we've got solid growth and profitability and then be able to reach out from there. But clearly, it is a balance of growing margins while opening for example, new businesses. So, we've opened a few new markets while growing profitably. And I think that's sort of the foundational part of our D&E trajectory. So, I expect to continue to see it aspirationally, continue to expect it to go up and expand quarter-over-quarter, year-on-year. And in the first quarter, we actually saw flooding in some markets. We saw weather in some others, maybe more than we would have expected. Though I expect that we continue on the trajectory in spite of all of the things that sort of come along and businesses that are open. So, should expect to continue to see that moving up.\nLuke Lemoine: Okay. Thanks, Jeff.\nJeffrey Miller: Thank you.\nOperator: Thanks. And one moment for our next question. And it comes from the line of Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. Please proceed.\nStephen Gengaro: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.\nJeffrey Miller: Good morning, Stephen.\nStephen Gengaro: Two from me, the first, you mentioned the strength in iCruise in North America. I think you said more than double a year ago footage drilled. Is that displacing competitors? Is that organic growth? Is that replacing all technology that you're offering? Can you give some color around that?\nJeffrey Miller: Look, it's performing very well and the uptake has been strong. And so, it is different technology than what we've ever had in the past. It's designed for this market. It's built on the iCruise platform. So, how it gets to market is really customer driven and there's been just more uptake on the technology self. Yes, it's all organic. In terms of it, we developed the technology ourselves. We've worked on it for some time. We built a platform that has been very effective internationally and now we've gotten to the North America part of it. So, it's early days, but stay tuned. I mean, we're really pleased with the advancement that it's making, but it's really customers will drive the uptake for that. So, the increase in footage drilled is indicative of customers gaining confidence in the performance of that technology, particularly in the curved lateral.\nStephen Gengaro: Great. Thank you. And I know this may be a little harder for you to answer directly, but when we think about the CHX, SLV deal and what's going on in production chemicals, I would imagine it's an area that would have interest to you. But my question is really, you had a great amount of success with Summit and what you bought and built over the last, I guess five, six years plus and the strength of that business. Is that something that you can replicate in production chemicals if you went down that road?\nJeffrey Miller: Look, I think, I'll revert back to strategically we like to grow things organically. We own the kernel of a business there. We continue to make progress. We've got the plant. The capacity is filling up in the Middle East. So, the trade-off is speed, but I think also the trade-off from our perspective anyway has been, we know how to do this and we believe it generates a lot of value for our shareholders when we go about it this way. And so, we're going to continue to grow our chemicals business around the world on the back of some assets that we built ourselves. And so, I'm pleased, I think there's opportunities for organic growth in chemicals, organic growth, and strong growth in intervention, a whole lot of different areas.\nStephen Gengaro: Okay, great. Now, thank you for the call.\nJeffrey Miller: Yes. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, and it comes from the line of Marc Bianchi with TD Cowen. Please proceed.\nMarc Bianchi: Hi. I wanted to circle back to the discussion on pricing for North America just because you made the comment that you've seen some softening, but you're not changing your strategy. Could you just comment on how sort of the market has evolved over the last 90 days, if anything has changed. We've had a competitor out there saying that they're going to go after share at the expensive price.\nJeffrey Miller: Look, I don't comment on competitors, but from a strategic perspective we haven't changed. What we're doing and I like where we are. A big part of our fleet is contracted today. We focus on delivering top-notch efficiency, sort of record-setting efficiency, and also lowest ECO. And so, that's where our primary focus is, and we plan to stay with that.\nMarc Bianchi: Okay, great. Thanks for that, Jeff. And then, on the second quarter outlook, you gave the C&P and D&E, should we assume that that's a similar profile for international in North America or anything that we should be contemplating there?\nJeffrey Miller: In terms of -- I don't --\nMarc Bianchi: Yes. Go ahead Jeff.\nJeffrey Miller: Look, in terms of growth, I think the margin growth I expect will continue. I mean, I think that we talked about expanding margins and D&E and also C&P is continuing to grow. And I think we're solid. We're in a number of very good businesses around C&P.\nMarc Bianchi: Okay. Maybe just to clarify, the question was more on revenue, so I guess what I'm wondering is to get to the low double digits for international, it would seem that you need a pretty healthy growth in the remaining -- all three remaining quarters of the year sequentially.\nJeffrey Miller: Oh, yes, sorry, I --\nMarc Bianchi: Could you talk about where that's coming from?\nJeffrey Miller: Yes. So, that's pretty broad-based. I mean, and so for C&P that's completion tools around the world. It's production enhancement around the world. So, in a very strong position, and we see a number of things growing, not the least of which would be lift, for example, and some things like that. So, I had heavy lift, I don't see it as a -- I see it as a very middle of the fairway, very doable from where we sit today. And again, equipment's tight. I think that we'll continue to see strengthening there as well, expanding margins in price.\nMarc Bianchi: Very good. Thank you.\nJeffrey Miller: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, and it comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with Benchmark. Please proceed.\nKurt Hallead: Hey, good morning. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for slotting me in here. So, Jeff you've been at this a long time. You referenced on more than one occasion, not just today, but in other calls about increasing level of visibility, especially on the international front and talking about opportunities that could extend out to the end of the decade. I think a lot of investors are wanting to kind of get inside the room with you, if you will, and try to get the same sort of conviction you have with respect to that duration. So, I'm just kind of curious if you could give us some perspectives and insights on how those conversations are taking place, how much lead time your customers are asking for, and effectively, what two or three things are you seeing that continue to underpin this confidence and conviction that this cycle is going to extend through the end of the decade?\nJeffrey Miller: Yes, thanks. Look, some of its work that will begin in '25 that is planned to go through the end of the decade. So, I feel very confident about that. Others are work that we're working on planning with clients that again are the types of projects that extend that far. I think just the price of the commodity and the tightness and the rising demand for oil and gas gives me confidence and it gives our clients confidence. And clearly, we've seen a bit of a return to oil and gas and its importance in a lot of places, but the type of work that we're starting, the type of offshore work that we're starting is takes time to get started and it takes a long time to do, and so, very confident about that broadly. And I would include, anyway, the outlook for North America is similar in terms of duration. I mean, this is the kind of investments that we've seen in North America that are not for a quarter or two. These are decade-long investments that we've seen happen. And the next leg on gas and the demand for gas, it's already been talked about on this call. I feel very confident in the resilience of this cycle.\nKurt Hallead: That's great. I appreciate that. So, the other dynamic you referenced was approving margins, right? So, you've booked contracts that tend to last, I don't know, two to three years on average in the international market, so those will roll through this year and next year and so on. Just curious in the context of that margin improvement from here, right, if you were to try to rank and order it. Is how much of the pricing how much is it? Is it volume? How much is the technology value proposition? Can you give us some additional sense on how you see that? What's driving that margin improvement?\nJeffrey Miller: Look, I think it's a combination of those. Some of it is certainly tightness in the market and pricing, but at the same time we've talked about our R&D investment over the last eight years has all been directed at better capital efficiency, and that drives margin also. That drives margins in our drilling business, it drives margin in our frac business. But these are deliberate choices that we've made to drive down or to improve capital efficiency and return. And I think that's evident, probably most evident in our drilling technology and our ZEUS technology. But at the same time, that's been a practice in all of our business. And so, anything that we're producing today, sort of its first criteria has to be improved capital efficiency and better returns out of R&D. And so, I'm really pleased with the success we've had there. And so, I would say all are contributing today, in addition to having sort of more market access, more opportunity to compete on the back of improved technology.\nKurt Hallead: I appreciate that. Thanks, Jeff.\nJeffrey Miller: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, and it comes from the line of Doug Becker with Capital One. Please proceed.\nDouglas Becker: Thanks. Jeff, would you expand a little bit more on the drivers behind the sequential margin expansion in D&E? And really, the question is just a function that the last several years D&E margins actually declined in 2Q from 1Q.\nJeffrey Miller: Look, I think that's, again, I'm back to the foundation building that I described. So, we've got a better foundation, broader-based work, and so I expect to continue to see expansion, certainly year-over-year. And then, also as that foundation gets stronger, that gives us more ability to grow the business profitably, but from a sound base.\nEric Carre: I think Doug, it's Eric here, that the typical drop in margin in Q2 happens with the reduction in our software business. The way we recognize revenue in our software business means that it's essentially taken in Q4 and in Q1, so we see a bit of a drop there. You see that being more muted this year because, as Jeff mentioned, the D&E margins were softer than we were expecting in Q1, as we had much more significant weather issues in the North Sea in Norway, in Alaska, and then the flooding over in Indonesia. So, the combination of the muted effect and the more traditional software impact moving from Q1 to Q2 results in margins going up here.\nDouglas Becker: That all makes sense. Maybe switching to North America, U.S. more specifically, last quarter you were talking about ZEUS e-fleets would represent about 40% by the end of the year, going to maybe 50% in 2025. Is there a reasonable or realistic or probable scenario where you would accelerate this deployment? The results certainly suggest the outperformance and there might be a case for that.\nJeffrey Miller: No. Look, this is a market push. The whole strategy behind e-fleet for us has been build the best technologies and clients demand it, and we've built to the demand that we see in hand, and therefore, they are not built on spec, they are built for customers that plan to use them. And we don't plan to change that. And so, in some ways that adds central to maximizing value in North America. When we maximize value in North America, we are not going to build things, we don't have home. And so, I expect to continue to see market demand for this equipment. 2024 is actually already in hand. It's just delivering the units themselves. They already have homes. And in '25, we actually have some deliveries. And I expect that we will see more as we go forward. But I think that important to remember that that our approach is to build to contract.\nDouglas Becker: That makes sense. Thank you.\nJeffrey Miller: Thank you.\nEric Carre: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And with that, we conclude our Q-and-A session for today. I will pass it back to management for final comments.\nJeffrey Miller: Okay. Thank you, Carmen. Let me close out the call with this, I am excited about the outlook for Halliburton and expect Halliburton to deliver strong free cash flow and shareholder returns. Look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Let's close out the call.\nOperator: Thank you everyone for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Our Q1 reported net income per diluted share was $0.68. Adjusted net income per diluted share was $0.76. Total company revenue for the first quarter of 2024 was $5.8 billion. Operating income was $987 million. And operating margin was 17%; flat compared to Q1 2023. Beginning with our Completion and Production division; revenue in Q1 was $3.4 billion, down slightly from Q1 2023. Operating income was $688 million, up 3% when compared to Q1 2023. And operating income margin was 20%. Compared to Q1 of last year, these results were primarily driven by reduced pressure pumping services in U.S. land. Partially offset by higher activity in international markets. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in Q1 was $2.4 billion, an increase of 7% compared to Q1 2023. Operating income was $398 million, up 8%, and operating margin was 16%, an increase of 10 basis points over Q1 last year. These results were primarily driven by higher drilling-related services in the Middle East and North America as well as improvements across multiple product lines in Latin America. Now let's move on to geographic results. Our Q1 international revenue increased 12% year over year. Europe/Africa revenue in the first quarter of 2024 was $729 million, an increase of 10% year over year. This increase was primarily driven by higher completion tool sales in the region and fluid services in Norway and the Caspian area. Middle East/Asia revenue in the first quarter of 2024 was $1.4 million, an increase of 6% year over year. This increase was primarily related to improved activity in multiple product service lines in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Oman. Latin America revenue in the first quarter of 2024 was $1.1 billion, an increase of 21% year over year. This improvement was primarily related to higher drilling-related services and increased software sales in Mexico, improved pressure pumping service and fluid services in Argentina, and increased activity in multi-product service lines in Brazil and Ecuador. In North America, revenue was $2.5 billion, representing an 8% decrease year over year, but a 5% increase from the last quarter. This year-over-year decline was primarily driven by lower pressure pumping services in U.S. land as well as lower wireline activity. Moving on to other items, in Q1, our corporate and other expense was $65 million. For the second quarter of 2024, we expect our corporate expenses to be approximately flat. Our SAP deployment remains on budget and is on schedule to conclude in 2025. In Q1, we spent $34 million, or about $0.04 per diluted share, on SAP S4 migration, which is included in our results. For the second quarter, we expect SAP expenses to be approximately flat. Net interest expense for the quarter was $92 million. For the second quarter 2024, we expect net interest expense to be roughly flat. Other net expense for Q1 was $108 million, higher than expected, primarily due to impairment of an investment in Argentina and currency devaluation in Egypt. For the second quarter 2024, we expect this expense to be approximately $35 million. Our adjusted effective tax rate for Q1 was 21.5%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our second quarter 2024 effective tax rate to increase approximately 75 basis points. Capital expenditures for Q1 were $330 million. For the full year of 2024, we expect capital expenditures to remain approximately 6% of revenue. Our Q1 cash flow from operations was $487 million, and free cash flow was $206 million. During the quarter, we repurchased $250 million of our common stock. For the full year 2024, we expect free cash flow to be at least 10% higher than 2023. Now let me provide you with some comments on our expectations for the second quarter. In our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to be up 2% to 4% and margins to increase by 25 to 75 basis points. In our drilling and evaluation division, we expect sequential revenue to increase 1% to 3% and margins to increase by 25 to 75 basis points. I will now turn the call back to Jeff. Yes, Neil, it's Eric. So, the baseline that we use is the framework that we announced several quarters ago to return a minimum of 50% of free cash flow to shareholders. We actually returned over that at just about 60% in 2023. So, when we look at the improvements in free cash flow year-over-year, which we mentioned to be about 10%. So, when we think through that, we think that the $250 million of buyback is a good base load for us to be repurchasing shares. So, expect more buybacks in dollars, expect more overall returns to shareholder dollar-wise, and then, we see where the overall percentage lands, but it should be pretty close to what we did last year. Yes. Good morning, James. Good morning, Scott. I think Doug, it's Eric here, that the typical drop in margin in Q2 happens with the reduction in our software business. The way we recognize revenue in our software business means that it's essentially taken in Q4 and in Q1, so we see a bit of a drop there. You see that being more muted this year because, as Jeff mentioned, the D&E margins were softer than we were expecting in Q1, as we had much more significant weather issues in the North Sea in Norway, in Alaska, and then the flooding over in Indonesia. So, the combination of the muted effect and the more traditional software impact moving from Q1 to Q2 results in margins going up here. Thank you."

            "name": "Jeffrey Miller",
            "content": "Thank you, David, and good morning everyone. Halliburton delivered solid first quarter results that again demonstrated the power of our strategy and the strength of our execution. Here are the quarter highlights. We delivered total company revenue of $5.8 billion, and operating margin of 17%. Both divisions demonstrated margin improvement year-over-year. International revenue was $3.3 billion, and grew 12% year-over-year, led by Latin America, which delivered a 21% increase. North America revenue was $2.5 billion, a 5% increase over the fourth quarter of 2023. Finally, during the first quarter, we generated $487 million of cash flow from operations, $206 million of free cash flow, and repurchased $250 million of our common stock. Let me begin today's discussion with my views on the strength of the oilfield services market. Global energy use is on the rise, with crude oil demand projected to grow between 1.2 million and 2.3 million barrels per day in 2024. This demand growth is greatest in non-OECD countries, where we expect more per capita energy consumption, not less as they develop their economies and improve their quality of life. Globally, secure, reliable hydrocarbon production powers industries, moves people, and advances economies. In the U.S., after stable electricity demand for nearly two decades, we now expect it to grow more than 15% by 2030. Today, over 40% of United States electricity is supplied by natural gas, and we expect strong demand for natural gas as a base fuel well into the future. The world requires more energy, not less, and I'm more convinced than ever that oil and gas will fill a critical role in the global energy mix for decades to come. My outlook is confirmed by our customers' multiyear activity plans across multiple markets and asset types. Everything I see points towards long-term growth for Halliburton's services. My outlook for the industry is not new, and it drives our focus on oilfield services, and sets our strategy. This focus is the basis for our technology investment, capital allocation, and culture. This multiyear upcycle together with our successful strategy execution make this a great time for Halliburton. Now, let's turn to international markets, where Halliburton's strategy of profitable growth delivered another solid quarter. International revenue grew 12% year-over-year with growth demonstrated by each region. This marks the 11th consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth in our international business. For 2024, I expect full-year revenue growth in the low double-digits. Equally important, the international market remains tight for equipment, and people, and therefore, we expect to see margin expansion over last year. One of the many things that excites me about our international business is our technology that creates meaningful value for our customers, and drives above-market growth for Halliburton. In the Drilling and Evaluation Division, our leading formation evaluation tools such as the EarthStar X logging-while-drilling system, and our Reservoir Xaminer Formation Sampling Service, both see strong adoption and increasing levels of demand. The advanced measurements these systems provide create unique insights for our customers and drive profitable growth for Halliburton. In the Completion and Production division, our Artificial Lift technology continues to generate profitable growth throughout each of our international regions. Our electric submersible pump portfolio proved to be a market leader in the competitive North America market, and we expect to deliver similar results over time in the international markets. Our complete solution, which includes downhole motors, pumps, and surface systems with remote monitoring and automation, provides an end-to-end solution, and the ability to operate at scale. A great example is in Kuwait, where in less than three years, we captured a nearly 20% market share with over 700 ESP installs. Before we move on, I want to share an observation. I'm consistently seeing more global interest in unconventionals. I can recall over a decade ago, the global scramble to find unconventionals with limited success. Today, two significant markets outside of North America achieve scale, which serves as a proof point for what is possible, and drives interest by others. As global markets grow, the technologies and processes Halliburton developed as the leader in North America over the last three decades have broad applications to unconventional reservoirs throughout the world, which makes this a fantastic long-term opportunity for Halliburton. I'm confident in the duration of this international upcycle in 2024 and beyond. Turning to North America, our first quarter revenue grew 5% over last quarter. As expected, North America land completion activity bottomed in the fourth quarter of last year and rebounded in the first quarter as our customers quickly resumed operations after the holidays. Looking ahead for the rest of 2024 in North America, we expect steady activity levels for Halliburton. Our customers are planning for the long-term and I expect they will execute work throughout the year as planned. This is consistent with a more industrialized approach to asset development in North America. And while we expect an eventual recovery in natural gas activity driven by demand from LNG expansions, our 2024 plan does not anticipate this recovery. Overall, we expect that full-year North America revenue and margins will be flattish compared with 2023 levels. Clearly, our strategy is to maximize value in North America. We do it in multiple ways. Today, I want to talk about two of them. The first is the ZEUS platform and the second is our new North America focused directional drilling system. The ZEUS platform, its electrification, automation and subsurface diagnostics continue to advance. This quarter, we introduced Sensory, which is the latest generation of our subsurface measurement technology. Sensory provides an easy to deploy, cost effective and automated system for real time subsurface measurement of fracturing operations. Additionally, our automation technologies are at the heart of our highly efficient simul-frac and trimul-frac operations and they continue to expand their capabilities creating value for Halliburton and our customers. The ZEUS platform demonstrates its uniqueness every day. And importantly, it's deployed at scale. Our scale allows for rapid technology innovation. Each technology improvement to the ZEUS platform widens the moat around our leading position in the fracturing market. This creates outsized value for Halliburton and our customers. I am pleased with the results we see in North America from our drilling services product line, which late last year launched a new version of our iCruise Rotary Steerable System specifically engineered for the North America unconventional market. The new iCruise CX system is designed for the challenging curve and lateral applications in North America. The system's performance is driving strong uptake and this quarter, our iCruise footage drilled in North America more than doubled over last year. We also coupled this high performing system with an asset light sales and rental model that increases the addressable market when compared to a full-service model. This is how iCruise CX both participates in new market segments and increases its speed of market penetration. The key trend that I see in North America drilling is the move to longer laterals and more complex wells which customers drill to improve economics. iCruise CX is specifically designed for these applications. And its performance is why I am excited about Halliburton's growth in the North America drilling market. To close out, I would like to thank our employees. I regularly hear from our customers about the work you do. How much it means to them, and how your execution of our value proposition differentiates Halliburton from our competitors. Well done. I am excited about the business outlook for Halliburton. Energy demand growth is strong and so is demand for our services. I expect that our focus on oilfield services and execution of our strategy will generate strong free cash flow and shareholder returns. This quarter, Halliburton repurchased $250 million of our common stock, a solid start to the year and a good benchmark for our expectations going forward. Now, I'll turn the call over to Eric to provide more details of our financial results. Eric? Thanks, Eric. Let me summarize our discussion today. Halliburton delivered solid first quarter results. I am confident in the strength and duration of this up cycle. We expect our North America business to deliver flattish revenues and margins year-on-year despite lower activity levels. We also expect our international business revenue to grow at low double digits year-on-year. I'm excited about the outlook for Halliburton and expect Halliburton to deliver strong free cash flow and shareholder returns. And now let's open it up for questions. Yes. Thank you, Dave. Look, the most important point is this is a comprehensive platform. ZEUS is a platform. Clearly, it's electric. Yes, it drives efficiency, but the embedded automation actually really changes the dynamics of how it performs. And then, also the subsurface measurements with Sensory that are embedded in this system, and uniquely embedded. And so, that widens the moat. And I think equally important is being at scale. So, it's one thing to do a research project around a thing, but when we're working at scale, these are solutions that can be pushed to the platform at any point in time. So, it's really the ability to grow the moat on existing equipment as well as any new turns on the science as it goes forward. So, I'm super excited about it. Yes, obviously lowest TCO, but it's the technology differentiation as well that widens the moat. Thank you, David. And I'm really excited about it. And there's a lot of opportunity for Halliburton around unconventionals, as you know. How we address it, we've got a lot of ways to address it, including some of the technology we've talked about today. We've got a good position in there, but I think with even more opportunity to grow, particularly with drilling technology that continues to advance. You mentioned mud, but also other aspects of that where we'll be very competitive. So, I think that's a big move forward. And I think more broadly, so good for Halliburton, but I think that more broadly, just the discussion around unconventionals internationally, what can you see today are two markets, at least outside the U.S., that are truly at scale. And I think that serves as a bit of a template for how that can be done, because it was really unclear a decade ago, as you recall. But I think we're in a different place with unconventionals today. And so, we do hear more discussion around, hey, this is possible, and how Halliburton would play a more meaningful role in that in additional markets, so super encouraged. Thank you. Look, Neil, no change to our strategy. You're correct. We like bolt-on M&A technology acquisitions. We think about M&A in terms really of research and development. Is it something that advances research? Does it move it more quickly so that we get to market more quickly? But we see significant organic growth in the businesses that we're in. And so, we like where we are and we see plenty of growth. And we also, I believe that organic growth generates more value for shareholders. And we've seen that with other things that we've done in the past in terms of small acquisitions that we're able to then grow and push through our channel. But we like the space where we compete and we like the technology and how we develop that. And so, you shouldn't expect any change from Halliburton. Thank you. Yes. Well, I want to answer the second part of that first in terms of organically. Yes. So, we don't see a change to our strategy or approach to markets. So, yes, we do see quite a bit of organic growth for us in the OpEx part of the market. We're in that business today. We've got strong, I mean, strong lift business today. We're in the chemicals business today. And we're in the intervention business today in a pretty big way. And we continue to develop technology similar to as we've done in the past. And so, it's my outlook for OpEx cycle. We've got plenty of exposure to that and have had. Now, I want to be careful and say the D&C cycle is very strong and continues to grow. And I suspect that it continues to grow also. So, I think we're well balanced across really all elements of this, whether it's exploration, development, drilling, and OpEx today. Some of the things we've done in the past, again, we bought smaller businesses that we've grown into bigger businesses. And so, again, a strategy that works for us and it delivers the organic growth that we believe is really good for our shareholders. Well, I think the first part of that in terms of Saudi growth, '24 is still growing, by the way. We expect growth in Saudi in '24. And the rebalancing, the gas and unconventionals is very good for Halliburton. We've got a very strong onshore business in Saudi Arabia. We participate in all aspects of that market. And that market remains tight for equipment. So, I feel good about that market. And I'm very confident in the long-term growth of that market. The rebalancing again to gas is, we're meaningful players in that part of the market and expect that will only be good for Halliburton. Pivot to growth, look, a couple of things. Number one, international business grew 12% overall. So, I want to start there. Clearly, I'd expect more growth in the region, but here's what we're doing. I want to be really clear that profitable growth has been our primary focus. We see a good pipeline of opportunities. We expect to continue to see growth in MENA. But at the same time, we want to make certain we're building a foundation shipment for growth. That means that we are delivering the technology, we're making the investment while expanding margins and growing, and that's been sort of our mantra, our strategy is profitable international growth. And that's what we saw this quarter. Thank you. Yes, thanks. Look, I think the growth is broad based, but the technology matters. It's not necessarily new products. It's actually an expanding market. A couple of things are happening at one time, yes, activity is growing, but we're participating in a larger share of that growth than maybe in the past based on some of the technology I described. So, we're competing differently technically, and so we get a bigger part of that growth. We've added some new things, yes, like Lift internationally, that's a new product for growth, a new product that's a whole business, but it's growth end markets, and we're really pleased with the progress that that's making. And then, obviously, pricing in the tight market internationally helps us well because that's helping growth all around. But I would not overlook the importance of the improvement in drilling technology, particularly just because it's more access to a larger market and at a much better rate of return for us given the improvement over legacy technology. The capital efficiency of the new technology is probably is right about 40% more capital efficient than the legacy tools. So, getting sort of improvement along several dimensions there, growing market, bigger share, better pricing and better capital efficiency. Yes, look thanks. I think that's the next big leg of growth in North America. It's a question of timing, but it is no question going to drive a lot of growth in North America. And I expect it will drive market growth '25 and beyond. And I think what's overlooked, look through the current timing and look forward to what's coming, attrition has really shrunk the fleet. The fleet for the market is shrinking to meet the demand that is there today and that happens every day. Equipment is not being built, new equipment. So, when we get to that point in time, it will be an incredibly tight market. And so, I'm actually quite excited and confident about what gas means to the North America market. Just saying, yes, the leading indicators of that will be well construction, it will be offtake contracts for LNG. There will be a number of things that sort of happen, but it will happen just given the capital has been invested on the export side. There's no question that the gas will be developed to meet that. Thank you. Good morning, James. Look, I think the surprise will be West Africa and North Sea in terms of '25 and beyond. I think really we're planning work now. There are great opportunities today that are being planned by clients with the full expectation that we see a meaningful step up as we go into '25 and beyond. And these are all long-term type projects that will extend into the end of the decade. So, but I do think that's where we'll see a lot of activity. Yes. Look, James, do we see some pressure? Yes. But does that affect our strategy? Absolutely not. We've got a strategy with maximized value in North America. 40% of our equipment is contracted under long-term contracts, and we're not terribly exposed where we do see that pressure. And I think maybe more answer than you want, but I think it's important that we keep central as our strategy is delivering unique technologies that create real value for customers. And so, that's what lowest TCO looks like and that's why we're also work solving for recovery with ZEUS platform and Sensory. We think those two things alone create significant value for customers and so we keep that central. Thank you, James. Good morning, Scott. I think gas is a critical fuel. And look, yes, I think we mentioned in the prepared remarks that the growth in demand for gas or gas and electricity and that being the most effective way to deliver power certainly today in the most reliable. So, I think that this is almost becoming, it's one of those things that you don't see it until it's on top of you. And I think that right now that demand is on top of us. And so, I think that can only be additive to demand. I have no question that will be additive. And clearly, AI consumes more power than traditional data centers. So, I think all of that combined, there's almost it's not almost, it is a secular trend towards demanding more power and that can only be good for our industry and for Halliburton. Look, Latin America performed very well. It's broad based growth in Latin America. So, really it's several geographies and types of markets, whether Argentina, Mexico, Caribbean, Ecuador. So, we saw strong growth all over. And important to say, our team in Latin America is doing an exceptional job. I'm very appreciative and pleased with the work that team does. And I think it also demonstrates how oil and gas is critical to economies. Those are economies that require oil and gas. They view oil and gas as critical to both security and economic growth, things that are important in Latin America. And so, I expect there's more to come. Thank you. Yes. Look, I like the trajectory that we're seeing in D&E. And I say that because we're growing the business, but we're growing the business at a pace that's profitable and building the kind of foundation that we can use the technology in markets where we know we've got solid growth and profitability and then be able to reach out from there. But clearly, it is a balance of growing margins while opening for example, new businesses. So, we've opened a few new markets while growing profitably. And I think that's sort of the foundational part of our D&E trajectory. So, I expect to continue to see it aspirationally, continue to expect it to go up and expand quarter-over-quarter, year-on-year. And in the first quarter, we actually saw flooding in some markets. We saw weather in some others, maybe more than we would have expected. Though I expect that we continue on the trajectory in spite of all of the things that sort of come along and businesses that are open. So, should expect to continue to see that moving up. Thank you. Good morning, Stephen. Look, it's performing very well and the uptake has been strong. And so, it is different technology than what we've ever had in the past. It's designed for this market. It's built on the iCruise platform. So, how it gets to market is really customer driven and there's been just more uptake on the technology self. Yes, it's all organic. In terms of it, we developed the technology ourselves. We've worked on it for some time. We built a platform that has been very effective internationally and now we've gotten to the North America part of it. So, it's early days, but stay tuned. I mean, we're really pleased with the advancement that it's making, but it's really customers will drive the uptake for that. So, the increase in footage drilled is indicative of customers gaining confidence in the performance of that technology, particularly in the curved lateral. Look, I think, I'll revert back to strategically we like to grow things organically. We own the kernel of a business there. We continue to make progress. We've got the plant. The capacity is filling up in the Middle East. So, the trade-off is speed, but I think also the trade-off from our perspective anyway has been, we know how to do this and we believe it generates a lot of value for our shareholders when we go about it this way. And so, we're going to continue to grow our chemicals business around the world on the back of some assets that we built ourselves. And so, I'm pleased, I think there's opportunities for organic growth in chemicals, organic growth, and strong growth in intervention, a whole lot of different areas. Yes. Thanks. Look, I don't comment on competitors, but from a strategic perspective we haven't changed. What we're doing and I like where we are. A big part of our fleet is contracted today. We focus on delivering top-notch efficiency, sort of record-setting efficiency, and also lowest ECO. And so, that's where our primary focus is, and we plan to stay with that. In terms of -- I don't -- Look, in terms of growth, I think the margin growth I expect will continue. I mean, I think that we talked about expanding margins and D&E and also C&P is continuing to grow. And I think we're solid. We're in a number of very good businesses around C&P. Oh, yes, sorry, I -- Yes. So, that's pretty broad-based. I mean, and so for C&P that's completion tools around the world. It's production enhancement around the world. So, in a very strong position, and we see a number of things growing, not the least of which would be lift, for example, and some things like that. So, I had heavy lift, I don't see it as a -- I see it as a very middle of the fairway, very doable from where we sit today. And again, equipment's tight. I think that we'll continue to see strengthening there as well, expanding margins in price. Thank you. Yes, thanks. Look, some of its work that will begin in '25 that is planned to go through the end of the decade. So, I feel very confident about that. Others are work that we're working on planning with clients that again are the types of projects that extend that far. I think just the price of the commodity and the tightness and the rising demand for oil and gas gives me confidence and it gives our clients confidence. And clearly, we've seen a bit of a return to oil and gas and its importance in a lot of places, but the type of work that we're starting, the type of offshore work that we're starting is takes time to get started and it takes a long time to do, and so, very confident about that broadly. And I would include, anyway, the outlook for North America is similar in terms of duration. I mean, this is the kind of investments that we've seen in North America that are not for a quarter or two. These are decade-long investments that we've seen happen. And the next leg on gas and the demand for gas, it's already been talked about on this call. I feel very confident in the resilience of this cycle. Look, I think it's a combination of those. Some of it is certainly tightness in the market and pricing, but at the same time we've talked about our R&D investment over the last eight years has all been directed at better capital efficiency, and that drives margin also. That drives margins in our drilling business, it drives margin in our frac business. But these are deliberate choices that we've made to drive down or to improve capital efficiency and return. And I think that's evident, probably most evident in our drilling technology and our ZEUS technology. But at the same time, that's been a practice in all of our business. And so, anything that we're producing today, sort of its first criteria has to be improved capital efficiency and better returns out of R&D. And so, I'm really pleased with the success we've had there. And so, I would say all are contributing today, in addition to having sort of more market access, more opportunity to compete on the back of improved technology. Thank you. Look, I think that's, again, I'm back to the foundation building that I described. So, we've got a better foundation, broader-based work, and so I expect to continue to see expansion, certainly year-over-year. And then, also as that foundation gets stronger, that gives us more ability to grow the business profitably, but from a sound base. No. Look, this is a market push. The whole strategy behind e-fleet for us has been build the best technologies and clients demand it, and we've built to the demand that we see in hand, and therefore, they are not built on spec, they are built for customers that plan to use them. And we don't plan to change that. And so, in some ways that adds central to maximizing value in North America. When we maximize value in North America, we are not going to build things, we don't have home. And so, I expect to continue to see market demand for this equipment. 2024 is actually already in hand. It's just delivering the units themselves. They already have homes. And in '25, we actually have some deliveries. And I expect that we will see more as we go forward. But I think that important to remember that that our approach is to build to contract. Thank you. Okay. Thank you, Carmen. Let me close out the call with this, I am excited about the outlook for Halliburton and expect Halliburton to deliver strong free cash flow and shareholder returns. Look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Let's close out the call."
