I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Sarah Whitford, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nSarah Whitford: Thanks, Amy. Good morning, and welcome to the Ventas Fourth Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. Earlier this morning, we issued our fourth quarter earnings release, supplemental and investor presentation. These materials are available on the Ventas website at ir.ventasreit.com.  As a reminder, remarks made today may include forward-looking statements, including certain expectations related to COVID-19 and other matters. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. And a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, all of which are available on the Ventas website.  Certain non-GAAP financial measures will also be discussed on this call. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to our supplemental posted on the Investor Relations section of our website.  I will now turn over the call to Debra Cafaro, Chairman and CEO.\nDebra Cafaro: Thank you, Sarah, and good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants. On behalf of all my colleagues, we want to welcome you to the Ventas Fourth Quarter and Year-end 2020 Earnings Call. Let me begin by expressing my deep gratitude and optimism, borne of the strength, resilience and innovation so many have demonstrated over the past year and the positive developments we are seeing on the ground in our portfolio virtually every day.  Our results in the fourth quarter demonstrated Ventas' resilience with normalized FFO reported at $0.83 a share and $0.74 at much appreciated funding from HHS to our senior living communities that have been affected by COVID-19. I've reflected on the grueling year we've all had. I couldn't be prouder of our productive and skilled teams, our enterprise and our capable, dedicated partners.  After a fast and positive start to 2020, the last year has been dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic and punctuated by extreme weather disruptions, both of which have continued into the first quarter of 2021. Throughout, we've put the full force of our firm's resources and energy behind keeping people safe, demonstrating remarkable resilience and becoming part of the solution, whether in employee testing, advocacy or assistance to tenants and operators who needed it.  Financially, through our foresight, our longstanding diversification strategy and our decisive actions, we've kept our enterprise strong and stable, generating almost the same EBITDA in 2020 as we did in 2019 and benefiting from our investments in people, systems and preparedness, our balance sheet flexibility and our embedded relationships with best-in-class partners.  And we found ways to grow and advance our strategic objectives, including building value through acquisition and development in life sciences, investing in Le Groupe Maurice's attractive senior housing development pipeline, creating new partnerships and establishing a third-party investment management platform that will provide more options for future growth.  We remain committed to our core values of respect and integrity and accelerated our actions to promote sustainability, diversity and social justice in our company, our communities and our country. Finally, we were very fortunate to recently add 2 topnotch directors to the company: one, a leader in health care; and the other in real estate and REITs.  My gratitude and optimism also flow from the life-saving COVID-19 vaccine discovery by doctors and scientists in record time and the recent acceleration of vaccine delivery by the Biden administration. Nationally, ending COVID-19 is foundational to spur sustained economic recovery and restore vitality to so many businesses, households and workers.  At Ventas, we're proud that 100% of our U.S. SHOP, AL and memory care communities have already received the vaccine. And nearly 90% of them will complete their second dose by the end of this month. Notably, senior housing vaccine delivery represents one of the shining successes in our fight against COVID-19. In our SHOP communities, it is wonderful to know that about 30,000 vulnerable residents have already been vaccinated and are one step closer to feeling safe, seeing loved ones and enjoying a richer life.  From our real-time data, we also know that confirmed COVID-19 cases in our communities have recently begun to improve significantly, creating an enhanced sense of well-being and enabling more operators to open communities to new move-ins. And leads at our communities built to their highest level since the pandemic began in January, once again demonstrating the strength of the value proposition of senior housing and the resilient demand for the services our care providers deliver.  While we expect SHOP's first quarter NOI and occupancy, which are lagging indicators, to decline sequentially as a result of November to January's extreme COVID-19 conditions, we are encouraged by the breadth and consistency of all positive leading indicators. Conditions remain dynamic, and it is too early to declare a definitive trend. But we like the picture we are starting to see. Post-pandemic senior housing growth represents an incredibly significant value creation opportunity for our shareholders.  Turning to our investment outlook. Our diversified asset base with 5 verticals has given us the ability to continue successfully allocating capital over time and through cycles. For example, we've created tremendous value since our early cycle investments in our Research & Innovation business in 2016. We continue to find meaningful opportunities to drive that business forward in both ground-up development and asset acquisitions with universities and in cluster markets alike.  Our decision to add life sciences to our enterprise has provided an uplift to our results, our investment activity and our value. Here are a couple of current examples. Our $280 million life sciences project, known as One uCity, in the thriving research submarket of Philadelphia, which is bookended by Penn and Drexel, is attracting significant leasing interest.  In addition to the nearly $1 billion ground-up development projects already underway, our university-based development pipeline continues to hold about another $1 billion in active potential projects with both new and existing university relationships. In particular, with Wexford, we are in the design development phase of a nearly $0.5 billion project with a major research university on the West Coast that is substantially pre-leased. We look forward to sharing more information with you later this year.  Outside of Research & Innovation, we continue to allocate capital to develop large Class A independent living communities with our partner, LGM, in Qu\u00e9bec. We've had 5 projects underway with investment also totaling nearly $0.5 billion. And 2 of the projects were delivered in the fourth quarter. We are pleased to report that the 2 open communities have leased up quickly and occupancy is already nearly 80%.  In addition, our pipeline of potential acquisitions in all 5 of our verticals is active and growing. We continue to invest with an eye towards growing reliable cash flow and favorable risk-adjusted returns. We will also continue to evaluate and execute opportunities to recycle capital as well. Both Justin and Pete have been working with our deal team to target about $1 billion of dispositions during the year to optimize our portfolio.  Finally, our institutional investment capital management platform continues to grow and succeed with well over $3 billion in assets under management. Bringing together our pre-existing and new third-party capital vehicles under one umbrella, the Ventas Investment Management business includes our life sciences and health care funds. The Ventas Fund stands out as one of the most successful launches of a first-time real estate fund in any asset class.  Our investment management platform provides a significant competitive advantage to Ventas. It broadens our capital sources, augments our investment capacity, expands our footprint, leverages our team and industry expertise, improves our financial flexibility and liquidity and adds an incremental source of earnings. There is tremendous market opportunity within life science, medical office and senior housing real estate. And we are well positioned to capitalize on it in multiple ways.  In closing, let me reiterate that demographically driven demand is right in front of us. The leading indicators in senior housing are improving rapidly. Vaccine delivery is accelerating. And the long-term thesis for all of our asset classes and for Ventas remains firmly positive. All of us at Ventas have an abiding commitment to staying strong and steady and winning the recovery on behalf of all of our stakeholders.  Now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Justin Hutchens.\nJustin Hutchens: Thank you, Debbie. I'd like to begin by highlighting the fourth quarter performance and first quarter performance expectations. First, I would like to mention that we are humbled and grateful that HHS continues to recognize the crucial role senior living plays in protecting vulnerable older Americans. Through the CARES Act, HHS has provided several rounds of funding to assisted living communities to partially mitigate losses directly suffered because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Through this program, applicable to sequential same-store SHOP assets, our communities have received $34 million in the fourth quarter and $13 million to date in the first quarter, which has been applied as a contract expense to offset COVID-19-related expenses incurred.  After a challenging fourth quarter and January in which the national spread of COVID-19 hit all-time highs, our communities experienced an increase in resident cases and we had more communities closed to move-ins. Leading indicators have followed a similar pattern. Leads and move-ins drifted down throughout November and December while at the same time, move-outs were elevated. Although the fourth quarter was a challenging quarter, we are pleased that our occupancy hung in there with a 90 basis point decline.  Looking ahead to the remainder of the first quarter. For the forecast Q1 sequential same-store SHOP portfolio, we expect cash NOI to decline from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, excluding HHS grants of $34 million and $13 million to date in each respective period. This NOI deterioration is driven by a 250 to 325 basis point expected occupancy decline, partially offset by a modest rate increase. We expect to see continued elevated operating expenses into the first quarter.  And while we are seeing continued high levels of COVID-related costs, these are partially mitigated by $13 million of Phase 3 HHS grant money received to date in the first quarter. I'll add that recent severe winter weather across the country could cause additional expenses as well as delays in move-ins. We haven't included any impacts, if any, in our guidance.  While we are experiencing choppy waters at this stage of the pandemic, I would like to highlight green shoots that support a more optimistic outlook ahead. I'll start by highlighting our improving clinical trends. Consistent with the U.S. COVID case trends, our SHOP communities are experiencing a significant decline in new COVID cases. In the most recent week, we are averaging 9 cases per day, which is the lowest since October and down from 92 cases per day at the peak in January. We couldn't be more relieved about this improvement, knowing this means less illness and less people potentially dying from COVID.  This positive clinical trend is also important to local health departments' support of our communities' ability to accept new move-ins and to offer a more robust living experience for our residents. I'd like to comment on the early success our operators have had deploying the vaccine to residents and employees within our SHOP portfolio. As Debbie mentioned, 100% of our assisted living and memory care communities have hosted their first vaccine clinic.  In other good news related to the vaccine, 2 studies from Spain and Israel have come out showing favorable data that people who are vaccinated and still contract COVID-19 are far less likely to spread the illness to others than if they were not vaccinated. The execution of the vaccine is a massively important step towards the stabilization and growth in our senior housing platform. I'll note that 95% of our communities are already open to move-ins, which is near our pandemic high.  I'll remind you of the importance of the segments mentioned in our business update. Currently, 80% of our communities are operating in segment 3. This is up from 64% a month ago. Segment 3 is the least restrictive operating environment. The communities in this segment offer a more robust living experience, includes a more open dining experience and small group activities. Most importantly, it allows for less restrictive visitation between residents and their loved ones. As more communities expand their service offering, demand for our services should improve.  Leads and move-ins started to pick up again in January with the highest number of leads we have witnessed since the beginning of the pandemic. We have seen broad-based strength in lead volume across regions. And the initial indication is that this momentum has continued into February. The increase in leads have been bolstered by very strong growth in our Le Groupe Maurice portfolio in Canada and consistent strong lead performance by Atria in the U.S.  To summarize our optimism, new COVID cases down, vaccine distribution on track, leading to a more robust living experience and all combining to support higher leads. We continue to monitor these positive trends on a real-time basis and remain focused on supporting our operating partners as they get positioned to win the recovery.  Moving on to triple-net senior housing. In the fourth quarter and through January, Ventas received all of its expected triple-net senior housing cash rents. Our underlying triple-net senior housing portfolio performance continues to be impacted by COVID-19. However, due to a mix of lease resolutions executed in 2020, government subsidies, including PPP loans and HHS funds and other tenant resources, our tenants have continued to pay as expected. Our trailing 12-month cash flow coverage for senior housing is 1.3x, respectively.  I'll comment on the senior housing industry outlook. Our competitive outlook has continued to evolve amid the pandemic. In 2020, construction starts nationally were down 50% year-over-year and deliveries were at their lowest levels since 2013. Our SHOP markets witnessed particularly favorable supply trends with starts down 66% versus the prior year and deliveries down over 40%. We are optimistic about the long-term impact from lower construction starts. Fewer starts today, combined with the compelling aging demographic trends, where the 80-plus population is expected to grow nearly 15% between now and 2024, which is 5x faster than the broader population, will provide a potent tailwind over the next few years.  Moving on to final comments. I'd like to comment on the tremendous job well done our operator partners and frontline staff have done prioritizing the health and safety of our residents and employees throughout a very challenging period. We couldn't be more proud of their focus, determination, courage and perseverance throughout the pandemic. I'd also like to note our excitement in support for Jack Callison, the new CEO of Sunrise Senior Living. We know Jack to be an accomplished and charismatic leader who is extremely qualified to lead Sunrise.  I'll finish by reiterating our optimistic outlook as we consider the improving clinical trends, vaccine rollout, communities opening for move-ins with a more robust living experience and post-pandemic supply-demand tailwinds that give us continued confidence and a very strong positive growth trajectory in senior housing.  With that, I'll hand the call to Pete.\nPeter Bulgarelli: Thanks, Justin. I'll cover the Office and health care triple-net segments. Together, these segments represent 47% of Ventas' NOI. They continue to produce strong results, showcasing their value proposition and financial strength amongst the pandemic. In fact, for the full year 2020, these segments combined to generate same-store cash NOI growth of 3%.  First, I'll cover Office. MOBs and Research & Innovation centers, the 2 lines of business within our Office portfolio, they play a key role in the delivery of crucial health care services and research for life-saving vaccines and therapeutics. The office portfolio continued to provide steady growth, delivering $128 million of same-store cash NOI in the fourth quarter. This represents a 1.5% sequential growth, led by our R&I portfolio, which generated 3.6% same-store cash NOI growth.  Moreover, full year Office same-store cash NOI grew 3.3% versus 2019, near the midpoint of original 2020 Office guidance of 3% to 4% despite the impacts of COVID-19. Normalizing for a pay parking shortfall and increased cleaning cost due to COVID, same-store cash NOI grew 4.5%, surpassing our pre-COVID guidance range.  In terms of rent receipts, Office tenants paid an industry-leading 99.2% of contractual rent in the fourth quarter. For the entire period, from April through December, tenants paid 99.4% of contractual rent. This is without deducts or deferrals, which were de minimis. Substantially, all granted deferrals have been repaid and new deferrals were negligible during the fourth quarter. Continuing the trend, we have collected 98% of January contractual rents, on track to meet or exceed the fourth quarter collection rate. February to date collection results are also strong and are at a consistent pace when compared to the fourth quarter.  This strong performance is enabled by the mission-critical nature of our portfolio and by our high-quality, creditworthy tenancy. In our medical office portfolio, nearly 85% of our NOI comes from investment-grade-rated tenants and HCA. In our R&I portfolio, a 76% of our revenues come directly from investment-grade-rated organizations and publicly traded companies. Medical office had a record level retention of 88% for the fourth quarter and 87% for the trailing 12 months.  Driven by this retention, total Office leasing was 700,000 square feet for the quarter and 3.4 million square feet for the full year of 2020. This includes 540,000 square feet of new leasing. Total leasing far exceeded our pre-COVID 2020 plan. All of our MOB properties are in elective surgery restriction-free locations. As a result, we are seeing positive utilization trends that mirror increased admissions and surgery volumes being reported by the health systems. As an example, pay parking receipts during the second quarter of 2020 were only 46% of normal. During the fourth quarter, however, pay parking recovered to 71% of normal.  As Debbie mentioned, we continue to be excited about the Office business and particularly investment opportunities in the R&I space. In the fourth quarter, we closed our acquisition of the 3-asset, 800,000-square foot trophy life sciences portfolio in San Francisco. Since last quarter's announcement, we have renewed a large tenant and signed 2 new leases, bringing the building to 100% leased, a clear demonstration of the attractiveness of these buildings to the marketplace. We also opened our $80 million R&I development on the campus of Arizona State, located within the Phoenix Biomedical Campus, a 30-acre innovation district established by the city of Phoenix in the heart of downtown. The building is over 50% pre-leased and is ahead of pro forma.  Now let's turn to health care triple-net. During the fourth quarter, our health care triple-net assets showed continued strength. We have received 100% of fourth quarter rents as well as 100% of January and 100% of February rents. Trailing 12-month EBITDARM cash flow coverage improved sequentially for all our health care triple-net asset classes, except skilled nursing despite COVID-19. Acute and post-acute providers had early access to significant government funding to create liquidity and mitigate pandemic-related losses.  Acute care hospitals' trailing 12-month coverage was a strong 3.3 in the third quarter, a 20 basis point sequential improvement, driven by a rebound in elective surgical procedures, prudent expense management as well as government funding. Ardent continues to perform extremely well in this dynamic market condition. And all of Ardent's hospitals reside in jurisdictions that are open for elective procedures. We are excited to continue growing with Ardent. During the fourth quarter, Ardent opened a new outpatient cancer center on the campus in their hospital in Amarillo, Texas. The cancer center features best-in-class equipment and facilities for radiation therapy, chemotherapy and cancer care.  We invested approximately $30 million at a near 8% stabilized yield. IRF and LTAC coverage improved 10 basis points to 1.6x in the third quarter, buoyed by strong business results and government funding. In particular, Kindred has demonstrated its core competency in treating complex patient cases. Census levels continued to be very high. And finally, within our loan portfolio, our Colony, Holiday and Brookdale loans are all fully current.  I'd like to close with a thank you, a sincere thank you to our frontline staff, who have kept these critical facilities open during this difficult time. You are all heroes. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.\nRobert Probst: Thanks, Pete. In my remarks today, I'll cover our 2020 enterprise fourth quarter results, our expectations for the first quarter of 2021 and our recent liquidity, balance sheet and capital activities.  Let's start with our fourth quarter financial performance. Ventas reported fourth quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.29 per share and normalized funds from operations of $0.83 per share or $0.74, excluding the $0.09 in HHS grants received in SHOP in Q4. Other sequential fourth quarter drivers to highlight include $0.04 of income recorded in our unconsolidated entities, offset by a $0.05 Q4 sequential decline in NOI, principally in SHOP. Meanwhile, Office and triple-net healthcare was stable on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter.  That's a good segue way to our Q1 guidance as Q4 is an appropriate start point for our first quarter 2021 expectations. The key components of our Q1 guidance are as follows. Net income attributable to common stockholders is estimated to range between minus $0.07 and minus $0.01 per fully diluted share. Normalized FFO is forecast to range from $0.66 to $0.71 per share. The midpoint of our FFO guidance, $0.68 per share, represents a $0.15 sequential decline from the fourth quarter. This change can be largely explained by a $0.09 reduction in HHS grant income and income from unconsolidated entities. The balance is driven by a $0.05 reduction in organic SHOP NOI performance.  A few of the key SHOP Q1 assumptions include Q1 2021 average occupancy ranging from 250 to 325 basis points lower versus the fourth quarter average; sequential growth in REVPOR as a result of the annual in-place rent increases implemented at the start of 2021; and continued elevated levels of operating expenses, driven by COVID labor and testing. Outside of SHOP, we expect our property NOI to be stable on a sequential basis in the first quarter. A normalized FFO per share bridge from our fourth quarter to our first quarter 2021 guidance midpoint, together with key assumptions, can be found in our press release and our business update presentation posted to our website today.  I'll close with our balance sheet and capital activity. I am proud of the actions the Ventas team has taken to manage our balance sheet, leverage and liquidity. We have navigated the disruption created by COVID and kept Ventas strong and stable while protecting shareholder capital. I'd highlight a few of our most recent actions and results.  First, some key stats from 2020. We finished 2020 with full year net debt-to-EBITDA of 6.1x, maintained a strong maturity profile with duration exceeding 6 years, had held total debt to gross asset value at 37%, reduced our net debt at year-end by over $500 million year-over-year and retained robust liquidity exceeding $3 billion.  In 2020, we also took advantage of the strong bid for health care real estate and realized over $1 billion in asset sales at a blended 5.3% cash yield. In 2021, we're targeting an additional $1 billion in asset sales across our verticals in the second half of the year. Proceeds from dispositions are expected to be used to reduce debt and to fund future growth through development and redevelopment capital spend.  In January 2021, we closed on a new 4-year $2.75 billion unsecured credit facility. We had great demand from 24 new and incumbent financial institutions and we're able to realize better pricing. I'd like to personally thank our banking partners for their support of Ventas. They are critical to our success.  And finally, in March 2021, Ventas will use cash on hand from recent dispositions to reduce our near-term maturities by fully repaying $400 million of our 3.1% senior notes due January 2023. As a result of these and other actions, we're positioned to capitalize on the powerful upside across our business once the pandemic is finally in the rearview mirror.  That concludes our prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions]. With that, I will turn the call back to the operator.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.\nJuan Sanabria: I was just hoping, Debbie, maybe you could provide a little color on the acquisition pipeline. You talked about it being robust across your various verticals. So I guess I'm curious what asset texture of the most interest. You've been kind of quiet on the seniors housing acquisition front for a while. It seems like Ardent might have some new opportunities if it merges with LifePoint. I'm curious if that acquisition pipeline is more focused on balance sheet or through the fund.\nDebra Cafaro: Well, it's great to hear from you. I would say that we have a lot of options now as we look at investment opportunities. Not only can we look across the 5 asset types, but also we have a number of tools we can use to acquire assets, either on balance sheet or in our investment management business. So I'd say we're really looking across the board. We've got obviously a lot of life sciences and research and innovation, both ground-up development as well as acquisition activity. We've got some senior housing possibilities in the pipeline.  Ardent is obviously doing well. And we continue to look for similarly high-quality opportunities in that space. And so it really is quite interesting and across the board. And as I mentioned, we're continuing to invest with LGM. They have done just an incredible job, both on the management of the stable portfolio but also in developing and leasing up very quickly these Class A assets. And we're looking forward to doing more of that with LGM as well.\nJuan Sanabria: Okay. And then just for my follow-up on the disposition front, switching to the opposite side, the $1 billion for '21 that you've targeted for the second half, could you provide any color on the types of assets you're selling? If I think about this time last year, you talked about maybe joint venturing Eclipse. You had some Atria assets that were on the block. So if you could just give us a little bit more color on the flavor there.\nDebra Cafaro: Good one. I mean I gave a little clue when we talked about Justin and Pete really optimizing the portfolio. So while we're really looking across the board, I would say that senior housing and maybe some select MOBs could fall within that disposition pipeline.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi.\nNicholas Joseph: Maybe just following up on that question. I know you said it's the back half of the year. But just curious what the timing is and then the cap rates on any of those asset sales, just trying to get a sense of any potential dilution in the back half of this year into 2022.\nDebra Cafaro: Yes. I mean, obviously, we're going to look to be smart about when and how we do it. I would basically just refer you to kind of the back half, and you can make a weighted assumption around timing. It's obviously TBD. And cap rates also TBD, but we would look really to find lower cap rate assets that we could dispose of. And obviously, you can see in the market, there's a really strong bid across the board in these asset classes. And that is a very good sign for our ability to execute in a really effective way.\nNicholas Joseph: And then maybe just on the senior housing side, I'm looking at your business update, with the move-outs trending higher at least through January, what percentage of those were voluntary? And then how have voluntary move-outs trended over the past few months?\nDebra Cafaro: Yes. I'm going to turn it over to Justin. I mean, as we've mentioned, I mean, the key points are really around the clinical results. Because you really have to think about leading indicators, seeing cases in mortality. And then when those start to improve significantly, as we've seen, the lagging indicators of NOI and occupancy tends to follow. So I'll turn it over to Justin, so he can really address your questions in specific.\nJustin Hutchens: In regards to the recent trend upwards in move-outs, that's mostly clinically related hospitalizations, deaths. The voluntary move-out questions come up. We really haven't seen a high number of discretionary move-outs that are for reasons other than clinical purposes.\nOperator: Your next question today comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya with Mizuho.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Two quick ones for me. REVPOR growth in the quarter were kind of down meaningfully. I think it was negative 3.3% or so. Could you talk a little bit about kind of what caused that? I think you had made some comments about kind of concessions and discounts and things like that. And kind of how is that trending in the early stages of 2021?\nDebra Cafaro: Yes. I mean we are projecting positive REVPOR sequentially. And I'll turn it over to Bob to elaborate.\nRobert Probst: All right. Cool. So in the fourth quarter, you're right to say down on REVPOR. Tayo, really two drivers there. One is simply discounting in the effort to get occupancy, definitely seeing that in the marketplace. The second is mix. With Canada continuing to perform really strongly, Canada has a lower REVPOR, you see a mixed impact. And it's a combination of those 2 things on a sequential basis which drives the number you see on REVPOR. Positively looking ahead to Q1, we're expecting growth. And again, that in-place increase, very much in line with what we've seen historically, which is quite positive and so expect to see that as a tailwind in the first quarter on revenue.\nOmotayo Okusanya: So no additional -- that whole discounting concession thing is not kind of rising through the first quarter of '21?\nRobert Probst: Well, I think that will likely carry on, at least in the short run. But you see the lift of the in-place rents, which happens Jan 1 across the good part of the population. So that really benefits the first quarter.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Okay. Great. And then on the government reimbursement side, any thoughts or any estimates in regards to how much HHS grants seem maybe due under kind of like the Phase 2 and Phase 3 programs from last year? And generally, what are you hearing about future government support, just kind of given the change in administration?\nDebra Cafaro: Right. We've had, with our industry partners, a really effective public outreach on this exact point of really the impact of COVID-19 on these communities and on seniors. And we have made so much progress, Tayo, as evidenced by the willingness of HHS to mitigate some of the COVID-19 impacts by the amounts that we've received to date, which for us has been, I think, about $48 million or so. And we're very grateful for that, as Justin mentioned.  What we're focused on going forward is there continues to be significant billions remaining in the HHS fund -- well, first of all, Phase 3 could result in additional funding. That's an unknown. There's also multiple tens of billions remaining in the HHS fund, which hopefully can be utilized beyond Phase 3 to support the health care providers writ large, including senior housing.  And then in terms of additional COVID relief packages, we would endeavor to make the case that some of those funds should be either earmarked for or certainly available to be used to mitigate the continuing impact of COVID-19 on the 1 to 2 million seniors, who are cared for in senior living. So that's the framework, and we'll continue to try to make -- be effective advocates with policymakers to produce a favorable and, I think, very justifiable outcome on a public health priority basis.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.\nMichael Carroll: I want to see if you could provide some color on the occupancy expectation going into the first quarter of '21. I guess the 250 to 325 basis point decline in average occupancy, I mean, what does that trend look like on a, I guess, week-to-week or month-to-month basis on the low end versus the high end? I mean, do you expect declines to continue at this pace through to February and then start to moderate in March? Or how should we think about that?\nDebra Cafaro: Yes. Good question. I'm going to turn it over to my colleagues. And again, I think in light of the conditions in January, we are -- feel that our portfolio is really hanging in there in terms of leads and occupancy. So I'll turn it over to the team to answer the specific question that you're asking.\nRobert Probst: Sure. I'll take that. So Mike, you can see on Page 12 of our investor presentation, some of the most recent data on the trends in the quarter on occupancy. If you look at it quarter-to-date on average, we're down about 210 basis points quarter-to-date, really driven by that January result. If you just extrapolated that to the full quarter, i.e., kind of baked what we have and held from there, we'd be at the better end of the guidance range, 250 basis points down. If the trend continued down, as we've seen in the first quarter-to-date and carried on, that would be the lower end, i.e., the worse end of the range. And so it's really kind of -- that's the guardrails, if you like, stabilization versus continuation of the trend, if you want to think of that, that way.\nMichael Carroll: Okay. Great. And then I guess, on the move-ins, obviously there was an uptick on an absolute basis in January. But it still looks like the percentage compared to 2019 actually dropped. I mean is a good way to think about that is, is that the seasonal nature of leads probably is not holding right now, just given the COVID impact, and you're just more optimistic because the absolute number is actually increasing?\nDebra Cafaro: I think what is incredibly encouraging is that the clinical conditions in January were the worst that they've been really since the beginning of the pandemic. And you can see that on the slide, yet we are getting incredible demand, in my opinion, in January, nonetheless, through both leads and move-ins. And that, to me, is an incredible combination and one that is just really heartening about this being a kind of need-based business that is going to be resilient. And that happens during the toughest times. And so that's what -- that is the key point, Mike. Thank you for raising it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.\nNick Yulico: I guess just, first off, maybe if you wouldn't mind providing the -- you gave the vaccine data, which was good, on number of residents, number of staff. Do you have that in terms of a percentage of the residents and of the staff who've gotten the vaccine so far? And Atria...\nDebra Cafaro: Yes. In general, the uptake with the residents has been really, really high, in and around the 90% range. And probably even higher if you take out people who were ineligible, either because they had just had COVID or something like that or another medical condition. And amongst the staff, it's really been in that 40%-ish, plus or minus, at the beginning on the first clinic. But we're seeing way higher uptake of employees getting that first shot at the second clinic. And so those numbers are going much higher both because of an increasing comfort level with the vaccine and also some operator, we'll call it, incentives and requirements. And Justin, maybe you can touch on what the operators are doing in the vaccine to make the uptake better.\nJustin Hutchens: Absolutely. So there's been -- the standard practice across the sector is communication, incentives, bringing a lot of attention and quite frankly, celebration around the vaccine. That's been very successful. We have operators that have mandated vaccine as well. Where that's happened, we've seen the employee numbers tick up significantly. And we know at least 2 that have made the decision to mandate. There are several others where we know it's under consideration. And it's been met with a lot of success, where those employee numbers are closer to 80%.\nNick Yulico: Okay. Great. That was very helpful. Just second question is on the leads having picked up. I guess, are you getting any information from your prospective tenants about at what point they're going to increasingly convert that lead into a move-in? Is it has something to do with the percentage of people in the facility that are vaccinated or a reduced rate of COVID in a facility? I guess I'm just trying to sort of understand at what point if leads are down, still around 20%, moving to down around 20%, at some point, you get closer to 100%. But what are -- are you getting any information from prospective tenants about that?\nJustin Hutchens: Yes. I can definitely give you some color. One point about our leads is that leads are actually stronger in our U.S. portfolio, but our move-ins have been stronger in Canada. So when you think about us, think about a higher conversion rate in Canada, there's less dependency on external agencies to get move-ins. But if you focus in on the U.S., one thing that we found interesting is that the lead volume is very high, as Debbie mentioned, in spite of the clinical backdrop. But we're also still missing out on some typical sources for leads. And that includes respites, that includes personal and professional referral sources, which are all our highest converted leads. So as the lead bank starts to materialize and get back to normal, not only the leads go up, but our conversion should go with it. So our operators are fairly bullish on the outlook. But that remains to be seen, obviously.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Connor Siversky with Berenberg.\nConnor Siversky: You had mentioned in the prepared remarks, just switching gears to the R&I portfolio, that uCity was attracting some significant leasing interest. I'm just wondering if you can quantify at all how this is progressing and then what the path looks up to stabilization on that end.\nDebra Cafaro: Good to have you. I'm going to turn that over to our team to talk about the significant leasing interest there in the uCity market.\nPeter Bulgarelli: John, did you want to take that? Or would like me?\nJohn Cobb: Sure. Yes, this is John Cobb. I think we have a lot of good leads. I think we're shopping a lot of LOIs back and forth, but the interest is high. But it's -- when you start building and you start going vertical, the interest is much higher when you're doing that.\nConnor Siversky: Okay. And then just related to the development of the independent living communities in Qu\u00e9bec with Le Groupe Maurice, I'm just wondering if that occupancy metrics you guys provided, does that take into account the 800 units that had just recently opened?\nDebra Cafaro: Yes. Well, that, I believe, is those 800 units. So this is what is remarkable and we're trying to have it rub off on us here south of the border is that LGM built these large projects, Class A for independent living, a younger, healthier senior. They're really beautiful. We hope to take you there someday. And then they have a really significant pre-marketing effort, a lot of pre-leasing and deposits. And these communities opened in the fourth quarter and they're already nearly 80% occupied.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Bernstein with Capital One.\nDaniel Bernstein: Glad to hear an upbeat tone and outlook. The question I do have though, I think the move-ins are kind of rather simple math, demographics going up, construction going down, COVID levels going down. But I'm trying to understand a little bit better the move-outs. And particularly, if you have any color on average entrance age of residents coming in and thoughts on length of stay and whether that's going to offset some of the improvement that seems likely to come on the move-in side.\nJustin Hutchens: Dan, it's Justin. You mentioned -- I'll start with the second part of your question. Length of stay has actually gone up. And the reason for that is we've had less respite stays over this past year, far less. So that averages up without the short-term stays of respite. In terms of the type of resident moving in, we also haven't seen a lot of change there either. There's the age group demographic, the type of resident, care needs, everything has been relatively consistent. We just need more of them. And as we mentioned, leads are certainly on their way up.\nDaniel Bernstein: Okay. And then the other question I had on SHOP, I don't know if you can give a kind of a general idea of what the rent increases are in 1Q versus maybe historical and whether those are kind of what we should be thinking about when we model that versus historical 1Q increases.\nDebra Cafaro: Well, since that's a modeling one, Bob, do you want to take that?\nRobert Probst: Yes. I love the modeling ones. So historically, we've seen sort of mid-single-digit in-place increases every -- nearly every year. And that's again sort of an overarching number to think about. From there though, a few considerations. There's always a percentage of the population to whom that does not apply. And that could be those who are on an anniversary renewal or those who came in, moved in late in the year and aren't subject to a thing like that. So all of that said, it blends in on a sequential Q4 to Q1 REVPOR basis to improve REVPOR overall. And that is one of the powers of having the occupancy in place in December is to have that benefit.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC.\nRich Anderson: So if investment activity can be used as a proxy for perhaps your level of confidence in things going forward, your company has a history of sort of hunkering down at the right times. I recall back in '08/'09 time frame, you were quick to protect the balance sheet like a lot of your peers, but I remember that in particular. You now have $1 billion of asset sales. You refer to paying down debt with that, at least in part. But then you also talk about this pipeline of activity. So I'm not -- I can't get a good sense of where you are at on a net disposition or net acquisition perspective. Or are you kind of still in the point where you're sort of hedging your bet, you could go one direction or another? Or are you sort of thinking along the lines of sort of a neutral impact?\nDebra Cafaro: Well, we are -- thank you. It's really good to hear from you. I mean, we are continuing to invest very actively, as I mentioned, in life science, in these LGM developments. We do have an acquisition pipeline. So it really is a case-by-case basis. And we continue to evaluate conditions very carefully and are really in a great position, given all the things that we've done and all the pieces we've put in place, to be able to really act opportunistically as and when we believe the circumstances are appropriate based on risk-adjusted return. And so I feel good about where we are. And we have a long history, as you know, of doing $2 billion to $3 billion a year of investment activity. And we're in the market in all the verticals and have the team and the capital options. And so it will be based upon what opportunities become available.\nRich Anderson: Fair enough. Okay. And then on the HHS grants, you guys were perhaps earlier than some others in terms of getting your hands on it. But nonetheless, it impacts the assisted living side more, obviously. I think you're 60% ALF and 40% independent. I mean, correct me if I'm wrong on that, I could have that backwards. But does this inform you about where the opportunities might exist going forward in terms of that specific debate between ILF and ALF?\nDebra Cafaro: Well, I think we would base our investment decisions and our portfolio composition really on the fundamental opportunities that we see rather than what I'll call bridge support for the pandemic impact. So I think you're roughly in the ballpark on the 60-40. But I'll turn it over to Justin really to talk about how he thinks about those asset classes and the differences and opportunities there.\nRich Anderson: And before you do that, Justin, I was thinking in terms of perhaps being there some disruption in the ILF side, which would make you more interested today just from the standpoint of there being better opportunities because of the lack of HHS. But then anyway, that was the basis of my question. Go ahead. Sorry.\nDebra Cafaro: I see.\nJustin Hutchens: It's Justin. Yes, in terms of the disruption, ILs really held up okay. It held up in early going based on having lower move-outs, longer length of stay. Move-ins have continued in the IL setting. They are generally a higher-margin business. So they have a little more room to work with as occupancy has fallen. They don't benefit from HHS funds, so a little later to the -- from a vaccine standpoint. But vaccine clinics are being set up in the IL setting. So that's on that point.  And then in general, the first thing we're always going to look at is the market. And we have within our data set, over 800 MSAs that we study. And within those, we can determine which products will work, which price point is appropriate, could be IL, AL, memory care. But we would always start there and then look -- so market, then it's the quality of property and then it's opportunity for successful execution.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nJordan Sadler: So Justin, I was -- I wanted to just get your take on sort of historical seasonality. I know how familiar you are with this business in terms of SHOP. What percent of annual move-ins take place in December, January, February in the SHOP portfolio generally?\nJustin Hutchens: So there's a little bit on the seasonality. When you look at it on a quarterly basis, there's not a big change ins or outs. You tend to have relatively higher move-outs in the fourth quarter and the first quarter and then lower move-outs in the third and fourth. And then move-ins will move within quarters. Some months that jump out to me are January, August, September, where you get a little bit of spike, April, May or some -- usually some good move-in months. But on a quarter-to-quarter basis, it's only like 1% change from 1 quarter to the next. And you just kind of -- usually, you have opportunities to net significantly during those times when the move-outs are lower. I'm not sure if that's helpful. And I'm sure you're [indiscernible]\nJordan Sadler: Yes. Go ahead, finish, sorry.\nJustin Hutchens: Yes, I was just going to say, in this setting, seasonality hasn't really held up because the clinical impacts have been so severe at times. That's had impact on demand. And then of course, I mentioned the difference in our lead bank in that there's a lot more opportunity for that to get back to a normalized level. And so it's really hard to point to seasonality in this current environment.\nJordan Sadler: It sounds like typically you're saying you see higher move-outs in 1Q and 4Q, but move-ins generally are more steady.\nJustin Hutchens: Yes, that's about right.\nJordan Sadler: Okay. And then as a sort of non sequitur follow-up, of the disposition guidance for 2021, Debbie or Bob, is any -- what portion of that is scheduled or expected loan repayments?\nRobert Probst: What's the mix of debt reduction versus other investments, in other words, Jordan?\nJordan Sadler: Yes. I think if there's $1 billion of disposition guidance for the year, like is any of that loan repayment?\nRobert Probst: I see, I see the question. Yes. No, it's majority asset sales.\nJordan Sadler: That's majority loan repayments or would that be over and above or you just don't expect any?\nRobert Probst: There may be some. But again, a significant majority will be asset sales as it was in 2020.\nJordan Sadler: Okay. Because I know you have some maturities in 2021. But those could be extended?\nRobert Probst: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.\nVikram Malhotra: Just maybe first one on senior housing overall. Now that you have higher percentage vaccinated, you've got your rents in place in January for SHOP and you sort of pointed to some light at the end of the tunnel, I'm just wondering, higher level, is there an initial sort of preliminary strategy you can lay out for us in terms of how you're thinking to start gaining back this occupancy? I mean demand will come when it is. But just in terms of flexing rents versus occupancy, high level kind of -- is there a strategy that you can lay out? And does that differ by product type or geography?\nDebra Cafaro: Yes. And different operators take different views as well based on the particular conditions in markets, as you point out. So Justin, do you want to address Vikram's question, please?\nJustin Hutchens: Absolutely. So I mentioned -- but I'll try, I'd like to step back for a second and just reiterate the underlying demand that the operators are facing and how they're trying to play into that. I had mentioned before that leads are very strong, and we're missing parts of the typical lead bank that could help bolster things. But if you look back a little bit, and you look back into September, October, if you look at our leads and our move-ins, you can see that we're running 80% and 90%, respectively, no vaccine in sight at the time. So the underlying demand remains really strong. Our operators are well aware of that. We even had, at that time in October, almost 60% of our communities that were achieving 100% or more of their prior-to-COVID typical move-in run rate. So all of that bodes well. And as operators have tried to play into that and with the backdrop of, of course, the clinical trends they were facing throughout the end of last year, beginning of this year, they're taking different approaches.  One I'll highlight is Atria. I mentioned that they have bolstered our overall lead growth and volume. And they've done that with the help of discounting and it's worked. Because they've had higher occupancy, higher leads as a result. We've had others that have been a little more local market-focused, holding back a little bit to preserve rate. And that worked as well. And moving ahead, I think what every operator is focused on is the wide variety of different referral sources that they've relied in, in the past, how to rejuvenate those moving forward and to play into that, the optimistic kind of supply-demand outlook I gave as well as the trends that are positioning our communities to accept move-ins again.\nVikram Malhotra: Okay. That's helpful. Yes, and it's interesting, to your point, even if you look back a year ago, just based on the numbers you gave, it doesn't seem like the conversion rates have fallen off dramatically in terms of leads to move-ins. It seems like those rates are maybe a little lower but not dramatically lower. So that's sort of another positive.  I guess just on the triple-net side, two quick clarifications. So you do have -- your EBITDA is probably closer to the low 1s, if I'm not wrong. And you have at a minimum 4 years left on maturity for a lot of these leases that are kind of in that range or below. So I'm just wondering if there is a need or thought or are you just able to adjust rents or convert some of these to RIDEA. And could you just clarify in that the cash flow coverage -- I may be thinking wrong about this. But in the quarter or historically, are there -- just the last 2 quarters, is there any -- the provider funds or the relief funds, they're not factored into that coverage, are they?\nDebra Cafaro: Yes, I'll take that. So look, I mean, we have been really successful during 2020, since Justin been here, at really having some outstanding resolutions of the bigger relationships we have with partners like Brookdale and Holiday and others. And that's been really helpful. And we've received significant cash upfront as well as participation in the upside through either warrants or conversions to management contracts. So those have been really well received and rightly so. Our operators, as you mentioned, really have been the beneficiaries in some cases of government funding that would principally be in the fourth quarter. Of course, that would benefit coverage.  But our statistics are really through the end of the third quarter, which is always on a 1 quarter lag, as you know. So they will be factored in. They'll be called out separately as we have with some of the health care providers in the supplemental materials. And so you'll be able to do your own analysis. But again, remember that the funding is really intended to be a bridge, if you will, to replace NOI that would otherwise be there and hopefully will otherwise be there in the future. So that's how we've been thinking about it.\nVikram Malhotra: Fair enough. But just to clarify, you don't anticipate the need. Given what you did in 2020, you don't anticipate the need for more rent adjustments or conversions near term?\nDebra Cafaro: It really depends on COVID, just like almost every other answer we could give you on the call today. The operators are really hanging in there. As Justin said, they're doing an incredible job on health and safety. And right now, we're getting all the rent that we expect to receive and the operators are getting government funding in many cases. So that's a good picture. And if the leading indicators that we've discussed really take hold and gain traction and result in improved occupancy and NOI as we look forward in the year, then I think we feel okay about where we are.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays.\nSteven Valiquette: So I guess, first one, just regarding the percent of SHOP communities open for move-ins, that data on the bottom of Page 11, the explantation looks pretty positive with that metric jumping up from around 80% in early January to now 95% just in the last month or so, those communities available for -- open for move-ins.  So I guess I'm just curious to hear more color. Is that driven more by either voluntary policy changes by the operators? Or is it more just changes in local government guidelines? And how much of this is simply driven by the benefits of the COVID vaccine, if we're able to get the extra color around all that as far as that improvement?\nJustin Hutchens: It's Justin. Yes. So what you'll see is the -- first of all, 95% of our communities are open to move-ins. And then we segmented them based on just their restrictive environment. And what drives that, segment two and segment three, segment three is the most open, most consistent with pre-COVID lifestyle. Segment two has some restrictions, but you can certainly take move-ins. And it's the state and local health departments that are really weighing in on how open a community can be. And so those conversations are happening constantly. And it's very much driven by recent COVID activity, sometimes in the broader community, sometimes within our own communities. So that's fluid. But as you can tell from the overall picture that new cases are down and open communities are up. So it's looking good across the board.\nSteven Valiquette: Yes. Okay. And one other quick question, since we spent, I feel, like half of this call discussing leads and move-ins, I think you just confirmed that the definition of a lead hasn't really changed for today versus 2019, when you're showing that data on Page 12. And if there is, it's just a quick one-liner on what officially defines a lead for you. It'd be great to remind us of that as well since that can differ sometimes from one company to the next.\nJustin Hutchens: Sure. So a lead is defined really, another way to put it, is an inquiry. And it's distinct. And so it's new. So each month, when you see our data, all the leads that we're representing are new to that month. We don't carry forward. And it's from -- any source, could be through the Internet, could be through referrals, could be a drive-by, for instance, any source that's interested in moving in is characterized as a lead.\nDebra Cafaro: And that's remained consistent.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lukas Hartwich with Green Street.\nLukas Hartwich: Just one left for me. So it looks like the majority of your loan investments are maturing or can be repaid early in 2021. So I was just hoping you could provide a little bit color of what you expect around that.\nDebra Cafaro: Right now is that -- is they -- as you point out, they are open to repayment and some are also open to extension. So our current expectation is extension. But of course, that could change. And we always like to be repaid. So either way, I think we're in good shape.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Maybe a follow-up on Steve's question earlier on the vaccination, COVID cases coming down. When you guys think like big picture, everyone -- it seems like by the end of this month, everyone is going to be vaccinated within your SHOP portfolio. Do you think you start seeing a pickup in movement because of that? Or is the customer's mindset to overall kind of COVID level across their community? And then how are your operators, I guess, going to respond to vaccinations? Like will they be able to increase visits? Because that feels like one of the big hurdles to getting people to move their parents in.\nJustin Hutchens: It's Justin. Yes. So first of all, just the fact that there has been vaccines available has played a role in some of the uptick in leads. So certainly, there's an expectation that when the vaccines are fully executed that, that attracts higher leads, more potential demand that would make perfect sense. In terms of defining the lifestyle moving forward, I mentioned that the health departments play an important role in working with operators to define that. Certainly, operators want a robust living experience, as I mentioned, for the residents. They're working hard to give the best lifestyle available. But they're going to work within health department guidelines. And I would expect that to continue for a period of time as they work through this next phase.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up on the opening comments. You mentioned that the severe weather that's hitting the country now isn't in guidance. Have any of your facilities been impacted by the power outages in Texas that you know of at this time?\nDebra Cafaro: Yes. I mean, it's been a biblical year, when you really want to think about it with COVID and wildfires and hurricanes. And now we have this severe winter storms in places you'd least expected. So yes, I mean, I think everyone -- many people in the real estate business have significant investments in Texas. And almost all of them will be affected by the power outages and related storm impacts. And that would include us.  And again, our operators are taking extraordinary measures in the case of senior housing to make sure that employees and residents are safe. And often we see in senior housing that after something like this, we see an uptick in interest because a lot of people are alone in their homes, and that's -- you're better off kind of together when things like this happens. So yes, I mean, we have investments in Texas across the board. And we, like others, would be affected by something as significant as the recent storm.\nOperator: And your last question in queue comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.\nMichael Mueller: It looks like the SHOP occupancy losses have been greater in the primary versus secondary, what you call other markets. What do you think in terms of recovery? Do you think the primary markets recover faster? And are you seeing any differences in lead trends so far?\nDebra Cafaro: Good question. Again, the leading indicators are flashing green. And Justin will answer your segmentation question.\nJustin Hutchens: It's Justin. So there's been -- we've studied the performance throughout the pandemic. There's a little bit of a disconnection in terms of our expectations relative to COVID impacts on move-ins and geographies because of the virus has really become -- through the fourth quarter, it became more widespread and more impactful. So as we look ahead, we're really just looking into local markets and looking at the fundamentals I mentioned earlier relative to our position in that market. And there's -- some of the primary markets are really benefiting from a reduction in construction as a percentage of inventory, which we're supportive. But I think to get a real good read on -- to answer your question, I think we're -- we have to go a little further beyond the pandemic to get a clearer view.\nOperator: And there are no further questions in queue at this time. I turn the call back over...\nDebra Cafaro: You've all been very patient. And I want to thank you, as always, for your interest in and your support of our company. We look forward to seeing you soon, and we hope that you and your family stay healthy, happy and optimistic.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Peter Bulgarelli",
            "content": "Thanks, Justin. I'll cover the Office and health care triple-net segments. Together, these segments represent 47% of Ventas' NOI. They continue to produce strong results, showcasing their value proposition and financial strength amongst the pandemic. In fact, for the full year 2020, these segments combined to generate same-store cash NOI growth of 3%.  First, I'll cover Office. MOBs and Research & Innovation centers, the 2 lines of business within our Office portfolio, they play a key role in the delivery of crucial health care services and research for life-saving vaccines and therapeutics. The office portfolio continued to provide steady growth, delivering $128 million of same-store cash NOI in the fourth quarter. This represents a 1.5% sequential growth, led by our R&I portfolio, which generated 3.6% same-store cash NOI growth.  Moreover, full year Office same-store cash NOI grew 3.3% versus 2019, near the midpoint of original 2020 Office guidance of 3% to 4% despite the impacts of COVID-19. Normalizing for a pay parking shortfall and increased cleaning cost due to COVID, same-store cash NOI grew 4.5%, surpassing our pre-COVID guidance range.  In terms of rent receipts, Office tenants paid an industry-leading 99.2% of contractual rent in the fourth quarter. For the entire period, from April through December, tenants paid 99.4% of contractual rent. This is without deducts or deferrals, which were de minimis. Substantially, all granted deferrals have been repaid and new deferrals were negligible during the fourth quarter. Continuing the trend, we have collected 98% of January contractual rents, on track to meet or exceed the fourth quarter collection rate. February to date collection results are also strong and are at a consistent pace when compared to the fourth quarter.  This strong performance is enabled by the mission-critical nature of our portfolio and by our high-quality, creditworthy tenancy. In our medical office portfolio, nearly 85% of our NOI comes from investment-grade-rated tenants and HCA. In our R&I portfolio, a 76% of our revenues come directly from investment-grade-rated organizations and publicly traded companies. Medical office had a record level retention of 88% for the fourth quarter and 87% for the trailing 12 months.  Driven by this retention, total Office leasing was 700,000 square feet for the quarter and 3.4 million square feet for the full year of 2020. This includes 540,000 square feet of new leasing. Total leasing far exceeded our pre-COVID 2020 plan. All of our MOB properties are in elective surgery restriction-free locations. As a result, we are seeing positive utilization trends that mirror increased admissions and surgery volumes being reported by the health systems. As an example, pay parking receipts during the second quarter of 2020 were only 46% of normal. During the fourth quarter, however, pay parking recovered to 71% of normal.  As Debbie mentioned, we continue to be excited about the Office business and particularly investment opportunities in the R&I space. In the fourth quarter, we closed our acquisition of the 3-asset, 800,000-square foot trophy life sciences portfolio in San Francisco. Since last quarter's announcement, we have renewed a large tenant and signed 2 new leases, bringing the building to 100% leased, a clear demonstration of the attractiveness of these buildings to the marketplace. We also opened our $80 million R&I development on the campus of Arizona State, located within the Phoenix Biomedical Campus, a 30-acre innovation district established by the city of Phoenix in the heart of downtown. The building is over 50% pre-leased and is ahead of pro forma.  Now let's turn to health care triple-net. During the fourth quarter, our health care triple-net assets showed continued strength. We have received 100% of fourth quarter rents as well as 100% of January and 100% of February rents. Trailing 12-month EBITDARM cash flow coverage improved sequentially for all our health care triple-net asset classes, except skilled nursing despite COVID-19. Acute and post-acute providers had early access to significant government funding to create liquidity and mitigate pandemic-related losses.  Acute care hospitals' trailing 12-month coverage was a strong 3.3 in the third quarter, a 20 basis point sequential improvement, driven by a rebound in elective surgical procedures, prudent expense management as well as government funding. Ardent continues to perform extremely well in this dynamic market condition. And all of Ardent's hospitals reside in jurisdictions that are open for elective procedures. We are excited to continue growing with Ardent. During the fourth quarter, Ardent opened a new outpatient cancer center on the campus in their hospital in Amarillo, Texas. The cancer center features best-in-class equipment and facilities for radiation therapy, chemotherapy and cancer care.  We invested approximately $30 million at a near 8% stabilized yield. IRF and LTAC coverage improved 10 basis points to 1.6x in the third quarter, buoyed by strong business results and government funding. In particular, Kindred has demonstrated its core competency in treating complex patient cases. Census levels continued to be very high. And finally, within our loan portfolio, our Colony, Holiday and Brookdale loans are all fully current.  I'd like to close with a thank you, a sincere thank you to our frontline staff, who have kept these critical facilities open during this difficult time. You are all heroes. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob. John, did you want to take that? Or would like me?"

First, I would like to mention that we are humbled and grateful that HHS continues to recognize the crucial role senior living plays in protecting vulnerable older Americans. Through the CARES Act, HHS has provided several rounds of funding to assisted living communities to partially mitigate losses directly suffered because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Through this program, applicable to sequential same-store SHOP assets, our communities have received $34 million in the fourth quarter and $13 million to date in the first quarter, which has been applied as a contract expense to offset COVID-19-related expenses incurred.  After a challenging fourth quarter and January in which the national spread of COVID-19 hit all-time highs, our communities experienced an increase in resident cases and we had more communities closed to move-ins. Leading indicators have followed a similar pattern. Leads and move-ins drifted down throughout November and December while at the same time, move-outs were elevated. Although the fourth quarter was a challenging quarter, we are pleased that our occupancy hung in there with a 90 basis point decline.  Looking ahead to the remainder of the first quarter. For the forecast Q1 sequential same-store SHOP portfolio, we expect cash NOI to decline from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, excluding HHS grants of $34 million and $13 million to date in each respective period. This NOI deterioration is driven by a 250 to 325 basis point expected occupancy decline, partially offset by a modest rate increase. We expect to see continued elevated operating expenses into the first quarter.  And while we are seeing continued high levels of COVID-related costs, these are partially mitigated by $13 million of Phase 3 HHS grant money received to date in the first quarter. I'll add that recent severe winter weather across the country could cause additional expenses as well as delays in move-ins. We haven't included any impacts, if any, in our guidance.  While we are experiencing choppy waters at this stage of the pandemic, I would like to highlight green shoots that support a more optimistic outlook ahead. I'll start by highlighting our improving clinical trends. Consistent with the U.S. COVID case trends, our SHOP communities are experiencing a significant decline in new COVID cases. In the most recent week, we are averaging 9 cases per day, which is the lowest since October and down from 92 cases per day at the peak in January. We couldn't be more relieved about this improvement, knowing this means less illness and less people potentially dying from COVID.  This positive clinical trend is also important to local health departments' support of our communities' ability to accept new move-ins and to offer a more robust living experience for our residents. I'd like to comment on the early success our operators have had deploying the vaccine to residents and employees within our SHOP portfolio. As Debbie mentioned, 100% of our assisted living and memory care communities have hosted their first vaccine clinic.  In other good news related to the vaccine, 2 studies from Spain and Israel have come out showing favorable data that people who are vaccinated and still contract COVID-19 are far less likely to spread the illness to others than if they were not vaccinated. The execution of the vaccine is a massively important step towards the stabilization and growth in our senior housing platform. I'll note that 95% of our communities are already open to move-ins, which is near our pandemic high.  I'll remind you of the importance of the segments mentioned in our business update. Currently, 80% of our communities are operating in segment 3. This is up from 64% a month ago. Segment 3 is the least restrictive operating environment. The communities in this segment offer a more robust living experience, includes a more open dining experience and small group activities. Most importantly, it allows for less restrictive visitation between residents and their loved ones. As more communities expand their service offering, demand for our services should improve.  Leads and move-ins started to pick up again in January with the highest number of leads we have witnessed since the beginning of the pandemic. We have seen broad-based strength in lead volume across regions. And the initial indication is that this momentum has continued into February. The increase in leads have been bolstered by very strong growth in our Le Groupe Maurice portfolio in Canada and consistent strong lead performance by Atria in the U.S.  To summarize our optimism, new COVID cases down, vaccine distribution on track, leading to a more robust living experience and all combining to support higher leads. We continue to monitor these positive trends on a real-time basis and remain focused on supporting our operating partners as they get positioned to win the recovery.  Moving on to triple-net senior housing. In the fourth quarter and through January, Ventas received all of its expected triple-net senior housing cash rents. Our underlying triple-net senior housing portfolio performance continues to be impacted by COVID-19. However, due to a mix of lease resolutions executed in 2020, government subsidies, including PPP loans and HHS funds and other tenant resources, our tenants have continued to pay as expected. Our trailing 12-month cash flow coverage for senior housing is 1.3x, respectively.  I'll comment on the senior housing industry outlook. Our competitive outlook has continued to evolve amid the pandemic. In 2020, construction starts nationally were down 50% year-over-year and deliveries were at their lowest levels since 2013. Our SHOP markets witnessed particularly favorable supply trends with starts down 66% versus the prior year and deliveries down over 40%. We are optimistic about the long-term impact from lower construction starts. Fewer starts today, combined with the compelling aging demographic trends, where the 80-plus population is expected to grow nearly 15% between now and 2024, which is 5x faster than the broader population, will provide a potent tailwind over the next few years.  Moving on to final comments. I'd like to comment on the tremendous job well done our operator partners and frontline staff have done prioritizing the health and safety of our residents and employees throughout a very challenging period. We couldn't be more proud of their focus, determination, courage and perseverance throughout the pandemic. I'd also like to note our excitement in support for Jack Callison, the new CEO of Sunrise Senior Living. We know Jack to be an accomplished and charismatic leader who is extremely qualified to lead Sunrise.  I'll finish by reiterating our optimistic outlook as we consider the improving clinical trends, vaccine rollout, communities opening for move-ins with a more robust living experience and post-pandemic supply-demand tailwinds that give us continued confidence and a very strong positive growth trajectory in senior housing.  With that, I'll hand the call to Pete. In regards to the recent trend upwards in move-outs, that's mostly clinically related hospitalizations, deaths. The voluntary move-out questions come up. We really haven't seen a high number of discretionary move-outs that are for reasons other than clinical purposes. Absolutely. So there's been -- the standard practice across the sector is communication, incentives, bringing a lot of attention and quite frankly, celebration around the vaccine. That's been very successful. We have operators that have mandated vaccine as well. Where that's happened, we've seen the employee numbers tick up significantly. And we know at least 2 that have made the decision to mandate. There are several others where we know it's under consideration. And it's been met with a lot of success, where those employee numbers are closer to 80%. Yes. I can definitely give you some color. One point about our leads is that leads are actually stronger in our U.S. portfolio, but our move-ins have been stronger in Canada. So when you think about us, think about a higher conversion rate in Canada, there's less dependency on external agencies to get move-ins. But if you focus in on the U.S., one thing that we found interesting is that the lead volume is very high, as Debbie mentioned, in spite of the clinical backdrop. But we're also still missing out on some typical sources for leads. And that includes respites, that includes personal and professional referral sources, which are all our highest converted leads. So as the lead bank starts to materialize and get back to normal, not only the leads go up, but our conversion should go with it. So our operators are fairly bullish on the outlook. But that remains to be seen, obviously. Dan, it's Justin. You mentioned -- I'll start with the second part of your question. Length of stay has actually gone up. And the reason for that is we've had less respite stays over this past year, far less. So that averages up without the short-term stays of respite. In terms of the type of resident moving in, we also haven't seen a lot of change there either. There's the age group demographic, the type of resident, care needs, everything has been relatively consistent. We just need more of them. And as we mentioned, leads are certainly on their way up. It's Justin. Yes, in terms of the disruption, ILs really held up okay. It held up in early going based on having lower move-outs, longer length of stay. Move-ins have continued in the IL setting. They are generally a higher-margin business. So they have a little more room to work with as occupancy has fallen. They don't benefit from HHS funds, so a little later to the -- from a vaccine standpoint. But vaccine clinics are being set up in the IL setting. So that's on that point.  And then in general, the first thing we're always going to look at is the market. And we have within our data set, over 800 MSAs that we study. And within those, we can determine which products will work, which price point is appropriate, could be IL, AL, memory care. But we would always start there and then look -- so market, then it's the quality of property and then it's opportunity for successful execution. So there's a little bit on the seasonality. When you look at it on a quarterly basis, there's not a big change ins or outs. You tend to have relatively higher move-outs in the fourth quarter and the first quarter and then lower move-outs in the third and fourth. And then move-ins will move within quarters. Some months that jump out to me are January, August, September, where you get a little bit of spike, April, May or some -- usually some good move-in months. But on a quarter-to-quarter basis, it's only like 1% change from 1 quarter to the next. And you just kind of -- usually, you have opportunities to net significantly during those times when the move-outs are lower. I'm not sure if that's helpful. And I'm sure you're [indiscernible] Yes, I was just going to say, in this setting, seasonality hasn't really held up because the clinical impacts have been so severe at times. That's had impact on demand. And then of course, I mentioned the difference in our lead bank in that there's a lot more opportunity for that to get back to a normalized level. And so it's really hard to point to seasonality in this current environment. Yes, that's about right. Absolutely. So I mentioned -- but I'll try, I'd like to step back for a second and just reiterate the underlying demand that the operators are facing and how they're trying to play into that. I had mentioned before that leads are very strong, and we're missing parts of the typical lead bank that could help bolster things. But if you look back a little bit, and you look back into September, October, if you look at our leads and our move-ins, you can see that we're running 80% and 90%, respectively, no vaccine in sight at the time. So the underlying demand remains really strong. Our operators are well aware of that. We even had, at that time in October, almost 60% of our communities that were achieving 100% or more of their prior-to-COVID typical move-in run rate. So all of that bodes well. And as operators have tried to play into that and with the backdrop of, of course, the clinical trends they were facing throughout the end of last year, beginning of this year, they're taking different approaches.  One I'll highlight is Atria. I mentioned that they have bolstered our overall lead growth and volume. And they've done that with the help of discounting and it's worked. Because they've had higher occupancy, higher leads as a result. We've had others that have been a little more local market-focused, holding back a little bit to preserve rate. And that worked as well. And moving ahead, I think what every operator is focused on is the wide variety of different referral sources that they've relied in, in the past, how to rejuvenate those moving forward and to play into that, the optimistic kind of supply-demand outlook I gave as well as the trends that are positioning our communities to accept move-ins again. It's Justin. Yes. So what you'll see is the -- first of all, 95% of our communities are open to move-ins. And then we segmented them based on just their restrictive environment. And what drives that, segment two and segment three, segment three is the most open, most consistent with pre-COVID lifestyle. Segment two has some restrictions, but you can certainly take move-ins. And it's the state and local health departments that are really weighing in on how open a community can be. And so those conversations are happening constantly. And it's very much driven by recent COVID activity, sometimes in the broader community, sometimes within our own communities. So that's fluid. But as you can tell from the overall picture that new cases are down and open communities are up. So it's looking good across the board. Sure. So a lead is defined really, another way to put it, is an inquiry. And it's distinct. And so it's new. So each month, when you see our data, all the leads that we're representing are new to that month. We don't carry forward. And it's from -- any source, could be through the Internet, could be through referrals, could be a drive-by, for instance, any source that's interested in moving in is characterized as a lead. It's Justin. Yes. So first of all, just the fact that there has been vaccines available has played a role in some of the uptick in leads. So certainly, there's an expectation that when the vaccines are fully executed that, that attracts higher leads, more potential demand that would make perfect sense. In terms of defining the lifestyle moving forward, I mentioned that the health departments play an important role in working with operators to define that. Certainly, operators want a robust living experience, as I mentioned, for the residents. They're working hard to give the best lifestyle available. But they're going to work within health department guidelines. And I would expect that to continue for a period of time as they work through this next phase. It's Justin. So there's been -- we've studied the performance throughout the pandemic. There's a little bit of a disconnection in terms of our expectations relative to COVID impacts on move-ins and geographies because of the virus has really become -- through the fourth quarter, it became more widespread and more impactful. So as we look ahead, we're really just looking into local markets and looking at the fundamentals I mentioned earlier relative to our position in that market. And there's -- some of the primary markets are really benefiting from a reduction in construction as a percentage of inventory, which we're supportive. But I think to get a real good read on -- to answer your question, I think we're -- we have to go a little further beyond the pandemic to get a clearer view."

            "name": "Debra Cafaro",
            "content": "Thank you, Sarah, and good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants. On behalf of all my colleagues, we want to welcome you to the Ventas Fourth Quarter and Year-end 2020 Earnings Call. Let me begin by expressing my deep gratitude and optimism, borne of the strength, resilience and innovation so many have demonstrated over the past year and the positive developments we are seeing on the ground in our portfolio virtually every day.  Our results in the fourth quarter demonstrated Ventas' resilience with normalized FFO reported at $0.83 a share and $0.74 at much appreciated funding from HHS to our senior living communities that have been affected by COVID-19. I've reflected on the grueling year we've all had. I couldn't be prouder of our productive and skilled teams, our enterprise and our capable, dedicated partners.  After a fast and positive start to 2020, the last year has been dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic and punctuated by extreme weather disruptions, both of which have continued into the first quarter of 2021. Throughout, we've put the full force of our firm's resources and energy behind keeping people safe, demonstrating remarkable resilience and becoming part of the solution, whether in employee testing, advocacy or assistance to tenants and operators who needed it.  Financially, through our foresight, our longstanding diversification strategy and our decisive actions, we've kept our enterprise strong and stable, generating almost the same EBITDA in 2020 as we did in 2019 and benefiting from our investments in people, systems and preparedness, our balance sheet flexibility and our embedded relationships with best-in-class partners.  And we found ways to grow and advance our strategic objectives, including building value through acquisition and development in life sciences, investing in Le Groupe Maurice's attractive senior housing development pipeline, creating new partnerships and establishing a third-party investment management platform that will provide more options for future growth.  We remain committed to our core values of respect and integrity and accelerated our actions to promote sustainability, diversity and social justice in our company, our communities and our country. Finally, we were very fortunate to recently add 2 topnotch directors to the company: one, a leader in health care; and the other in real estate and REITs.  My gratitude and optimism also flow from the life-saving COVID-19 vaccine discovery by doctors and scientists in record time and the recent acceleration of vaccine delivery by the Biden administration. Nationally, ending COVID-19 is foundational to spur sustained economic recovery and restore vitality to so many businesses, households and workers.  At Ventas, we're proud that 100% of our U.S. SHOP, AL and memory care communities have already received the vaccine. And nearly 90% of them will complete their second dose by the end of this month. Notably, senior housing vaccine delivery represents one of the shining successes in our fight against COVID-19. In our SHOP communities, it is wonderful to know that about 30,000 vulnerable residents have already been vaccinated and are one step closer to feeling safe, seeing loved ones and enjoying a richer life.  From our real-time data, we also know that confirmed COVID-19 cases in our communities have recently begun to improve significantly, creating an enhanced sense of well-being and enabling more operators to open communities to new move-ins. And leads at our communities built to their highest level since the pandemic began in January, once again demonstrating the strength of the value proposition of senior housing and the resilient demand for the services our care providers deliver.  While we expect SHOP's first quarter NOI and occupancy, which are lagging indicators, to decline sequentially as a result of November to January's extreme COVID-19 conditions, we are encouraged by the breadth and consistency of all positive leading indicators. Conditions remain dynamic, and it is too early to declare a definitive trend. But we like the picture we are starting to see. Post-pandemic senior housing growth represents an incredibly significant value creation opportunity for our shareholders.  Turning to our investment outlook. Our diversified asset base with 5 verticals has given us the ability to continue successfully allocating capital over time and through cycles. For example, we've created tremendous value since our early cycle investments in our Research & Innovation business in 2016. We continue to find meaningful opportunities to drive that business forward in both ground-up development and asset acquisitions with universities and in cluster markets alike.  Our decision to add life sciences to our enterprise has provided an uplift to our results, our investment activity and our value. Here are a couple of current examples. Our $280 million life sciences project, known as One uCity, in the thriving research submarket of Philadelphia, which is bookended by Penn and Drexel, is attracting significant leasing interest.  In addition to the nearly $1 billion ground-up development projects already underway, our university-based development pipeline continues to hold about another $1 billion in active potential projects with both new and existing university relationships. In particular, with Wexford, we are in the design development phase of a nearly $0.5 billion project with a major research university on the West Coast that is substantially pre-leased. We look forward to sharing more information with you later this year.  Outside of Research & Innovation, we continue to allocate capital to develop large Class A independent living communities with our partner, LGM, in Que\u0301bec. We've had 5 projects underway with investment also totaling nearly $0.5 billion. And 2 of the projects were delivered in the fourth quarter. We are pleased to report that the 2 open communities have leased up quickly and occupancy is already nearly 80%.  In addition, our pipeline of potential acquisitions in all 5 of our verticals is active and growing. We continue to invest with an eye towards growing reliable cash flow and favorable risk-adjusted returns. We will also continue to evaluate and execute opportunities to recycle capital as well. Both Justin and Pete have been working with our deal team to target about $1 billion of dispositions during the year to optimize our portfolio.  Finally, our institutional investment capital management platform continues to grow and succeed with well over $3 billion in assets under management. Bringing together our pre-existing and new third-party capital vehicles under one umbrella, the Ventas Investment Management business includes our life sciences and health care funds. The Ventas Fund stands out as one of the most successful launches of a first-time real estate fund in any asset class.  Our investment management platform provides a significant competitive advantage to Ventas. It broadens our capital sources, augments our investment capacity, expands our footprint, leverages our team and industry expertise, improves our financial flexibility and liquidity and adds an incremental source of earnings. There is tremendous market opportunity within life science, medical office and senior housing real estate. And we are well positioned to capitalize on it in multiple ways.  In closing, let me reiterate that demographically driven demand is right in front of us. The leading indicators in senior housing are improving rapidly. Vaccine delivery is accelerating. And the long-term thesis for all of our asset classes and for Ventas remains firmly positive. All of us at Ventas have an abiding commitment to staying strong and steady and winning the recovery on behalf of all of our stakeholders.  Now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Justin Hutchens. Well, it's great to hear from you. I would say that we have a lot of options now as we look at investment opportunities. Not only can we look across the 5 asset types, but also we have a number of tools we can use to acquire assets, either on balance sheet or in our investment management business. So I'd say we're really looking across the board. We've got obviously a lot of life sciences and research and innovation, both ground-up development as well as acquisition activity. We've got some senior housing possibilities in the pipeline.  Ardent is obviously doing well. And we continue to look for similarly high-quality opportunities in that space. And so it really is quite interesting and across the board. And as I mentioned, we're continuing to invest with LGM. They have done just an incredible job, both on the management of the stable portfolio but also in developing and leasing up very quickly these Class A assets. And we're looking forward to doing more of that with LGM as well. Good one. I mean I gave a little clue when we talked about Justin and Pete really optimizing the portfolio. So while we're really looking across the board, I would say that senior housing and maybe some select MOBs could fall within that disposition pipeline. Yes. I mean, obviously, we're going to look to be smart about when and how we do it. I would basically just refer you to kind of the back half, and you can make a weighted assumption around timing. It's obviously TBD. And cap rates also TBD, but we would look really to find lower cap rate assets that we could dispose of. And obviously, you can see in the market, there's a really strong bid across the board in these asset classes. And that is a very good sign for our ability to execute in a really effective way. Yes. I'm going to turn it over to Justin. I mean, as we've mentioned, I mean, the key points are really around the clinical results. Because you really have to think about leading indicators, seeing cases in mortality. And then when those start to improve significantly, as we've seen, the lagging indicators of NOI and occupancy tends to follow. So I'll turn it over to Justin, so he can really address your questions in specific. Yes. I mean we are projecting positive REVPOR sequentially. And I'll turn it over to Bob to elaborate. Right. We've had, with our industry partners, a really effective public outreach on this exact point of really the impact of COVID-19 on these communities and on seniors. And we have made so much progress, Tayo, as evidenced by the willingness of HHS to mitigate some of the COVID-19 impacts by the amounts that we've received to date, which for us has been, I think, about $48 million or so. And we're very grateful for that, as Justin mentioned.  What we're focused on going forward is there continues to be significant billions remaining in the HHS fund -- well, first of all, Phase 3 could result in additional funding. That's an unknown. There's also multiple tens of billions remaining in the HHS fund, which hopefully can be utilized beyond Phase 3 to support the health care providers writ large, including senior housing.  And then in terms of additional COVID relief packages, we would endeavor to make the case that some of those funds should be either earmarked for or certainly available to be used to mitigate the continuing impact of COVID-19 on the 1 to 2 million seniors, who are cared for in senior living. So that's the framework, and we'll continue to try to make -- be effective advocates with policymakers to produce a favorable and, I think, very justifiable outcome on a public health priority basis. Yes. Good question. I'm going to turn it over to my colleagues. And again, I think in light of the conditions in January, we are -- feel that our portfolio is really hanging in there in terms of leads and occupancy. So I'll turn it over to the team to answer the specific question that you're asking. I think what is incredibly encouraging is that the clinical conditions in January were the worst that they've been really since the beginning of the pandemic. And you can see that on the slide, yet we are getting incredible demand, in my opinion, in January, nonetheless, through both leads and move-ins. And that, to me, is an incredible combination and one that is just really heartening about this being a kind of need-based business that is going to be resilient. And that happens during the toughest times. And so that's what -- that is the key point, Mike. Thank you for raising it. Yes. In general, the uptake with the residents has been really, really high, in and around the 90% range. And probably even higher if you take out people who were ineligible, either because they had just had COVID or something like that or another medical condition. And amongst the staff, it's really been in that 40%-ish, plus or minus, at the beginning on the first clinic. But we're seeing way higher uptake of employees getting that first shot at the second clinic. And so those numbers are going much higher both because of an increasing comfort level with the vaccine and also some operator, we'll call it, incentives and requirements. And Justin, maybe you can touch on what the operators are doing in the vaccine to make the uptake better. Good to have you. I'm going to turn that over to our team to talk about the significant leasing interest there in the uCity market. Yes. Well, that, I believe, is those 800 units. So this is what is remarkable and we're trying to have it rub off on us here south of the border is that LGM built these large projects, Class A for independent living, a younger, healthier senior. They're really beautiful. We hope to take you there someday. And then they have a really significant pre-marketing effort, a lot of pre-leasing and deposits. And these communities opened in the fourth quarter and they're already nearly 80% occupied. Well, since that's a modeling one, Bob, do you want to take that? Well, we are -- thank you. It's really good to hear from you. I mean, we are continuing to invest very actively, as I mentioned, in life science, in these LGM developments. We do have an acquisition pipeline. So it really is a case-by-case basis. And we continue to evaluate conditions very carefully and are really in a great position, given all the things that we've done and all the pieces we've put in place, to be able to really act opportunistically as and when we believe the circumstances are appropriate based on risk-adjusted return. And so I feel good about where we are. And we have a long history, as you know, of doing $2 billion to $3 billion a year of investment activity. And we're in the market in all the verticals and have the team and the capital options. And so it will be based upon what opportunities become available. Well, I think we would base our investment decisions and our portfolio composition really on the fundamental opportunities that we see rather than what I'll call bridge support for the pandemic impact. So I think you're roughly in the ballpark on the 60-40. But I'll turn it over to Justin really to talk about how he thinks about those asset classes and the differences and opportunities there. I see. Yes. And different operators take different views as well based on the particular conditions in markets, as you point out. So Justin, do you want to address Vikram's question, please? Yes, I'll take that. So look, I mean, we have been really successful during 2020, since Justin been here, at really having some outstanding resolutions of the bigger relationships we have with partners like Brookdale and Holiday and others. And that's been really helpful. And we've received significant cash upfront as well as participation in the upside through either warrants or conversions to management contracts. So those have been really well received and rightly so. Our operators, as you mentioned, really have been the beneficiaries in some cases of government funding that would principally be in the fourth quarter. Of course, that would benefit coverage.  But our statistics are really through the end of the third quarter, which is always on a 1 quarter lag, as you know. So they will be factored in. They'll be called out separately as we have with some of the health care providers in the supplemental materials. And so you'll be able to do your own analysis. But again, remember that the funding is really intended to be a bridge, if you will, to replace NOI that would otherwise be there and hopefully will otherwise be there in the future. So that's how we've been thinking about it. It really depends on COVID, just like almost every other answer we could give you on the call today. The operators are really hanging in there. As Justin said, they're doing an incredible job on health and safety. And right now, we're getting all the rent that we expect to receive and the operators are getting government funding in many cases. So that's a good picture. And if the leading indicators that we've discussed really take hold and gain traction and result in improved occupancy and NOI as we look forward in the year, then I think we feel okay about where we are. And that's remained consistent. Right now is that -- is they -- as you point out, they are open to repayment and some are also open to extension. So our current expectation is extension. But of course, that could change. And we always like to be repaid. So either way, I think we're in good shape. Yes. I mean, it's been a biblical year, when you really want to think about it with COVID and wildfires and hurricanes. And now we have this severe winter storms in places you'd least expected. So yes, I mean, I think everyone -- many people in the real estate business have significant investments in Texas. And almost all of them will be affected by the power outages and related storm impacts. And that would include us.  And again, our operators are taking extraordinary measures in the case of senior housing to make sure that employees and residents are safe. And often we see in senior housing that after something like this, we see an uptick in interest because a lot of people are alone in their homes, and that's -- you're better off kind of together when things like this happens. So yes, I mean, we have investments in Texas across the board. And we, like others, would be affected by something as significant as the recent storm. Good question. Again, the leading indicators are flashing green. And Justin will answer your segmentation question. You've all been very patient. And I want to thank you, as always, for your interest in and your support of our company. We look forward to seeing you soon, and we hope that you and your family stay healthy, happy and optimistic."

            "name": "Robert Probst",
            "content": "Thanks, Pete. In my remarks today, I'll cover our 2020 enterprise fourth quarter results, our expectations for the first quarter of 2021 and our recent liquidity, balance sheet and capital activities.  Let's start with our fourth quarter financial performance. Ventas reported fourth quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.29 per share and normalized funds from operations of $0.83 per share or $0.74, excluding the $0.09 in HHS grants received in SHOP in Q4. Other sequential fourth quarter drivers to highlight include $0.04 of income recorded in our unconsolidated entities, offset by a $0.05 Q4 sequential decline in NOI, principally in SHOP. Meanwhile, Office and triple-net healthcare was stable on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter.  That's a good segue way to our Q1 guidance as Q4 is an appropriate start point for our first quarter 2021 expectations. The key components of our Q1 guidance are as follows. Net income attributable to common stockholders is estimated to range between minus $0.07 and minus $0.01 per fully diluted share. Normalized FFO is forecast to range from $0.66 to $0.71 per share. The midpoint of our FFO guidance, $0.68 per share, represents a $0.15 sequential decline from the fourth quarter. This change can be largely explained by a $0.09 reduction in HHS grant income and income from unconsolidated entities. The balance is driven by a $0.05 reduction in organic SHOP NOI performance.  A few of the key SHOP Q1 assumptions include Q1 2021 average occupancy ranging from 250 to 325 basis points lower versus the fourth quarter average; sequential growth in REVPOR as a result of the annual in-place rent increases implemented at the start of 2021; and continued elevated levels of operating expenses, driven by COVID labor and testing. Outside of SHOP, we expect our property NOI to be stable on a sequential basis in the first quarter. A normalized FFO per share bridge from our fourth quarter to our first quarter 2021 guidance midpoint, together with key assumptions, can be found in our press release and our business update presentation posted to our website today.  I'll close with our balance sheet and capital activity. I am proud of the actions the Ventas team has taken to manage our balance sheet, leverage and liquidity. We have navigated the disruption created by COVID and kept Ventas strong and stable while protecting shareholder capital. I'd highlight a few of our most recent actions and results.  First, some key stats from 2020. We finished 2020 with full year net debt-to-EBITDA of 6.1x, maintained a strong maturity profile with duration exceeding 6 years, had held total debt to gross asset value at 37%, reduced our net debt at year-end by over $500 million year-over-year and retained robust liquidity exceeding $3 billion.  In 2020, we also took advantage of the strong bid for health care real estate and realized over $1 billion in asset sales at a blended 5.3% cash yield. In 2021, we're targeting an additional $1 billion in asset sales across our verticals in the second half of the year. Proceeds from dispositions are expected to be used to reduce debt and to fund future growth through development and redevelopment capital spend.  In January 2021, we closed on a new 4-year $2.75 billion unsecured credit facility. We had great demand from 24 new and incumbent financial institutions and we're able to realize better pricing. I'd like to personally thank our banking partners for their support of Ventas. They are critical to our success.  And finally, in March 2021, Ventas will use cash on hand from recent dispositions to reduce our near-term maturities by fully repaying $400 million of our 3.1% senior notes due January 2023. As a result of these and other actions, we're positioned to capitalize on the powerful upside across our business once the pandemic is finally in the rearview mirror.  That concludes our prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions]. With that, I will turn the call back to the operator. All right. Cool. So in the fourth quarter, you're right to say down on REVPOR. Tayo, really two drivers there. One is simply discounting in the effort to get occupancy, definitely seeing that in the marketplace. The second is mix. With Canada continuing to perform really strongly, Canada has a lower REVPOR, you see a mixed impact. And it's a combination of those 2 things on a sequential basis which drives the number you see on REVPOR. Positively looking ahead to Q1, we're expecting growth. And again, that in-place increase, very much in line with what we've seen historically, which is quite positive and so expect to see that as a tailwind in the first quarter on revenue. Well, I think that will likely carry on, at least in the short run. But you see the lift of the in-place rents, which happens Jan 1 across the good part of the population. So that really benefits the first quarter. Sure. I'll take that. So Mike, you can see on Page 12 of our investor presentation, some of the most recent data on the trends in the quarter on occupancy. If you look at it quarter-to-date on average, we're down about 210 basis points quarter-to-date, really driven by that January result. If you just extrapolated that to the full quarter, i.e., kind of baked what we have and held from there, we'd be at the better end of the guidance range, 250 basis points down. If the trend continued down, as we've seen in the first quarter-to-date and carried on, that would be the lower end, i.e., the worse end of the range. And so it's really kind of -- that's the guardrails, if you like, stabilization versus continuation of the trend, if you want to think of that, that way. Yes. I love the modeling ones. So historically, we've seen sort of mid-single-digit in-place increases every -- nearly every year. And that's again sort of an overarching number to think about. From there though, a few considerations. There's always a percentage of the population to whom that does not apply. And that could be those who are on an anniversary renewal or those who came in, moved in late in the year and aren't subject to a thing like that. So all of that said, it blends in on a sequential Q4 to Q1 REVPOR basis to improve REVPOR overall. And that is one of the powers of having the occupancy in place in December is to have that benefit. What's the mix of debt reduction versus other investments, in other words, Jordan? I see, I see the question. Yes. No, it's majority asset sales. There may be some. But again, a significant majority will be asset sales as it was in 2020. Yes."

At this time, all participants\u2019 lines are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Sarah Whitford, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nSarah Whitford: Good morning, and welcome to the Ventas third quarter financial results conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued our third quarter earnings release, supplemental and investor presentation. These materials are available on the Ventas Web site at www.ventasreit.com. As a reminder, remarks made today may include forward-looking statements including certain expectations related to COVID-19 and other matters. Forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties in a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those [indiscernible]. For a more detailed discussion of these factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, all of which are available on the Ventas Web site. Certain non-GAAP financial measures will also be discussed in this call. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the Investor Relations section of our Web site. I will now turn over the call to Debra A. Cafaro, Chairman and CEO.\nDebra Cafaro: Thank you, Sarah. Good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants. We want to welcome you to the Ventas third quarter 2020 earnings call. The Ventas team is dispersed but unified in spirit as we join you for today's call. I'd like to provide an overview of our consistent strategy, discuss our third quarter results, highlight how we are driving our research and innovation business forward, describe our competitive advantage and managing institutional third-party capital and touch on the positive senior housing operating trends that continue into October. Our enterprise continues to benefit significantly from our steady commitment over decades and various cycles to asset class, operator and geographical diversification. We aim to generate reliable growing cash flows from a high-quality diverse portfolio of assets on a strong balance sheet. We've seen that staying disciplined about diversification has protected the downside and also provided myriad opportunities for our stakeholders. The current environment is certainly proving out the merits of this strategy. First, our diversified portfolio is enabling the company to remain strong and stable, despite the disruption occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected our different asset classes and geographies in non-correlated way. Our medical office, research and innovation business and our healthcare triple-net lease business now represents over half of our enterprise. During the quarter, these asset classes have continued to perform well and led our third quarter performance, enabling us to deliver $0.75 of normalized FFO per share. Second, our diversified asset base with five verticals has given us the ability to continue successfully allocating capital over time and through cycles. For example, following the spinoff of our skilled nursing business, we invested in high quality health systems with [indiscernible], which is currently performing very well as hospitals have asserted their centrality to the health care delivery systems in the U.S. Also, just as we did when we allocated capital to the medical office building business a decade earlier, in 2016, we entered the research and innovation business, and we have found significant opportunities to drive that business forward since then, through both ground up development and asset acquisitions. The addition of life sciences to our enterprise has provided uplift to our results, our investment activity and our enterprise value. Two recent examples of the benefit of our diversified strategy include our investment in a $1 billion Class A Trophy Life Science Portfolio located in the Premier South San Francisco Life Science Cluster at a forward cap rate of 5% on cash NOI. The tenant base is a nice mix of public companies and a diverse group of early to mid-stage life science company. The South San Francisco market consistently ranks as one of the elite life science clusters. Spurred by record capital flows into the life science sector, this market has less than 2% lab vacancy, unparalleled access to a large concentration of life science firms and an extensive venture capital network going after the world class talent pool. We also recently recommenced construction on a 400,000 square foot state-of-the-art Life Sciences project known as One UCity in this thriving research sub-market of Philadelphia, bookended by 10 and Drexel. This project is designed to be LEED certified and total estimated project costs are over $280 million. Similarly, we've invested on a geographically diversified basis with over 30% of our shop portfolio now in Canada. Last year, we acquired the high-quality Le Groupe Maurice portfolio in Quebec. Building on the strong performance LGM has delivered and its history of successfully developing and leasing up senior communities for vibrant older adults. We are also investing nearly $420 million in ground up development of new consumer focused senior living communities, which are well underway. We do see areas where we can recycle capital too. We have recently sold or placed under contract certain portfolios of senior living assets that are not long-term holds for us. We want to continue making senior housing a key part of our diversified portfolio because of the operational asset class upside post-pandemic, the demographically driven demand that is in front of us and the continued improvement on the supply side. There remains a strong bid from private capital for senior living, which supports our conclusion. On the other side of the ledger, through our growing third-party institutional Capital Management Platform, we also continue to diversify our capital sources, augment our investment capacity, expand our footprint, leverage our team and industry expertise and improve our financial flexibility and liquidity, all of which are positive for our public shareholders. Having additional partners and tools to use at appropriate times and for customized situations, provides a significant competitive advantage for Ventas and as an incremental source of earnings. We already have over $3 billion in assets under management in our institutional third-party capital management platform. These forms include our successful open-end funds, launched in March of this year that has already grown to nearly $2 billion and 2 million square feet in assets under management. Following the South San Francisco Life Sciences portfolio closing, when we raised over 600 million of discretionary new equity, our fund exceeds $1 billion in equity capital, and continues to have additional committed capital to accommodate new investments. We've also today announced a new joint venture with GIC, one of the most respected global real estate investors. This joint venture covers four research and innovation development projects currently in progress with approximately 930 million in estimated project costs. Our joint venture with GIC may be expanded to over $2 billion with other pre-identified future R&I development projects currently in our pipeline if they go forward. While maintaining a majority interest in all these projects and receiving market-based compensation, our GIC joint venture enables us to align with a strategic partner, improve our liquidity and financial profile and accelerate our research and innovation development pipeline, including the recent construction commencement of the One UCity project in Philadelphia. The success of our open-end fund and the GIC partnership demonstrates a tremendous market opportunity within life science, medical office and senior housing real estate and also they are a testament to Ventas's excellent team and investment track record. Turning to the here and now, I'd like to provide some key observations about our U.S. senior housing operating portfolio. Importantly, in the third quarter, our operators continued to build on the improving trend that began in the second quarter. Our communities demonstrated sustained increases in leads and move-ins, which continued through October. While we are sober and clear eyed about the recent increase in COVID-19 cases nationally, to a record level of nearly 120,000 confirmed cases today, we believe in the strength of the senior living business as we look toward the post-pandemic environment. We are also appreciative that HHS has recognized the crucial role senior living plays in protecting vulnerable older Americans. HHS has allocated CARES Act funding to the assisted living community to partially mitigate the losses directly suffered because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we are encouraged by the progress being made by scientists and doctors on vaccines and treatments for COVID-19. Older Americans, including our residents, will be prioritized for vaccine distribution slated just behind first responders and frontline health care providers. Most of our operators have already registered with pharmacy distribution sources to administer the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as it becomes available. An effective, widely distributed vaccine will further improve conditions for a senior housing recovery. We are glad that we have significant embedded exposure to that upside in our diversified portfolio. Today, we published our corporate sustainability report that showcases our longstanding commitment to and leadership in ESG. Among other things, this report discloses our new environmental goals are consistent and growing investments in sustainability improvements in our portfolio, and our principles and practice, which is a series of case studies showing our actions on health and safety and COVID-19 describing our emergency preparedness, and demonstrating our customized framework to achieve greater gender and racial equality and social justice. In closing, let me reiterate that the long-term demographically driven thesis for healthcare real estate and for Ventas remains in place. I'm incredibly proud of our Ventas team. Our consistency and cohesion are great assets for all our stakeholders. All of us at Ventas have an abiding commitment to stay strong and stable and win the recovery. Justin?\nJustin Hutchens: Thanks, Debbie. I'll start by mentioning the encouraging trends we continue to see in our shop portfolio. We are pleased to have had our first net positive move in month since the start of the pandemic in October and a majority of our portfolios delivering move ins at levels that are equal to or more than typical levels across the U.S. and Canada. The underlying demand for need driven senior housing in the U.S. and independent living services in Canada persists. While we are encouraged about these positive trends, we're mindful that the pandemic causes ongoing uncertainty and choppy waters in the senior housing business. I will also add that in spite of the near-term pressure on the sector, we remain committed to the senior housing business and excited about the supportive underlying supply demand fundamentals that should persist for years to come. Now I will review our third quarter senior housing results in the shop and triple-net portfolio and follow that up with some comments on our latest trends and outlook. First up, the shop, for the quarter, shop results were in line with the company's expectations. Our 395 assets sequential same-store pool comprising over 90% of our shop NOI, posted cash NOI of 109 million which is effectively flat versus the second quarter. Average occupancy was 130 basis points lower sequentially with improving trends inter quarter while RevPOR declined 30 basis points and grew 50 basis points in our U.S. and Canadian operating portfolios respectively. Leading indicators such as leads and movements also saw a consistent and positive trend intra quarter, both in absolute numbers and relative to prior year, highlighting the resilient demand for senior housing. In September leads and move-ins were 85% and 94%, respectively, as compared to the prior year. Third quarter revenue declined 3.6% which was offset entirely by 4.5%, lower operating expenses sequentially, primarily driven by lower COVID related expenses. As a reminder, all COVID-19 impacts including elevated testing, labor, cleaning and supplies costs have been reflected in property operating results. As with last quarter, I'll highlight our Canadian portfolio, which represents 33% of our shop portfolio and demonstrates the benefits of our diversification and a well-orchestrated public health response. The 72 communities within our sequential Q3 same-store pool, including our LGM investment was 93.2% occupied, which compares to an average of 93.7% for the second quarter, outperform in the U.S. on an absolute and relative basis. Same-store cash NOI on a sequential basis grew in Canada by over 10%. Moving on to our triple-net senior housing portfolio, in the third quarter and through October Ventas received all of its expected triple-net senior housing cash rent. Our underlying triple-net senior housing portfolio performance continues to be impacted by COVID-19, which we have been collaboratively addressing with our tenant partners. As a result of our proactive steps to improve coverage through mutually beneficial arrangements with Capital Senior, Holiday, Brookdale and other smaller tenants, our trailing 12 months cash flow coverage for senior housing is 1.4x. We also expect triple-net senior housing tenants will receive CARES Act funding, which will be a positive development. Now I'll address recent trends. As described earlier, demand characteristics supporting senior housing remain solid and leads and move-ins continue to improve since the low point in April and month-over-month in the third quarter. These trends persisted into October as we experienced net positive move-ins helped in part by selective move in incentives. Our operators successful execution of screening, protecting and testing protocols has been supporting a living environment that's more open and more robust than earlier in the pandemic. Currently, 96% of our communities are accepting move-ins. Moving on to our clinical results. As a result of the diligent efforts of our operators executing, testing and preventative protocols new resident COVID-19 cases more than 75% better than the peak seen in April, in spite of broader market trends of increased new infection rates among the U.S. general public. In regards to the Q4 outlook for shop, due to the uncertain environment, it is too hard to predict. However, we would expect occupancy to soften and we would expect expenses to be relatively flat at the current elevated levels as the health and safety of the residents and frontline caregivers is the biggest priority. In summary, we are encouraged by the continued improvement and leading indicators through the third quarter and October and we remain committed to the senior housing business moving forward. We are proud of our operators' efforts in the third quarter to successfully execute COVID-19 related protocols while focusing on the health and safety of frontline caregivers and residents. With that, I'll hand the call to Pete.\nPete Bulgarelli: Thanks, Justin. I'll cover the office segment third quarter results and trends. Our office segment which now represents over 30% of Ventas' NOI continues to produce strong results and show its value proposition and financial strength and missed the pandemic. MOBs and research and innovation centers, the two lines of business within our office portfolio play a key role in the delivery of crucial health care services and research for life saving vaccines and therapeutics. The Office portfolio continued to provide steady growth delivering 126 million of same-store cash NOI in the third quarter. This represents a 40 basis points of sequential growth. You will note that the same-store cash NOI declined 2.2% year-on-year for the third quarter. However, we lapped a large $4.7 million termination fee in the third quarter of 2019. normalizing for this fee. The same-store cash NOI grew 1.5% from the prior year normalizing for the paid parking shortfall and increased cleaning costs due to COVID, same-store cash NOI grew by 2.8%. In terms of rent receipts, office tenants paid an industry leading 99% of contractual rents in the third quarter in line with the second quarter. This is without D docs for deferrals, which were de minimis. Substantially all granted second quarter deferrals that came due have been repaid and new granted, deferrals were negligible. As of November 6, our tenants have paid more than 99% of October contractual rents. Receiving 99% of total rent without D docs is a direct reflection of the quality of our tenants and the quality of our buildings. The solid result underscores the durability and quality of our tenant base. Remember 88% of MOB NOI is from investment grade tenants or HCA and 97% of our MOB NOI comes from tenants affiliated with major health systems, including some of the nation's most prestigious, not-fort-profit health systems. Most tenants have received significant amount of federal support through a variety of programs designed to assist healthcare providers in small businesses. As an example, we estimate that our top 10 Health System tenants have collectively received nearly 5 billion in CARES Act relief and 10 billion in Medicare advanced payments. For our R&I portfolio 76% of our revenues are received from investment grade organizations and publicly listed companies a very solid foundation. Third quarter 2020 office occupancy for the same-store portfolio was 91.1%, a sequential decline of 40 basis points due to several small tenants not reopening post COVID. This was partially offset by the lease up of research and innovation assets associated with the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and Washington University in St. Louis. Lab space continues to be in high demand and the R&I portfolio is now 97% leased an outstanding result. Medical office had a record level retention at 90% for the third quarter of 2020 and for the trailing 12 months. Driven by this retention total office leasing was 1.2 million square feet for the quarter and 2.7 million square feet year to-date. This is 400,000 square feet higher than our third quarter of 2019 leasing and 300,000 square feet higher than the third quarter 2019 year-to-date leasing. We also saw a positive space utilization trends that mirrored admissions in surgery volumes reported by the health systems. These trends have continued through October. As an example, paid parking is more than doubled from the depths of COVID but as recovered to 65% to 70% of pre-COVID levels, climbing but still below historical levels. All of our MOB buildings are open for business, and 100% of our MOBs are in counties that are restriction free for elective procedures. All R&I buildings are also open, supporting multiple critical research organizations in fighting the pandemic. We have over 15 major university relationships, all of which opened in the fall with some level of on-campus in person learning, influenced to do the same for the second semester. As Debbie mentioned, we are pleased to have added three R&A buildings in South San Francisco. Since going under contract, we have signed a large renewal and are experiencing a high level of leasing activity. This gives us confidence that our occupancy will soon build from the current state which is already 96% leased. During the third quarter, we received the results of our annual tenant satisfaction survey. I am pleased to report that this year's results were significantly higher than in prior years. In fact, when compared to other MOB portfolios by an independent third-party, our tenant satisfaction is in the top quartile. One of our highest rated scores was how our team supported our tenants during the pandemic. These essential field personnel who serve our tenants on-site during the pandemic, have done a terrific job. We are grateful for their effort and commitment. And we continue to focus on the health and safety of these personnel and our tenants. In sum, our tenant satisfaction, leasing, NOI and cash receipts were positive during the third quarter, a clear build from the second quarter and we look forward to continuing the normalization of healthcare in research operations as we entered 2021. With that, I'll pass the baton to Bob.\nBob Probst: Thanks, Pete. I'll touch on our healthcare triple-net lease portfolio before I close with some enterprise level commentary. During the third quarter, our healthcare triple-net assets showed continued strength and resilience as evidenced by receiving 100% of third quarter, October and November from our total healthcare tenants. Further trailing 12 months EBITDARM cash flow coverage for the second quarter of '20, related to the available information improved sequentially for all of our healthcare triple-net asset classes despite COVID-19. Both acute and post-acute providers have had early access to significant government funding to create liquidity and to mitigate losses related to the pandemic. Acute care hospitals trailing 12-month coverage was a strong 3.1x in the second quarter. Nationally hospital inpatient admissions and surgeries continue to rebound in Q3 and third quarter admissions approached over 90% of prior year levels. Arden continues to perform extremely well despite the challenging market conditions and is benefiting from over 90% of its hospitals residing in jurisdictions that are open for elective procedures. Herbs and health tax coverage improved 20 basis points to 1.5x in Q2 on the heels of government funding and significantly improved census. Health tax have increasingly proved their importance in the care continuum, with or without COVID. And finally, within our loan portfolio, our Colony, Holiday and Brookdale loans are all fully current. Turning to our third quarter financial performance, and let me start with Q3 GAAP net income, which includes $0.06 in non-cash charges as a result of COVID impacts. Most notably the write-off of straight-line rents across five tenants, with Genesis being the largest. These tenants are now on a cash basis and represent approximately 50 million of annual cash rent, notwithstanding the write-offs, all these tenants are current, and we will endeavor to collect all our contractual rents going forward. These non-cash charges are excluded from third quarter normalized FFO. We provided additional information in our supplemental on page 34. In terms of normalized FFO per share, we delivered $0.75 in Q3 2020 versus $0.77 in the second quarter. Shop and office NOI were stable sequentially, with the $0.02 reduction in FFO in the third quarter, as compared to the second described by the Brookdale rent reset in the third quarter. In the third quarter, we saw the results of the decisive actions taken earlier in the year to ensure a strong and stable Ventas. These included reducing our corporate cost structure by 25%, resulting in 30 million in annualized SG&A savings in Q3. We are also active in managing our balance sheet and liquidity, including paying down substantially all borrowings under our revolving credit facility, successfully tendering for 236 million of near-term bonds and issuing under our ATM to help fund the South San Francisco investments. Net-net, we feel good about our financial flexibility. Our liquidity is strong at 3.2 billion between available revolver capacity and cash on hand as of November 5. We have limited near-term debt maturities, access to diversified capital sources, strong fixed charge coverage and debt to gross asset value just 37%. To close, we're pleased with our performance in the quarter and the continuing improving trends in senior housing. The entire Ventas team is sharply focused on taking the actions that will enable us to win the recovery when the pandemic is finally behind us. And that concludes our prepared remarks. Before we start with Q&A, we're limiting each caller to one question with one follow-up to be respectful to everyone on the line. Also given the fact that we continue to be remote, I'd ask Debbie to do her Roethlsberger impression and quarterback our QA. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.\nSteve Sakwa: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the formation of the GIC joint venture. And you guys have talked a lot about the R&I and how excited you are. And I'm just curious, how you thought about bringing in a partner and giving up some of the upside in these developments versus maybe selling other assets in the portfolio to kind of fund that.\nDebra Cafaro: Good morning, Steve. I'll take that one. I think that, we're very excited about the GIC joint venture. We really believe it's helping us to accelerate our commitment to growing our R&I business and really moving that business forward. Basically, again, we've restarted our Philadelphia development of a significant life science building, we've got these three projects further underway. GIC is a great strategic partner, whether it's with this joint venture or on other potential activities, we're very happy to be partnered with someone of their expertise and quality. And, it gives us a really great way to continue to own a significant portion of those developments and their upside. And move the whole R&I business forward.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay. And then just a quick follow up for Bob, I just wanted to make sure I heard you correctly. Did you say that you issued stock in the quarter to help fund the San Francisco purchase?\nBob Probst: Right, Steve, just step back a little bit, on the billion dollars transaction, the vast majority of that was 600 million of new equity across the fund and ourselves included newly raised equity. Within that our equity portion, we funded really two ways one through some dispositions of senior housing and second some modest ATM. So ultimately, that was the sources of uses for the deal overall.\nDebra Cafaro: Right. And the debt piece was about a $400 million, attractive debt piece.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Nicholas Joseph with Citi.\nNicholas Joseph: Deb, you mentioned the senior housing asset sales are some on the market, give some color on what the size of those portfolios are? And then, also what sort of pricing you're seeing in the market today?\nDebra Cafaro: Right. Yes. The main point is really, we continue to - we continue to believe in senior housing and think it's an important part of our diversified business model. We definitely are open to recycling capital. The dispositions that I'm talking about are really over a couple hundred million of assets, some of which are sold, some of which are under contract. And those the kind of blended cap rate is around a six.\nNicholas Joseph: Thanks. So then just back to the GIC development JV, how did you think about getting paid or compensated for the value that you've created in the existing developmental asset?\nDebra Cafaro: Yes, that's a great question. And I think we were very focused on again, partnering with a strategic partner. For us, this is much more than just about capital, which we can get in a myriad of ways as you can see, but having that strategic partnership and getting compensated with market-based measures, keeping half of the upside certainly. And then, generating as I mentioned in my remarks, additional income and profit sharing that are market-based. They give us a lot of confidence that we not only have a great partner but we are preserving as much of the upside as we move forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James.\nJonathan Hughes: Does the potential for federal oversight in regulations seniors housing make that business a potentially less attractive avenue for growth for Ventas going forward relative to some of your other businesses?\nDebra Cafaro: I mean, I think, as I said, we believe in the business, the demographic demand is in front of us, the supply is continuing to improve. So we think there's upside there operationally and in terms of the business, we're benefiting, obviously, from some of the government's financial support, available to assisted living communities under the CARES Act, and we're grateful for that. With that, there certainly could be reporting or other requirements that I think would be appropriate about the clinical record and performance of senior housing, which frankly compares incredibly well, overall to the skilled nursing business, and we welcome that transparency.\nJonathan Hughes: Okay. And then just one more for me, can you walk us through why you raised equity via the ATM when you have plenty of liquidity? I understand the desire to manage leverage, but it was a very small amount. And the willingness to seemingly give shares away at a significant discount, the last time that was done a year ago sends a bit of a mixed signal, in my opinion, I just love to hear your views, rationale and how you thought about that. Thanks.\nDebra Cafaro: I'm going to ask Bob to answer that. And again, talking about access to public and private capital. So Bob, can you take that question for Jonathan?\nBob Probst: Sure. I think the main point to start with is, the 600 million of equity for that transaction was principally sourced from new third party capital and principally via the fund. So demonstrating the ability to acquire an attractive set of assets, like the San Francisco assets, with partners, through the fund vehicle and that's the main -- the majority source of the fund. Within that Ventas has a portion I mentioned a call it 120 million. We took a balanced approach to that, Jonathan, frankly. Part of that equity was through attractive dispositions. And part of that is through the ATM in small size. And frankly, we have to keep our eye on leverage and think about our risk overall. So a balanced approach, but the majority, of course, of the equity coming from third-party private capital.\nJonathan Hughes: Right. But I mean, how did you just pulled it on the line, leverage would have gone up by I think, like 0.04 turns. So it just -- it seems kind of inconsequential as to why tap equity and why not just pull it down.\nDebra Cafaro: Good math, I think that's currently Biden's lead in Georgia. Yes, again, it's a balanced approach, we continue to be active across all capital sourcing. And, it's just like the asset side of the balance sheet. We want to stay disciplined, keep in these different markets. And I think you could make a case either way for the ATM in that size, but we decided it was an appropriate way to fund part of that. And the other part is, as Bob mentioned, with the private capital, and then with asset sales.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.\nMichael Carroll: Thanks. I want to talk a little bit about your near term seniors housing outlook, I believe Justin mentioned his prepared remarks that you expect occupancy will soften. What is this driven by, is it driven by the third COVID wave typical seasonal trends and like what type of volatility should we expect over the next few months, two quarters?\nDebra Cafaro: I'm going to ask Justin to answer that with the overview that of course, we're in a very dynamic environment with the clinical trends nationally and so that's just something to keep in mind as you think about our near-term outlook.\nJustin Hutchens: Yes. I would just add that we're certainly encouraged by the trends, they've been consistently going up in leads and move-ins. We had the net positive month in October that I mentioned. And the contributors to that were operators across the board in the U.S. and in Canada. So the trends are positive but the macro environment is concerning. So, it's difficult to predict the continuation of positive trends in the face of just the increase infections across the broader public in the U.S. And so that's really the biggest driver for our hesitancy to make predictions about continued positive improvements.\nMichael Carroll: Okay. And then, what type of competition are you seeing, I guess, from other operators in forms of rank cuts or rank concessions, and I know, Atria has kind of highlighted on its Web site that they're offering some free ramp right now, is that widespread dropped out of the portfolio? And will that weigh on near term results?\nJustin Hutchens: Yes. So I'll start with Canada, because that's the easy one, Canada has performed really well, their occupancy only dropped 50 basis points sequentially. All three of our Canadian operators contributed to NOI growth in Canada with LGM leading the way with more than with double-digit NOI growth getting 10% overall. So there's less kind of supply/demand dynamics there. And the virus was less impactful. So set Canada aside, then you get into the U.S. and what's been interesting in the U.S., if you look at the performance we've had throughout the pandemic. Early on, the Northeast was impacted because of the prevalence of the virus and we had to add more expense to deal with that from a PPE perspective, and also had an impact on our move out and move in activity. So the Northeast was impacted early. Since then, geographically, as we started to see these improving trends, the improving trends have been relatively equal across all geographies and across the operators for the most part, with some exceptions. But what operators are now facing as they want to continue these trends is some competition. And so in certain markets, and in certain asset classes, operators are starting to use some move-in incentives and in an environment where you have a high fixed cost business that benefits greatly from increased occupancy, you would expect to see that. And that's what we're seeing in the early stages at this point.\nOperator: And your next question comes the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC.\nRich Anderson: So on the life science purchase, a kind of a departure from your university based business, which I guess is partially explains why it goes to the fund, maybe, maybe not but you can respond to that. But also, is there any kind of redevelopment angle in that portfolio, some understanding there some -- maybe some awkward orientation of some of the assets that need that could be addressed or is it pretty much a turnkey sort of situation?\nDebra Cafaro: Rich, the asset is a essentially new asset that is, leased up to its current 96% area, in a very short period of time, we really liked the asset. And now I'll turn it over to Pete to talk about why we like to ask that. In terms of the capital, I would say the fund was really designed to be a competitive advantage for us in these really highly sought after trophy assets, where there's a huge amount of capital available to acquire them. But the cap rate is something -- in this case, it's a forward cap rate of five that may not always work perfectly in size, with the public capital markets. And so that's why having these different pools of capital is really advantageous for us as we continue to expand our life science footprint. Now just to say one other thing, I mean, we really have from 2016 just incredibly built out this business to a point where it's about 9 million square feet. And not only do we have presence on over 15 major research campuses that represent, like 10% of all the life science, university research in the nation, just our customers, but also, we've been in Cambridge for a couple years now. And so, we're now in two of the largest life science clusters with both Mass Ave that we acquired a couple years ago and now the South San Francisco investment. So those are some of the more capital answers that I would ask Pete to address why we like the portfolio.\nPete Bulgarelli: Yes. We feel very fortunate Rich to be able to enter the South San Francisco market on a scale, this is 800,000 square feet. So it's a terrific start for us. We also like the fact this building is highly differentiated from the competitors. It's got great views; it's got fantastic accessibility from the expressway. It's on the proper side of the expressway. And it's very close to the BART stations and Caltran. It's got onsite amenities. And as Debbie said, it's largely it's their new buildings and we're at 96% leased. It really drives towards a niche market 10,000 to 50,000 square foot tenants this fits perfectly for. And we have opportunity to enhance the 96% occupancy rate, we've got a lot of activity. And we think that we\u2019ll be very close to 100% leased in a short period of time. Now, as you refer to an infrastructure, they are new and they're high quality buildings. But there are several floors in the buildings that are not built out for Life Sciences. So as those office tenants leave, we will do some construction to convert those floors into life sciences floors in the lab space.\nDebra Cafaro: Thanks, Pete. And yes, the tenants in the work that we did, the tenants really liked the location and the characteristics of the building. So that's kind of proving itself out by the occupancy and leasing activity.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capitals.\nJohn Kim: I was looking on the R&I joint venture, developing in the low 70s and I think you're contributing the asset cost. How does this compare to cap rates if we were to sell these assets in the open market for new assets?\nDebra Cafaro: Good morning. So, again, in terms of the strategic benefits of this transaction, the stabilized level of cap rates is about seven wins, they're fully leased and developed over time. And as I mentioned, we are keeping 50% of the assets and are generating kind of market based compensation and profit sharing as it relates to the upside.\nJohn Kim: Okay. Seems like a similar cap rate when you bought the platform. My second question is on Brookdale Battery Park. Can you discuss how you expect occupancy to be impacted, given new competition from some of your peers in Manhattan? And also if you could discuss the ground lease potentially being reset as far as the timing and potential outcome?\nDebra Cafaro: Yes. Great. So I'm going to ask Justin to talk about operations but I just want to remind you that we acquired that asset at below replacement cost. It has been a successful asset in the market for a long time, it's a great physical plant. And in terms of the ground lease reset, we underwrote that quite carefully. And as is always the case, there's a silver lining to everything, and it's quite possible that the current environment and COVID-19 may give us a benefit on the rent reset when it becomes applicable. So Justin, do you want to talk to John about how you see the operations and upside post-COVID in the Battery Park asset in Manhattan.\nJustin Hutchens: Sure. The Battery Park community has been a very strong performer consistently for us before the COVID environment And it's been -- it's now seeing more competition not in its direct market but in the New York Manhattan area, and that competition has entered at a higher price point. So we are positioned within our own price point as an intelligent product, we have a strong history there of solid performance, we expect there to be demand moving forward. It is a community that we've evaluated very closely and we'll continue to consider actions that can be taken to help us to be -- continued to be positioned competitive moving forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Omotayo Okusanya with Mizuho.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Congrats on the solid quarter. Question around universities based life sciences. Again, you pause the project, you're restarting it? I think that's a good thing. But I think the broader concern is what's happening with universities, amidst COVID, tightening budgets and things like that. Do you see that impacting demand going forward for university based life sciences?\nDebra Cafaro: Good. I mean, again, we've now built this really nice business where the capital flows into life sciences are at record highs and with those record highs of capital flows, also demand for the life science, real estate. So we feel really good about getting in the business. And we feel good about being situated now, both with the universities and in the cluster markets of Cambridge and South San Francisco. Obviously, I mentioned that we really like diversification, we know that COVID is affecting different segments of our portfolio differently, currently, life science, including the university based life sciences in great demand. And the universities, in general, as leaders in research with significant government and other funding have continued to pursue research and developments throughout the pandemic. Clearly, if the pandemic continues at really high levels, there are all sorts of potential consequences to that. But we're looking forward to the fact that, frankly, within our buildings and elsewhere, we're hopeful that a vaccine is going to be developed and distributed that is going to help us coupled with a sound public policy, public health response, so that we will be post-pandemic before the academic year begins in 2021. So that's our base case. And in that case, we continue to like the life science business and we continue to be glad that we're associated with these research leaders at these universities.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Okay. That's helpful. And then just one quick follow up. Kind of elections, it seems we're heading to Democratic president, Republican Senate, Democratic house, how do you think that helps or hinders the drive or the fight for additional help as a senior housing from a government perspective?\nDebra Cafaro: Well, thank you. Yes. I mean, we are grateful that HHS has understood what a crucial role senior living play is for vulnerable older Americans during this pandemic. And my guess is, it's only a guess, obviously, because we don't even know what the results of the election are yet, but with a moderate democratic president, a democratic house and what will certainly be a closely divided Senate, that will push us toward more consistency in policy, more moderation in policy, more likely to be steady as she goes and that's quite a favorable backdrop for Ventas and hopefully for the country as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.\nVikram Malhotra: Maybe just first one on growing kind of senior housing and the platform -- during the platform from here. How should be thinking about potentially using this fund or other fund structure or kind of housing business. Whether it's contributing properties or just in the fun of acquiring senior housing finance, have kind of both end of the spectrum, like you have on balance sheet.\nDebra Cafaro: You kind of broke up, I am sorry, but could you repeat your question?\nVikram Malhotra: What I was asking you is, how do you think about growing the senior housing platform using the fund structure like you've grown kind of MOB like sign for the O&I business as well, whether it's contributing properties from Ventas into the fund, or just using a fund structure to grow senior housing?\nDebra Cafaro: Yes. Okay. I did hear that. Again, we really like the fact that we do have embedded upside in our business from senior housing. In terms of additional investments, we would obviously look at those investments depending on what their characteristics were. And now we have various tools at our disposal to figure out what would be the customized capital source for that type of acquisition. And the fund is really designed to be an open-end vehicle for core and core plus real estate, that's typically low cap rate, highly stable, low leverage assets, including senior housing. So in the case assets fit that profile, they could obviously be suitable for the funds. To the extent they are more value add or opportunistic, those could either be on balance sheet, and/or you could use some other form of private capital for them. Right now, we do have pension fund capital that really likes to do opportunistic, value add, and ground up development in senior housing. So that's another pocket of capital that we've had available for a while, that we could use for those types of opportunities if we wanted to do so.\nVikram Malhotra: Okay, make sense. And then just a follow up, say, you get a vaccine at the end of the year and it's distribution plans were laid out, how do you think about regaining the last occupants in senior housing, between sort of the levers of occupancy and rent growth and in any other levers and just trying to get a sense of the -- on the rent cycle equation, how you would pull that lever?\nDebra Cafaro: Yes. And that I'm going to turn that over to Justin, that's really been the key, obviously, of, having move in succeed move out for in which, we've attained as Justin described in October, and then how to gain back the occupancy. So Justin, would you would you take that on?\nJustin Hutchens: Sure. So, just to back up, the big change that occurred across our portfolio and we've seen this across the sector, throughout the pandemic, really was the operators ability to safely offer a more robust living environment that was a big driver and what the key driver being the residents desire to be able to visit with their relatives once they move in. And also enjoy some amount of amenities that you typically enjoy in senior housing and throughout the pandemic, that's obviously improved. And you can see leads and move-ins and demand has persisted. In the case where there's a vaccine and that the virus is either eliminated or less impactful then you can restore the lifestyle back to where it was pre-pandemic and we would expect that to be very supportive of senior housing and you're doing it at a time when you have your demographics are really supportive, too. I mean, the 75 plus CAGR is going to be 10x that of the remaining population over the next five years. New starts are at nine-year low, deliveries are down by half year-over-year. So there's a lot of support, especially if we can get a vaccine. Now, predicting what that's really going to deliver is nearly impossible. All we can really point to is the moving parts and the lifestyle and the care delivery that residents are accessing and the availability of it. And I think in the post vaccine environment it's very supportive of growth.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nJordan Sadler: I would like to just start, so Bob, you mentioned keeping an eye on leverage. So first, given your development funding commitments, should we expect you to continue to fund with equity raised under the ATM? And then, maybe along the same lines, have you had conversations with the rating agencies surrounding your leverage at 6.8x, net debt to EBITDA and are they receptive to looking at pre-COVID NOI on the seniors housing portfolio?\nBob Probst: Sure, Jordan. So let's start with the rating agencies, you were in consistent dialogue with the rating agencies, as you would expect. They're an important stakeholder, clearly, for the whole of the sector, ourselves included, there's been a lot of attention paid and rightly so to the senior housing trajectory. And so, the main focus of our conversations with them as it is with you, is what is that trajectory look like? And we've been encouraged, as we said, numerous times by the trends thus far. So that's good. In the meantime, of course, being smart, being prudent, managing the balance sheet appropriately. And demonstrating our commitment to financial strength and flexibility is what we're doing, whether it's accessing third-party capital, selling assets, things like that to make sure we stay in the right zip code. And so that's our approach. At the end of the day, the senior housing recovery is going to be very helpful to the leverage situation. But in the meantime, be smart about how we manage things.\nJordan Sadler: Okay. Then maybe the follow up just on the GIC, JV, I was also struck by who's contributed, essentially, what seems to be cost even though it was pre-leasing and you seemingly have created some value? Have you guys considered monetizing the stabilized R&I portfolio or would you consider monetizing that?\nDebra Cafaro: This is Debbie. Look, we're constantly evaluating our capital sourcing, as we've talked about sort of at length this morning. We're really happy to have a variety of ways to source public and private capital, debt capital. If you'll recall, when we launched our fund in March, we actually seeded it with some stabilized R&I and MOB assets at attractive cap rates, as you know, sits at a significant profit. And as I've mentioned, with respect to the R&I development JV, here, we have a strategic partner, we've retained 50% of the assets. And we also have kind of market-based compensation, that all of which together including our retained interest gives us a significant part of the upside while also managing our financial strength and flexibility in our risk profile. So we feel good about that all on balance. And certainly, we can will consistently evaluate the portfolio for capital recycling opportunities and profit-making opportunities of all types.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.\nJoshua Dennerlein: You mentioned GIC was brought and not just as a capital partner but also for strategic reasons, could maybe elaborate on what they bring strategically to the JV?\nDebra Cafaro: Right. I mean, I would just say that, we're very particular about who we would be partners with. GIC is obviously one of the world's leading real estate investors. We have a good relationship with them. We've known them for a long time. And we the optionality or we like having a relationship with them because we certainly in the case of other types of investments or activities, they could be a good strategic partner for us across asset types. If we felt that that was appropriate. So we think establishing a good relationship with them could benefit our entire enterprise and public stakeholders over time.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay, appreciate that, Debbie. And then you mentioned potential additional senior housing asset sales. I think you mentioned you said they were being marketed at six cap, or that's what they're expected to sell at? Are those shop or net lease assets? And then, is that cap rate you're quoting is that a trailing 12-month basis or a more current NOI.\nDebra Cafaro: So that's really a combination of assets that we sold in the third quarter and a portfolio that we have under -- that we have targeted for sale. And they're both triple-net leased assets. And again, you know, very consistent with other market data, and that's based more on sort of current NOI trends in today's environment.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.\nNick Yulico: So I just wanted to follow up on the senior housing portfolio, the moving trends you talked about and the spot occupancy benefits so far. And in October, it was is the message, delivered I know, you talked a little bit about this. But it's the message though that occupancy is off in October, but we shouldn't necessarily assume that that occupancy benefit lasts through the fourth quarter, because of your weaker move in period historically, etc.\nDebraCafaro: Yes. I mean, I think look we had good results, our trends are good. Those trends have been sustained improvement in demand and move in from the nadir of this pandemic, in April, and it's been month-over-month, consistent traction, showing that demand and value propositions for senior living and I think that, it's important to, to take a moment on that and appreciate that and celebrate it. On the other hand, we know that we are in a pandemic, that creates a lot of uncertainty and unpredictability. And so, we want to, we want to discuss the facts, share how really positive what evidence, positive evidence that is of the benefits of the asset class, and what kind of recovery the asset class can have. But at the same time, be humble about the fact that the virus creates unpredictability, as does normal fourth quarter, history, as you mentioned.\nNick Yulico: Right. Okay. I guess, in terms of this year thinking about, fourth quarter, first quarter next year, I mean, typically, the business will experience some sort of sequential occupancy, pressure because of flu. And is, that a going to be in a dynamic again, coming up or as soon as some of that occupancy pressure, as obviously already happened, I guess they're just trying to figure out in terms of an occupancy rebound, if, we should be thinking more about the spring as really kind of the earliest opportunity for occupancy benefit, given what historically happens in the fourth quarter and first quarter?\nDebra Cafaro: Well, again, let's not talk about that win, it's the right time to do so. I'll be very happy when we're talking about the flu again, and not COVID.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Daniel Bernstein with Capital One.\nDaniel Bernstein: I'm the two quick questions on seniors house and one, how do you view the threat of home health to senior housing, there's been a, I guess a number of CMS initiatives to more at home care, and we'll see what happens given a new administration, but how do you see the threat of home health a senior counting into? How do you see the CapEx needs for seniors housing going forward in a kind of a post-COVID environment, there's been a lot of talk about needs for smaller dining rooms or, I guess more medical care or higher acuity, especially post-COVID. So just try to think about those two items somehow in CapEx?\nDebra Cafaro: Well, the senior housing is supposed to be a social environment. That's important when we think about the differences between home health and senior housing, but I'm going to turn it over to Justin to take your questions.\nJustin Hutchens: Yes, as it pertains to home health, home health tends to be supportive of independent living, which is about half of our senior housing portfolio, allows residents to receive, any medical attention they might need in care and services within their NFL living apartments. It's certainly been a service that's been offered for many years and a part of the continuum that's been offered to seniors. In terms of assisted living, assisted living is well positioned to take care of residents that have higher acuity needs and memory care needs. And we would expect that that need would continue as well. And then, in terms of what was the follow up question?\nDaniel Bernstein: CapEx means that may be needed within the portfolio, or even redevelopment opportunities. The other way to look at it is, are there increased CapEx needs? And on the flip side, there are development opportunities that are coming out of COVID?\nJustin Hutchens: Yes. I would say that the asset class certainly benefits from ongoing investment. And our portfolio has been well invested over time. And that's important to remain relevant and competitive within our market. And I would expect that to continue. I would also expect to see certain markets that probably benefit from redevelopments or a broader refresh. And we definitely have a list of projects that are under review for -- when we get out of this pandemic, and definitely that the asset class benefits from the CapEx and should continue to moving forward.\nOperator: Next question comes from Lukas Hartwich with Green Street.\nLukas Hartwich: So for life science, now that Ventas has a JV for new development and acquisition? How will the company evaluate new opportunities going forward? Are they all going to go into a JV? And if not, what determines whether they go in a JV or not?\nDebra Cafaro: Hi, Lucas, this is Debbie. That's a very clear answer. So the GIC joint venture is for basically these four projects that are underway, including the UCity development that we started construction on, and we believe that JV again, is going to accelerate our ability to drive this business forward. And there's a handful of identified projects in our pipeline that could go in that JV, full stop. Then, as we talked about, when we launched the open-end fund in March, that is really designed to be able to capture low cap rate, high quality core assets that would be very difficult for Ventas to buy on balance sheet. And at the assist part of the cycle and that's kind of how the segmentation is designed. It gives us lots of options, again, particularly at a time when the public markets may be disrupted as a result of COVID-19. And that creates significant value for our public shareholders and leverages our platform in a very positive way.\nOperator: Next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays.\nSteven Valiquette: When the shop portfolio you mentioned that the revenue decline in 3Q was offset by the lower COVID related operating expenses, 4% to 5%. Lower. And for 4Q, you expect the shop operating expenses to remain flat at current elevated levels. So I guess the question is, hopefully I didn't miss this. But was there any disclosure in the slides just on the total dollar amount of COVID related expenses? Ventas and your partner's have absorbed in the shop portfolio? And if not, we're just looking for more data points, you can give around that either as a percent of revenues and therefore just impact the NOI margins, or even just, again, any rod dollar amount of COVID expenses, either in 3Q or prior quarters?\nDebra Cafaro: Sure. I'm going to ask Justin to answer that.\nJustin Hutchens: I saw that the COVID expenses from Q2 to Q3 went down by about half. But we're still carrying around 15 million of COVID expense. So we're still running at an elevated level. But we do think that the overall expenses sequentially will be flat.\nSteven Valiquette: Okay. One quick follow up just on slide 15 in the slide deck, wasn't really sure what the point that of other than thank you for not using blue and red colors on that slide. But just want to do just get more color on kind of what the takeaway was from that particular\u2026\nDebra Cafaro: Which page so we can\u2026\nSteven Valiquette: That has a U.S. map?\nDebra Cafaro: Oh, yes. We like that flag. We will share that with you. It's supposed to show our -- the extent of our NOI in different markets, where there is significant new confirmed cases of COVID, which is shown by the backdrop of green, red and yellow. So where are there more and less kind of COVID cases? Where do we have more or less NOI? And importantly, within those geographies, where do we see move in as a percent of prior year. So for example, you can see that in the New York area, the COVID pandemic confirmed cases are lower, New York is green. You can see we have a lot of NOI there because their bubble is large and that the movements are above 75% of our prior year level. So yes, that's, that's kind of -- we really love this map. And I think it gives investors kind of, especially, in the earlier parts of the pandemic, where there was a little bit of -- and it continues to be a little bit of geographical movement of the virus and how that could be affecting the different markets where we have senior housing operating assets. I have to give Justin credit, it was his --Justin's brainchild that I really like it.\nOperator: Your last question comes from Sarah Tan with JPMorgan.\nSarah Tan: So just once you've past COVID and occupancy recovers, do you think the operating margin of the senior housing business will be materially different from what it was hitting to the pandemic, just given all the moving parts of the COVID-19 expenses and I assume some of that will be carried forward with all the security measures in place?\nDebra Cafaro: Okay. I'm going to turn that over to Justin, and then we'll wrap up.\nJustin Hutchens: In regards to margin, I'll start with the defense side of the question. If we're in a post pandemic situation, I would expect expenses to normalize. There may be a little bit very small amount of carrying cost per PPE that wasn't used previously, that's proven to be helpful combating the virus, but it's not going to be a material impact. The big help to margin is really going to be the revenue growth as it comes back. And like I said earlier, there's a lot of underlying drivers that support potential revenue growth when we get out of this pandemic. So, this is a very high fixed cost business, when you get occupancies back up into the historical levels of the high 80s and move at certain markets in the 90s margins. Go with it significantly. So, there'll be a recovery period but to expect margins to be somewhat similar to previous levels once we get there.\nDebra Cafaro: Yes. And thank you for that question, Sarah, because there is a lot of operating leverage that, will be fairly powerful to the upside off of these occupancy levels as Justin said. When we get to the post-pandemic recovery of senior housing and the demographic demand. So that is the end of our call today. I want to sincerely thank everyone for joining us. And, as always, for your interest in and support of Ventas, we are all here working very hard for you. And we're committed to winning the recovery. Thank you and I hope you stay safe. Bye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bob Probst",
            "content": "Thanks, Pete. I'll touch on our healthcare triple-net lease portfolio before I close with some enterprise level commentary. During the third quarter, our healthcare triple-net assets showed continued strength and resilience as evidenced by receiving 100% of third quarter, October and November from our total healthcare tenants. Further trailing 12 months EBITDARM cash flow coverage for the second quarter of '20, related to the available information improved sequentially for all of our healthcare triple-net asset classes despite COVID-19. Both acute and post-acute providers have had early access to significant government funding to create liquidity and to mitigate losses related to the pandemic. Acute care hospitals trailing 12-month coverage was a strong 3.1x in the second quarter. Nationally hospital inpatient admissions and surgeries continue to rebound in Q3 and third quarter admissions approached over 90% of prior year levels. Arden continues to perform extremely well despite the challenging market conditions and is benefiting from over 90% of its hospitals residing in jurisdictions that are open for elective procedures. Herbs and health tax coverage improved 20 basis points to 1.5x in Q2 on the heels of government funding and significantly improved census. Health tax have increasingly proved their importance in the care continuum, with or without COVID. And finally, within our loan portfolio, our Colony, Holiday and Brookdale loans are all fully current. Turning to our third quarter financial performance, and let me start with Q3 GAAP net income, which includes $0.06 in non-cash charges as a result of COVID impacts. Most notably the write-off of straight-line rents across five tenants, with Genesis being the largest. These tenants are now on a cash basis and represent approximately 50 million of annual cash rent, notwithstanding the write-offs, all these tenants are current, and we will endeavor to collect all our contractual rents going forward. These non-cash charges are excluded from third quarter normalized FFO. We provided additional information in our supplemental on page 34. In terms of normalized FFO per share, we delivered $0.75 in Q3 2020 versus $0.77 in the second quarter. Shop and office NOI were stable sequentially, with the $0.02 reduction in FFO in the third quarter, as compared to the second described by the Brookdale rent reset in the third quarter. In the third quarter, we saw the results of the decisive actions taken earlier in the year to ensure a strong and stable Ventas. These included reducing our corporate cost structure by 25%, resulting in 30 million in annualized SG&A savings in Q3. We are also active in managing our balance sheet and liquidity, including paying down substantially all borrowings under our revolving credit facility, successfully tendering for 236 million of near-term bonds and issuing under our ATM to help fund the South San Francisco investments. Net-net, we feel good about our financial flexibility. Our liquidity is strong at 3.2 billion between available revolver capacity and cash on hand as of November 5. We have limited near-term debt maturities, access to diversified capital sources, strong fixed charge coverage and debt to gross asset value just 37%. To close, we're pleased with our performance in the quarter and the continuing improving trends in senior housing. The entire Ventas team is sharply focused on taking the actions that will enable us to win the recovery when the pandemic is finally behind us. And that concludes our prepared remarks. Before we start with Q&A, we're limiting each caller to one question with one follow-up to be respectful to everyone on the line. Also given the fact that we continue to be remote, I'd ask Debbie to do her Roethlsberger impression and quarterback our QA. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator. Right, Steve, just step back a little bit, on the billion dollars transaction, the vast majority of that was 600 million of new equity across the fund and ourselves included newly raised equity. Within that our equity portion, we funded really two ways one through some dispositions of senior housing and second some modest ATM. So ultimately, that was the sources of uses for the deal overall. Sure. I think the main point to start with is, the 600 million of equity for that transaction was principally sourced from new third party capital and principally via the fund. So demonstrating the ability to acquire an attractive set of assets, like the San Francisco assets, with partners, through the fund vehicle and that's the main -- the majority source of the fund. Within that Ventas has a portion I mentioned a call it 120 million. We took a balanced approach to that, Jonathan, frankly. Part of that equity was through attractive dispositions. And part of that is through the ATM in small size. And frankly, we have to keep our eye on leverage and think about our risk overall. So a balanced approach, but the majority, of course, of the equity coming from third-party private capital. Sure, Jordan. So let's start with the rating agencies, you were in consistent dialogue with the rating agencies, as you would expect. They're an important stakeholder, clearly, for the whole of the sector, ourselves included, there's been a lot of attention paid and rightly so to the senior housing trajectory. And so, the main focus of our conversations with them as it is with you, is what is that trajectory look like? And we've been encouraged, as we said, numerous times by the trends thus far. So that's good. In the meantime, of course, being smart, being prudent, managing the balance sheet appropriately. And demonstrating our commitment to financial strength and flexibility is what we're doing, whether it's accessing third-party capital, selling assets, things like that to make sure we stay in the right zip code. And so that's our approach. At the end of the day, the senior housing recovery is going to be very helpful to the leverage situation. But in the meantime, be smart about how we manage things."

            "content": "Thanks, Debbie. I'll start by mentioning the encouraging trends we continue to see in our shop portfolio. We are pleased to have had our first net positive move in month since the start of the pandemic in October and a majority of our portfolios delivering move ins at levels that are equal to or more than typical levels across the U.S. and Canada. The underlying demand for need driven senior housing in the U.S. and independent living services in Canada persists. While we are encouraged about these positive trends, we're mindful that the pandemic causes ongoing uncertainty and choppy waters in the senior housing business. I will also add that in spite of the near-term pressure on the sector, we remain committed to the senior housing business and excited about the supportive underlying supply demand fundamentals that should persist for years to come. Now I will review our third quarter senior housing results in the shop and triple-net portfolio and follow that up with some comments on our latest trends and outlook. First up, the shop, for the quarter, shop results were in line with the company's expectations. Our 395 assets sequential same-store pool comprising over 90% of our shop NOI, posted cash NOI of 109 million which is effectively flat versus the second quarter. Average occupancy was 130 basis points lower sequentially with improving trends inter quarter while RevPOR declined 30 basis points and grew 50 basis points in our U.S. and Canadian operating portfolios respectively. Leading indicators such as leads and movements also saw a consistent and positive trend intra quarter, both in absolute numbers and relative to prior year, highlighting the resilient demand for senior housing. In September leads and move-ins were 85% and 94%, respectively, as compared to the prior year. Third quarter revenue declined 3.6% which was offset entirely by 4.5%, lower operating expenses sequentially, primarily driven by lower COVID related expenses. As a reminder, all COVID-19 impacts including elevated testing, labor, cleaning and supplies costs have been reflected in property operating results. As with last quarter, I'll highlight our Canadian portfolio, which represents 33% of our shop portfolio and demonstrates the benefits of our diversification and a well-orchestrated public health response. The 72 communities within our sequential Q3 same-store pool, including our LGM investment was 93.2% occupied, which compares to an average of 93.7% for the second quarter, outperform in the U.S. on an absolute and relative basis. Same-store cash NOI on a sequential basis grew in Canada by over 10%. Moving on to our triple-net senior housing portfolio, in the third quarter and through October Ventas received all of its expected triple-net senior housing cash rent. Our underlying triple-net senior housing portfolio performance continues to be impacted by COVID-19, which we have been collaboratively addressing with our tenant partners. As a result of our proactive steps to improve coverage through mutually beneficial arrangements with Capital Senior, Holiday, Brookdale and other smaller tenants, our trailing 12 months cash flow coverage for senior housing is 1.4x. We also expect triple-net senior housing tenants will receive CARES Act funding, which will be a positive development. Now I'll address recent trends. As described earlier, demand characteristics supporting senior housing remain solid and leads and move-ins continue to improve since the low point in April and month-over-month in the third quarter. These trends persisted into October as we experienced net positive move-ins helped in part by selective move in incentives. Our operators successful execution of screening, protecting and testing protocols has been supporting a living environment that's more open and more robust than earlier in the pandemic. Currently, 96% of our communities are accepting move-ins. Moving on to our clinical results. As a result of the diligent efforts of our operators executing, testing and preventative protocols new resident COVID-19 cases more than 75% better than the peak seen in April, in spite of broader market trends of increased new infection rates among the U.S. general public. In regards to the Q4 outlook for shop, due to the uncertain environment, it is too hard to predict. However, we would expect occupancy to soften and we would expect expenses to be relatively flat at the current elevated levels as the health and safety of the residents and frontline caregivers is the biggest priority. In summary, we are encouraged by the continued improvement and leading indicators through the third quarter and October and we remain committed to the senior housing business moving forward. We are proud of our operators' efforts in the third quarter to successfully execute COVID-19 related protocols while focusing on the health and safety of frontline caregivers and residents. With that, I'll hand the call to Pete. Yes. I would just add that we're certainly encouraged by the trends, they've been consistently going up in leads and move-ins. We had the net positive month in October that I mentioned. And the contributors to that were operators across the board in the U.S. and in Canada. So the trends are positive but the macro environment is concerning. So, it's difficult to predict the continuation of positive trends in the face of just the increase infections across the broader public in the U.S. And so that's really the biggest driver for our hesitancy to make predictions about continued positive improvements. Yes. So I'll start with Canada, because that's the easy one, Canada has performed really well, their occupancy only dropped 50 basis points sequentially. All three of our Canadian operators contributed to NOI growth in Canada with LGM leading the way with more than with double-digit NOI growth getting 10% overall. So there's less kind of supply/demand dynamics there. And the virus was less impactful. So set Canada aside, then you get into the U.S. and what's been interesting in the U.S., if you look at the performance we've had throughout the pandemic. Early on, the Northeast was impacted because of the prevalence of the virus and we had to add more expense to deal with that from a PPE perspective, and also had an impact on our move out and move in activity. So the Northeast was impacted early. Since then, geographically, as we started to see these improving trends, the improving trends have been relatively equal across all geographies and across the operators for the most part, with some exceptions. But what operators are now facing as they want to continue these trends is some competition. And so in certain markets, and in certain asset classes, operators are starting to use some move-in incentives and in an environment where you have a high fixed cost business that benefits greatly from increased occupancy, you would expect to see that. And that's what we're seeing in the early stages at this point. Sure. The Battery Park community has been a very strong performer consistently for us before the COVID environment And it's been -- it's now seeing more competition not in its direct market but in the New York Manhattan area, and that competition has entered at a higher price point. So we are positioned within our own price point as an intelligent product, we have a strong history there of solid performance, we expect there to be demand moving forward. It is a community that we've evaluated very closely and we'll continue to consider actions that can be taken to help us to be -- continued to be positioned competitive moving forward. Sure. So, just to back up, the big change that occurred across our portfolio and we've seen this across the sector, throughout the pandemic, really was the operators ability to safely offer a more robust living environment that was a big driver and what the key driver being the residents desire to be able to visit with their relatives once they move in. And also enjoy some amount of amenities that you typically enjoy in senior housing and throughout the pandemic, that's obviously improved. And you can see leads and move-ins and demand has persisted. In the case where there's a vaccine and that the virus is either eliminated or less impactful then you can restore the lifestyle back to where it was pre-pandemic and we would expect that to be very supportive of senior housing and you're doing it at a time when you have your demographics are really supportive, too. I mean, the 75 plus CAGR is going to be 10x that of the remaining population over the next five years. New starts are at nine-year low, deliveries are down by half year-over-year. So there's a lot of support, especially if we can get a vaccine. Now, predicting what that's really going to deliver is nearly impossible. All we can really point to is the moving parts and the lifestyle and the care delivery that residents are accessing and the availability of it. And I think in the post vaccine environment it's very supportive of growth. Yes, as it pertains to home health, home health tends to be supportive of independent living, which is about half of our senior housing portfolio, allows residents to receive, any medical attention they might need in care and services within their NFL living apartments. It's certainly been a service that's been offered for many years and a part of the continuum that's been offered to seniors. In terms of assisted living, assisted living is well positioned to take care of residents that have higher acuity needs and memory care needs. And we would expect that that need would continue as well. And then, in terms of what was the follow up question? Yes. I would say that the asset class certainly benefits from ongoing investment. And our portfolio has been well invested over time. And that's important to remain relevant and competitive within our market. And I would expect that to continue. I would also expect to see certain markets that probably benefit from redevelopments or a broader refresh. And we definitely have a list of projects that are under review for -- when we get out of this pandemic, and definitely that the asset class benefits from the CapEx and should continue to moving forward. I saw that the COVID expenses from Q2 to Q3 went down by about half. But we're still carrying around 15 million of COVID expense. So we're still running at an elevated level. But we do think that the overall expenses sequentially will be flat. In regards to margin, I'll start with the defense side of the question. If we're in a post pandemic situation, I would expect expenses to normalize. There may be a little bit very small amount of carrying cost per PPE that wasn't used previously, that's proven to be helpful combating the virus, but it's not going to be a material impact. The big help to margin is really going to be the revenue growth as it comes back. And like I said earlier, there's a lot of underlying drivers that support potential revenue growth when we get out of this pandemic. So, this is a very high fixed cost business, when you get occupancies back up into the historical levels of the high 80s and move at certain markets in the 90s margins. Go with it significantly. So, there'll be a recovery period but to expect margins to be somewhat similar to previous levels once we get there."

            "content": "Thanks, Justin. I'll cover the office segment third quarter results and trends. Our office segment which now represents over 30% of Ventas' NOI continues to produce strong results and show its value proposition and financial strength and missed the pandemic. MOBs and research and innovation centers, the two lines of business within our office portfolio play a key role in the delivery of crucial health care services and research for life saving vaccines and therapeutics. The Office portfolio continued to provide steady growth delivering 126 million of same-store cash NOI in the third quarter. This represents a 40 basis points of sequential growth. You will note that the same-store cash NOI declined 2.2% year-on-year for the third quarter. However, we lapped a large $4.7 million termination fee in the third quarter of 2019. normalizing for this fee. The same-store cash NOI grew 1.5% from the prior year normalizing for the paid parking shortfall and increased cleaning costs due to COVID, same-store cash NOI grew by 2.8%. In terms of rent receipts, office tenants paid an industry leading 99% of contractual rents in the third quarter in line with the second quarter. This is without D docs for deferrals, which were de minimis. Substantially all granted second quarter deferrals that came due have been repaid and new granted, deferrals were negligible. As of November 6, our tenants have paid more than 99% of October contractual rents. Receiving 99% of total rent without D docs is a direct reflection of the quality of our tenants and the quality of our buildings. The solid result underscores the durability and quality of our tenant base. Remember 88% of MOB NOI is from investment grade tenants or HCA and 97% of our MOB NOI comes from tenants affiliated with major health systems, including some of the nation's most prestigious, not-fort-profit health systems. Most tenants have received significant amount of federal support through a variety of programs designed to assist healthcare providers in small businesses. As an example, we estimate that our top 10 Health System tenants have collectively received nearly 5 billion in CARES Act relief and 10 billion in Medicare advanced payments. For our R&I portfolio 76% of our revenues are received from investment grade organizations and publicly listed companies a very solid foundation. Third quarter 2020 office occupancy for the same-store portfolio was 91.1%, a sequential decline of 40 basis points due to several small tenants not reopening post COVID. This was partially offset by the lease up of research and innovation assets associated with the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and Washington University in St. Louis. Lab space continues to be in high demand and the R&I portfolio is now 97% leased an outstanding result. Medical office had a record level retention at 90% for the third quarter of 2020 and for the trailing 12 months. Driven by this retention total office leasing was 1.2 million square feet for the quarter and 2.7 million square feet year to-date. This is 400,000 square feet higher than our third quarter of 2019 leasing and 300,000 square feet higher than the third quarter 2019 year-to-date leasing. We also saw a positive space utilization trends that mirrored admissions in surgery volumes reported by the health systems. These trends have continued through October. As an example, paid parking is more than doubled from the depths of COVID but as recovered to 65% to 70% of pre-COVID levels, climbing but still below historical levels. All of our MOB buildings are open for business, and 100% of our MOBs are in counties that are restriction free for elective procedures. All R&I buildings are also open, supporting multiple critical research organizations in fighting the pandemic. We have over 15 major university relationships, all of which opened in the fall with some level of on-campus in person learning, influenced to do the same for the second semester. As Debbie mentioned, we are pleased to have added three R&A buildings in South San Francisco. Since going under contract, we have signed a large renewal and are experiencing a high level of leasing activity. This gives us confidence that our occupancy will soon build from the current state which is already 96% leased. During the third quarter, we received the results of our annual tenant satisfaction survey. I am pleased to report that this year's results were significantly higher than in prior years. In fact, when compared to other MOB portfolios by an independent third-party, our tenant satisfaction is in the top quartile. One of our highest rated scores was how our team supported our tenants during the pandemic. These essential field personnel who serve our tenants on-site during the pandemic, have done a terrific job. We are grateful for their effort and commitment. And we continue to focus on the health and safety of these personnel and our tenants. In sum, our tenant satisfaction, leasing, NOI and cash receipts were positive during the third quarter, a clear build from the second quarter and we look forward to continuing the normalization of healthcare in research operations as we entered 2021. With that, I'll pass the baton to Bob. Yes. We feel very fortunate Rich to be able to enter the South San Francisco market on a scale, this is 800,000 square feet. So it's a terrific start for us. We also like the fact this building is highly differentiated from the competitors. It's got great views; it's got fantastic accessibility from the expressway. It's on the proper side of the expressway. And it's very close to the BART stations and Caltran. It's got onsite amenities. And as Debbie said, it's largely it's their new buildings and we're at 96% leased. It really drives towards a niche market 10,000 to 50,000 square foot tenants this fits perfectly for. And we have opportunity to enhance the 96% occupancy rate, we've got a lot of activity. And we think that we'll be very close to 100% leased in a short period of time. Now, as you refer to an infrastructure, they are new and they're high quality buildings. But there are several floors in the buildings that are not built out for Life Sciences. So as those office tenants leave, we will do some construction to convert those floors into life sciences floors in the lab space."

            "name": "Debra Cafaro",
            "content": "Thank you, Sarah. Good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants. We want to welcome you to the Ventas third quarter 2020 earnings call. The Ventas team is dispersed but unified in spirit as we join you for today's call. I'd like to provide an overview of our consistent strategy, discuss our third quarter results, highlight how we are driving our research and innovation business forward, describe our competitive advantage and managing institutional third-party capital and touch on the positive senior housing operating trends that continue into October. Our enterprise continues to benefit significantly from our steady commitment over decades and various cycles to asset class, operator and geographical diversification. We aim to generate reliable growing cash flows from a high-quality diverse portfolio of assets on a strong balance sheet. We've seen that staying disciplined about diversification has protected the downside and also provided myriad opportunities for our stakeholders. The current environment is certainly proving out the merits of this strategy. First, our diversified portfolio is enabling the company to remain strong and stable, despite the disruption occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected our different asset classes and geographies in non-correlated way. Our medical office, research and innovation business and our healthcare triple-net lease business now represents over half of our enterprise. During the quarter, these asset classes have continued to perform well and led our third quarter performance, enabling us to deliver $0.75 of normalized FFO per share. Second, our diversified asset base with five verticals has given us the ability to continue successfully allocating capital over time and through cycles. For example, following the spinoff of our skilled nursing business, we invested in high quality health systems with [indiscernible], which is currently performing very well as hospitals have asserted their centrality to the health care delivery systems in the U.S. Also, just as we did when we allocated capital to the medical office building business a decade earlier, in 2016, we entered the research and innovation business, and we have found significant opportunities to drive that business forward since then, through both ground up development and asset acquisitions. The addition of life sciences to our enterprise has provided uplift to our results, our investment activity and our enterprise value. Two recent examples of the benefit of our diversified strategy include our investment in a $1 billion Class A Trophy Life Science Portfolio located in the Premier South San Francisco Life Science Cluster at a forward cap rate of 5% on cash NOI. The tenant base is a nice mix of public companies and a diverse group of early to mid-stage life science company. The South San Francisco market consistently ranks as one of the elite life science clusters. Spurred by record capital flows into the life science sector, this market has less than 2% lab vacancy, unparalleled access to a large concentration of life science firms and an extensive venture capital network going after the world class talent pool. We also recently recommenced construction on a 400,000 square foot state-of-the-art Life Sciences project known as One UCity in this thriving research sub-market of Philadelphia, bookended by 10 and Drexel. This project is designed to be LEED certified and total estimated project costs are over $280 million. Similarly, we've invested on a geographically diversified basis with over 30% of our shop portfolio now in Canada. Last year, we acquired the high-quality Le Groupe Maurice portfolio in Quebec. Building on the strong performance LGM has delivered and its history of successfully developing and leasing up senior communities for vibrant older adults. We are also investing nearly $420 million in ground up development of new consumer focused senior living communities, which are well underway. We do see areas where we can recycle capital too. We have recently sold or placed under contract certain portfolios of senior living assets that are not long-term holds for us. We want to continue making senior housing a key part of our diversified portfolio because of the operational asset class upside post-pandemic, the demographically driven demand that is in front of us and the continued improvement on the supply side. There remains a strong bid from private capital for senior living, which supports our conclusion. On the other side of the ledger, through our growing third-party institutional Capital Management Platform, we also continue to diversify our capital sources, augment our investment capacity, expand our footprint, leverage our team and industry expertise and improve our financial flexibility and liquidity, all of which are positive for our public shareholders. Having additional partners and tools to use at appropriate times and for customized situations, provides a significant competitive advantage for Ventas and as an incremental source of earnings. We already have over $3 billion in assets under management in our institutional third-party capital management platform. These forms include our successful open-end funds, launched in March of this year that has already grown to nearly $2 billion and 2 million square feet in assets under management. Following the South San Francisco Life Sciences portfolio closing, when we raised over 600 million of discretionary new equity, our fund exceeds $1 billion in equity capital, and continues to have additional committed capital to accommodate new investments. We've also today announced a new joint venture with GIC, one of the most respected global real estate investors. This joint venture covers four research and innovation development projects currently in progress with approximately 930 million in estimated project costs. Our joint venture with GIC may be expanded to over $2 billion with other pre-identified future R&I development projects currently in our pipeline if they go forward. While maintaining a majority interest in all these projects and receiving market-based compensation, our GIC joint venture enables us to align with a strategic partner, improve our liquidity and financial profile and accelerate our research and innovation development pipeline, including the recent construction commencement of the One UCity project in Philadelphia. The success of our open-end fund and the GIC partnership demonstrates a tremendous market opportunity within life science, medical office and senior housing real estate and also they are a testament to Ventas's excellent team and investment track record. Turning to the here and now, I'd like to provide some key observations about our U.S. senior housing operating portfolio. Importantly, in the third quarter, our operators continued to build on the improving trend that began in the second quarter. Our communities demonstrated sustained increases in leads and move-ins, which continued through October. While we are sober and clear eyed about the recent increase in COVID-19 cases nationally, to a record level of nearly 120,000 confirmed cases today, we believe in the strength of the senior living business as we look toward the post-pandemic environment. We are also appreciative that HHS has recognized the crucial role senior living plays in protecting vulnerable older Americans. HHS has allocated CARES Act funding to the assisted living community to partially mitigate the losses directly suffered because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we are encouraged by the progress being made by scientists and doctors on vaccines and treatments for COVID-19. Older Americans, including our residents, will be prioritized for vaccine distribution slated just behind first responders and frontline health care providers. Most of our operators have already registered with pharmacy distribution sources to administer the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as it becomes available. An effective, widely distributed vaccine will further improve conditions for a senior housing recovery. We are glad that we have significant embedded exposure to that upside in our diversified portfolio. Today, we published our corporate sustainability report that showcases our longstanding commitment to and leadership in ESG. Among other things, this report discloses our new environmental goals are consistent and growing investments in sustainability improvements in our portfolio, and our principles and practice, which is a series of case studies showing our actions on health and safety and COVID-19 describing our emergency preparedness, and demonstrating our customized framework to achieve greater gender and racial equality and social justice. In closing, let me reiterate that the long-term demographically driven thesis for healthcare real estate and for Ventas remains in place. I'm incredibly proud of our Ventas team. Our consistency and cohesion are great assets for all our stakeholders. All of us at Ventas have an abiding commitment to stay strong and stable and win the recovery. Justin? Good morning, Steve. I'll take that one. I think that, we're very excited about the GIC joint venture. We really believe it's helping us to accelerate our commitment to growing our R&I business and really moving that business forward. Basically, again, we've restarted our Philadelphia development of a significant life science building, we've got these three projects further underway. GIC is a great strategic partner, whether it's with this joint venture or on other potential activities, we're very happy to be partnered with someone of their expertise and quality. And, it gives us a really great way to continue to own a significant portion of those developments and their upside. And move the whole R&I business forward. Right. And the debt piece was about a $400 million, attractive debt piece. Right. Yes. The main point is really, we continue to - we continue to believe in senior housing and think it's an important part of our diversified business model. We definitely are open to recycling capital. The dispositions that I'm talking about are really over a couple hundred million of assets, some of which are sold, some of which are under contract. And those the kind of blended cap rate is around a six. Yes, that's a great question. And I think we were very focused on again, partnering with a strategic partner. For us, this is much more than just about capital, which we can get in a myriad of ways as you can see, but having that strategic partnership and getting compensated with market-based measures, keeping half of the upside certainly. And then, generating as I mentioned in my remarks, additional income and profit sharing that are market-based. They give us a lot of confidence that we not only have a great partner but we are preserving as much of the upside as we move forward. I mean, I think, as I said, we believe in the business, the demographic demand is in front of us, the supply is continuing to improve. So we think there's upside there operationally and in terms of the business, we're benefiting, obviously, from some of the government's financial support, available to assisted living communities under the CARES Act, and we're grateful for that. With that, there certainly could be reporting or other requirements that I think would be appropriate about the clinical record and performance of senior housing, which frankly compares incredibly well, overall to the skilled nursing business, and we welcome that transparency. I'm going to ask Bob to answer that. And again, talking about access to public and private capital. So Bob, can you take that question for Jonathan? Good math, I think that's currently Biden's lead in Georgia. Yes, again, it's a balanced approach, we continue to be active across all capital sourcing. And, it's just like the asset side of the balance sheet. We want to stay disciplined, keep in these different markets. And I think you could make a case either way for the ATM in that size, but we decided it was an appropriate way to fund part of that. And the other part is, as Bob mentioned, with the private capital, and then with asset sales. I'm going to ask Justin to answer that with the overview that of course, we're in a very dynamic environment with the clinical trends nationally and so that's just something to keep in mind as you think about our near-term outlook. Rich, the asset is a essentially new asset that is, leased up to its current 96% area, in a very short period of time, we really liked the asset. And now I'll turn it over to Pete to talk about why we like to ask that. In terms of the capital, I would say the fund was really designed to be a competitive advantage for us in these really highly sought after trophy assets, where there's a huge amount of capital available to acquire them. But the cap rate is something -- in this case, it's a forward cap rate of five that may not always work perfectly in size, with the public capital markets. And so that's why having these different pools of capital is really advantageous for us as we continue to expand our life science footprint. Now just to say one other thing, I mean, we really have from 2016 just incredibly built out this business to a point where it's about 9 million square feet. And not only do we have presence on over 15 major research campuses that represent, like 10% of all the life science, university research in the nation, just our customers, but also, we've been in Cambridge for a couple years now. And so, we're now in two of the largest life science clusters with both Mass Ave that we acquired a couple years ago and now the South San Francisco investment. So those are some of the more capital answers that I would ask Pete to address why we like the portfolio. Thanks, Pete. And yes, the tenants in the work that we did, the tenants really liked the location and the characteristics of the building. So that's kind of proving itself out by the occupancy and leasing activity. Good morning. So, again, in terms of the strategic benefits of this transaction, the stabilized level of cap rates is about seven wins, they're fully leased and developed over time. And as I mentioned, we are keeping 50% of the assets and are generating kind of market based compensation and profit sharing as it relates to the upside. Yes. Great. So I'm going to ask Justin to talk about operations but I just want to remind you that we acquired that asset at below replacement cost. It has been a successful asset in the market for a long time, it's a great physical plant. And in terms of the ground lease reset, we underwrote that quite carefully. And as is always the case, there's a silver lining to everything, and it's quite possible that the current environment and COVID-19 may give us a benefit on the rent reset when it becomes applicable. So Justin, do you want to talk to John about how you see the operations and upside post-COVID in the Battery Park asset in Manhattan. Good. I mean, again, we've now built this really nice business where the capital flows into life sciences are at record highs and with those record highs of capital flows, also demand for the life science, real estate. So we feel really good about getting in the business. And we feel good about being situated now, both with the universities and in the cluster markets of Cambridge and South San Francisco. Obviously, I mentioned that we really like diversification, we know that COVID is affecting different segments of our portfolio differently, currently, life science, including the university based life sciences in great demand. And the universities, in general, as leaders in research with significant government and other funding have continued to pursue research and developments throughout the pandemic. Clearly, if the pandemic continues at really high levels, there are all sorts of potential consequences to that. But we're looking forward to the fact that, frankly, within our buildings and elsewhere, we're hopeful that a vaccine is going to be developed and distributed that is going to help us coupled with a sound public policy, public health response, so that we will be post-pandemic before the academic year begins in 2021. So that's our base case. And in that case, we continue to like the life science business and we continue to be glad that we're associated with these research leaders at these universities. Well, thank you. Yes. I mean, we are grateful that HHS has understood what a crucial role senior living play is for vulnerable older Americans during this pandemic. And my guess is, it's only a guess, obviously, because we don't even know what the results of the election are yet, but with a moderate democratic president, a democratic house and what will certainly be a closely divided Senate, that will push us toward more consistency in policy, more moderation in policy, more likely to be steady as she goes and that's quite a favorable backdrop for Ventas and hopefully for the country as well. You kind of broke up, I am sorry, but could you repeat your question? Yes. Okay. I did hear that. Again, we really like the fact that we do have embedded upside in our business from senior housing. In terms of additional investments, we would obviously look at those investments depending on what their characteristics were. And now we have various tools at our disposal to figure out what would be the customized capital source for that type of acquisition. And the fund is really designed to be an open-end vehicle for core and core plus real estate, that's typically low cap rate, highly stable, low leverage assets, including senior housing. So in the case assets fit that profile, they could obviously be suitable for the funds. To the extent they are more value add or opportunistic, those could either be on balance sheet, and/or you could use some other form of private capital for them. Right now, we do have pension fund capital that really likes to do opportunistic, value add, and ground up development in senior housing. So that's another pocket of capital that we've had available for a while, that we could use for those types of opportunities if we wanted to do so. Yes. And that I'm going to turn that over to Justin, that's really been the key, obviously, of, having move in succeed move out for in which, we've attained as Justin described in October, and then how to gain back the occupancy. So Justin, would you would you take that on? This is Debbie. Look, we're constantly evaluating our capital sourcing, as we've talked about sort of at length this morning. We're really happy to have a variety of ways to source public and private capital, debt capital. If you'll recall, when we launched our fund in March, we actually seeded it with some stabilized R&I and MOB assets at attractive cap rates, as you know, sits at a significant profit. And as I've mentioned, with respect to the R&I development JV, here, we have a strategic partner, we've retained 50% of the assets. And we also have kind of market-based compensation, that all of which together including our retained interest gives us a significant part of the upside while also managing our financial strength and flexibility in our risk profile. So we feel good about that all on balance. And certainly, we can will consistently evaluate the portfolio for capital recycling opportunities and profit-making opportunities of all types. Right. I mean, I would just say that, we're very particular about who we would be partners with. GIC is obviously one of the world's leading real estate investors. We have a good relationship with them. We've known them for a long time. And we the optionality or we like having a relationship with them because we certainly in the case of other types of investments or activities, they could be a good strategic partner for us across asset types. If we felt that that was appropriate. So we think establishing a good relationship with them could benefit our entire enterprise and public stakeholders over time. So that's really a combination of assets that we sold in the third quarter and a portfolio that we have under -- that we have targeted for sale. And they're both triple-net leased assets. And again, you know, very consistent with other market data, and that's based more on sort of current NOI trends in today's environment. Yes. I mean, I think look we had good results, our trends are good. Those trends have been sustained improvement in demand and move in from the nadir of this pandemic, in April, and it's been month-over-month, consistent traction, showing that demand and value propositions for senior living and I think that, it's important to, to take a moment on that and appreciate that and celebrate it. On the other hand, we know that we are in a pandemic, that creates a lot of uncertainty and unpredictability. And so, we want to, we want to discuss the facts, share how really positive what evidence, positive evidence that is of the benefits of the asset class, and what kind of recovery the asset class can have. But at the same time, be humble about the fact that the virus creates unpredictability, as does normal fourth quarter, history, as you mentioned. Well, again, let's not talk about that win, it's the right time to do so. I'll be very happy when we're talking about the flu again, and not COVID. Well, the senior housing is supposed to be a social environment. That's important when we think about the differences between home health and senior housing, but I'm going to turn it over to Justin to take your questions. Hi, Lucas, this is Debbie. That's a very clear answer. So the GIC joint venture is for basically these four projects that are underway, including the UCity development that we started construction on, and we believe that JV again, is going to accelerate our ability to drive this business forward. And there's a handful of identified projects in our pipeline that could go in that JV, full stop. Then, as we talked about, when we launched the open-end fund in March, that is really designed to be able to capture low cap rate, high quality core assets that would be very difficult for Ventas to buy on balance sheet. And at the assist part of the cycle and that's kind of how the segmentation is designed. It gives us lots of options, again, particularly at a time when the public markets may be disrupted as a result of COVID-19. And that creates significant value for our public shareholders and leverages our platform in a very positive way. Sure. I'm going to ask Justin to answer that. Which page so we can... Oh, yes. We like that flag. We will share that with you. It's supposed to show our -- the extent of our NOI in different markets, where there is significant new confirmed cases of COVID, which is shown by the backdrop of green, red and yellow. So where are there more and less kind of COVID cases? Where do we have more or less NOI? And importantly, within those geographies, where do we see move in as a percent of prior year. So for example, you can see that in the New York area, the COVID pandemic confirmed cases are lower, New York is green. You can see we have a lot of NOI there because their bubble is large and that the movements are above 75% of our prior year level. So yes, that's, that's kind of -- we really love this map. And I think it gives investors kind of, especially, in the earlier parts of the pandemic, where there was a little bit of -- and it continues to be a little bit of geographical movement of the virus and how that could be affecting the different markets where we have senior housing operating assets. I have to give Justin credit, it was his --Justin's brainchild that I really like it. Okay. I'm going to turn that over to Justin, and then we'll wrap up. Yes. And thank you for that question, Sarah, because there is a lot of operating leverage that, will be fairly powerful to the upside off of these occupancy levels as Justin said. When we get to the post-pandemic recovery of senior housing and the demographic demand. So that is the end of our call today. I want to sincerely thank everyone for joining us. And, as always, for your interest in and support of Ventas, we are all here working very hard for you. And we're committed to winning the recovery. Thank you and I hope you stay safe. Bye."

Before I hand the call off to Debra A. Cafaro, Chairman and CEO of the company; I\u2019d like to note that we\u2019ve posted an investor presentation this morning on our website, which includes helpful information that the team will reference in our prepared remarks. With those formalities out of the way, I\u2019ll hand it over to Debbie.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Nicely done, Sarah, and thank you. Good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants. And welcome to the Ventas second quarter 2020 earnings call. I sincerely hope that you are safe and healthy and staying positive as the COVID-19 pandemic persists in our country. I\u2019m proud to say that the Ventas team has been cohesive skilled and enormously hard-working as we\u2019ve addressed key issues and weathered the initial storm created by the pandemic. We still have a long way to go, and conditions remain highly uncertain and uneven, but we are encouraged by second quarter performance and trends, which have continued into July. Our enterprise benefited significantly in the second quarter from our long-standing commitment to asset class, operator and geographical diversification. We delivered $0.77 of normalized FFO per share in the quarter, led by our medical office building, research and innovation and health care triple-net business, which collectively represent nearly half of our enterprise. As a result of the pandemic, we recorded a number of non-cash charges in the quarter, primarily focused on senior housing. These items reflect the conditions affecting senior housing we shared with you in late June, and our expectations remain unchanged regarding our business prospects and potential from that point. As expected and consistent with those communications, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected our senior housing financial results in the quarter. Our SHOP portfolio experienced the maximum occupancy impact from mid-March through April, particularly in our large, high quality, high rate, New York and New Jersey communities. Since then, we are heartened to see the resilience of demand for senior living and the recognition of the value our industry provides to seniors and their families. We saw sustained intra-quarter improvement in leads and move-ins and clinical results for our residents that continues into July. Atria has led the way. And as we previously anticipated, operators at virtually all of our communities are currently open to new resident move-ins and the vast majority of our communities are offering residents an enriched living environment. The focus of our operators now is to safely increase move-ins and stabilize occupancy. And then seek to rebuild occupancy towards pre-pandemic level. We are proud of our early and rigorous focus on health and safety, and our leadership in adopting testing protocols to keep seniors and frontline caregivers safe. We have also taken decisive actions during and after the quarter to keep Ventas strong and stable for all those who depend upon us. These include adjusting our cost structure by $25 million to $30 million annualized to further enhance our efficiency and effectiveness while preserving our core competencies of capital raising, investment, asset management and service in the field. Increasing our liquidity, which currently stands at $3.5 billion, and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Conserving capital through the reduction of capital expenditures and our dividend. Taking proactive steps to address the financial impact of the pandemic with our two largest senior housing tenants, Brookdale and Holiday, resulting in mutually beneficial transactions with both large operators. For Holiday, we are pleased that we converted our 26 independent living communities operated by Holiday to SHOP. And we recently announced the deal with Brookdale that provides Ventas shareholders with certainty, flexibility and the opportunity for upside on industry recovery and creates better lease coverage and a stronger tenant. We appreciate our constructive relationship with both companies and management teams, and continuing to advocate for seniors with federal policymakers. Because of the crucial role senior living care providers play in protecting our vulnerable senior population and the impressive clinical record in our industry. We remain respectfully hopeful that HHS will provide much deserved and needed financial support to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. We also continue to explore opportunities to grow our enterprise and our investment team is being active, yet selective. I\u2019d highlight, in particular, the strategic advantage of the open-end fund we successfully launched in March with access to institutional capital and a well-performing core of quality assets under management. The fund is another tool that will enable us to expand our footprint, leverage our team and industry expertise and create value. We also continue our capital allocation focus on our expanding research and innovation business. While the existing R&I portfolio continues to deliver outstanding performance. We also have two major projects well underway with leading research institutions at the University of Arizona and the University of Pittsburgh, both expected to deliver next year. In addition, we just broke ground on Drexel\u2019s academic tower in uCity market of Philadelphia. Together, these three developments represent over $600 million in aggregate investment and are over 80% pre-leased to highly rated tenants. Our team continues to work with our development partner, Westford, to build our pipeline of R&I projects that will be actionable as soon as the time is right. We were pleased to welcome Marguerite Nader to our diverse, independent and experienced Board in July. Marguerite is a top-notch CEO and real estate executive, and we look forward to benefiting from her insights as we move the company through the pandemic and forward. In closing, the long-term demographically driven thesis for healthcare real estate and for Ventas remains in place despite the near-term disruption caused by the pandemic. We see resilient demand and strong performance in our different business lines and have taken decisive actions, so Ventas can successfully navigate through current conditions and capture opportunities. We will continue working together for the benefit of all our stakeholders. And now I\u2019m pleased to ask Justin to discuss our senior housing business.\nJustin Hutchens: Thanks, Debbie. Let me start by noting that we witnessed an impact from COVID-19 on the senior housing industry in the second quarter that is truly unprecedented. That said, I am proud of how our industry came together in a crisis to protect health and safety for the most vulnerable segment of our population. I\u2019d like to publicly acknowledge all the hard work, dedication and skill of our employees, operators, tenants and their teams and frontline care providers for their courageous efforts throughout this pandemic. I\u2019ll start with a quick overview of our results in the SHOP and triple-net portfolio. It seems like agent history, but we began the year and SHOP with a strong first quarter performance with NOI growth of 6% versus fourth quarter 2019 when excluding COVID impacts. The second quarter was a different story as our SHOP operators battled the pandemic. Second quarter 2020 average monthly occupancy came in approximately 470 basis points lower than first quarter average monthly occupancy for our same-store senior living operating portfolio pool. At the end of the second quarter, occupancy stood at 80.6%. COVID-19 related operating expenses totaled $42 million, and after netting $15 million of estimated mitigating cost savings the OpEx impact totaled $27 million, and therefore, total operating expenses grew 3.4% sequentially, which improved from previous expectations. All COVID-19 expenses, including testing, labor and supplies have been reflected in property operating results. RevPOR declined 2.9% sequentially due to the disproportionate clinical impact in New York and New Jersey when these high red four communities were locked down, and occupancy loss was most pronounced in the Northeast. Net-net, as expected, cash NOI for our 390 asset sequential same-store portfolio declined from $165 million in the first quarter to $106 million in the second quarter, a reduction of $59 million. I\u2019ll highlight our Canadian portfolio, which generated 30% of our SHOP NOI. It demonstrates both the benefit of our diversification strategy and a well-orchestrated public health response. Our 68 communities within our sequential Q2 same-store pool, including our recent investment in Le Groupe Maurice, were 94.2% occupied, which compares to an average of 96.3% in the first quarter, outperforming the U.S. on an absolute and relative basis. Additionally, our independent living portfolio more broadly, inclusive partly of Le Groupe Maurice and Holiday Retirement, have demonstrated resilience during the pandemic, significantly outperforming assisted living, specifically, I\u2019d like to highlight our Holiday portfolio. Since converting the SHOP, NOI has approximated 7,000,589 in May and June, representing a 1.1% improvement over prior year and ahead of our pre-COVID budget. Moving to our triple-net senior housing portfolio. In the second quarter and through July, Ventas received all of its expected triple-net senior housing cash rent. Our underlying triple-net portfolio performance broadly followed the same trends as our SHOP portfolio. And as a result, we have been taking actions to proactively address certain leases. I\u2019m really happy we\u2019ve been able to reach mutually beneficial arrangements with Capital Senior Living, Holiday Retirement and Brookdale Senior Living already this year. I really look forward to working with these management teams to optimize each respective portfolio. Now I\u2019ll address recent trends. First and foremost, I am pleased to report that the demand characteristics supporting senior housing remained solid even in the face of the pandemic as we have seen leads and move-ins improved since the low point in April. And it\u2019s important to note, this trend persists in markets that have long since faced the virus such as New York and New Jersey and those that are still experiencing high new cases per day, such as California, Texas, Florida and Arizona. As we reported to investors in June, the key leading indicator of demand is communities loosening restrictions and allowing for a richer resident experience and most crucially, allows structured family visits and small group dining and activities. It is very encouraging to see that 86% of our communities are offering this lifestyle, which with appropriate infection control practices and testing protocols is getting much closer to the pre-COVID living experience. We are pleased to support a proactive industry-leading testing program, including our partnership with Mayo Clinic labs that served as one component of a thoughtful reopening approach and has yielded over 59,000 resident and employee tests to date. In regards to our clinical results, although lessening, we are still facing pockets of increased virus activity, which has caused some of our communities to reverse course and increase restrictions throughout recent weeks. However, as Debbie noted, we currently have the highest number of communities accepting move-ins since the beginning of the pandemic at 96%. New resident cases per day in the Ventas portfolio peaked in April at 26 per day and have averaged only 8 per day in May through July, and thus far in August, we are only averaging 4.5 new resident cases per day. 89% of our communities have either never had a confirmed resident case and/or have not had a case in 14 days. As a reflection of the diligent efforts by our operators, we have continued to see improvement in our leading indicators. We ended July occupancy at 80.1%, which is approximately a 50 basis point decline since June as the deceleration in occupancy decline continues. The improving lead and move-in trend through July also persist. Our move-ins are 72% and our leads are 74% versus prior year, respectively. Our movements, however, have not yet covered are move-outs and therefore resulted in lower occupancy. While we are encouraged by the improving leading indicators and evidence of strong demand drivers and moderating expenses, we do not expect to experience stabilized NOI performance until our move-ins and move-outs level out. All things considered, we are steadily making progress towards a stabilized performance. In summary, we are cautiously optimistic regarding the positive leading indicator trends we are seeing in our senior housing portfolio. The efforts and success of our operators in providing more robust safe living environments for seniors, and the meaningful improvements to move-ins and leading indicators we\u2019ve seen since April. However, we remain measured in our outlook because of the uncertainty of the pandemic, its continuing financial impact on our senior living business and the cost of stabilizing and recapturing occupancy in our communities while focusing on the health and safety of frontline caregivers and residents. With that, I\u2019ll hand the floor to Pete.\nPete Bulgarelli: Thanks, Justin. I\u2019ll cover the office segment second quarter results and trends. Our office segment, which now represents 30% of Ventas\u2019 NOI continues to show its value proposition, financial strength and growth amidst the pandemic. MOBs and research and innovation centers, the two lines of business within our office portfolio, play a key role in the delivery of crucial health care services and research for life-saving vaccines and therapeutics. For the second quarter of 2020, reported office same-store cash NOI increased by 2.7% year-over-year. This outstanding result was led by our R&I portfolio, which grew 14.4%, driven by strong lease-up and with occupancy improving by 500 basis points and rent growth of 6.1%. Strong performance in our university based developments affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania and Washington University fueled our growth. This growth was partially offset by a modest 40 basis point decline in the medical office portfolio. It was driven by a difficult comparison period, lower paid parking receipts and increased cleaning expenses caused by COVID-19. After adjusting for these factors, office and MOB same-store, cash NOI versus prior year would have grown by 5.7% and 2.3%, respectively. These results exceeded our expectations for the quarter. Office occupancy grew by 20 basis points sequentially in the second quarter, with occupancy in our 361 asset sequential same-store pool, reaching 91.4% as of June 30. MOB retention has increased to record levels, at 97% for second quarter of 2020. Total office leasing, which includes renewals and new leasing, was 860,000 square feet for the quarter, and nearly 1.5 million square feet year-to-date. Lab space continues to be in high demand in our R&I portfolio, which is currently 97% leased. This is a clear opportunity area. In terms of rent collections, office tenants paid an industry-leading 99% of contractual rent in the second quarter. This is without D docs for deferrals, which were de minimis. And actually half of those deferrals have already been repaid. Collecting 99% of total rent is a direct reflection of the quality of our tenants and the quality of our buildings. Most tenants have received significant amount of federal support through a variety of programs designed to assist health care providers in small businesses. As an example, we estimate there are top 10 health system tenants have collectively received nearly $3 billion in CARES Act relief and $10 billion in Medicare advance payments. As of August 6, 2020, our tenants have already paid more than 97% of July rents. This is a faster collection pace than experienced during the second quarter. This solid result underscores the durability and quality of our tenant base. 88% of MOB NOI is from investment-grade tenants, or HCA, and 97% of our MOB NOI comes from tenants affiliated with a major health system. For our R&I portfolio, 76% of our revenues are received from investment-grade organizations and publicly listed companies. A very solid foundation. We also saw positive space utilization trends intra-quarter that mirrored admissions and surgery volumes reported by the health systems. For example, in our MOB portfolio, essentially all of our physicians were back to work in June. Patient visits and paid parking activity more than doubled in June from the depths of April. These trends have continued in July, although still below historical levels. All of our MOB buildings are open for business, and 94% of our MOBs are in counties that are restriction free for elective procedures. To ensure the safety of our tenants, their patients and our employees, we have set up screening at certain building entrances and enhance our cleaning protocols. All R&I buildings are also open, supporting multiple critical research organizations in fighting the pandemic. We have 16 major university relationships, all of which anticipate opening in the fall with some level of on-campus in person learning scheduled. Essential field personnel who have continued to serve our tenants on-site through the pandemic have done a terrific job. We\u2019re grateful for their effort and commitment, and we continue to focus on the health and safety of these personnel and our tenants. Finally, I\u2019m pleased to let you know that our doctor center medical office building associated with an Emory Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, play second at the Bauma International Tobi awards in the best renovated all office building category amongst all submissions across the globe, an extraordinary example in utilizing our capital to reinvigorate a well-located medical office building associated with a strong health system. In sum, our occupancy, NOI and cash payment results and trends were outstanding during the second quarter. During this difficult time, we are honored to be caring for the caregivers, the physicians, the hospitals, scientists and researchers who bring hope and comfort to those in need. With that report, I\u2019ll pass the time to Bob.\nBob Probst: Thanks, Pete. I\u2019ll touch on our health care triple-net lease portfolio before I close with some enterprise level commentary. During the second quarter, our health care triple-net assets showed continued strength. As evidenced by receiving 100% of second quarter, July and August rents from our health care triple-net tenants. Acute and post-acute providers have had access to significant government funding to create liquidity and mitigate losses related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In terms of rent coverage through Q1, acute care hospital coverage was a strong 3 times. Nationally, hospital inpatient admissions and surgeries rebounded in Q3 with differences by market. 100% of Ardent\u2019s hospitals are in states or counties that are open for elective procedures. Ardent continues to perform extremely well despite the challenging market conditions. LTACs have proven their value proposition in the pandemic, and census has benefited from the increasing need for hospital capacity due to COVID-19 as well as the ultimate discharge of patients into this important care setting. The majority of this benefit began to accrue in the second quarter, so was not yet reflected in the coverage stats reported today. IRF census initially declined due to lower surgeries and acute care volumes, but census has improved since mid-April and has benefited from rate enhancements. SNFs experienced notably higher mortality rates with census down dramatically and the most profitable rehab patients also down. But have also benefited from significant government support. Turning to our second quarter financial performance. Let me start with Q2 GAAP net income. In the second quarter, we recognized net income of $50 million for the Holiday transaction. And even though our second quarter rent collections were robust across the business, we assess the go-forward collectibility of future rents in the context of COVID. We also took the appropriate step in the quarter of evaluating the values of certain of our assets as a result of the material impact of the pandemic. As a result, we took several noncash charges in the quarter, largely driven by senior housing. First, we wrote down the value of select senior housing real estate assets by $109 million included in D&A. This reduction represents less than half of 1% of our total net real estate asset base of nearly $21 billion. Second, though we collected substantially all of the expected triple-net senior housing rent in the second quarter, we wrote out $54 million of accrued straight-line rent receivables in Q2, primarily representing eight tenants in our triple-net senior housing business and converted those senior housing tenants to a cash basis with annual cash rent of approximately $80 million. Notwithstanding the reserve, we\u2019ll endeavor to collect all our contractual rents going forward. Third, we took a non-cash tax charge in Q2 of $56 million, and fourth, though our loan portfolio is fully current through the second quarter, we took a $40 million allowance for credit losses against our investments in a handful of small loans as well as a charge for unconsolidated entities. I\u2019d note that we did not take credit allowances against our Holiday or Colony loan investments. Before mentioned Holiday transaction and non-cash charges are excluded from our normalized FFO. We provided additional information in our supplemental on Page 35 and in our press release. In terms of normalized FFO per share, we delivered $0.77 in the second quarter versus $0.97 in the first, the $0.20 change was a function of the reduction in SHOP NOI. As we showed you in June, SHOP NOI in the second quarter was, on average, $20 million lower per month than Q1. Our second quarter FFO, same-store NOI and SHOP RevPOR results reflect the full quarter impact of the early and significant loss of SHOP occupancy in March to April in the important high RevPOR New York and New Jersey markets. As Debbie described earlier, we took decisive actions in Q2 to ensure Ventas is in a strong and stable financial position to weather the impact of the pandemic, including adjusting our cost structure, lowering our dividend and enhancing our liquidity. In July, as a result of these actions and a stable capital markets backdrop, we paid down substantially all borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As a result, as of August 5, the company has available liquidity of approximately $3.5 billion, including $2.9 billion of undrawn revolver capacity, $600 million in cash, no commercial paper outstanding and the minimal near-term unfunded obligations. Finally, debt to gross asset value in the second quarter was 37%. I\u2019ll close with a few comments on the third quarter. As Justin described in SHOP, spot occupancy at the end of July is estimated as 80.1%, representing approximately a 50 basis point decline over the course of the month based on interim information provided by Ventas\u2019 operators. This compares to a Q2 average monthly occupancy decline of approximately 150 basis points. If current conditions hold, we expect SHOP occupancy and NOI to sequentially decline in the third quarter albeit at an improved pace versus the $20 million per month average NOI reduction we saw in the second quarter. Nonetheless, the environment remains uncertain. Our operators continued emphasis in Q3 is on keeping residents and staff safe and building leads and move-ins with the goal of stabilizing occupancy. We\u2019ll account for the Brookdale transaction in the third quarter, which we estimate as a $0.02 to $0.03 per quarter impact going forward versus the second quarter results. In Q3, we expect to fully realize the benefits of reducing our G&A cost structure as well as paying down our revolver. To close, this quarter has underscored, like never before, the importance of a diversified model operated by leading providers. We are confident that we have a portfolio, operators and tenants and team to weather this storm. Looking further ahead, health care real estate continues to offer compelling, demographically driven growth potential, and Ventas is well positioned to benefit from these powerful tailwinds. That concludes our prepared remarks. Before we start with Q&A, we are limiting each caller to two questions to be respectful to everyone on the line. Also given the fact we\u2019re still remote, we\u2019ll ask Debbie to act as quarterback for the Q&A and to pass the football to the Ventas team as needed. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to the operator.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.\nMichael Carroll: Yes, thanks. I wanted to talk a little bit about the seniors housing trends, I guess, the leading indicators. It looked like in July, the improvement of up 70% over the prior year is similar to June. Does that mean that the leads trends is flat or are we continuing to see an increase as we go through July and beyond?\nDebra A. Cafaro: Good morning, Mike. Justin will take that one.\nJustin Hutchens: Good morning. So if you look closely at the numbers, you\u2019ll see this is on Page 13 of the investor deck that we shared. The total number is up. So we have 13,000 \u2013 over 13,000 leads in July; we had a little close to 12,500 in June. There was a little bit of slowness around the 4th of July, as reported by our operators. But altogether, we really view this as an improving trend. The percent versus prior year is just there for reference.\nMichael Carroll: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then can we talk a little bit about the move-outs. I mean, honestly, they\u2019re still below the historical trend. Do you expect some of those voluntary move-outs to kind of pick up as we kind of hit the stabilized level kind of as we move through the post COVID environment? Or do you think it will stay low until a vaccine actually comes through?\nJustin Hutchens: Well, in regards to move-outs, they\u2019ve been relatively consistent versus prior year levels, except for the month of April, which we\u2019ve mentioned was driven by New York, New Jersey. And we\u2019re not getting any reports of pent-up move-outs or any really notable drivers that would change the trend. So we expect move-outs really to be relatively stable, absent any external circumstances we\u2019re not aware of today. And the big focus is really just to see leads and ultimately move-ins to overcome the move-outs over time.\nMichael Carroll: Okay, great. Thank you.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question is from Nick Joseph with Citi.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. Debbie, you mentioned the potential continued government support on the senior housing side or kind of the need for it. How do you view the probability, timing and potential structure of any support that could come about?\nDebra A. Cafaro: Well, the industry has a very strong case to tell. Essentially, the senior living care providers care for the largest group of seniors. The vast majority of the seniors are 85 and over, many have significant comorbidities. And importantly, the clinical record of the senior care providers and keeping seniors safe has been far superior than in other sectors that have received significant support. So all of the policy predicates for receiving support from HHS to mitigate the financial costs of the COVID pandemic are there. And really, it\u2019s just a question of continuing to educate the policymakers on those key points and continuing to, again, respectfully request their financial support. And we\u2019re hopeful, but remaining cautious around our outreach.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. And then just on the senior housing portfolio, I think you talked about the sequential same-store pool outperforming. You mentioned LGM for July. What\u2019s the sequential occupancy change for the annual same-store pool, so for the smaller pool? I think you quoted 50 basis points on the sequential side.\nDebra A. Cafaro: I\u2019ll take \u2013 I\u2019ll ask Justin or Bob to take that question.\nBob Probst: I just want to clarify the question. Was that the \u2013 you wanted the year-over-year occupancy change?\nNick Joseph: No, the sequential change in July for the 340 same-store pool that\u2019s on the annual basis because I think the 50 basis points you talked about was for the 390 properties and includes LGM.\nDebra A. Cafaro: It is because the sequential pool contains that. So Nick, we don\u2019t have that broken out, but we can take that offline with you.\nNick Joseph: Thank you.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James.\nJonathan Hughes: Hey, good morning.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Good morning.\nJonathan Hughes: Looking at the slide deck on Page 17 and Bob, I believe you referenced this other triple-net senior housing portfolio in your remarks. What\u2019s the plan there? I know you\u2019re going to try to collect the rents, like you said, but any plans to sell or maybe re-tenant those properties? Just curious about the outlook there.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Thanks. We are really happy. As we\u2019ve said, that we have reached these attractive transactions with our biggest triple-net senior housing operators, Capital Senior, Holiday and Brookdale, and I will turn it over to Justin to address the remaining 40%.\nJustin Hutchens: Thank you, Debbie. This other pool contains many operators. There\u2019s only one operator within it that\u2019s more than 1% of our NOI. The rest \u2013 really, it\u2019s very diverse, too. I mean, they\u2019re diverse from a geographic standpoint, they\u2019re diverse from the standpoint of how the pandemic has impacted performance. There are certainly different product types mixed in. And then there\u2019s also different credit profiles within each of the operators, and they all have slightly different coverage ratios. So there\u2019s a lot of moving parts that we\u2019ve been evaluating. Certainly, it\u2019s something we\u2019ve kept a very close eye on. There are a few operators, in particular, that we\u2019ve been more focused on, and there\u2019s just one that has a little bit more than 1% of the NOI, and that\u2019s had most of our focus, and we anticipate having a resolution with them relatively soon. But I think what\u2019s \u2013 the key takeaway is the bigger and higher priority leases have been addressed already. We have a track record of taking action, and then we have certainly a close eye on all the dynamics I just described to determine any actions we may take moving forward.\nJonathan Hughes: Okay. Fair enough. That\u2019s helpful. And then just one more for me. And I say this with all due respect to you, Debbie, but has the Board discussed succession planning for the day when you maybe decide to take a step back from running the business and laid out who will be filling your shoes. I would just appreciate any color there, if you can share it as the only Board member on the call. Thank you.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Sure. I can tell you that our Board \u2013 we have a great Board. Our Board is very experienced and very independent. Obviously, succession planning, regardless of the tenure or age of a CEO, is one of the core functions of any board, and I can assure you that our Board performs all of its duties in an exceptionally positive and good way, and that would include succession. And I\u2019ve always been really proud of the deep and experienced Ventas team that we have and that we\u2019ve continued to augment this year. So you should feel really good about that.\nJonathan Hughes: Okay, got it. I appreciate the answer. Thanks for the time this morning.\nDebra A. Cafaro: You bet. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rich Anderson with SMBC Global.\nRich Anderson: Thanks, good morning. Bob, you mentioned the $20 million NOI monthly average in decline during the second quarter, and then you thought there would be improvement in the third quarter from that run rate. What does that imply in the third quarter, as you\u2019re looking at this, if you break it out between occupancy and rate?\nBob Probst: You know qualitatively, Rich \u2013 sorry, qualitatively, the story in the third quarter, we expect a sequential decline on occupancy and in the bottom line. And it really will be led by two things that will determine that; one is the pace of the occupancy decline, which we\u2019ve seen good trends there as you see in the deck; and then secondly, RevPOR, and RevPOR is really a function of the pricing environment in the market. Those will be the key drivers. Cost, sequentially, we expect will not be a key driver. It\u2019s really going to be revenue driven. But all in, we expect that sequential decline, the pace of that decline to improve versus that $20 million you referenced.\nRich Anderson: Right. And so I am asking if you can break out the occupancy assumption in that decline. Is it 50 basis points what you\u2019ve been\u2026\nDebra A. Cafaro: Yes. I mean, it\u2019s really going to depend on how August and September play out, Rich.\nRich Anderson: All right. Fair enough. Second question. So listening to your closest peers, PEAK has sort of said their area of growth going forward is more in life science and medical office, Welltower has been more thinking about growing in senior housing. So two different choices there, which is good for investors. You always want choice. Where does Ventas stand on that on a go-forward basis based on the experience you had? Is senior housing still something that you would consider a vital growth area for the company? Or will you sort of turn your attention incrementally elsewhere, not saying you\u2019ll abandon, but just what you\u2019re thinking going forward from this?\nDebra A. Cafaro: Thanks. I mean, obviously, capital allocation is something that\u2019s extremely important. We start out with a view that we price diversification by geography, by asset class, by operator. We found it to be a tremendous strength over a long period of time. Over the past several years, our focus really has been on growing the MOB, life science and R&I development business, and that has been a capital allocation priority and, again, is serving us really well. Our team is active really across sectors, although I would say that we would likely prioritize, again, the life science, R&I development and MOB businesses, while at the same time, I would say we have terrific exposure to upside in senior housing in a variety of ways. It is a significant part of our business. So we\u2019re happy about that for when the business turns, but we would continue to be very selective in our senior housing investments were we to make any at this time.\nRich Anderson: Great color. Thanks, Debbie. Thanks, everyone.\nDebra A. Cafaro: All right. Be well.\nOperator: Our next question is from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.\nVikram Malhotra: Thanks for taking the question. Good morning, everyone. Just maybe first on seniors housing. Thanks for all the color and the detail you provided in the deck, very useful. I just want to understand on Slide 13, where you show kind of the spot point-to-point movements and move-in, move-outs. Typically, does the sort of end of the month benefit from just lower move-outs, meaning is it somewhat sort of contractual when these \u2013 when people move out? And I\u2019m just trying to the 10 bps increase, is it more of a function of \u2013 it seems like move-ins were higher, but I just want to clarify, is it more of a function of move-ins outpacing move-outs or vice versa?\nDebra A. Cafaro: I\u2019m going to ask Justin to take that, and he will school all of us on the operating trends.\nJustin Hutchens: Thank you. The first thing I\u2019d say is it\u2019s not really a direct connection between the chart and the bottom right and the move-ins and move-outs reflected on the left. Move-ins and move-outs are really recorded on a month and the bottom right is really showing a weekly trend. And so if you\u2019re trying to do some math and correlate the two, it\u2019s going to be difficult. But I will point this out, and this hopefully is helpful to you, it\u2019s really an age-old rule in the sector that the vast majority of move-in activity happens on the last day of the month. And then the vast majority of move-out activity happens on the first day of the month. And so that \u2013 as you look across this trend here, and you can see it on a weekly basis, it clearly plays out that way. And that just gives you a feel for how the two work together to ultimately net occupancy.\nVikram Malhotra: Okay, okay. That\u2019s helpful. And just, I guess, second question, still on senior housing, maybe sticking with you, Justin. You\u2019ve talked about the \u2013 you\u2019ve given us a lot of data on the leads. But maybe you can just size the so-called pent-up demand for us maybe as a percent of occupancy, just how should we think about? And how should we think about that in terms of the \u2013 when it impacts? Is it a third quarter impact, assuming everything remains open, is it just a gradual kind of bump to whatever move-in, move-out activity we see? How should we think about this pent-up demand?\nJustin Hutchens: Well, I\u2019ll tell you, the short answer is we really don\u2019t know for sure. And there\u2019s encouraging trends. As we\u2019ve all mentioned, I think the one that I was most encouraged about, quite frankly, was the clinical outcomes. As the U.S. had increases in new cases with COVID-19, our portfolio resisted that trend. And all the credit goes to our operators for protecting the health and safety of all of our residents, and that\u2019s a real credit. But I bring that up because the virus is a bit unpredictable as well, and that\u2019s the big backdrop that we\u2019re facing. We are encouraged, though, by two things; one is the fact that we\u2019re starting to offer a lifestyle within our communities that more residents are attracted to where they can move about and do activities and participate in dining and visit most importantly is that with their loved ones, and we\u2019re really encouraged to see the improvement in leads. So the demand characteristics are improving, and they look good. But it\u2019s a bit too early to start making predictions about additional demand at this stage.\nVikram Malhotra: Okay. But just to clarify, the leads, if we \u2013 I\u2019m just trying to understand the needs-based nature of assisted living, and the independent living is probably a little bit less needs based. But if you take the leads and think about this as a percent of the whole resident population, is that a rough way to think about the occupancy impact, or maybe just help us size it a bit.\nJustin Hutchens: Yes, I\u2019m not really sure how to size it more than what we\u2019ve shown you here. You can see, if you look at Page 13, and then you just look at \u2013 you can see the trend, particularly in the top two boxes, you can see the leads, you can see how the leads are translating into move-ins. The things we look at, we look at conversion ratios, we look at lead volume. And there has been strong conversions in our need based product. Our independent living benefits from longer length of stay. So they\u2019ve had less dependency to maintain occupancy on new move-in traffic. And all of this is working together really to create the outcome that we\u2019ve been reporting. There\u2019s a lot of moving parts in a big diversified portfolio. I don\u2019t know I\u2019m going to place really pinpoint anything more on that point.\nVikram Malhotra: Okay. No worries. I can follow-up. Yes. I think it will be helpful just maybe get a sense of the \u2013 just historically how leads have \u2013 what the conversion rates and just the time line. I\u2019m more just interested in trying to understand, is this \u2013 the lead, is it a six-month thing, is it a 12-month thing or is it just \u2013 historically, at least how long has that conversion taken place? But I can follow-up offline.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.\nNick Yulico: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First question is just going back to this issue of move-ins being still below where they were pre-COVID. And I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s any data that you\u2019re getting from prospective residents on why they\u2019re delaying move-ins and for how long because clearly, you\u2019ve had a rebound off the bottom, but leads, move-ins are still down 20%, 25% versus last year. And I think there\u2019s a lot of debate right now about whether we should be looking at these improvements in move-ins and leads versus the bottom and making an interpretation that there\u2019s going to keep being linear improvement, or the other way to look at it is that you had pent-up demand that you didn\u2019t capture in April, happened in June, July, but structurally, there\u2019s still not as much demand for move-ins as there was a year ago and this could persist because of COVID still being an issue. So is there any way anything you have, you could share with us on that?\nDebra A. Cafaro: Yes. Good question. Let me start and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Justin. So basically, again, as you say, we are encouraged by the sustained improvement in demand that we saw from the April time frame to where we are now. And it has \u2013 I think it\u2019s more in the former category of your question rather than the latter. It\u2019s a need-based business, it\u2019s demographically driven. Obviously, if you just watch the news, there\u2019s going to be a psychological impact on individuals and families willingness and readiness to move-in. And I think that has had an effect. What we are happy about seeing is in places like New York, where that was the epicenter and, obviously, early and where there was a deep psychological and clinical impact of the pandemic, Atria, for example, had a July that was better than it had last July, significantly so, and better than June. So I almost think of it as a time series, where you start to see the virus. At some point, it effects, it then \u2013 we\u2019re a lagging indicator, let me say. And then it may affect move-ins either because of psychology or because the communities are restricted to do move-ins, as Justin said. And then at some point, the cases get under control and improvements are made, communities move back into the green and can offer richer lifestyle and over time, psychology improves, people feel more confident. We have testing protocols. And then you can see an improvement in the trends. And we\u2019re seeing this on a geographical basis operating exactly as I\u2019ve described. Within the U.S. at this time with New York, at this point, starting to show some stronger trends, having been a month or two or three away from the real nadir of the pandemic there. And what\u2019s also encouraging is that in the regions where the virus is more widespread, the south and the west, we\u2019ve learned a lot clinically and treatments are better, protocols are better and, therefore, clinical results are better, which is keeping more communities open to new residents. And so this is a multifaceted situation. As we\u2019ve said, remains uncertain. We have to be very humble in our expectations about our ability to predict the future. But so far, we\u2019re seeing the sustained positive trend. So I hope that puts it in perspective for you and answers your question.\nNick Yulico: Yes. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. My second question is just going back to that straight line rent receivable write-off. I just want to be clear, that \u2013 does that \u2013 the $53 million that\u2019s on Slide 17, does that exclude Holiday and Brookdale and then also, in terms of that rent that was cited here, the $80 million of annual cash rent, did you actually collect 100% of that rent in the second quarter?\nBob Probst: Yes. I\u2019ll take that one. The answer to the first question is Holiday and Brookdale are not in that $53 million. And the second question is, we have collected all of the rents that we expected on these eight tenants. So this is really a go-forward assessment of future rents, meaning that we\u2019re fully current.\nNick Yulico: Okay. So as a note, if we\u2019re just looking at a cash NOI number for the quarter, there\u2019s no adjustments we need to make for those tenants?\nJustin Hutchens: Nothing material now.\nNick Yulico: Okay, thank you.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is from Tayo Okusanya with Mizuho.\nTayo Okusanya: Yes. Good morning, everyone. Bob, it just sounds like excited about difficult season.\nBob Probst: Debbie is more excited.\nTayo Okusanya: All right. So my first question is really around the senior housing portfolio, both SHOP and triple-net. So you\u2019ve adjusted the Holiday and Brookdale leases. You\u2019ve moved some of the smaller tenants to a cash basis. So it sounds like a lot of things people were expecting to happen have happened. The two things I wanted to focus on. First of all, ESL that you guys have kind of indicated a couple of quarters ago seems to be struggling more so than some of the other SHOP operators. Is anything being done at that end to kind of improve things at ESL? And second of all, further diversification of the SHOP portfolio operator group. Any update on that.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Justin?\nJustin Hutchens: Good morning. Let me start with ESL, and I\u2019ll revisit a comment I made on the last earnings call where I referenced the improvement \u2013 the sequential improvement in first quarter performance versus the fourth quarter, and ESL was a contributor to that improvement. So that was a good indicator. Certainly, they have \u2013 it\u2019s a relatively young company, but it\u2019s a company that has strengthened their management team. They have a lot of experience at the senior management level. And we\u2019ve observed really good steps that they\u2019ve made to strengthen the company and the platform. We\u2019ve also noted that during this pandemic, which obviously completely changes the performance profile of every company, that they\u2019ve done really well. They\u2019ve navigated the pandemic well and just as well as the rest of our operators in the portfolio, and we\u2019re very pleased and very proud of the ESL management team for their contributions. In regards to the second part, in terms of diversification, the SHOP operating platform, really, where we\u2019ve been focused in this stage of the pandemic is supporting existing operators in every way that we can. We\u2019ve been a little less forward-looking as we\u2019ve been dealing with the leases that you mentioned, and we\u2019ve been giving a lot of support to the SHOP operating platform. So that\u2019s where our focus has been at this time.\nTayo Okusanya: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. My second question is around leverage at about net debt to EBITDA, that\u2019s a little bit higher than your peers. Just kind of curious, target leverage for the company and any other additional plans going forward to delever, whether it\u2019s naturally by an improvement in EBITDA growth post-pandemic, or how do you kind of think about leverage overall in regards to our target leverage ratio?\nDebra A. Cafaro: Well, that would be our first choice, it\u2019s improving EBITDA. I\u2019ll turn it over to Bob to answer.\nBob Probst: Right. That\u2019s plan A. This is the same question, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re asking everybody in the REIT sector Tayo, because we\u2019re all seeing the same sorts of leverage pressure just toward the EBITDA degradation, which ultimately we believe is timing. And we believe in the stabilization and the recovery in senior housing, particularly, and so that\u2019s the key. In the meantime, the focus is on liquidity, first and foremost, and we\u2019re in a great spot there. We remain committed to a strong balance sheet. We have a long track record of being within that 5 to 6 times range. And when we\u2019ve gone out, we found a way back in for net debt to EBITDA. So it\u2019s I\u2019m sure a conversation in every boardroom, but is really a timing issue in my mind.\nTayo Okusanya: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just if you could indulge me with one more question. Again, acquisitions, right now, again, not a lot going on industry-wide. But can you just kind of tell us a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing out there, cap rates for some of your major kind of sector you\u2019re interested in, is that changing? Is that moving? Is nothing really happening?\nDebra A. Cafaro: You\u2019re an abuser, but I\u2019ll give you one tidbit. So I mean, obviously, we\u2019re very pleased that we got into the life science business and have expanded that part of our business, and have a longstanding commitment to hospital affiliated medical office buildings, mostly on-campus, as Pete described. And the cap rates for research and innovation or life science have continued to stay strong and, in many cases, have even strengthened further. So that\u2019s a little tidbit for you that has enhanced the value of our portfolio.\nTayo Okusanya: Great, thank you.\nDebra A. Cafaro: All right.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nJordan Sadler: Thank you. Good morning, and I will keep it to the two questions, for sure. First, I wanted to follow-up on the triple-net seniors housing business. In the business update on Page 17, there is a reference to the other \u2013 all other triple-net tenants at 1.3 times EBITDARM through 1Q. So I\u2019m assuming, given the performance mirrors what you\u2019re seeing in the SHOP portfolio, that continues to dip, and that\u2019s probably what precipitated the write-offs. But any incremental color you can give us around what those write-offs portend for the $80 million of annual rent for those eight tenants or for the rest of that portfolio?\nDebra A. Cafaro: So again, that\u2019s about $170 million of cash rent. It\u2019s all relatively small tenants, as Justin said. These tenants are performing on an aggregate basis, substantially better than the capital senior Brookdale and Holiday tenants were prior to the pandemic. They certainly will feel the same pressures of the sector that the SHOP operators are feeling directionally, but may have different credit profiles, different geographies, different business models, et cetera, that could make the outcomes vary. And also, I would just say that really, the outcomes are going to be really dependent upon basically, what the trajectory of the property performance is going forward, whether there is some kind of government relief for the industry, what the credit support that we have for the individual leases is and, obviously, where the pandemic goes. And so I think we\u2019ve really demonstrated a commitment to being decisive and proactive, creative, whatever word you want to use, and you have our commitment to continue to do so. But as Bob said, we will continue to try to collect our rents.\nJordan Sadler: Okay. That\u2019s fair. And then Bob, I believe you did touch base on the Colony loan, I heard a mention, but I think the $40 million allowance was unrelated to that. Can you maybe speak to what the assessment is of the Colony loan at this point?\nDebra A. Cafaro: Bob, I\u2019ll take that. I mean, that\u2019s correct. It was not in the $40 million. And the Colony loan is a LIBOR-based loan, and there continues to be, for the time being, very significant cushion between the cash flow of the collateral and the debt service.\nJordan Sadler: Okay. Thank you.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. I guess I\u2019m curious to hear you\u2019ve had any communities that maybe went from that kind of red like restricting move-ins to green where they\u2019re allowing move-ins to back now that COVID cases are rising across the country?\nDebra A. Cafaro: We \u2013 as Justin said, we are glad that in the greens and even yellow, we have record levels of communities now offering the richer environment to seniors really since the beginning of the pandemic. And Justin, can you talk about the movement that we\u2019ve seen perhaps as the virus has moved in the country?\nJustin Hutchens: Sure. So if you we were to talk about the month of July, one way to look at this is that 99% of our communities, at any given time, were open; and 1% were not taking move-ins. But even within that, there was movement, and among the segments there was movement. So frankly, I think there\u2019s around 30 communities that actually moved backwards among the segments. But then we had just as many or close as many approved. So there is a little bit of movement back and forth. But very few communities, quite frankly, that are involved in the movement throughout the month of July, and the net result, of course, is very positive to see the vast majority of the portfolio offering the more robust lifestyle.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay, thank you. Okay, sounds like the rising COVID cases hasn\u2019t been a big impact. And then maybe touching base on expenses going forward, how should we think about operators\u2019 ability to flex labor? I\u2019m assuming a lot of folks cut their marketing budgets. What are the kind of expectations for ramping that back up? And maybe how that might impact move-ins and leads going forward?\nDebra A. Cafaro: Bob, do you want to take that?\nBob Probst: Sure. Kind of a gas and clutch answer, I think, to that question because, again, we saw $42 million of direct COVID costs in the second \u2013 labor and supplies and PP&E and so on. And we expect just because of the protocol necessary to keep residents safe, and we\u2019re going to continue to see that kind of expense. At the same time, some of the offset, and this really was better than we had expected from the last time we talked, was on other mitigating costs. And you mentioned, for example, sales and marketing costs which, again, as you have more communities in segments one and two, we\u2019ll have less marketing costs. So I would expect as we have more activity on the sales side, you\u2019ll see some increase in the costs there. Meanwhile, we can begin to dampen some of the pressure on the direct costs just because per unit costs are going down and are managing the labor very efficiently. So I mentioned earlier to a question of kind of flattish, if I thought about sequential OpEx, and it\u2019s really that gas and clutch phenomenon that\u2019s driving that.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Got it, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is Steve Valiquette with Barclays .\nSteve Valiquette: Hey, thanks. Good morning, Debbie, and Bob, thanks for taking the questions.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Good morning.\nSteve Valiquette: So I just had a couple on the Brookdale restructuring. First, I guess, it seemed to us that Ventas was focused on gaining some liquidity as part of that restructured Brookdale agreement with the $235 million of upfront consideration. So I guess, first, I\u2019m wondering if you can just speak to a little more of your thoughts on wanting to gain some upfront cash as opposed to maybe absorbing a smaller rent reduction unless that\u2019s the nearest characterization, of course, and then I\u2019ll have an accounting follow-up question on Brookdale after this one.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Sure thing. So we think the Brookdale deal is a really well balanced, thoughtful structure that\u2019s really customized to create some significant key benefits for Ventas, of course, but also for Brookdale. So we are trying to balance creating certainty for our shareholders, a sustainable rent stream and that\u2019s really important over the \u2013 as we still \u2013 and the industry still is combating COVID. We wanted to create significant opportunity for upside, which we did through the 8% warrant in Brookdale, so that we have the opportunity to hear an industry recovery and, in particular, at Brookdale, not only on our own portfolio, but also on their own portfolio, so a broader-based upside participation opportunity. And of course, getting the cash upfront and all the upfront consideration really replaces over 2.5 years of the cash rent reduction that we gave. And so we thought that was really great. And in the meanwhile, we did improve lease coverage and we created a better, stronger, more stable tenant overall. And that was really a very thoughtful, again, I think, very mutually beneficial type of transaction that accomplished the objectives of both companies.\nSteve Valiquette: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then the accounting question around this separate from the rent reduction, you had that statement in the press release that Ventas expects to recognize the full value of the upfront consideration from Brookdale ratably over the remaining base term of lease.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Correct.\nSteve Valiquette: I just want to confirm, as you divide that $235 million and recognize that, presumably, I guess, quarterly over the next five years or so, will that show up in one of the other income lines as opposed to property revenue? I\u2019m assuming it will still flow into NOI, but I just want to make sure I understand which line that will flow into. Thanks.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Great question. I\u2019m going to hand that over to Bob.\nBob Probst: Yes, it\u2019s treated as deferred revenue flowing through NOI, so that \u2013 and amortized over the remaining period of at least 5.5 years.\nDebra A. Cafaro: I think of it as prepaid rent, but they won\u2019t let me write it that way, but that\u2019s sort of what I think about.\nSteve Valiquette: So will it show up as property revenue, though, in terms of how we should think about it?\nBob Probst: Yes.\nSteve Valiquette: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Okay, thank you.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Lukas Hartwich with Green Street Advisors.\nLukas Hartwich: Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you could go a little bit deeper into MOB performance this quarter.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Thank you, Lukas. I know that Pete Bulgarelli has been awaiting that question. So Pete, I\u2019m going to turn it over to you.\nPete Bulgarelli: Yes. Thanks so much, Lukas for asking a question. Appreciate that. Yes. So this quarter, we\u2019re actually very happy with the MOB performance, particularly given COVID condition. We have a substantial amount of paid parking that took, as you might not be surprised, a hit in the second quarter. We were down in paid parking by over $2.6 million for the quarter. In addition, we had premium cleaning costs. Our protocol was when we were aware of someone walking through our building, a patient walking through a building, who is COVID positive, we would do a deep clean in the premises as well as the lobbies in all common areas. So there is substantial cleaning costs. And then in addition, in the second quarter of 2019, we had some fairly large offsets on the operating expenses, such as real estate tax appeals that came in during the second quarter. So it was a poor comparison; tough comparison in the second quarter on the expense line. Does that answer your question?\nLukas Hartwich: Yes. Perfect, yes. And then sorry, my next question is on senior housing, but\u2026\nPete Bulgarelli: I\u2019m just curious.\nLukas Hartwich: I\u2019m curious what your senior housing operators in terms of how they\u2019re preparing for the fall. Are they preparing to go back into quarantine mode? Or how are they thinking about it? I understand there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty, but I\u2019m just curious how they\u2019re preparing for it.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Good question. We sit here at the beginning of August, and there\u2019s obviously a lot of uncertainty in schools and other types of settings. And I\u2019ll ask Justin to really comment on what the operators are doing as it relates to the fall protocol.\nJustin Hutchens: Thank you, Debbie. The one thing I would just point to is just the approaches that our operators have used to keep our residents safe. And you actually see it in investor deck on Page 15 it falls into three categories; there\u2019s screening, which is something as a practice, they really started it right way, and then you\u2019re familiar with daily temperature checks and symptom screening and the health questionnaires that happen; and then the protecting, which has to do with social distancing and PPE and resident cohorts and cleaning and disinfecting; and then testing has been widely utilized across our operators as well. So all of those have been \u2013 things have been working together to create an environment that is safe for our residents and our employees. And as you can see, really from everything we\u2019ve shared and both on the call and through the materials, so that the results have been good. And so as long as those trends persist, we would expect to see communities open and accepting move-ins and allowing for residents to move about safely among \u2013 in the community and have visitation with relatives that is really, really important to the residents and \u2013 but done so in a very safe way in a restricted manner. So at this time, the trend really is leaning more towards opening. And certainly, as we\u2019ve seen in our own portfolio, that if there is a new infection or new infections that find their way into a community, they may reverse course a bit. But the overwhelming trend has really been more towards opening at this point.\nDebra A. Cafaro: And it\u2019s also going to be interesting to see whether all of the processes that have been adopted and the heightened sensitivity is really going to have any measurable positive effects on the spread of influenza in the fall. And we don\u2019t yet know that, there are various hypotheses floating around, but that will be an interesting \u2013 it will be an interesting test case this year to see whether that shows better trends than usual. So we\u2019ll have to wait and see on that.\nLukas Hartwich: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Thank you.\nOperator: And our final question comes from the line of Sarah Tan with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nSarah Tan: Hi, this is Sarah on for Mike Mueller. The question is for Justin. Just wondering how sensitive has the move-in and tour trends been trending in markets where you see virus flareups and has progress stall when that happened?\nJustin Hutchens: That\u2019s a great question. And if you can look at \u2013 if you look at the deck we provided, if you go to Page 14 then you can see that we\u2019ve included a map that describes what I\u2019m going to tell you. And that is that the \u2013 to Debbie\u2019s point earlier, where we had the most impact really from the virus in the early stages was in New York and New Jersey. But the virus peak in that geography is well behind us as well. And the highest lead and move-in trend right now in recent weeks is really in the northeast, primarily in New York and New Jersey. But having said that, away from that outlier, it\u2019s very consistently improving all across the country. And you can see it as we reflect it, we have the size of the circle on this page that reflects the NOI concentration. The color really reflects that \u2013 the state is reflecting the number of new cases per 100,000 population and the general population. So it indicates whether or not there\u2019s increased virus spread in the general population. And then the color of the circle is really about the move-in versus prior year. And you can see there\u2019s a lot of green circles and irregardless of what\u2019s happening externally with the virus. And that\u2019s an indicator of the demand for our services. And as I said, we\u2019re seeing that across all geographies.\nDebra A. Cafaro: And part of it also is the ability of the buildings to stay in the more rich resident experience, which encourages move-ins. And again, that\u2019s a very \u2013 it\u2019s a very unpredictable trend and communities, as Justin said, are moving in and out of this frequently and depending on virus activity. But overall, I think the math presents the right picture at this moment in time. But again, we want to be cautious and humble about the predictive abilities going forward. So if there are no further questions, I really want to thank everyone for their attendance today for their interest in our company, for their participation. And I hope you and yours stay vigilant and safe, and we look forward to seeing you on the other side of this thing. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you again for joining us today. This does conclude today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Bob Probst",
            "content": "Thanks, Pete. I'll touch on our health care triple-net lease portfolio before I close with some enterprise level commentary. During the second quarter, our health care triple-net assets showed continued strength. As evidenced by receiving 100% of second quarter, July and August rents from our health care triple-net tenants. Acute and post-acute providers have had access to significant government funding to create liquidity and mitigate losses related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In terms of rent coverage through Q1, acute care hospital coverage was a strong 3 times. Nationally, hospital inpatient admissions and surgeries rebounded in Q3 with differences by market. 100% of Ardent's hospitals are in states or counties that are open for elective procedures. Ardent continues to perform extremely well despite the challenging market conditions. LTACs have proven their value proposition in the pandemic, and census has benefited from the increasing need for hospital capacity due to COVID-19 as well as the ultimate discharge of patients into this important care setting. The majority of this benefit began to accrue in the second quarter, so was not yet reflected in the coverage stats reported today. IRF census initially declined due to lower surgeries and acute care volumes, but census has improved since mid-April and has benefited from rate enhancements. SNFs experienced notably higher mortality rates with census down dramatically and the most profitable rehab patients also down. But have also benefited from significant government support. Turning to our second quarter financial performance. Let me start with Q2 GAAP net income. In the second quarter, we recognized net income of $50 million for the Holiday transaction. And even though our second quarter rent collections were robust across the business, we assess the go-forward collectibility of future rents in the context of COVID. We also took the appropriate step in the quarter of evaluating the values of certain of our assets as a result of the material impact of the pandemic. As a result, we took several noncash charges in the quarter, largely driven by senior housing. First, we wrote down the value of select senior housing real estate assets by $109 million included in D&A. This reduction represents less than half of 1% of our total net real estate asset base of nearly $21 billion. Second, though we collected substantially all of the expected triple-net senior housing rent in the second quarter, we wrote out $54 million of accrued straight-line rent receivables in Q2, primarily representing eight tenants in our triple-net senior housing business and converted those senior housing tenants to a cash basis with annual cash rent of approximately $80 million. Notwithstanding the reserve, we'll endeavor to collect all our contractual rents going forward. Third, we took a non-cash tax charge in Q2 of $56 million, and fourth, though our loan portfolio is fully current through the second quarter, we took a $40 million allowance for credit losses against our investments in a handful of small loans as well as a charge for unconsolidated entities. I'd note that we did not take credit allowances against our Holiday or Colony loan investments. Before mentioned Holiday transaction and non-cash charges are excluded from our normalized FFO. We provided additional information in our supplemental on Page 35 and in our press release. In terms of normalized FFO per share, we delivered $0.77 in the second quarter versus $0.97 in the first, the $0.20 change was a function of the reduction in SHOP NOI. As we showed you in June, SHOP NOI in the second quarter was, on average, $20 million lower per month than Q1. Our second quarter FFO, same-store NOI and SHOP RevPOR results reflect the full quarter impact of the early and significant loss of SHOP occupancy in March to April in the important high RevPOR New York and New Jersey markets. As Debbie described earlier, we took decisive actions in Q2 to ensure Ventas is in a strong and stable financial position to weather the impact of the pandemic, including adjusting our cost structure, lowering our dividend and enhancing our liquidity. In July, as a result of these actions and a stable capital markets backdrop, we paid down substantially all borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As a result, as of August 5, the company has available liquidity of approximately $3.5 billion, including $2.9 billion of undrawn revolver capacity, $600 million in cash, no commercial paper outstanding and the minimal near-term unfunded obligations. Finally, debt to gross asset value in the second quarter was 37%. I'll close with a few comments on the third quarter. As Justin described in SHOP, spot occupancy at the end of July is estimated as 80.1%, representing approximately a 50 basis point decline over the course of the month based on interim information provided by Ventas' operators. This compares to a Q2 average monthly occupancy decline of approximately 150 basis points. If current conditions hold, we expect SHOP occupancy and NOI to sequentially decline in the third quarter albeit at an improved pace versus the $20 million per month average NOI reduction we saw in the second quarter. Nonetheless, the environment remains uncertain. Our operators continued emphasis in Q3 is on keeping residents and staff safe and building leads and move-ins with the goal of stabilizing occupancy. We'll account for the Brookdale transaction in the third quarter, which we estimate as a $0.02 to $0.03 per quarter impact going forward versus the second quarter results. In Q3, we expect to fully realize the benefits of reducing our G&A cost structure as well as paying down our revolver. To close, this quarter has underscored, like never before, the importance of a diversified model operated by leading providers. We are confident that we have a portfolio, operators and tenants and team to weather this storm. Looking further ahead, health care real estate continues to offer compelling, demographically driven growth potential, and Ventas is well positioned to benefit from these powerful tailwinds. That concludes our prepared remarks. Before we start with Q&A, we are limiting each caller to two questions to be respectful to everyone on the line. Also given the fact we're still remote, we'll ask Debbie to act as quarterback for the Q&A and to pass the football to the Ventas team as needed. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator. I just want to clarify the question. Was that the \u2013 you wanted the year-over-year occupancy change? You know qualitatively, Rich \u2013 sorry, qualitatively, the story in the third quarter, we expect a sequential decline on occupancy and in the bottom line. And it really will be led by two things that will determine that; one is the pace of the occupancy decline, which we've seen good trends there as you see in the deck; and then secondly, RevPOR, and RevPOR is really a function of the pricing environment in the market. Those will be the key drivers. Cost, sequentially, we expect will not be a key driver. It's really going to be revenue driven. But all in, we expect that sequential decline, the pace of that decline to improve versus that $20 million you referenced. Yes. I'll take that one. The answer to the first question is Holiday and Brookdale are not in that $53 million. And the second question is, we have collected all of the rents that we expected on these eight tenants. So this is really a go-forward assessment of future rents, meaning that we're fully current. Debbie is more excited. Right. That's plan A. This is the same question, I'm sure you're asking everybody in the REIT sector Tayo, because we're all seeing the same sorts of leverage pressure just toward the EBITDA degradation, which ultimately we believe is timing. And we believe in the stabilization and the recovery in senior housing, particularly, and so that's the key. In the meantime, the focus is on liquidity, first and foremost, and we're in a great spot there. We remain committed to a strong balance sheet. We have a long track record of being within that 5 to 6 times range. And when we've gone out, we found a way back in for net debt to EBITDA. So it's I'm sure a conversation in every boardroom, but is really a timing issue in my mind. Sure. Kind of a gas and clutch answer, I think, to that question because, again, we saw $42 million of direct COVID costs in the second \u2013 labor and supplies and PP&E and so on. And we expect just because of the protocol necessary to keep residents safe, and we're going to continue to see that kind of expense. At the same time, some of the offset, and this really was better than we had expected from the last time we talked, was on other mitigating costs. And you mentioned, for example, sales and marketing costs which, again, as you have more communities in segments one and two, we'll have less marketing costs. So I would expect as we have more activity on the sales side, you'll see some increase in the costs there. Meanwhile, we can begin to dampen some of the pressure on the direct costs just because per unit costs are going down and are managing the labor very efficiently. So I mentioned earlier to a question of kind of flattish, if I thought about sequential OpEx, and it's really that gas and clutch phenomenon that's driving that. Yes, it's treated as deferred revenue flowing through NOI, so that \u2013 and amortized over the remaining period of at least 5.5 years. Yes."

            "name": "Justin Hutchens",
            "content": "Thanks, Debbie. Let me start by noting that we witnessed an impact from COVID-19 on the senior housing industry in the second quarter that is truly unprecedented. That said, I am proud of how our industry came together in a crisis to protect health and safety for the most vulnerable segment of our population. I'd like to publicly acknowledge all the hard work, dedication and skill of our employees, operators, tenants and their teams and frontline care providers for their courageous efforts throughout this pandemic. I'll start with a quick overview of our results in the SHOP and triple-net portfolio. It seems like agent history, but we began the year and SHOP with a strong first quarter performance with NOI growth of 6% versus fourth quarter 2019 when excluding COVID impacts. The second quarter was a different story as our SHOP operators battled the pandemic. Second quarter 2020 average monthly occupancy came in approximately 470 basis points lower than first quarter average monthly occupancy for our same-store senior living operating portfolio pool. At the end of the second quarter, occupancy stood at 80.6%. COVID-19 related operating expenses totaled $42 million, and after netting $15 million of estimated mitigating cost savings the OpEx impact totaled $27 million, and therefore, total operating expenses grew 3.4% sequentially, which improved from previous expectations. All COVID-19 expenses, including testing, labor and supplies have been reflected in property operating results. RevPOR declined 2.9% sequentially due to the disproportionate clinical impact in New York and New Jersey when these high red four communities were locked down, and occupancy loss was most pronounced in the Northeast. Net-net, as expected, cash NOI for our 390 asset sequential same-store portfolio declined from $165 million in the first quarter to $106 million in the second quarter, a reduction of $59 million. I'll highlight our Canadian portfolio, which generated 30% of our SHOP NOI. It demonstrates both the benefit of our diversification strategy and a well-orchestrated public health response. Our 68 communities within our sequential Q2 same-store pool, including our recent investment in Le Groupe Maurice, were 94.2% occupied, which compares to an average of 96.3% in the first quarter, outperforming the U.S. on an absolute and relative basis. Additionally, our independent living portfolio more broadly, inclusive partly of Le Groupe Maurice and Holiday Retirement, have demonstrated resilience during the pandemic, significantly outperforming assisted living, specifically, I'd like to highlight our Holiday portfolio. Since converting the SHOP, NOI has approximated 7,000,589 in May and June, representing a 1.1% improvement over prior year and ahead of our pre-COVID budget. Moving to our triple-net senior housing portfolio. In the second quarter and through July, Ventas received all of its expected triple-net senior housing cash rent. Our underlying triple-net portfolio performance broadly followed the same trends as our SHOP portfolio. And as a result, we have been taking actions to proactively address certain leases. I'm really happy we've been able to reach mutually beneficial arrangements with Capital Senior Living, Holiday Retirement and Brookdale Senior Living already this year. I really look forward to working with these management teams to optimize each respective portfolio. Now I'll address recent trends. First and foremost, I am pleased to report that the demand characteristics supporting senior housing remained solid even in the face of the pandemic as we have seen leads and move-ins improved since the low point in April. And it's important to note, this trend persists in markets that have long since faced the virus such as New York and New Jersey and those that are still experiencing high new cases per day, such as California, Texas, Florida and Arizona. As we reported to investors in June, the key leading indicator of demand is communities loosening restrictions and allowing for a richer resident experience and most crucially, allows structured family visits and small group dining and activities. It is very encouraging to see that 86% of our communities are offering this lifestyle, which with appropriate infection control practices and testing protocols is getting much closer to the pre-COVID living experience. We are pleased to support a proactive industry-leading testing program, including our partnership with Mayo Clinic labs that served as one component of a thoughtful reopening approach and has yielded over 59,000 resident and employee tests to date. In regards to our clinical results, although lessening, we are still facing pockets of increased virus activity, which has caused some of our communities to reverse course and increase restrictions throughout recent weeks. However, as Debbie noted, we currently have the highest number of communities accepting move-ins since the beginning of the pandemic at 96%. New resident cases per day in the Ventas portfolio peaked in April at 26 per day and have averaged only 8 per day in May through July, and thus far in August, we are only averaging 4.5 new resident cases per day. 89% of our communities have either never had a confirmed resident case and/or have not had a case in 14 days. As a reflection of the diligent efforts by our operators, we have continued to see improvement in our leading indicators. We ended July occupancy at 80.1%, which is approximately a 50 basis point decline since June as the deceleration in occupancy decline continues. The improving lead and move-in trend through July also persist. Our move-ins are 72% and our leads are 74% versus prior year, respectively. Our movements, however, have not yet covered are move-outs and therefore resulted in lower occupancy. While we are encouraged by the improving leading indicators and evidence of strong demand drivers and moderating expenses, we do not expect to experience stabilized NOI performance until our move-ins and move-outs level out. All things considered, we are steadily making progress towards a stabilized performance. In summary, we are cautiously optimistic regarding the positive leading indicator trends we are seeing in our senior housing portfolio. The efforts and success of our operators in providing more robust safe living environments for seniors, and the meaningful improvements to move-ins and leading indicators we've seen since April. However, we remain measured in our outlook because of the uncertainty of the pandemic, its continuing financial impact on our senior living business and the cost of stabilizing and recapturing occupancy in our communities while focusing on the health and safety of frontline caregivers and residents. With that, I'll hand the floor to Pete. Good morning. So if you look closely at the numbers, you'll see this is on Page 13 of the investor deck that we shared. The total number is up. So we have 13,000 \u2013 over 13,000 leads in July; we had a little close to 12,500 in June. There was a little bit of slowness around the 4th of July, as reported by our operators. But altogether, we really view this as an improving trend. The percent versus prior year is just there for reference. Well, in regards to move-outs, they've been relatively consistent versus prior year levels, except for the month of April, which we've mentioned was driven by New York, New Jersey. And we're not getting any reports of pent-up move-outs or any really notable drivers that would change the trend. So we expect move-outs really to be relatively stable, absent any external circumstances we're not aware of today. And the big focus is really just to see leads and ultimately move-ins to overcome the move-outs over time. Thank you, Debbie. This other pool contains many operators. There's only one operator within it that's more than 1% of our NOI. The rest \u2013 really, it's very diverse, too. I mean, they're diverse from a geographic standpoint, they're diverse from the standpoint of how the pandemic has impacted performance. There are certainly different product types mixed in. And then there's also different credit profiles within each of the operators, and they all have slightly different coverage ratios. So there's a lot of moving parts that we've been evaluating. Certainly, it's something we've kept a very close eye on. There are a few operators, in particular, that we've been more focused on, and there's just one that has a little bit more than 1% of the NOI, and that's had most of our focus, and we anticipate having a resolution with them relatively soon. But I think what's \u2013 the key takeaway is the bigger and higher priority leases have been addressed already. We have a track record of taking action, and then we have certainly a close eye on all the dynamics I just described to determine any actions we may take moving forward. Thank you. The first thing I'd say is it's not really a direct connection between the chart and the bottom right and the move-ins and move-outs reflected on the left. Move-ins and move-outs are really recorded on a month and the bottom right is really showing a weekly trend. And so if you're trying to do some math and correlate the two, it's going to be difficult. But I will point this out, and this hopefully is helpful to you, it's really an age-old rule in the sector that the vast majority of move-in activity happens on the last day of the month. And then the vast majority of move-out activity happens on the first day of the month. And so that \u2013 as you look across this trend here, and you can see it on a weekly basis, it clearly plays out that way. And that just gives you a feel for how the two work together to ultimately net occupancy. Well, I'll tell you, the short answer is we really don't know for sure. And there's encouraging trends. As we've all mentioned, I think the one that I was most encouraged about, quite frankly, was the clinical outcomes. As the U.S. had increases in new cases with COVID-19, our portfolio resisted that trend. And all the credit goes to our operators for protecting the health and safety of all of our residents, and that's a real credit. But I bring that up because the virus is a bit unpredictable as well, and that's the big backdrop that we're facing. We are encouraged, though, by two things; one is the fact that we're starting to offer a lifestyle within our communities that more residents are attracted to where they can move about and do activities and participate in dining and visit most importantly is that with their loved ones, and we're really encouraged to see the improvement in leads. So the demand characteristics are improving, and they look good. But it's a bit too early to start making predictions about additional demand at this stage. Yes, I'm not really sure how to size it more than what we've shown you here. You can see, if you look at Page 13, and then you just look at \u2013 you can see the trend, particularly in the top two boxes, you can see the leads, you can see how the leads are translating into move-ins. The things we look at, we look at conversion ratios, we look at lead volume. And there has been strong conversions in our need based product. Our independent living benefits from longer length of stay. So they've had less dependency to maintain occupancy on new move-in traffic. And all of this is working together really to create the outcome that we've been reporting. There's a lot of moving parts in a big diversified portfolio. I don't know I'm going to place really pinpoint anything more on that point. Nothing material now. Good morning. Let me start with ESL, and I'll revisit a comment I made on the last earnings call where I referenced the improvement \u2013 the sequential improvement in first quarter performance versus the fourth quarter, and ESL was a contributor to that improvement. So that was a good indicator. Certainly, they have \u2013 it's a relatively young company, but it's a company that has strengthened their management team. They have a lot of experience at the senior management level. And we've observed really good steps that they've made to strengthen the company and the platform. We've also noted that during this pandemic, which obviously completely changes the performance profile of every company, that they've done really well. They've navigated the pandemic well and just as well as the rest of our operators in the portfolio, and we're very pleased and very proud of the ESL management team for their contributions. In regards to the second part, in terms of diversification, the SHOP operating platform, really, where we've been focused in this stage of the pandemic is supporting existing operators in every way that we can. We've been a little less forward-looking as we've been dealing with the leases that you mentioned, and we've been giving a lot of support to the SHOP operating platform. So that's where our focus has been at this time. Sure. So if you we were to talk about the month of July, one way to look at this is that 99% of our communities, at any given time, were open; and 1% were not taking move-ins. But even within that, there was movement, and among the segments there was movement. So frankly, I think there's around 30 communities that actually moved backwards among the segments. But then we had just as many or close as many approved. So there is a little bit of movement back and forth. But very few communities, quite frankly, that are involved in the movement throughout the month of July, and the net result, of course, is very positive to see the vast majority of the portfolio offering the more robust lifestyle. Thank you, Debbie. The one thing I would just point to is just the approaches that our operators have used to keep our residents safe. And you actually see it in investor deck on Page 15 it falls into three categories; there's screening, which is something as a practice, they really started it right way, and then you're familiar with daily temperature checks and symptom screening and the health questionnaires that happen; and then the protecting, which has to do with social distancing and PPE and resident cohorts and cleaning and disinfecting; and then testing has been widely utilized across our operators as well. So all of those have been \u2013 things have been working together to create an environment that is safe for our residents and our employees. And as you can see, really from everything we've shared and both on the call and through the materials, so that the results have been good. And so as long as those trends persist, we would expect to see communities open and accepting move-ins and allowing for residents to move about safely among \u2013 in the community and have visitation with relatives that is really, really important to the residents and \u2013 but done so in a very safe way in a restricted manner. So at this time, the trend really is leaning more towards opening. And certainly, as we've seen in our own portfolio, that if there is a new infection or new infections that find their way into a community, they may reverse course a bit. But the overwhelming trend has really been more towards opening at this point. That's a great question. And if you can look at \u2013 if you look at the deck we provided, if you go to Page 14 then you can see that we've included a map that describes what I'm going to tell you. And that is that the \u2013 to Debbie's point earlier, where we had the most impact really from the virus in the early stages was in New York and New Jersey. But the virus peak in that geography is well behind us as well. And the highest lead and move-in trend right now in recent weeks is really in the northeast, primarily in New York and New Jersey. But having said that, away from that outlier, it's very consistently improving all across the country. And you can see it as we reflect it, we have the size of the circle on this page that reflects the NOI concentration. The color really reflects that \u2013 the state is reflecting the number of new cases per 100,000 population and the general population. So it indicates whether or not there's increased virus spread in the general population. And then the color of the circle is really about the move-in versus prior year. And you can see there's a lot of green circles and irregardless of what's happening externally with the virus. And that's an indicator of the demand for our services. And as I said, we're seeing that across all geographies."

            "content": "Thanks, Justin. I'll cover the office segment second quarter results and trends. Our office segment, which now represents 30% of Ventas' NOI continues to show its value proposition, financial strength and growth amidst the pandemic. MOBs and research and innovation centers, the two lines of business within our office portfolio, play a key role in the delivery of crucial health care services and research for life-saving vaccines and therapeutics. For the second quarter of 2020, reported office same-store cash NOI increased by 2.7% year-over-year. This outstanding result was led by our R&I portfolio, which grew 14.4%, driven by strong lease-up and with occupancy improving by 500 basis points and rent growth of 6.1%. Strong performance in our university based developments affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania and Washington University fueled our growth. This growth was partially offset by a modest 40 basis point decline in the medical office portfolio. It was driven by a difficult comparison period, lower paid parking receipts and increased cleaning expenses caused by COVID-19. After adjusting for these factors, office and MOB same-store, cash NOI versus prior year would have grown by 5.7% and 2.3%, respectively. These results exceeded our expectations for the quarter. Office occupancy grew by 20 basis points sequentially in the second quarter, with occupancy in our 361 asset sequential same-store pool, reaching 91.4% as of June 30. MOB retention has increased to record levels, at 97% for second quarter of 2020. Total office leasing, which includes renewals and new leasing, was 860,000 square feet for the quarter, and nearly 1.5 million square feet year-to-date. Lab space continues to be in high demand in our R&I portfolio, which is currently 97% leased. This is a clear opportunity area. In terms of rent collections, office tenants paid an industry-leading 99% of contractual rent in the second quarter. This is without D docs for deferrals, which were de minimis. And actually half of those deferrals have already been repaid. Collecting 99% of total rent is a direct reflection of the quality of our tenants and the quality of our buildings. Most tenants have received significant amount of federal support through a variety of programs designed to assist health care providers in small businesses. As an example, we estimate there are top 10 health system tenants have collectively received nearly $3 billion in CARES Act relief and $10 billion in Medicare advance payments. As of August 6, 2020, our tenants have already paid more than 97% of July rents. This is a faster collection pace than experienced during the second quarter. This solid result underscores the durability and quality of our tenant base. 88% of MOB NOI is from investment-grade tenants, or HCA, and 97% of our MOB NOI comes from tenants affiliated with a major health system. For our R&I portfolio, 76% of our revenues are received from investment-grade organizations and publicly listed companies. A very solid foundation. We also saw positive space utilization trends intra-quarter that mirrored admissions and surgery volumes reported by the health systems. For example, in our MOB portfolio, essentially all of our physicians were back to work in June. Patient visits and paid parking activity more than doubled in June from the depths of April. These trends have continued in July, although still below historical levels. All of our MOB buildings are open for business, and 94% of our MOBs are in counties that are restriction free for elective procedures. To ensure the safety of our tenants, their patients and our employees, we have set up screening at certain building entrances and enhance our cleaning protocols. All R&I buildings are also open, supporting multiple critical research organizations in fighting the pandemic. We have 16 major university relationships, all of which anticipate opening in the fall with some level of on-campus in person learning scheduled. Essential field personnel who have continued to serve our tenants on-site through the pandemic have done a terrific job. We're grateful for their effort and commitment, and we continue to focus on the health and safety of these personnel and our tenants. Finally, I'm pleased to let you know that our doctor center medical office building associated with an Emory Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, play second at the Bauma International Tobi awards in the best renovated all office building category amongst all submissions across the globe, an extraordinary example in utilizing our capital to reinvigorate a well-located medical office building associated with a strong health system. In sum, our occupancy, NOI and cash payment results and trends were outstanding during the second quarter. During this difficult time, we are honored to be caring for the caregivers, the physicians, the hospitals, scientists and researchers who bring hope and comfort to those in need. With that report, I'll pass the time to Bob. Yes. Thanks so much, Lukas for asking a question. Appreciate that. Yes. So this quarter, we're actually very happy with the MOB performance, particularly given COVID condition. We have a substantial amount of paid parking that took, as you might not be surprised, a hit in the second quarter. We were down in paid parking by over $2.6 million for the quarter. In addition, we had premium cleaning costs. Our protocol was when we were aware of someone walking through our building, a patient walking through a building, who is COVID positive, we would do a deep clean in the premises as well as the lobbies in all common areas. So there is substantial cleaning costs. And then in addition, in the second quarter of 2019, we had some fairly large offsets on the operating expenses, such as real estate tax appeals that came in during the second quarter. So it was a poor comparison; tough comparison in the second quarter on the expense line. Does that answer your question? I'm just curious."

            "name": "Debra A. Cafaro",
            "content": "Nicely done, Sarah, and thank you. Good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants. And welcome to the Ventas second quarter 2020 earnings call. I sincerely hope that you are safe and healthy and staying positive as the COVID-19 pandemic persists in our country. I'm proud to say that the Ventas team has been cohesive skilled and enormously hard-working as we've addressed key issues and weathered the initial storm created by the pandemic. We still have a long way to go, and conditions remain highly uncertain and uneven, but we are encouraged by second quarter performance and trends, which have continued into July. Our enterprise benefited significantly in the second quarter from our long-standing commitment to asset class, operator and geographical diversification. We delivered $0.77 of normalized FFO per share in the quarter, led by our medical office building, research and innovation and health care triple-net business, which collectively represent nearly half of our enterprise. As a result of the pandemic, we recorded a number of non-cash charges in the quarter, primarily focused on senior housing. These items reflect the conditions affecting senior housing we shared with you in late June, and our expectations remain unchanged regarding our business prospects and potential from that point. As expected and consistent with those communications, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected our senior housing financial results in the quarter. Our SHOP portfolio experienced the maximum occupancy impact from mid-March through April, particularly in our large, high quality, high rate, New York and New Jersey communities. Since then, we are heartened to see the resilience of demand for senior living and the recognition of the value our industry provides to seniors and their families. We saw sustained intra-quarter improvement in leads and move-ins and clinical results for our residents that continues into July. Atria has led the way. And as we previously anticipated, operators at virtually all of our communities are currently open to new resident move-ins and the vast majority of our communities are offering residents an enriched living environment. The focus of our operators now is to safely increase move-ins and stabilize occupancy. And then seek to rebuild occupancy towards pre-pandemic level. We are proud of our early and rigorous focus on health and safety, and our leadership in adopting testing protocols to keep seniors and frontline caregivers safe. We have also taken decisive actions during and after the quarter to keep Ventas strong and stable for all those who depend upon us. These include adjusting our cost structure by $25 million to $30 million annualized to further enhance our efficiency and effectiveness while preserving our core competencies of capital raising, investment, asset management and service in the field. Increasing our liquidity, which currently stands at $3.5 billion, and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Conserving capital through the reduction of capital expenditures and our dividend. Taking proactive steps to address the financial impact of the pandemic with our two largest senior housing tenants, Brookdale and Holiday, resulting in mutually beneficial transactions with both large operators. For Holiday, we are pleased that we converted our 26 independent living communities operated by Holiday to SHOP. And we recently announced the deal with Brookdale that provides Ventas shareholders with certainty, flexibility and the opportunity for upside on industry recovery and creates better lease coverage and a stronger tenant. We appreciate our constructive relationship with both companies and management teams, and continuing to advocate for seniors with federal policymakers. Because of the crucial role senior living care providers play in protecting our vulnerable senior population and the impressive clinical record in our industry. We remain respectfully hopeful that HHS will provide much deserved and needed financial support to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. We also continue to explore opportunities to grow our enterprise and our investment team is being active, yet selective. I'd highlight, in particular, the strategic advantage of the open-end fund we successfully launched in March with access to institutional capital and a well-performing core of quality assets under management. The fund is another tool that will enable us to expand our footprint, leverage our team and industry expertise and create value. We also continue our capital allocation focus on our expanding research and innovation business. While the existing R&I portfolio continues to deliver outstanding performance. We also have two major projects well underway with leading research institutions at the University of Arizona and the University of Pittsburgh, both expected to deliver next year. In addition, we just broke ground on Drexel's academic tower in uCity market of Philadelphia. Together, these three developments represent over $600 million in aggregate investment and are over 80% pre-leased to highly rated tenants. Our team continues to work with our development partner, Westford, to build our pipeline of R&I projects that will be actionable as soon as the time is right. We were pleased to welcome Marguerite Nader to our diverse, independent and experienced Board in July. Marguerite is a top-notch CEO and real estate executive, and we look forward to benefiting from her insights as we move the company through the pandemic and forward. In closing, the long-term demographically driven thesis for healthcare real estate and for Ventas remains in place despite the near-term disruption caused by the pandemic. We see resilient demand and strong performance in our different business lines and have taken decisive actions, so Ventas can successfully navigate through current conditions and capture opportunities. We will continue working together for the benefit of all our stakeholders. And now I'm pleased to ask Justin to discuss our senior housing business. Good morning, Mike. Justin will take that one. Thank you. Well, the industry has a very strong case to tell. Essentially, the senior living care providers care for the largest group of seniors. The vast majority of the seniors are 85 and over, many have significant comorbidities. And importantly, the clinical record of the senior care providers and keeping seniors safe has been far superior than in other sectors that have received significant support. So all of the policy predicates for receiving support from HHS to mitigate the financial costs of the COVID pandemic are there. And really, it's just a question of continuing to educate the policymakers on those key points and continuing to, again, respectfully request their financial support. And we're hopeful, but remaining cautious around our outreach. I'll take \u2013 I'll ask Justin or Bob to take that question. It is because the sequential pool contains that. So Nick, we don't have that broken out, but we can take that offline with you. Thank you. Good morning. Thanks. We are really happy. As we've said, that we have reached these attractive transactions with our biggest triple-net senior housing operators, Capital Senior, Holiday and Brookdale, and I will turn it over to Justin to address the remaining 40%. Sure. I can tell you that our Board \u2013 we have a great Board. Our Board is very experienced and very independent. Obviously, succession planning, regardless of the tenure or age of a CEO, is one of the core functions of any board, and I can assure you that our Board performs all of its duties in an exceptionally positive and good way, and that would include succession. And I've always been really proud of the deep and experienced Ventas team that we have and that we've continued to augment this year. So you should feel really good about that. You bet. Thanks. Yes. I mean, it's really going to depend on how August and September play out, Rich. Thanks. I mean, obviously, capital allocation is something that's extremely important. We start out with a view that we price diversification by geography, by asset class, by operator. We found it to be a tremendous strength over a long period of time. Over the past several years, our focus really has been on growing the MOB, life science and R&I development business, and that has been a capital allocation priority and, again, is serving us really well. Our team is active really across sectors, although I would say that we would likely prioritize, again, the life science, R&I development and MOB businesses, while at the same time, I would say we have terrific exposure to upside in senior housing in a variety of ways. It is a significant part of our business. So we're happy about that for when the business turns, but we would continue to be very selective in our senior housing investments were we to make any at this time. All right. Be well. I'm going to ask Justin to take that, and he will school all of us on the operating trends. Okay, thank you. Yes. Good question. Let me start and then I'll turn it over to Justin. So basically, again, as you say, we are encouraged by the sustained improvement in demand that we saw from the April time frame to where we are now. And it has \u2013 I think it's more in the former category of your question rather than the latter. It's a need-based business, it's demographically driven. Obviously, if you just watch the news, there's going to be a psychological impact on individuals and families willingness and readiness to move-in. And I think that has had an effect. What we are happy about seeing is in places like New York, where that was the epicenter and, obviously, early and where there was a deep psychological and clinical impact of the pandemic, Atria, for example, had a July that was better than it had last July, significantly so, and better than June. So I almost think of it as a time series, where you start to see the virus. At some point, it effects, it then \u2013 we're a lagging indicator, let me say. And then it may affect move-ins either because of psychology or because the communities are restricted to do move-ins, as Justin said. And then at some point, the cases get under control and improvements are made, communities move back into the green and can offer richer lifestyle and over time, psychology improves, people feel more confident. We have testing protocols. And then you can see an improvement in the trends. And we're seeing this on a geographical basis operating exactly as I've described. Within the U.S. at this time with New York, at this point, starting to show some stronger trends, having been a month or two or three away from the real nadir of the pandemic there. And what's also encouraging is that in the regions where the virus is more widespread, the south and the west, we've learned a lot clinically and treatments are better, protocols are better and, therefore, clinical results are better, which is keeping more communities open to new residents. And so this is a multifaceted situation. As we've said, remains uncertain. We have to be very humble in our expectations about our ability to predict the future. But so far, we're seeing the sustained positive trend. So I hope that puts it in perspective for you and answers your question. Thank you. Justin? Well, that would be our first choice, it's improving EBITDA. I'll turn it over to Bob to answer. You're an abuser, but I'll give you one tidbit. So I mean, obviously, we're very pleased that we got into the life science business and have expanded that part of our business, and have a longstanding commitment to hospital affiliated medical office buildings, mostly on-campus, as Pete described. And the cap rates for research and innovation or life science have continued to stay strong and, in many cases, have even strengthened further. So that's a little tidbit for you that has enhanced the value of our portfolio. All right. So again, that's about $170 million of cash rent. It's all relatively small tenants, as Justin said. These tenants are performing on an aggregate basis, substantially better than the capital senior Brookdale and Holiday tenants were prior to the pandemic. They certainly will feel the same pressures of the sector that the SHOP operators are feeling directionally, but may have different credit profiles, different geographies, different business models, et cetera, that could make the outcomes vary. And also, I would just say that really, the outcomes are going to be really dependent upon basically, what the trajectory of the property performance is going forward, whether there is some kind of government relief for the industry, what the credit support that we have for the individual leases is and, obviously, where the pandemic goes. And so I think we've really demonstrated a commitment to being decisive and proactive, creative, whatever word you want to use, and you have our commitment to continue to do so. But as Bob said, we will continue to try to collect our rents. Bob, I'll take that. I mean, that's correct. It was not in the $40 million. And the Colony loan is a LIBOR-based loan, and there continues to be, for the time being, very significant cushion between the cash flow of the collateral and the debt service. Thank you. We \u2013 as Justin said, we are glad that in the greens and even yellow, we have record levels of communities now offering the richer environment to seniors really since the beginning of the pandemic. And Justin, can you talk about the movement that we've seen perhaps as the virus has moved in the country? Bob, do you want to take that? Good morning. Sure thing. So we think the Brookdale deal is a really well balanced, thoughtful structure that's really customized to create some significant key benefits for Ventas, of course, but also for Brookdale. So we are trying to balance creating certainty for our shareholders, a sustainable rent stream and that's really important over the \u2013 as we still \u2013 and the industry still is combating COVID. We wanted to create significant opportunity for upside, which we did through the 8% warrant in Brookdale, so that we have the opportunity to hear an industry recovery and, in particular, at Brookdale, not only on our own portfolio, but also on their own portfolio, so a broader-based upside participation opportunity. And of course, getting the cash upfront and all the upfront consideration really replaces over 2.5 years of the cash rent reduction that we gave. And so we thought that was really great. And in the meanwhile, we did improve lease coverage and we created a better, stronger, more stable tenant overall. And that was really a very thoughtful, again, I think, very mutually beneficial type of transaction that accomplished the objectives of both companies. Correct. Great question. I'm going to hand that over to Bob. I think of it as prepaid rent, but they won't let me write it that way, but that's sort of what I think about. Thank you. Thank you, Lukas. I know that Pete Bulgarelli has been awaiting that question. So Pete, I'm going to turn it over to you. Good question. We sit here at the beginning of August, and there's obviously a lot of uncertainty in schools and other types of settings. And I'll ask Justin to really comment on what the operators are doing as it relates to the fall protocol. And it's also going to be interesting to see whether all of the processes that have been adopted and the heightened sensitivity is really going to have any measurable positive effects on the spread of influenza in the fall. And we don't yet know that, there are various hypotheses floating around, but that will be an interesting \u2013 it will be an interesting test case this year to see whether that shows better trends than usual. So we'll have to wait and see on that. Thank you. And part of it also is the ability of the buildings to stay in the more rich resident experience, which encourages move-ins. And again, that's a very \u2013 it's a very unpredictable trend and communities, as Justin said, are moving in and out of this frequently and depending on virus activity. But overall, I think the math presents the right picture at this moment in time. But again, we want to be cautious and humble about the predictive abilities going forward. So if there are no further questions, I really want to thank everyone for their attendance today for their interest in our company, for their participation. And I hope you and yours stay vigilant and safe, and we look forward to seeing you on the other side of this thing. Take care."

I would like to note that, we posted an investor presentation this morning on our website, which includes a COVID-19 business update to this helpful information that the team will reference in our prepared remarks.   With those formalities out of the way, I will hand it over to Debbie.  \nDebra Cafaro:   Thank you, Juan. and good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants and welcome to the Ventas' first quarter 2020 earnings call. I sincerely hope that, you and yours are safe and healthy.   Today, the Ventas team is working remotely, but we are together in spirit as we outline our outstanding first quarter results, describe the challenging conditions in the markets, the economy and or Company brought on by the terrible COVID-19 pandemic, discuss near-term business trends and evaluate the macro outlook.   At this time, we face unprecedented conditions nationally and globally created by the pandemic. Those of us in real estate has been around a long time have managed through many severe crises over the decades, including the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the great financial crisis, and the deep recession that followed both. Yet today's complex mix of public health, remote working, economic, operational and market conditions make this pandemic a uniquely challenging adversary.   Let me begin today by setting the stage and then outlining the swift and decisive actions we have taken to ensure that Ventas remains strong and stable. As we rolled into March, we were excited to see how our previously announced initiatives were gaining traction and making an impact and how well our overall enterprise and each of our business lines were performing.   You can see the power of our diversified business model in the strong normalized FFO per share results we reported today at $0.97 per share, inclusive of the financial impact of COVID-19 toward the end of the quarter. In short, we were hitting on all cylinders with terrific momentum.   As soon as, we realized the potential scope and impact of the novel Coronavirus in February and early in March, we identified as our key priority that health and safety of Ventas\u2019 employees and their family and the employees patients and senior living residents in our 1200 healthcare sites.   Although this particular crisis reflecting unique combination of forces, our experience, deep analysis based on early real time inputs and core principles have given us a solid framework for action.   Here are some of the strong measures we have taken to preserve and protect the Company and the many stakeholders who depend upon us. We have devoted significant efforts to support our tenants and operators across our portfolio during the COVID-19 pandemic.   We have established financial support programs for those who are experiencing financial hardship. We have assisted operators, who may be eligible for complex and various government programs, and we have leveraged our national scale to help operators source supplies, including scarce Personal Protective Equipment or PPE.   And today, we have announced a powerful new initiative for Ventas Senior Living Operators. Ventas will be providing access to COVID-19 testing kits and analysis from Mayo Clinic laboratories without charge to certain of our senior housing operators to further enhance safety at Ventas communities by accelerating employee testing.   Ventas and Atria working through Atria's ongoing relationship have secured access to testing capacity in excess of 30,000.   Atria is already nearly done testing all of this 14,000 U.S. on site and regional staff with approximately 9,000 results in less than 1% of Atria's employee tests have been returned positive.   Combined with digital tracking and tracing and appropriate use of PPE, Atria is building a new normal model to run its senior housing business safely and thoughtfully. In a positive sign, Atria has moved in 300 residents since early March all under full quarantine and PPE protocol.   Ventas plans to make available to certain of its other operators at least 10,000 COVID-19 test kits and analysis from Mayo Clinic Labs, ESL will be the next Ventas\u2019 operators to use this testing for its Ventas communities, and it is already getting ready to test all this staff in May.   We look forward to finding more ways to work with Mayo Clinic Labs and our operators to further enhance safety in our communities for residents and caregivers. We will continue to evaluate additional action as appropriate.   Second, on our action hit list, we move early to review and implement our pre-existing business continuity plan. So, we could maintain a high level of productivity and manage a seamless transition to remote working arrangements.   With an interdisciplinary team of Ventas leaders coordinating our efforts, strongly IT support and capabilities, full buy in by our employees and enhanced communication. The company experienced no downtime and we have been highly effective during these challenging times. I'm so proud of how Ventas employees have reacted in rally and I want to thank them for their extraordinary efforts.   Third, we are pleased that we have reached a positive consensual resolution of our Holiday lease. After receiving full rents from Holiday since lease inception in 2013, through the end of the first quarter 2020. We have now received an additional $100 million in cash and secured notes.   We have entered into a new management agreement with Holiday for a 26 independent living assets and we have terminated the Holiday lease all effective April 1. This management structure retains our upside in our 26 communities and provides us with operational flexibility. We appreciate Holiday management's engagement and cooperation to complete this transaction.   Fourth, we were excited to augment our leadership team with Justin Hutchens and Carey Roberts when they join Ventas on March the 4th. Justin and Carey have added new energy and insight to our tight knit group at this crucial time. They've already made many meaningful contributions to Ventas. As we have collaborated to analyze and attack the business challenges presented by the pandemic.   Our experience has instilled in us the importance of liquidity in a crisis. As a result, we shared the courage of our convictions in mid-March by drawing on our revolver and then issuing senior notes generating $3.3 billion in liquidity. This financial flexibility will serve us well as we manage through to the other side of the COVID-19 pandemic.   In addition, we further enhanced our financial flexibility by acting immediately to reduce 2020 capital expenditures by $300 million, mainly by pausing certain of our previously announced ground-up developments that were not yet substantially underway. We are also carefully reviewing other areas of our Company for cost savings, including general and administrative expenses.   At the same time, we promptly withdrew our financial guidance on March 17th, nearly two months ago, when our early analysis informed by real time data let us to conclude that our financial performance could be materially affected by the pandemic. Our foresight proved correct and we fulfilled our commitment to transparency to our stakeholders by the actions we took in a timely way.   Finally, Ventas has served and continues to work tirelessly as a proactive and evidence-based advocate for seniors as federal policy makers. Working with industry groups and in alliance with senior living CEOs, we are demonstrating the crucial role senior living care providers play in protecting our senior population that is particularly vulnerable to this novel Coronavirus.   While we have taken plenty of actions, policymakers have done exponentially more. The Fed, the administration and Congress have implemented a comprehensive array of bold policy actions to partially mitigate the virus' severe implications for public health, capital markets and the economy.   Many businesses and households, including many of our tenants and operators have already benefited from this arsenal of federal programs. With this powerful support and more financial relief likely to follow, it is our responsibility now to take action to safely and responsibly move our Company toward a new normal.   As we do so, our visibility is limited and uncertainty remains very high. Indeed, we faced the COVID-19 paradox on the one side, reputable models and even certain government projections show an expected increase in COVID-19 confirmed cases and mortality numbers in many jurisdictions. These expectations if they materialize, could derail even the best laid plans for economic recovery. And this morning we saw a historic levels of unemployment claims in the U.S.   On the other hand, there is palpable optimism in the air as most states plan staged re-openings of their economies and businesses, many companies including ours are preparing for a gradual return to office work, patients and physicians are scheduling appointments in elective procedures, families are making deposits for senior housing move in, universities are planning to welcome students in the fall, and most importantly, our best scientific and medical minds are racing to find treatment, cures and vaccines for the Coronavirus.   We are proud to say that, many of our key research and innovation university relationships and tenants, including Duke, Wake Forest, Penn, Yale, and Integral Molecular are at the forefront of this research. All these promising developments provide hope for a speedier and sustained bounce back.   We don't have to know how these opposing trends will play out. Our job is to preserve and protect our Company and our stakeholders, and be ready for a variety of scenarios and opportunities. Before closing, I want to address our dividends in the context of this COVID-19 uncertainty.   As you know, we declared and paid our last quarterly dividend in April. Because we normally pay our next dividend in July, our board will consider the dividends in mid to late June. As it always does, our responsible and experienced board will make a decision using it is good faith business judgment, taking into account all of the information available to it at that time.   In a situation like the fast moving rapidly changing global pandemic, we have the advantage of aggregating and analyzing the best and most current information available in order to make the optimal decision.   The cycle test events as team and the Company are well prepared to manage through current conditions and to take further action as necessary. Guided by our experience, analysis and ethics, we will safeguard our employees, our senior housing residents and caregivers, our capital and our reputation, so that Ventas will remain a leading healthcare property owner in the businesses and geographies where we invest a desirable employer and an attractive investment vehicle.   And now for the first time, I'm pleased to ask Justin Hutchins to address you about Venta\u2019s senior housing business.  \nJustin Hutchens:   Thanks, Debbie. Let me just start off by saying I'm extremely excited to be working with the Ventas team. Given the circumstances, I have certainly had the opportunity to jump right in and immediately put my operating experience to work.   I'm also happy to be working again with long standing colleagues and industry leaders like Atria, Brookdale, SDL, Holiday, and Sunrise. COVID notwithstanding, I see great opportunities ahead for Ventas in its senior housing business.   In my first Ventas earnings call, I would like to discuss the momentum of our SHOP, the same-store portfolio showed in the first quarter. Outline how Ventas has worked with integrity to support our tenants and operators during a very challenging time. Describe the operational and clinical environment in SHOP, in triple-net, delve into April and May trends and provide our outlook for safe and staged reopening in senior housing.   Our SHOP portfolio started the year ahead of our expectations and with good momentum. Sequentially, NOI and our same-store SHOP portfolio grew 2.3% in the first quarter with COVID costs embedded.   Without COVID impacts NOI grew 6% versus the fourth quarter, with credit due to solid sequential performance from Atria through strong rate growth and expense control, and some welcome stabilization from ESL.   As expected, the year-over-year same-store SHOP comparisons were negatively affected by six million in COVID costs incurred in the quarter. The reduction in occupancy as a result of COVID in the back half of March as well as the previously discussed lower star point heading into 2020. Ex-COVID costs the year-over-year, same-store NOI would have declined 6.9%, better than our expectations given the difficult prior year comparison.   While we are mostly focused on the impact of COVID-19 to our operating performance, it is worth noting new construction starts in senior housing continue to decelerate with the first quarter of 2020, having the lowest number of new starts in several years at 1,000 units in Ventas markets.   Moving to our support for senior housing tenants and operators. I have been proud that Ventas has been out front and willing to work with integrity in support of our senior housing tenants, who are on the front lines of caring for seniors. This support has taken many forms.   I will just focus on some creative programs we have offered to our triple-net tenants. The company offered support to its triple-net senior housing tenants affected by the COVID-19 pandemic by implementing a 25% rent deferral program in April to enable them to care for seniors, purchase needed supplies and pay employees. This program ultimately reduced April cash rent receipts by approximately $3 million.   Adjusting for this tenant support program, tenants paid substantially all triple-net senior housing rents in April. For the month of May, the company offered qualified senior housing tenants the opportunity to pay up to 25% of their rent with cash as escrows and security deposits and based on participating tenants, we expect about $2 million of our rent to be paid this way.   We are encouraged to see that, some of our tenants have availed themselves of government relief programs for which they are eligible. We will continue to engage in constructive ongoing dialogue with our triple-net tenants regarding their COVID-19 challenges on a case-by-case basis.   We have many tools available to us to work through a near-term conditions including our backstop of corporate and personal guarantees in over $100 million of security deposits that stand behind these lease obligations.   Turning to the clinical and operational environment. These trying times underlined the importance of partnering with true industry leaders. We have been inspired by the tireless work of our operating partners to keep seniors safe.   Senior housing operators across the industry continue to aggressively implement protocols to protect against COVID-19. The result of these protocols is that almost all operators are only offering virtual tours and at the present time, about 29% of our 400 SHOP communities have suspended their move-ins.   In terms of the clinical impact on our SHOP portfolio as of April 30, it is a tale of two cities. Having a large New York and New Jersey footprint is a strategic advantage for Ventas, but those States where the epicenter for the COVID-19 infection and mortality rate.   On a full portfolio basis, about a quarter of our SHOP communities experienced at least one positive COVID-19 resident diagnosis since the beginning of the pandemic, registering accumulative percentage of resident cases at slightly over 2% of the resident population. Excluding New York and New Jersey, these figures improved dramatically with only 1% of our residents cumulatively effective since day one.   In our triple-net senior housing portfolio benefiting from geographic diversification, the percentage of resident cases is 1%. As is best practice, the care providers to great lengths to isolate or transfer to a higher acuity setting, the limited number of residents who receive positive diagnosis.   Brookdale in particular has been compassionate, but also fairly disciplined and rigorous in its preparation for and management of COVID conditions for the benefit of residents and their families.   In SHOPs, as a result of restricted access to communities nationally, April move-ins approximated 25% of typical levels. While overall move-outs were largely in-line with historic patterns. April average occupancy was approximately 82.4%. As of May 1, spot occupancy was estimated as 80.7% representing a 330 basis points declined since the beginning of April based on interim information provided by Ventas operators.   When excluding New York and New Jersey, occupancy would have declined to 280 basis points. Operating expenses are trending around 10% higher, particularly for labor and supplies, including PPE. These revenue and expense trends we are seeing for April, are expected to continue in May.   Financial and operational trends are expected to be directionally similar for our triple-net portfolio in the second quarter. For senior housing overall, as we look beyond the second quarter, there are three critical considerations we are monitoring that will materially affect the outlook for senior housing.   One, timing of reopening of communities to physical tours and move-ins. Two, cost and access to labor. Three, local demand characteristics including evolving protocols required to protect against the virus. The timing of openings will be driven by state specific guidelines, CDC guidelines and local community considerations. Ventas along with our operating partners is closely tracking state specific guidelines and COVID infection curves in each of our markets.   I'm encouraged to report that we have roughly 300 deposits for move-ins, which is a good sign of ongoing demand for our senior housing communities. Senior housing operators will find success in many ways, including and most importantly building trust with prospective residents and their families by demonstrating a concerted effort to keep communities free of infection. To do so, we anticipate elevated levels of costs over the course of the next several months.   Trust and confidence in senior housing or the near-term will be supported with best in class infection control practices, availability of PPE and testing residents and employees. As Debbie described, Ventas has played an important role alongside our operators and tenants to combat into pandemic and helping operators prepare to open successfully.   Through this challenging stretch, we continue to resolutely believe in the long-term value that senior living offers residents and their families and are sharply focused on positioning Ventas\u2019 senior housing business for long term success.   With that, I will hand the floor to Pete to discuss our office business.  \nPeter Bulgarelli:   Thanks Justin. We are certainly glad to have you and Carey on board. I will quickly touch on the first quarter results for our office segment, which represents 27% to Ventas NOI and then focus on the latest trends in our latest second quarter COVID framework.   For the first quarter of 2020 office same-store cash NOI increased by 5.8% year-on-year. This outstanding results was fueled by our R&I portfolio, which grew 22% driven by strong lease up and complimented by strong performance from the MOB portfolio.   In R&I, first quarter average rent per square foot was up 9.4% and occupancy was robust at just under 97%. Strong performance at our university based developments affiliated with University of Pennsylvania and Philadelphia and Washington University in St. Louis fueled our growth. Complimenting the fast growing R&I business is our MOB business. MOB same-store cash NOI for the first quarter of 2020 increased 1.9% year-on-year, also above our expectations.   Now let's shift to the latest COVID trends we are seeing in our office portfolio. I will start with medical office. Our top priority has been to partner with our tenants and the associated health systems to ensure the safety of health professionals, patients and our employees.   We have sourced substantial amounts of PPE, coordinated visitor screening, licensed short-term spaces, set up drive-through testing centers in our parking lots, provide a supplemental cleaning and otherwise supported our tenants during this challenging time.   We are happy to report that all of our buildings are open and none of our site based employees have tested positively for COVID-19. We sincerely thank all of our on-site employees and partners who fight the fight every day. We are very proud of them. I will also say regarding our MOB business, that parking receipts have slowed and while safety concerns have caused an increase in cleaning costs.   Given the current uncertainty, the pace of new leasing has slowed. However, we still leased 573,000 square feet during the first quarter and 381,000 square feet during April, with an additional 200,000 square feet of leases at the letter of intent stage.   Also, tenant retention has increased. I'm proud to say that MOB reported record retention of 83% for the trailing 12-months, 90% retention for the first quarter, 94% retention for March and an outstanding 98% in April.   Turning to our R&I portfolio. Our R&I buildings are a 100% open and are supporting critical research focused on the detection, prevention, and cure of COVID-19. We are proud to be partnered with leading research institutions such as Yale, Penn Gene Therapy Center, Wake Forest Health Sciences, Virginia Commonwealth University, Integral Molecular, Alexion and others in fighting this virus.   And we look forward to expanding our portfolio with other leading research institutions such as Arizona State and University of Pittsburgh in new under construction, world-class research building.   As previously mentioned, our R&I portfolio is 97% leased with an active leasing pipeline. Last phase continues to be in high demand. Net-net as of April 30th, we had 91.5% occupancy in our office business, representing 150 basis points year-on-year increase from April 2019. From March 31st through April 30th, we experienced a 10 basis point increase in occupancy for MOB and a 10 basis point increase for R&I.   So, let's talk rent payments. During the first quarter, our tenants paid essentially 100% of the office rent. Our historical bad debt expense has only been 20 basis points. We have high quality tenants that pay their rent.   In April, our tenants paid 96% of office rents. We expect a significant proportion of the unpaid rent to be ultimately collected. And I\u2019m encouraged that so far in May, our office tenants have paid nearly 80% of the rents due, to-date we are seeing a faster payment rate than what we experienced in April.   I will say the tenants experiencing the most pressure are the smaller third party position groups in MOB, the smaller private companies in R&I and retail. Taken together, these customer segments represent a relatively small portion of our office portfolio. We are supporting these tenants by raising awareness and assisting them with securing federal relief.   On a selective basis, we are also offering to differ May rent for these small tenants to be repaid no later than the fourth quarter. To-date only a small number of tenants who have utilized the rents deferral opportunity.   Supporting the durability of our office portfolio are a couple of our additional facts. First, our MOB portfolio is largely on campus 71%. We also have a high level of acuity in our buildings, with 88% of our physician tenants being specialists. Our buildings and our tenants are essential to the delivery of care during this difficult time. Less than 10% of our tenant suites closed during the pandemic.   Second, as of May 7th, over 80% of the MOB NOI is in states that have either reopened for elective procedures or have announced the resumption of elective procedures. In locations that have reopened, we are seeing material increases in activity, although still below pre-COVID levels.   As a reminder that our nation is resilient and that normalcy returns following catastrophes. I'm happy to report that Ventas is delivering [Technical Difficulty] that was devastated by Hurricane Michel in 2018.   With that happy news, I will pass the turn to Bob to finish up our prepared remarks.  \nRobert Probst:   Thank you Pete. I will start with our triple-net lease portfolio overall before I close with some enterprise level commentary. The triple-net portfolio grew same-store cash NOI by 3.9% year-over-year in the first quarter. Growth was driven by in-place lease escalations, and a $3 million cash fee received in the quarter from capital senior living.   Trailing 12-months coverage as of the fourth quarter of 2019, for the overall triple-net portfolio for triple-net senior housing remains stable at 1.5 times and 1.1 times respectively. Post acute coverage declined sequentially by 10 basis points to 1.3 times, due to a decline in volumes at Kindred, driven by managed care and purposeful reduction of non-compliant patients.   Adjusting for the 25% rent deferral program in senior housing, we collected close to 100% of our overall expected triple-net portfolio rents in April. We have already received almost a 100% of triple-net healthcare rent for May and we are on-track with triple-net senior housing May collections.   We expect the impact of COVID on our triple-net healthcare rents from acute care providers to be muted in the second quarter. Acute care hospitals have been impacted by the reduction of elective procedures, but have had significant access to government funding and support.   Additionally for Ardent, as of May 1st, all 10 of the Ventas owned hospitals have reopened or will reopen in May for elective procedures. For the post acute providers in our triple-net health care portfolio, volume trends have varied. Deltek, Ventas has been higher than budgeted, the costs have increased. We expect that the concern over respiratory disease will enhance Kindred Deltek business going forward.   Urban census initially declined due to lower surgeries and acute care volumes, but census has improved since mid April. Smiths are experiencing notably higher mortality rates with census down dramatically and the most profitable rehab patients also down. Positive post-acute trends include access to government funding, relief from site neutral pricing, waiver of length of stay requirements and the 2% sequestration delay.   I will close with some comments regarding the overall enterprise and our financial position. I want to underscore how pleased we are with our first quarter results including property performance ahead of our expectations, record quarterly revenues, strong FFO delivery of $0.97 per share and enhanced balance sheet 5.7 times of net debt to EBITDA and excellent liquidity. And we took decisive action in the face of the pandemic to bolster our financial flexibility.   In March, we drew $2.75 billion under our $3 billion revolver and followed it up in early April with a $500 million senior note issuance. As a result, as of May 6th, Ventas has approximately $3.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand with no commercial paper outstanding. We also have very limited debt maturing in 2020 or 2021 and we have the ability to extend our revolver for up to one year.   We plan to bolster financial flexibility by reducing 2020 total capital expenditures by nearly 300 million to a total of 500 million with the decline led by pausing ground-up developments not yet substantially underway. Notably one used to be in Philadelphia and 42/10 in St. Louis.   Our ongoing development projects are on average 81% free leaks to high quality credit tenants in the R&I business. I note that Ventas has a $400 million committed construction line of credit to fund development with $250 million of available capacity as of the end of March. Ventas is expected unfunded investment in all of ground up developments in 2020 net of committed financing is approximately $100 million.   In addition to conserving CapEx, the company is reviewing its cost structures across the enterprise, including its SG&A and organizational costs. As Debbie says, we are on it.   Given our early understanding of the potential impacts of the pandemic, Ventas went through a previously issued financial guidance on March 17th. We believe the adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition will be driven by many factors, most of which are outside of the Company's control and ability to forecast.   Wherever provide investors with incremental observations and transparency, we included today the investor deck outlining our COVID response and latest business trends, as well as expanded disclosure as summarized on Page 44 of the supplemental.   To close we are pleased with our start to year and with the actions taken thus far, and are committed to continuing to take the actions necessary to manage through these unprecedented times. That concludes our prepared remarks.   Before we start with Q&A, we are limiting each caller to two questions given a busy calendar request from a few analysts to be respectful of everyone on the line. Also, given the fact that we are all remote, we will have Debby quarterback to the QA and to pass questions to the Ventas\u2019 team if needed.   With that, I will turn the call back to the operator.  \nOperator:   [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Nick Joseph from Citi.  \nQ - Nicholas Joseph:   Thank you, I appreciate all the color and specifically on April and May rent collections for net lease. You addressed Holiday this morning, but you expect additional net lease restructurings over the next few months?  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Good morning Nick its Debby. I'm going to ask Justin to comment on that.  \nA - Justin Hutchens:   Thank you Debby. First of all, I think it is important to know, our biggest priority is that our operators are looking out for the health and safety of our residents in our communities. That is priority number one, in the near-term.   I will also point two, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks that we have already started to take action, we mentioned the rent deferral in April, we mentioned the opportunity for tenants to pay down rent - pay some of their rent with their cash escrows in May and that the Holiday restructuring.   What we are committed to do is to take action that is going to give us the best opportunity to create value in a portfolio and work with our operators to determine the best outcome. It is still early, some uncertainty ahead of us still, but we will certainly be watching everything closely.  \nQ - Michael Bilerman:   Debby it is Michael Bilerman.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Hey Michael.  \nQ - Michael Bilerman:   I think Bob mentioned in his comments about sort of looking at all forms of cost within the enterprise. Can you sort of address corporate management sort of pay levels and whether that is on the docket and how investors should think about that interest in the governance perspective, whether there would be any changes from the chairman and CEO role which you continue to maintain?  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Sure, and I'm happy to talk about that and turn it over to Bob, for a little bit more detail. But most of our executive compensation is very aligned with shareholders and is the vast majority of which is in the form of performance based equity compensation.   When you think about the overall enterprise, I'm going to turn it over to Bob to talk about some of the insights he has about making sure that the company is efficient and cognizant of the environment that we are in.  \nA - Robert Probst:   Sure. This is an analysis Michael, that again pre-COVID that is the analysis of our SG&A. We are well underway in that analysis. Everything I would say is on the table, as we think about that. I would expect to have some more news this quarter as we are well underway on that analysis and we do see opportunity. But at the end of the day, we have a 20-year record of being efficient and effective and that continues to be our goal and we have a duty to make sure we are doing that.  \nQ - Michael Bilerman:   And Debby is there anything on splitting the Chairman and CEO role?  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   I think that, consistent with the idea that one of the cost efficient, our expectation is that, I would continue to hold those roles, obviously serving at the pleasure of our shareholders and our Board of Directors.  \nQ - Michael Bilerman:   Okay. Thank you.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Thank you.  \nOperator:   Your next question comes from Rich Anderson from SMBC.  \nQ - Rich Anderson:   Hey, thanks. Good morning everyone and hello to you, Justin.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Hi, Rich.  \nQ - Richard Anderson:   Hey thanks. Good morning everyone and hello to you Justin. So, just on the on the Holiday and maybe an extrapolation from that. So EBITDA below rent, so it is obviously a dilutive transaction. But understanding kind of the thought process on taking Sabra\u2019s roadmap on Holiday. And so, I'm curious in the aftermath of all this, do you feel like net lease is becoming an increasingly dying breed for Ventas and you want more control that goes through Brookdale and others or is this a one-off type of thing and you still think that there is a role for triple-net to play in senior housing in the aftermath of all this?  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Good to talk with you, Rich. Let me take that. A couple of things. One is we are pleased with the Holiday transaction. We think it really does a lot of good things and we are happy to take a page out of our friends with matrices book, and we preserved that upside in the assets and a lot of operational flexibility. So, we feel good about that and look forward to optimizing that portfolio.   In terms of the triple-net lease, what I would say is, triple-net leases are a little bit like mortgages in one sense, which is that they magnify ups and downs for the operators and in any challenging environment, they are going to be disfavored. And of course that is the situation we find ourselves in now. In other environments, they could be very attractive to both land owners as well as the operators.   So, I think there is many tools in the bag, many I guess you would say clubs in the bag, tools in the toolkit, and the triple-net lease I think will continue to be one. And there are many ways that you can customize leases also to create alignment.   So, we think the triple-net lease will survive and we think we will continue to be creative and collaborative in how we work with our operators, be they tenants or managers in optimizing our portfolio and then being good partners.  \nQ - Richard Anderson:   Okay. I prefer arrows in the quiver, but that is just me.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   That is a good one too. Absolutely.  \nQ - Richard Anderson:   And then juxtapose U.S. to Canadian, particularly as it relates to your recent investment there. And how things are kind of performing relatively.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Yes. I mean, our investment most, we have a significant Canadian portfolio. Obviously, the pandemic has affected assets there as well. Those operators have also received significant government support and one thing we have liked about the Quebec portfolio with LGM is that they have a younger healthier population a longer lengths of stay.   They are very rigorous and have been very active from early on working to protect the residents. Obviously, that portfolio will be effected as well. But there are some characteristics of the LGM portfolio that make it probably a better performer on a relative basis, despite being impacted by pandemic.  \nQ - Richard Anderson:   Okay, great. Thanks very much. Good luck everyone.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Thank you. great talking to you Rich.  \nOperator:   Your next question comes from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank.  \nQ - Nicholas Yulico:   Good morning everyone. So, in terms of the Holiday restructuring just to make sure understanding how this is going to work. I guess in terms of the money that you are receiving from them the cash, and then the notes and are you going to be actually booking any income from those two items in the second quarter and in terms of the notes, the 9% rate is there any component that cash interest that you are receiving?  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Great question. Yes, the cash and notes are effectively income and I think we mentioned this in the release and so those will be included in net income and yes we actually would expect as part of our ongoing this for ongoing notes we would expect to book and receive some amount of interest income as we go forward.  \nQ - Nicholas Yulico:   Is any of that cash income from those notes?  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   We would expect it to be cash. Yes.  \nQ - Nicholas Yulico:   Okay, thanks. And then I was just hoping to get a feel for you I know you gave us a coverage on Holiday as a trailing number. Is it possible to get the quarterly first quarter EBITDARM for those assets so we can understand exactly from an NOI standpoint as you now have this operating NOI. What the delta is going to be between the old 60 million of cash NOI you got on the lease versus on a real time basis, realizing things are going to move around still, but at least on the first quarter number record what that looks like from a operating EBITDARM basis?  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Right, I mean we have had Holiday in the heat map, obviously and it had been below a 101 and EBITDARM basis. So, as we reported the last time and really what I would say is that just like everything else in the portfolio as you point out, it is really going to depend on how the pandemic really plays out and so I think we will just defer that as we get more real time information about the portfolio. I'm happy to talk to you about it as things progress.  \nQ - Nicholas Yulico:   Right, I guess, but I mean you guys do have an actual number I'm assuming that for the first quarter and so I was trying to see if we can least get that number so we can use that as a base to then build off some assumptions.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Yes, I mean, I think you should, you should look at about a 0.9 EBITDARM coverage, something like that in the first quarter, rough numbers.  \nQ - Nicholas Yulico:   Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Thank you.  \nOperator:   Your next question from Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Hello.  \nQ - Vikram Malhotra:   Sorry. I had myself on mute. I just hope everyone in the team is okay and doing well.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Thank you.  \nQ - Vikram Malhotra:   Debbie, you referenced the dividend in your prepared remarks and I just want to clarify one. I'm assuming the dividend is all cash today and just as we think about the dividend going to second quarter, what are sort of the metrics? What are you looking at? Maybe give us a sense of where AFFO versus the dividend could trend even just percentage wise. What are some of your put and takes if you think about the dividend?  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Thank you. Yes, I mean, I think really want to just touch on the fact that, while we are in this period of uncertainty, we generally want to match our decision making speed with what is required. And our Board is going to look at all relevant information when it addresses the dividend, as I mentioned in mid to late June.  \nQ - Vikram Malhotra:   Okay. And the dividend is all cash currency.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   It has been. Yes, Vikram.  \nQ - Vikram Malhotra:   Okay. And then just second, as you I think you and Bob outlaid the expectations for occupancy in the next few months and it was about a 100 basis points per month in the [RIDEA] (Ph) portfolio. Can you give it a sort of a broader sense of what the ins and outs are in terms of assumptions for move-ins versus move-out and as an aside, if we could request more monthly or more weekly updates, that would be great.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   I'm going to ask Bob to address that Vikram.  \nA - Robert Probst:   Sure. I will give you some building blocks Vikram using April as our case study here. We saw move-ins approximately 25% of our historic levels or down 75%, to put the other way. The move-outs have trended pretty consistently with historical patterns and the net of that is approximately a 70 basis point impact on occupancy on a weekly basis.   One way to think about revenue impact is that, and this is the Page 7 of the investor deck. If you haven't seen this is, a 100 basis points of occupancy generally, sequentially on average is about $2 million to $3 million of revenue per month. So, you can do math there.   And we expect that trend as we see it right now to carry on into May. On the expense side, we mentioned about 10% OpEx increase, driven by labor and supplies including PP&E. We had about $125 million of monthly OpEx in our portfolio in SHOP. So, it gives you some more facts if you like to do the math.  \nQ - Vikram Malhotra:   Okay.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Vikram, we thought you love those rules of thumb.  \nQ - Vikram Malhotra:   I guess I was just trying to understand the move from the 330 basis points loss in the month of April down to a 100 per month. And I was just trying to understand more specifically like what are you assuming changes from April to May through June?  \nA - Robert Probst:   Let me clarify, just to make sure we are on the same page. The 330 basis points was the spot-to-spot effectively beginning to end of April, occupancy moves. And my 100 basis points was simply a rule of thumb to help you.   So, that is an important clarification, beyond what we are seeing in April and early May, I'm not able to project what I think is going to be for the second quarter, for example. But those will give you some building blocks to make your own assumptions.  \nA - Justin Hutchens:   This is Justin. And I'm going to add a little color to that might be helpful and I will just preface this that I'm going to give you April average occupancy numbers that are presented by our operators and these are fully vetted, we only report these numbers.   But I'm going to compare March first. So March average occupancy was 85%, April average is at 82.4%. So, there is 260 basis points difference. If you take New York and New Jersey out, as I did in my prepared remarks when I was using spot occupancy, March average is 85.1, April at 82.9. So, the 220 basis point change.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   And that is shows the difference between really the quote and unquote spot, beginning of month to end of month versus the average occupancies for the month. So, let's carry on. Thank you.  \nQ - Vikram Malhotra:   Thank you.  \nOperator:   Your next question comes from Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets.  \nQ - Michael Carroll:   Yes, thanks. Debbie, I just wonder if you could you add some color on the testing capabilities that you are providing your operators. I don't know if you said this, if I missed it, but are you able to provide enough tests for all the restaurants at the facilities or what in depth are you able to offer right now if that relationship?   \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Great. Good morning. So, we are very excited about this initiative and we are taking the first step with Atria and it is really to accelerate employee e-testing at Ventas buildings with select operators to make our communities safer, and facilitate thoughtful reopening and confidence and trust as Justin talked about.   And so, we have this first compliment of 10,000 testing kits with Mayo Lab\u2019s analysis, which is very important, they have a very high accuracy rate at Mayo, as you would imagine and we really think this is a great first step that we can make available. Atria has already done it, ESL will be next and we will make it available to select operators, principally for their employee testing program.   Once we see how that goes again, we are early days are, still a lot of uncertainty, new testing and tools coming out all the time, we will determine if we want to are-up or if we want to take a different step moving forward, but we think this is a great opportunity to do the right thing and really have a differentiated partnership with our operators and really build that trust and confidence with residents and their families that is so sorely needed.  \nQ - Michael Carroll:   And then what is the turnaround time. How long does it take to get to tests and I guess if you have confidence that at least your employees are not affected by COVID. Is there discussion that you could reopen those communities or is it still too early to tell?  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   The turnaround is a day or two and it will indeed build confidence as a component of the thoughtful reopening and admissions plan.  \nA - Justin Hutchens:   And I will just add one other point to that. This is Justin. All of our operators are considering the move-in protocols at this point, and about 70% of our operators are operating in states that are starting to loosen their stay-at-home policy. So this is a very active conversation.   And the advantage that testing gives you, obviously it gives you a lot more certainty around the potential for spread of infection. But the other advantage is, it is recognized in the CDC guidelines. If testing occurs, then it can accelerate the time that someone can move in, where the regular quarantine is around 14-days and the testing allows for something closer to two or three days.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Okay. Right. And that is a good point, because the test may also be available for new residents in certain cases. Thank you. Mike.  \nQ - Michael Carroll:   Okay. Great. Thanks.  \nOperator:   Your next question comes from Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital Markets.  \nQ - Jordan Sadler:   Thank you, and I hope everybody is doing well.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Thanks Jordan. We are.  \nQ - Jordan Sadler:   Okay. My first question I think is maybe for Bob, I will leave it to Debby to quarterback. But regarding the revolver draw down and I think some subsequent repayments post a senior note issuance in April. You did mentioned in your conversation that, Ventas is past the peak for mortality in your SHOP assets and in triple net.   And so, I guess I'm kind of curious, I know you are waiting till the last minute to make a decision on a dividend, but what do you want to see these to be the virus before in order to sort of pay down those borrowings and sort of what is that sort of draw down, is that reflecting concerns around the ability to potentially borrow?  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Well, I will turn it over to Bob, but one thing we know for sure is that, having went through many decades of this that, having assured liquidity is the number one, two and three attributes that you want to have to manage successfully through any kind of uncertainty. And so, we have that and that is kind of a golden rule, and it served us very, very well.   In terms of the pass of the peak, again, there are numerous models. There is a lot of uncertainty, but as of a point in time, I'm glad that you noticed data that shows that a lot of our NOI in our senior housing on those triple-net and SHOP is in states where according to a single model as of a certain day, the peak of mortality is behind us. Now that could change again and that of course would affect our outlook.  \nQ - Jordan Sadler:   That is helpful. I guess I'm trying to understand the difference between, that assured liquidity as it relates to sort of that revolver borrowing or draw downs versus the dividend that you actually pay. So, there is some uncertainty surrounding the potential to be able to draw or have access to cash. But, it seems like you are not yet willing to sort of cut the dividend down to zero in order to sort of stay off or protect yourself from any uncertainty or maybe I'm misreading that.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Yes. I mean, I think what we have said clearly about the dividends is that the board will make that decision at the right time, which are dividends is a July dividends historically and so that would basically defer that decision to be made by our board until mid to late June. So, do you have a question for Bob about the revolver draw just Jordon?  \nQ - Jordan Sadler:   I think you answered it. But maybe you mentioned Justin. I wanted a welcome back to him back to REIT land. Unfortunately, under these crazy circumstances, but I would have asked him for a review of the portfolio probably not fully appropriate.   Debbie, a couple years ago, you spun off the skilled nursing portfolio at a time when there was no real distress in that sector. Any thoughts surrounding, management and or the potential spin of the seniors housing portfolio or are we just that way too soon, I don't mean to be flippant at all in that question.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Yes, I think that under skilled nursing, I think I'm glad you reminded us that, that we really did that, at the absolute peak time in valuations at a seven cap on rent at that time. And we really continue to believe that was a very sound strategic decision, particularly as we look at infection mortality rates in skilled nursing now.   I think we given all the uncertainty right now we are focused on health and safety as Justin said really just strong effort to keep Ventas strong and stable and get ready for any scenario and the opportunities in the future. So, we will defer that discussion if you don't mind.  \nQ - Jordan Sadler:   Okay. That is fir. Thank you.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Thanks Jordan.  \nOperator:   Your next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein from Bank of America.  \nQ - Joshua Dennerlein:   Hey good morning everyone. Glad you are doing well.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   I clearly had too many people with the first initial J in my life. Anyways go ahead I will try to get it right this time.  \nQ - Joshua Dennerlein:   I'm just curious on the Holiday switch to the management contract. Was that something you were in discussion with before the pandemic or was it really the pandemic was the drivers that kind of got you going on that discussion?  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Well, we have talked about Holiday for a while and have been pretty clear about what the performance was over the past couple of years. I think we were in a good spot, because Holiday remains current and paying full rent all the way through the first quarter and they have been great about that and we were the sole beneficiary of the guarantors.   So, of course, we had a EBITDAR kind of one-to-one coverage. So, we felt like we were in a good spot. But we did feel mutually that it was the right time to take a different approach and we did so in a way that we think was beneficial for both and preserved upside and on operational flexibility.    So, we are happy that we have done it, and we are going to optimize that portfolio especially now that Justin is here.  \nQ - Joshua Dennerlein:   Okay, and then just on the senior housing triple-net rents. I see in your presentation you mentioned I guess sort of May rents are allowing up to 25% of the rent to get paid from the deposits, you expect two million or so to be paid. Do you have a sense of like I guess like back into it, but what percent of tenants are taking advantage of that and I guess later on would you require the tenants to kind of back fill those deposits?  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Right Justin.  \nA - Justin Hutchens:   Yes. It is actually very low percentage, if you think about around 30 million of rent per month and only round two million or up to two million we think will be paid with the cash escrows s to carry deposits. So not a lot.   I will mention two other things on the triple-net, one is that as we said it is our May collections are really right on track, so looking good in May. Also some of April tenants that took advantage of that deferral have already paid back.   So that was good encouraging sign as well, and in that case, there were smaller operators that had advantage of government assistance. But our tap was to Allow some liquidity for operators during a very tough and uncertain time, and we are happy that some of the operators have taken advantage of that.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Thank you.  \nOperator:   Your next question comes from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets.  \nQ - John Kim:   Hey good morning everyone and welcome Justin.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Hi John.  \nQ - John Kim:   I had question on your deposits, that were mentioned - deposits in senior housing, is there any difference regionally for the New York, New Jersey to have more of sure deposits than some of the other markets not impacted by the virus?  \nA - Justin Hutchens:   Hello, this is Justin. Let me just mention first of all, we don\u2019t normally track deposits, because senior housing particularly assisted living, and memory care are what we focused is need driven. So tracking deposits is usually a very short-term indictor of move-in.   But given the environment we started to track recently a lot of those deposits are in Sunrise and Sunrise has kind of a north east footprint with us. So there is certainly some New York and Massachusetts are few for our Sunrise footprint, a lot of those deposits are with them.   There is another stab I will mention, that is round lead which is something that we do track regularly and leads have stabilized over the past few weeks about half of our lead volume, which is you know encouraging in a sense, because it shows that there is still ongoing demand.   Even though we are not doing physical tours, and we are doing virtual tours and in-lue of those there is still ongoing demand and is ahead of that moving pace that we have been experiencing so far. But there is long answer to short question and that is not ready to really point out specific geographies except to say that Sunrise is a big part of those deposits.  \nQ - John Kim:   And then Pete mentioned in his prepared remarks the high retention rate you guys had in the medical office business. Can you provide some terms on that, are these short-term, but month-to-month lease expansions and also what the cash leasing spreads were?  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Pete.  \nA - Peter Bulgarelli:   So, John, let me just be sure that I understand what you are asking. Well, we talked about was 96% receipt of cash rents overall in the office portfolio. Is that what you are asking?  \nQ - John Kim:   No. I was talking about the retention rates, the renewal rates.  \nA - Peter Bulgarelli:   I see. Okay, so of our retention rates, yes, the 90% for the quarter and 94% for March and for April is at 98%, which is a phenomenal set of numbers. And yes, I would say it is a mix in some cases are short-term where they are just uncertain about their future.   And so they want to, just take a year extension. In other cases we use the opportunity to take advantage of maybe some rent relief in exchange for a couple years of additional term. So, we have been fairly entrepreneurial in doing that.   And then there is also some practical reasons, I will tell you kind of an interesting story of an [OVGYN] (Ph), who was 70 something years old who was going to retire. But then he sat back and he thought you know what with his shelter at home, maybe there is going to be a lot of bursts next time, in nine-months from now. So, I'm going to extend for one more year. I'm going to work and cash in on this opportunity. So, it is been a mixture of things.  \nQ - John Kim:   Great. Thank you.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Thanks John.  \nOperator:   Your next question comes from Lukas Hartwich from Green Street Advisors.  \nQ - Lukas Hartwich:   Great, thanks. Whenever we do come out the other side of the COVID pandemic. I'm just curious what you think the recovery in SHOP looks like. Do you expect there to be pent up demand or expect do you expect something more gradual?  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Well, I think our focus right now is really getting through the biggest part of the pandemic Lucas and then there remains really a lot of uncertainty about the depths and then the time period where it will be most active and then what the slope and pace to recovery will look like and those could very significantly affect what the recovery and senior housing looks like.   So, we are really happy for the day when we can discuss that with more specificity in terms of timing, pay and slope. But right now, we are focused on maximizing during the course of the toughest period of pandemic.  \nQ - Lukas Hartwich:   Great and then the second one for me is just. Can you provide a little more color on the performance trends of the Sunrise shop portfolio?  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Justin.  \nA - Justin Hutchens:   Yep, sure. So, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the year-over-year stats that were down and the reasons for that, given the fact that we are starting off at a lower starting point. I also mentioned the strong sequential performance.   That performance was driven by Atria and ESL. Sunrise was not as big acontributor to that. There are some less good performance from the sunrise portfolio during that time, so it was actually contributing on a sequential basis, closer to down around 9%.  \nQ - Lukas Hartwich:   Thank you.  \nOperator:   Your next question comes from Omotayo Okusanya form Mizuho.  \nQ - Omotayo Okusanya:   Yes. Good morning everyone. Justin, good to have you back from Jolly Old England old cap.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Hi.  \nQ - Omotayo Okusanya:   Hi Debbie.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Good.  \nQ - Omotayo Okusanya:   Good. I'm glad to hear that. A couple of questions. The first one is actually on the office side. The 96% of April rent collected, is there way you could help us break it down kind of what you know the rates of MOB versus Life Sciences or other differences there?  \nA - Pete Bulgarelli:   Hey Tayo. This is Pete. How are you? So, the 96% we are very, very pleased with, and one of the items I did want to point out is that those are receipts. Deferrals are not included in that number, and as a matter of fact for April, there were almost zero deferrals.   We are talking like $150,000 worth of deferrals in April, and those were for retail tenants. So, this is true cash receipts and collected in a very positive way. The MOB Portfolio had a slightly higher collection rate for April and the R&I had a slightly lower number. But really nothing material.   It is interesting that many of the universities are just - they do hand checks. They actually write checks out and it is a slower process in a normal month and it is a slower process in a turbulent month. So, that is my assessment.  \nQ - Omotayo Okusanya:   Okay.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   So. I mean those portfolios performed very well.  \nQ - Omotayo Okusanya:   Gotcha. Okay. And then on the Life Sciences side, again very strong same-store NOI this quarter, again it has been a positive on the overall Ventas story. So I guess, a little bit surprised when we looked at the development pipeline that is the projects that were halted or all kinds of Life Science Wexford projects and there was one other projects also Life Sciences, where the completion date was deferred or pushed back a year. So, just kind of curious kind of thinking about that business that is such a big positive on your overall story. And again, a part of what is kind of happening on the development front later you know halting or delaying some of these development projects.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   You are absolutely right. We are happy that, we have grown our office portfolio in particularly this exciting Life Science University based portfolio over the past years, it is really, you are seeing the benefit of that right now.   Both in the fact that is where all the action is on the virus and the vaccines in the search for a cure, as well as the diversification benefits we are getting from that portfolio, within the broader Ventas Enterprise.   And so, it is a significant capital allocation priority. We do have a number of ongoing projects with Arizona State and [Pitt] to name a few. And basically, what we did as a matter of I think, really good discipline and approach is that, when we really understood quickly the potential from this Coronavirus, we aggressively paused on the two developments that really were not yet significantly underway.   And so the ones that are ongoing are going to be delivered and we will have our 80% pre-leased and the ones that are on the drawing board have been paused I think intelligently to take a look at capital conservation.   And of course, as I mentioned, we will be able to make a decision on those at the appropriate time as to moving forward and timing and the life, we are happy to have this portfolio and it will continue to be an important part of the Ventas\u2019 story.  \nQ - Omotayo Okusanya:   Got you. Okay. One more if you would indulge me. So, when Justin was announced as joining the team and you guys announced your kind of plans around senior housing stock outperformed that day. Today, you announced solid plans around Holiday the stock is outperforming. So, clearly, I think the market is looking for you guys to kind of rectify potential issues that people see in the portfolio.   Just kind of given that, I guess why you guys maybe not a little bit more aggressive in regards to kind of trying to address some of these issues, whether it is some of the triple-net portfolio that still has a weak rent coverage and things of that nature, it just kind of feels like the market is basically saying, do it. We are expecting you to do it, but in the near-term it is just doesn\u2019t seem to be happening as quickly as I think some of us anticipating.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Well, I would say that we over a long period of time have a good track record of taking action, and that we think is going to be beneficial for our shareholders and we have taken many actions to evidence that whether they have been with Kindred or today with Holiday and we will continue to do that.   We have made a ton of progress, we are proud of what we have done on the leadership front, as you mentioned along with the portfolio front and we will continue to do that with urgency and purpose. And hopefully we will continue to get rewarded for doing the right things at the right time.  \nQ - Omotayo Okusanya:   Okay that is helpful. Well I just feel like the runway is clearly open and everyone is waiting for you guys to take off.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Well, thank you. We appreciate that support. Our wings are flapping. Thank you, Tayo.  \nQ - Omotayo Okusanya:   Thank you.  \nEnd of Q&A:  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   I think we have one more operator. Anything further? Okay, if we don't have any further questions, I want to sincerely thank you for your time, your attention, your interest in Ventas. We have a great team here that is really committed to protecting and preserving the Company and for really delivering for all the stakeholders who depend upon us. So, we look forward to seeing you on the other side of this terrible pandemic and until then, stay safe and strong. We will see you soon. Bye-bye.  \nOperator:   Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.Ventas, Inc.

I would like to note that, we posted an investor presentation this morning on our website, which includes a COVID-19 business update to this helpful information that the team will reference in our prepared remarks.   With those formalities out of the way, I will hand it over to Debbie.  \nDebra Cafaro:   Thank you, Juan. and good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants and welcome to the Ventas' first quarter 2020 earnings call. I sincerely hope that, you and yours are safe and healthy.   Today, the Ventas team is working remotely, but we are together in spirit as we outline our outstanding first quarter results, describe the challenging conditions in the markets, the economy and or Company brought on by the terrible COVID-19 pandemic, discuss near-term business trends and evaluate the macro outlook.   At this time, we face unprecedented conditions nationally and globally created by the pandemic. Those of us in real estate has been around a long time have managed through many severe crises over the decades, including the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the great financial crisis, and the deep recession that followed both. Yet today's complex mix of public health, remote working, economic, operational and market conditions make this pandemic a uniquely challenging adversary.   Let me begin today by setting the stage and then outlining the swift and decisive actions we have taken to ensure that Ventas remains strong and stable. As we rolled into March, we were excited to see how our previously announced initiatives were gaining traction and making an impact and how well our overall enterprise and each of our business lines were performing.   You can see the power of our diversified business model in the strong normalized FFO per share results we reported today at $0.97 per share, inclusive of the financial impact of COVID-19 toward the end of the quarter. In short, we were hitting on all cylinders with terrific momentum.   As soon as, we realized the potential scope and impact of the novel Coronavirus in February and early in March, we identified as our key priority that health and safety of Ventas\u2019 employees and their family and the employees patients and senior living residents in our 1200 healthcare sites.   Although this particular crisis reflecting unique combination of forces, our experience, deep analysis based on early real time inputs and core principles have given us a solid framework for action.   Here are some of the strong measures we have taken to preserve and protect the Company and the many stakeholders who depend upon us. We have devoted significant efforts to support our tenants and operators across our portfolio during the COVID-19 pandemic.   We have established financial support programs for those who are experiencing financial hardship. We have assisted operators, who may be eligible for complex and various government programs, and we have leveraged our national scale to help operators source supplies, including scarce Personal Protective Equipment or PPE.   And today, we have announced a powerful new initiative for Ventas Senior Living Operators. Ventas will be providing access to COVID-19 testing kits and analysis from Mayo Clinic laboratories without charge to certain of our senior housing operators to further enhance safety at Ventas communities by accelerating employee testing.   Ventas and Atria working through Atria's ongoing relationship have secured access to testing capacity in excess of 30,000.   Atria is already nearly done testing all of this 14,000 U.S. on site and regional staff with approximately 9,000 results in less than 1% of Atria's employee tests have been returned positive.   Combined with digital tracking and tracing and appropriate use of PPE, Atria is building a new normal model to run its senior housing business safely and thoughtfully. In a positive sign, Atria has moved in 300 residents since early March all under full quarantine and PPE protocol.   Ventas plans to make available to certain of its other operators at least 10,000 COVID-19 test kits and analysis from Mayo Clinic Labs, ESL will be the next Ventas\u2019 operators to use this testing for its Ventas communities, and it is already getting ready to test all this staff in May.   We look forward to finding more ways to work with Mayo Clinic Labs and our operators to further enhance safety in our communities for residents and caregivers. We will continue to evaluate additional action as appropriate.   Second, on our action hit list, we move early to review and implement our pre-existing business continuity plan. So, we could maintain a high level of productivity and manage a seamless transition to remote working arrangements.   With an interdisciplinary team of Ventas leaders coordinating our efforts, strongly IT support and capabilities, full buy in by our employees and enhanced communication. The company experienced no downtime and we have been highly effective during these challenging times. I'm so proud of how Ventas employees have reacted in rally and I want to thank them for their extraordinary efforts.   Third, we are pleased that we have reached a positive consensual resolution of our Holiday lease. After receiving full rents from Holiday since lease inception in 2013, through the end of the first quarter 2020. We have now received an additional $100 million in cash and secured notes.   We have entered into a new management agreement with Holiday for a 26 independent living assets and we have terminated the Holiday lease all effective April 1. This management structure retains our upside in our 26 communities and provides us with operational flexibility. We appreciate Holiday management's engagement and cooperation to complete this transaction.   Fourth, we were excited to augment our leadership team with Justin Hutchens and Carey Roberts when they join Ventas on March the 4th. Justin and Carey have added new energy and insight to our tight knit group at this crucial time. They've already made many meaningful contributions to Ventas. As we have collaborated to analyze and attack the business challenges presented by the pandemic.   Our experience has instilled in us the importance of liquidity in a crisis. As a result, we shared the courage of our convictions in mid-March by drawing on our revolver and then issuing senior notes generating $3.3 billion in liquidity. This financial flexibility will serve us well as we manage through to the other side of the COVID-19 pandemic.   In addition, we further enhanced our financial flexibility by acting immediately to reduce 2020 capital expenditures by $300 million, mainly by pausing certain of our previously announced ground-up developments that were not yet substantially underway. We are also carefully reviewing other areas of our Company for cost savings, including general and administrative expenses.   At the same time, we promptly withdrew our financial guidance on March 17th, nearly two months ago, when our early analysis informed by real time data let us to conclude that our financial performance could be materially affected by the pandemic. Our foresight proved correct and we fulfilled our commitment to transparency to our stakeholders by the actions we took in a timely way.   Finally, Ventas has served and continues to work tirelessly as a proactive and evidence-based advocate for seniors as federal policy makers. Working with industry groups and in alliance with senior living CEOs, we are demonstrating the crucial role senior living care providers play in protecting our senior population that is particularly vulnerable to this novel Coronavirus.   While we have taken plenty of actions, policymakers have done exponentially more. The Fed, the administration and Congress have implemented a comprehensive array of bold policy actions to partially mitigate the virus' severe implications for public health, capital markets and the economy.   Many businesses and households, including many of our tenants and operators have already benefited from this arsenal of federal programs. With this powerful support and more financial relief likely to follow, it is our responsibility now to take action to safely and responsibly move our Company toward a new normal.   As we do so, our visibility is limited and uncertainty remains very high. Indeed, we faced the COVID-19 paradox on the one side, reputable models and even certain government projections show an expected increase in COVID-19 confirmed cases and mortality numbers in many jurisdictions. These expectations if they materialize, could derail even the best laid plans for economic recovery. And this morning we saw a historic levels of unemployment claims in the U.S.   On the other hand, there is palpable optimism in the air as most states plan staged re-openings of their economies and businesses, many companies including ours are preparing for a gradual return to office work, patients and physicians are scheduling appointments in elective procedures, families are making deposits for senior housing move in, universities are planning to welcome students in the fall, and most importantly, our best scientific and medical minds are racing to find treatment, cures and vaccines for the Coronavirus.   We are proud to say that, many of our key research and innovation university relationships and tenants, including Duke, Wake Forest, Penn, Yale, and Integral Molecular are at the forefront of this research. All these promising developments provide hope for a speedier and sustained bounce back.   We don't have to know how these opposing trends will play out. Our job is to preserve and protect our Company and our stakeholders, and be ready for a variety of scenarios and opportunities. Before closing, I want to address our dividends in the context of this COVID-19 uncertainty.   As you know, we declared and paid our last quarterly dividend in April. Because we normally pay our next dividend in July, our board will consider the dividends in mid to late June. As it always does, our responsible and experienced board will make a decision using it is good faith business judgment, taking into account all of the information available to it at that time.   In a situation like the fast moving rapidly changing global pandemic, we have the advantage of aggregating and analyzing the best and most current information available in order to make the optimal decision.   The cycle test events as team and the Company are well prepared to manage through current conditions and to take further action as necessary. Guided by our experience, analysis and ethics, we will safeguard our employees, our senior housing residents and caregivers, our capital and our reputation, so that Ventas will remain a leading healthcare property owner in the businesses and geographies where we invest a desirable employer and an attractive investment vehicle.   And now for the first time, I'm pleased to ask Justin Hutchins to address you about Venta\u2019s senior housing business.  \nJustin Hutchens:   Thanks, Debbie. Let me just start off by saying I'm extremely excited to be working with the Ventas team. Given the circumstances, I have certainly had the opportunity to jump right in and immediately put my operating experience to work.   I'm also happy to be working again with long standing colleagues and industry leaders like Atria, Brookdale, SDL, Holiday, and Sunrise. COVID notwithstanding, I see great opportunities ahead for Ventas in its senior housing business.   In my first Ventas earnings call, I would like to discuss the momentum of our SHOP, the same-store portfolio showed in the first quarter. Outline how Ventas has worked with integrity to support our tenants and operators during a very challenging time. Describe the operational and clinical environment in SHOP, in triple-net, delve into April and May trends and provide our outlook for safe and staged reopening in senior housing.   Our SHOP portfolio started the year ahead of our expectations and with good momentum. Sequentially, NOI and our same-store SHOP portfolio grew 2.3% in the first quarter with COVID costs embedded.   Without COVID impacts NOI grew 6% versus the fourth quarter, with credit due to solid sequential performance from Atria through strong rate growth and expense control, and some welcome stabilization from ESL.   As expected, the year-over-year same-store SHOP comparisons were negatively affected by six million in COVID costs incurred in the quarter. The reduction in occupancy as a result of COVID in the back half of March as well as the previously discussed lower star point heading into 2020. Ex-COVID costs the year-over-year, same-store NOI would have declined 6.9%, better than our expectations given the difficult prior year comparison.   While we are mostly focused on the impact of COVID-19 to our operating performance, it is worth noting new construction starts in senior housing continue to decelerate with the first quarter of 2020, having the lowest number of new starts in several years at 1,000 units in Ventas markets.   Moving to our support for senior housing tenants and operators. I have been proud that Ventas has been out front and willing to work with integrity in support of our senior housing tenants, who are on the front lines of caring for seniors. This support has taken many forms.   I will just focus on some creative programs we have offered to our triple-net tenants. The company offered support to its triple-net senior housing tenants affected by the COVID-19 pandemic by implementing a 25% rent deferral program in April to enable them to care for seniors, purchase needed supplies and pay employees. This program ultimately reduced April cash rent receipts by approximately $3 million.   Adjusting for this tenant support program, tenants paid substantially all triple-net senior housing rents in April. For the month of May, the company offered qualified senior housing tenants the opportunity to pay up to 25% of their rent with cash as escrows and security deposits and based on participating tenants, we expect about $2 million of our rent to be paid this way.   We are encouraged to see that, some of our tenants have availed themselves of government relief programs for which they are eligible. We will continue to engage in constructive ongoing dialogue with our triple-net tenants regarding their COVID-19 challenges on a case-by-case basis.   We have many tools available to us to work through a near-term conditions including our backstop of corporate and personal guarantees in over $100 million of security deposits that stand behind these lease obligations.   Turning to the clinical and operational environment. These trying times underlined the importance of partnering with true industry leaders. We have been inspired by the tireless work of our operating partners to keep seniors safe.   Senior housing operators across the industry continue to aggressively implement protocols to protect against COVID-19. The result of these protocols is that almost all operators are only offering virtual tours and at the present time, about 29% of our 400 SHOP communities have suspended their move-ins.   In terms of the clinical impact on our SHOP portfolio as of April 30, it is a tale of two cities. Having a large New York and New Jersey footprint is a strategic advantage for Ventas, but those States where the epicenter for the COVID-19 infection and mortality rate.   On a full portfolio basis, about a quarter of our SHOP communities experienced at least one positive COVID-19 resident diagnosis since the beginning of the pandemic, registering accumulative percentage of resident cases at slightly over 2% of the resident population. Excluding New York and New Jersey, these figures improved dramatically with only 1% of our residents cumulatively effective since day one.   In our triple-net senior housing portfolio benefiting from geographic diversification, the percentage of resident cases is 1%. As is best practice, the care providers to great lengths to isolate or transfer to a higher acuity setting, the limited number of residents who receive positive diagnosis.   Brookdale in particular has been compassionate, but also fairly disciplined and rigorous in its preparation for and management of COVID conditions for the benefit of residents and their families.   In SHOPs, as a result of restricted access to communities nationally, April move-ins approximated 25% of typical levels. While overall move-outs were largely in-line with historic patterns. April average occupancy was approximately 82.4%. As of May 1, spot occupancy was estimated as 80.7% representing a 330 basis points declined since the beginning of April based on interim information provided by Ventas operators.   When excluding New York and New Jersey, occupancy would have declined to 280 basis points. Operating expenses are trending around 10% higher, particularly for labor and supplies, including PPE. These revenue and expense trends we are seeing for April, are expected to continue in May.   Financial and operational trends are expected to be directionally similar for our triple-net portfolio in the second quarter. For senior housing overall, as we look beyond the second quarter, there are three critical considerations we are monitoring that will materially affect the outlook for senior housing.   One, timing of reopening of communities to physical tours and move-ins. Two, cost and access to labor. Three, local demand characteristics including evolving protocols required to protect against the virus. The timing of openings will be driven by state specific guidelines, CDC guidelines and local community considerations. Ventas along with our operating partners is closely tracking state specific guidelines and COVID infection curves in each of our markets.   I'm encouraged to report that we have roughly 300 deposits for move-ins, which is a good sign of ongoing demand for our senior housing communities. Senior housing operators will find success in many ways, including and most importantly building trust with prospective residents and their families by demonstrating a concerted effort to keep communities free of infection. To do so, we anticipate elevated levels of costs over the course of the next several months.   Trust and confidence in senior housing or the near-term will be supported with best in class infection control practices, availability of PPE and testing residents and employees. As Debbie described, Ventas has played an important role alongside our operators and tenants to combat into pandemic and helping operators prepare to open successfully.   Through this challenging stretch, we continue to resolutely believe in the long-term value that senior living offers residents and their families and are sharply focused on positioning Ventas\u2019 senior housing business for long term success.   With that, I will hand the floor to Pete to discuss our office business.  \nPeter Bulgarelli:   Thanks Justin. We are certainly glad to have you and Carey on board. I will quickly touch on the first quarter results for our office segment, which represents 27% to Ventas NOI and then focus on the latest trends in our latest second quarter COVID framework.   For the first quarter of 2020 office same-store cash NOI increased by 5.8% year-on-year. This outstanding results was fueled by our R&I portfolio, which grew 22% driven by strong lease up and complimented by strong performance from the MOB portfolio.   In R&I, first quarter average rent per square foot was up 9.4% and occupancy was robust at just under 97%. Strong performance at our university based developments affiliated with University of Pennsylvania and Philadelphia and Washington University in St. Louis fueled our growth. Complimenting the fast growing R&I business is our MOB business. MOB same-store cash NOI for the first quarter of 2020 increased 1.9% year-on-year, also above our expectations.   Now let's shift to the latest COVID trends we are seeing in our office portfolio. I will start with medical office. Our top priority has been to partner with our tenants and the associated health systems to ensure the safety of health professionals, patients and our employees.   We have sourced substantial amounts of PPE, coordinated visitor screening, licensed short-term spaces, set up drive-through testing centers in our parking lots, provide a supplemental cleaning and otherwise supported our tenants during this challenging time.   We are happy to report that all of our buildings are open and none of our site based employees have tested positively for COVID-19. We sincerely thank all of our on-site employees and partners who fight the fight every day. We are very proud of them. I will also say regarding our MOB business, that parking receipts have slowed and while safety concerns have caused an increase in cleaning costs.   Given the current uncertainty, the pace of new leasing has slowed. However, we still leased 573,000 square feet during the first quarter and 381,000 square feet during April, with an additional 200,000 square feet of leases at the letter of intent stage.   Also, tenant retention has increased. I'm proud to say that MOB reported record retention of 83% for the trailing 12-months, 90% retention for the first quarter, 94% retention for March and an outstanding 98% in April.   Turning to our R&I portfolio. Our R&I buildings are a 100% open and are supporting critical research focused on the detection, prevention, and cure of COVID-19. We are proud to be partnered with leading research institutions such as Yale, Penn Gene Therapy Center, Wake Forest Health Sciences, Virginia Commonwealth University, Integral Molecular, Alexion and others in fighting this virus.   And we look forward to expanding our portfolio with other leading research institutions such as Arizona State and University of Pittsburgh in new under construction, world-class research building.   As previously mentioned, our R&I portfolio is 97% leased with an active leasing pipeline. Last phase continues to be in high demand. Net-net as of April 30th, we had 91.5% occupancy in our office business, representing 150 basis points year-on-year increase from April 2019. From March 31st through April 30th, we experienced a 10 basis point increase in occupancy for MOB and a 10 basis point increase for R&I.   So, let's talk rent payments. During the first quarter, our tenants paid essentially 100% of the office rent. Our historical bad debt expense has only been 20 basis points. We have high quality tenants that pay their rent.   In April, our tenants paid 96% of office rents. We expect a significant proportion of the unpaid rent to be ultimately collected. And I\u2019m encouraged that so far in May, our office tenants have paid nearly 80% of the rents due, to-date we are seeing a faster payment rate than what we experienced in April.   I will say the tenants experiencing the most pressure are the smaller third party position groups in MOB, the smaller private companies in R&I and retail. Taken together, these customer segments represent a relatively small portion of our office portfolio. We are supporting these tenants by raising awareness and assisting them with securing federal relief.   On a selective basis, we are also offering to differ May rent for these small tenants to be repaid no later than the fourth quarter. To-date only a small number of tenants who have utilized the rents deferral opportunity.   Supporting the durability of our office portfolio are a couple of our additional facts. First, our MOB portfolio is largely on campus 71%. We also have a high level of acuity in our buildings, with 88% of our physician tenants being specialists. Our buildings and our tenants are essential to the delivery of care during this difficult time. Less than 10% of our tenant suites closed during the pandemic.   Second, as of May 7th, over 80% of the MOB NOI is in states that have either reopened for elective procedures or have announced the resumption of elective procedures. In locations that have reopened, we are seeing material increases in activity, although still below pre-COVID levels.   As a reminder that our nation is resilient and that normalcy returns following catastrophes. I'm happy to report that Ventas is delivering [Technical Difficulty] that was devastated by Hurricane Michel in 2018.   With that happy news, I will pass the turn to Bob to finish up our prepared remarks.  \nRobert Probst:   Thank you Pete. I will start with our triple-net lease portfolio overall before I close with some enterprise level commentary. The triple-net portfolio grew same-store cash NOI by 3.9% year-over-year in the first quarter. Growth was driven by in-place lease escalations, and a $3 million cash fee received in the quarter from capital senior living.   Trailing 12-months coverage as of the fourth quarter of 2019, for the overall triple-net portfolio for triple-net senior housing remains stable at 1.5 times and 1.1 times respectively. Post acute coverage declined sequentially by 10 basis points to 1.3 times, due to a decline in volumes at Kindred, driven by managed care and purposeful reduction of non-compliant patients.   Adjusting for the 25% rent deferral program in senior housing, we collected close to 100% of our overall expected triple-net portfolio rents in April. We have already received almost a 100% of triple-net healthcare rent for May and we are on-track with triple-net senior housing May collections.   We expect the impact of COVID on our triple-net healthcare rents from acute care providers to be muted in the second quarter. Acute care hospitals have been impacted by the reduction of elective procedures, but have had significant access to government funding and support.   Additionally for Ardent, as of May 1st, all 10 of the Ventas owned hospitals have reopened or will reopen in May for elective procedures. For the post acute providers in our triple-net health care portfolio, volume trends have varied. Deltek, Ventas has been higher than budgeted, the costs have increased. We expect that the concern over respiratory disease will enhance Kindred Deltek business going forward.   Urban census initially declined due to lower surgeries and acute care volumes, but census has improved since mid April. Smiths are experiencing notably higher mortality rates with census down dramatically and the most profitable rehab patients also down. Positive post-acute trends include access to government funding, relief from site neutral pricing, waiver of length of stay requirements and the 2% sequestration delay.   I will close with some comments regarding the overall enterprise and our financial position. I want to underscore how pleased we are with our first quarter results including property performance ahead of our expectations, record quarterly revenues, strong FFO delivery of $0.97 per share and enhanced balance sheet 5.7 times of net debt to EBITDA and excellent liquidity. And we took decisive action in the face of the pandemic to bolster our financial flexibility.   In March, we drew $2.75 billion under our $3 billion revolver and followed it up in early April with a $500 million senior note issuance. As a result, as of May 6th, Ventas has approximately $3.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand with no commercial paper outstanding. We also have very limited debt maturing in 2020 or 2021 and we have the ability to extend our revolver for up to one year.   We plan to bolster financial flexibility by reducing 2020 total capital expenditures by nearly 300 million to a total of 500 million with the decline led by pausing ground-up developments not yet substantially underway. Notably one used to be in Philadelphia and 42/10 in St. Louis.   Our ongoing development projects are on average 81% free leaks to high quality credit tenants in the R&I business. I note that Ventas has a $400 million committed construction line of credit to fund development with $250 million of available capacity as of the end of March. Ventas is expected unfunded investment in all of ground up developments in 2020 net of committed financing is approximately $100 million.   In addition to conserving CapEx, the company is reviewing its cost structures across the enterprise, including its SG&A and organizational costs. As Debbie says, we are on it.   Given our early understanding of the potential impacts of the pandemic, Ventas went through a previously issued financial guidance on March 17th. We believe the adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition will be driven by many factors, most of which are outside of the Company's control and ability to forecast.   Wherever provide investors with incremental observations and transparency, we included today the investor deck outlining our COVID response and latest business trends, as well as expanded disclosure as summarized on Page 44 of the supplemental.   To close we are pleased with our start to year and with the actions taken thus far, and are committed to continuing to take the actions necessary to manage through these unprecedented times. That concludes our prepared remarks.   Before we start with Q&A, we are limiting each caller to two questions given a busy calendar request from a few analysts to be respectful of everyone on the line. Also, given the fact that we are all remote, we will have Debby quarterback to the QA and to pass questions to the Ventas\u2019 team if needed.   With that, I will turn the call back to the operator.  \nOperator:   [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Nick Joseph from Citi.  \nQ - Nicholas Joseph:   Thank you, I appreciate all the color and specifically on April and May rent collections for net lease. You addressed Holiday this morning, but you expect additional net lease restructurings over the next few months?  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Good morning Nick its Debby. I'm going to ask Justin to comment on that.  \nA - Justin Hutchens:   Thank you Debby. First of all, I think it is important to know, our biggest priority is that our operators are looking out for the health and safety of our residents in our communities. That is priority number one, in the near-term.   I will also point two, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks that we have already started to take action, we mentioned the rent deferral in April, we mentioned the opportunity for tenants to pay down rent - pay some of their rent with their cash escrows in May and that the Holiday restructuring.   What we are committed to do is to take action that is going to give us the best opportunity to create value in a portfolio and work with our operators to determine the best outcome. It is still early, some uncertainty ahead of us still, but we will certainly be watching everything closely.  \nQ - Michael Bilerman:   Debby it is Michael Bilerman.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Hey Michael.  \nQ - Michael Bilerman:   I think Bob mentioned in his comments about sort of looking at all forms of cost within the enterprise. Can you sort of address corporate management sort of pay levels and whether that is on the docket and how investors should think about that interest in the governance perspective, whether there would be any changes from the chairman and CEO role which you continue to maintain?  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Sure, and I'm happy to talk about that and turn it over to Bob, for a little bit more detail. But most of our executive compensation is very aligned with shareholders and is the vast majority of which is in the form of performance based equity compensation.   When you think about the overall enterprise, I'm going to turn it over to Bob to talk about some of the insights he has about making sure that the company is efficient and cognizant of the environment that we are in.  \nA - Robert Probst:   Sure. This is an analysis Michael, that again pre-COVID that is the analysis of our SG&A. We are well underway in that analysis. Everything I would say is on the table, as we think about that. I would expect to have some more news this quarter as we are well underway on that analysis and we do see opportunity. But at the end of the day, we have a 20-year record of being efficient and effective and that continues to be our goal and we have a duty to make sure we are doing that.  \nQ - Michael Bilerman:   And Debby is there anything on splitting the Chairman and CEO role?  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   I think that, consistent with the idea that one of the cost efficient, our expectation is that, I would continue to hold those roles, obviously serving at the pleasure of our shareholders and our Board of Directors.  \nQ - Michael Bilerman:   Okay. Thank you.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Thank you.  \nOperator:   Your next question comes from Rich Anderson from SMBC.  \nQ - Rich Anderson:   Hey, thanks. Good morning everyone and hello to you, Justin.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Hi, Rich.  \nQ - Richard Anderson:   Hey thanks. Good morning everyone and hello to you Justin. So, just on the on the Holiday and maybe an extrapolation from that. So EBITDA below rent, so it is obviously a dilutive transaction. But understanding kind of the thought process on taking Sabra\u2019s roadmap on Holiday. And so, I'm curious in the aftermath of all this, do you feel like net lease is becoming an increasingly dying breed for Ventas and you want more control that goes through Brookdale and others or is this a one-off type of thing and you still think that there is a role for triple-net to play in senior housing in the aftermath of all this?  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Good to talk with you, Rich. Let me take that. A couple of things. One is we are pleased with the Holiday transaction. We think it really does a lot of good things and we are happy to take a page out of our friends with matrices book, and we preserved that upside in the assets and a lot of operational flexibility. So, we feel good about that and look forward to optimizing that portfolio.   In terms of the triple-net lease, what I would say is, triple-net leases are a little bit like mortgages in one sense, which is that they magnify ups and downs for the operators and in any challenging environment, they are going to be disfavored. And of course that is the situation we find ourselves in now. In other environments, they could be very attractive to both land owners as well as the operators.   So, I think there is many tools in the bag, many I guess you would say clubs in the bag, tools in the toolkit, and the triple-net lease I think will continue to be one. And there are many ways that you can customize leases also to create alignment.   So, we think the triple-net lease will survive and we think we will continue to be creative and collaborative in how we work with our operators, be they tenants or managers in optimizing our portfolio and then being good partners.  \nQ - Richard Anderson:   Okay. I prefer arrows in the quiver, but that is just me.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   That is a good one too. Absolutely.  \nQ - Richard Anderson:   And then juxtapose U.S. to Canadian, particularly as it relates to your recent investment there. And how things are kind of performing relatively.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Yes. I mean, our investment most, we have a significant Canadian portfolio. Obviously, the pandemic has affected assets there as well. Those operators have also received significant government support and one thing we have liked about the Quebec portfolio with LGM is that they have a younger healthier population a longer lengths of stay.   They are very rigorous and have been very active from early on working to protect the residents. Obviously, that portfolio will be effected as well. But there are some characteristics of the LGM portfolio that make it probably a better performer on a relative basis, despite being impacted by pandemic.  \nQ - Richard Anderson:   Okay, great. Thanks very much. Good luck everyone.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Thank you. great talking to you Rich.  \nOperator:   Your next question comes from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank.  \nQ - Nicholas Yulico:   Good morning everyone. So, in terms of the Holiday restructuring just to make sure understanding how this is going to work. I guess in terms of the money that you are receiving from them the cash, and then the notes and are you going to be actually booking any income from those two items in the second quarter and in terms of the notes, the 9% rate is there any component that cash interest that you are receiving?  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Great question. Yes, the cash and notes are effectively income and I think we mentioned this in the release and so those will be included in net income and yes we actually would expect as part of our ongoing this for ongoing notes we would expect to book and receive some amount of interest income as we go forward.  \nQ - Nicholas Yulico:   Is any of that cash income from those notes?  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   We would expect it to be cash. Yes.  \nQ - Nicholas Yulico:   Okay, thanks. And then I was just hoping to get a feel for you I know you gave us a coverage on Holiday as a trailing number. Is it possible to get the quarterly first quarter EBITDARM for those assets so we can understand exactly from an NOI standpoint as you now have this operating NOI. What the delta is going to be between the old 60 million of cash NOI you got on the lease versus on a real time basis, realizing things are going to move around still, but at least on the first quarter number record what that looks like from a operating EBITDARM basis?  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Right, I mean we have had Holiday in the heat map, obviously and it had been below a 101 and EBITDARM basis. So, as we reported the last time and really what I would say is that just like everything else in the portfolio as you point out, it is really going to depend on how the pandemic really plays out and so I think we will just defer that as we get more real time information about the portfolio. I'm happy to talk to you about it as things progress.  \nQ - Nicholas Yulico:   Right, I guess, but I mean you guys do have an actual number I'm assuming that for the first quarter and so I was trying to see if we can least get that number so we can use that as a base to then build off some assumptions.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Yes, I mean, I think you should, you should look at about a 0.9 EBITDARM coverage, something like that in the first quarter, rough numbers.  \nQ - Nicholas Yulico:   Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Thank you.  \nOperator:   Your next question from Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Hello.  \nQ - Vikram Malhotra:   Sorry. I had myself on mute. I just hope everyone in the team is okay and doing well.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Thank you.  \nQ - Vikram Malhotra:   Debbie, you referenced the dividend in your prepared remarks and I just want to clarify one. I'm assuming the dividend is all cash today and just as we think about the dividend going to second quarter, what are sort of the metrics? What are you looking at? Maybe give us a sense of where AFFO versus the dividend could trend even just percentage wise. What are some of your put and takes if you think about the dividend?  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Thank you. Yes, I mean, I think really want to just touch on the fact that, while we are in this period of uncertainty, we generally want to match our decision making speed with what is required. And our Board is going to look at all relevant information when it addresses the dividend, as I mentioned in mid to late June.  \nQ - Vikram Malhotra:   Okay. And the dividend is all cash currency.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   It has been. Yes, Vikram.  \nQ - Vikram Malhotra:   Okay. And then just second, as you I think you and Bob outlaid the expectations for occupancy in the next few months and it was about a 100 basis points per month in the [RIDEA] (Ph) portfolio. Can you give it a sort of a broader sense of what the ins and outs are in terms of assumptions for move-ins versus move-out and as an aside, if we could request more monthly or more weekly updates, that would be great.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   I'm going to ask Bob to address that Vikram.  \nA - Robert Probst:   Sure. I will give you some building blocks Vikram using April as our case study here. We saw move-ins approximately 25% of our historic levels or down 75%, to put the other way. The move-outs have trended pretty consistently with historical patterns and the net of that is approximately a 70 basis point impact on occupancy on a weekly basis.   One way to think about revenue impact is that, and this is the Page 7 of the investor deck. If you haven't seen this is, a 100 basis points of occupancy generally, sequentially on average is about $2 million to $3 million of revenue per month. So, you can do math there.   And we expect that trend as we see it right now to carry on into May. On the expense side, we mentioned about 10% OpEx increase, driven by labor and supplies including PP&E. We had about $125 million of monthly OpEx in our portfolio in SHOP. So, it gives you some more facts if you like to do the math.  \nQ - Vikram Malhotra:   Okay.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Vikram, we thought you love those rules of thumb.  \nQ - Vikram Malhotra:   I guess I was just trying to understand the move from the 330 basis points loss in the month of April down to a 100 per month. And I was just trying to understand more specifically like what are you assuming changes from April to May through June?  \nA - Robert Probst:   Let me clarify, just to make sure we are on the same page. The 330 basis points was the spot-to-spot effectively beginning to end of April, occupancy moves. And my 100 basis points was simply a rule of thumb to help you.   So, that is an important clarification, beyond what we are seeing in April and early May, I'm not able to project what I think is going to be for the second quarter, for example. But those will give you some building blocks to make your own assumptions.  \nA - Justin Hutchens:   This is Justin. And I'm going to add a little color to that might be helpful and I will just preface this that I'm going to give you April average occupancy numbers that are presented by our operators and these are fully vetted, we only report these numbers.   But I'm going to compare March first. So March average occupancy was 85%, April average is at 82.4%. So, there is 260 basis points difference. If you take New York and New Jersey out, as I did in my prepared remarks when I was using spot occupancy, March average is 85.1, April at 82.9. So, the 220 basis point change.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   And that is shows the difference between really the quote and unquote spot, beginning of month to end of month versus the average occupancies for the month. So, let's carry on. Thank you.  \nQ - Vikram Malhotra:   Thank you.  \nOperator:   Your next question comes from Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets.  \nQ - Michael Carroll:   Yes, thanks. Debbie, I just wonder if you could you add some color on the testing capabilities that you are providing your operators. I don't know if you said this, if I missed it, but are you able to provide enough tests for all the restaurants at the facilities or what in depth are you able to offer right now if that relationship?   \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Great. Good morning. So, we are very excited about this initiative and we are taking the first step with Atria and it is really to accelerate employee e-testing at Ventas buildings with select operators to make our communities safer, and facilitate thoughtful reopening and confidence and trust as Justin talked about.   And so, we have this first compliment of 10,000 testing kits with Mayo Lab\u2019s analysis, which is very important, they have a very high accuracy rate at Mayo, as you would imagine and we really think this is a great first step that we can make available. Atria has already done it, ESL will be next and we will make it available to select operators, principally for their employee testing program.   Once we see how that goes again, we are early days are, still a lot of uncertainty, new testing and tools coming out all the time, we will determine if we want to are-up or if we want to take a different step moving forward, but we think this is a great opportunity to do the right thing and really have a differentiated partnership with our operators and really build that trust and confidence with residents and their families that is so sorely needed.  \nQ - Michael Carroll:   And then what is the turnaround time. How long does it take to get to tests and I guess if you have confidence that at least your employees are not affected by COVID. Is there discussion that you could reopen those communities or is it still too early to tell?  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   The turnaround is a day or two and it will indeed build confidence as a component of the thoughtful reopening and admissions plan.  \nA - Justin Hutchens:   And I will just add one other point to that. This is Justin. All of our operators are considering the move-in protocols at this point, and about 70% of our operators are operating in states that are starting to loosen their stay-at-home policy. So this is a very active conversation.   And the advantage that testing gives you, obviously it gives you a lot more certainty around the potential for spread of infection. But the other advantage is, it is recognized in the CDC guidelines. If testing occurs, then it can accelerate the time that someone can move in, where the regular quarantine is around 14-days and the testing allows for something closer to two or three days.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Okay. Right. And that is a good point, because the test may also be available for new residents in certain cases. Thank you. Mike.  \nQ - Michael Carroll:   Okay. Great. Thanks.  \nOperator:   Your next question comes from Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital Markets.  \nQ - Jordan Sadler:   Thank you, and I hope everybody is doing well.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Thanks Jordan. We are.  \nQ - Jordan Sadler:   Okay. My first question I think is maybe for Bob, I will leave it to Debby to quarterback. But regarding the revolver draw down and I think some subsequent repayments post a senior note issuance in April. You did mentioned in your conversation that, Ventas is past the peak for mortality in your SHOP assets and in triple net.   And so, I guess I'm kind of curious, I know you are waiting till the last minute to make a decision on a dividend, but what do you want to see these to be the virus before in order to sort of pay down those borrowings and sort of what is that sort of draw down, is that reflecting concerns around the ability to potentially borrow?  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Well, I will turn it over to Bob, but one thing we know for sure is that, having went through many decades of this that, having assured liquidity is the number one, two and three attributes that you want to have to manage successfully through any kind of uncertainty. And so, we have that and that is kind of a golden rule, and it served us very, very well.   In terms of the pass of the peak, again, there are numerous models. There is a lot of uncertainty, but as of a point in time, I'm glad that you noticed data that shows that a lot of our NOI in our senior housing on those triple-net and SHOP is in states where according to a single model as of a certain day, the peak of mortality is behind us. Now that could change again and that of course would affect our outlook.  \nQ - Jordan Sadler:   That is helpful. I guess I'm trying to understand the difference between, that assured liquidity as it relates to sort of that revolver borrowing or draw downs versus the dividend that you actually pay. So, there is some uncertainty surrounding the potential to be able to draw or have access to cash. But, it seems like you are not yet willing to sort of cut the dividend down to zero in order to sort of stay off or protect yourself from any uncertainty or maybe I'm misreading that.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Yes. I mean, I think what we have said clearly about the dividends is that the board will make that decision at the right time, which are dividends is a July dividends historically and so that would basically defer that decision to be made by our board until mid to late June. So, do you have a question for Bob about the revolver draw just Jordon?  \nQ - Jordan Sadler:   I think you answered it. But maybe you mentioned Justin. I wanted a welcome back to him back to REIT land. Unfortunately, under these crazy circumstances, but I would have asked him for a review of the portfolio probably not fully appropriate.   Debbie, a couple years ago, you spun off the skilled nursing portfolio at a time when there was no real distress in that sector. Any thoughts surrounding, management and or the potential spin of the seniors housing portfolio or are we just that way too soon, I don't mean to be flippant at all in that question.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Yes, I think that under skilled nursing, I think I'm glad you reminded us that, that we really did that, at the absolute peak time in valuations at a seven cap on rent at that time. And we really continue to believe that was a very sound strategic decision, particularly as we look at infection mortality rates in skilled nursing now.   I think we given all the uncertainty right now we are focused on health and safety as Justin said really just strong effort to keep Ventas strong and stable and get ready for any scenario and the opportunities in the future. So, we will defer that discussion if you don't mind.  \nQ - Jordan Sadler:   Okay. That is fir. Thank you.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Thanks Jordan.  \nOperator:   Your next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein from Bank of America.  \nQ - Joshua Dennerlein:   Hey good morning everyone. Glad you are doing well.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   I clearly had too many people with the first initial J in my life. Anyways go ahead I will try to get it right this time.  \nQ - Joshua Dennerlein:   I'm just curious on the Holiday switch to the management contract. Was that something you were in discussion with before the pandemic or was it really the pandemic was the drivers that kind of got you going on that discussion?  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Well, we have talked about Holiday for a while and have been pretty clear about what the performance was over the past couple of years. I think we were in a good spot, because Holiday remains current and paying full rent all the way through the first quarter and they have been great about that and we were the sole beneficiary of the guarantors.   So, of course, we had a EBITDAR kind of one-to-one coverage. So, we felt like we were in a good spot. But we did feel mutually that it was the right time to take a different approach and we did so in a way that we think was beneficial for both and preserved upside and on operational flexibility.    So, we are happy that we have done it, and we are going to optimize that portfolio especially now that Justin is here.  \nQ - Joshua Dennerlein:   Okay, and then just on the senior housing triple-net rents. I see in your presentation you mentioned I guess sort of May rents are allowing up to 25% of the rent to get paid from the deposits, you expect two million or so to be paid. Do you have a sense of like I guess like back into it, but what percent of tenants are taking advantage of that and I guess later on would you require the tenants to kind of back fill those deposits?  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Right Justin.  \nA - Justin Hutchens:   Yes. It is actually very low percentage, if you think about around 30 million of rent per month and only round two million or up to two million we think will be paid with the cash escrows s to carry deposits. So not a lot.   I will mention two other things on the triple-net, one is that as we said it is our May collections are really right on track, so looking good in May. Also some of April tenants that took advantage of that deferral have already paid back.   So that was good encouraging sign as well, and in that case, there were smaller operators that had advantage of government assistance. But our tap was to Allow some liquidity for operators during a very tough and uncertain time, and we are happy that some of the operators have taken advantage of that.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Thank you.  \nOperator:   Your next question comes from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets.  \nQ - John Kim:   Hey good morning everyone and welcome Justin.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Hi John.  \nQ - John Kim:   I had question on your deposits, that were mentioned - deposits in senior housing, is there any difference regionally for the New York, New Jersey to have more of sure deposits than some of the other markets not impacted by the virus?  \nA - Justin Hutchens:   Hello, this is Justin. Let me just mention first of all, we don\u2019t normally track deposits, because senior housing particularly assisted living, and memory care are what we focused is need driven. So tracking deposits is usually a very short-term indictor of move-in.   But given the environment we started to track recently a lot of those deposits are in Sunrise and Sunrise has kind of a north east footprint with us. So there is certainly some New York and Massachusetts are few for our Sunrise footprint, a lot of those deposits are with them.   There is another stab I will mention, that is round lead which is something that we do track regularly and leads have stabilized over the past few weeks about half of our lead volume, which is you know encouraging in a sense, because it shows that there is still ongoing demand.   Even though we are not doing physical tours, and we are doing virtual tours and in-lue of those there is still ongoing demand and is ahead of that moving pace that we have been experiencing so far. But there is long answer to short question and that is not ready to really point out specific geographies except to say that Sunrise is a big part of those deposits.  \nQ - John Kim:   And then Pete mentioned in his prepared remarks the high retention rate you guys had in the medical office business. Can you provide some terms on that, are these short-term, but month-to-month lease expansions and also what the cash leasing spreads were?  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Pete.  \nA - Peter Bulgarelli:   So, John, let me just be sure that I understand what you are asking. Well, we talked about was 96% receipt of cash rents overall in the office portfolio. Is that what you are asking?  \nQ - John Kim:   No. I was talking about the retention rates, the renewal rates.  \nA - Peter Bulgarelli:   I see. Okay, so of our retention rates, yes, the 90% for the quarter and 94% for March and for April is at 98%, which is a phenomenal set of numbers. And yes, I would say it is a mix in some cases are short-term where they are just uncertain about their future.   And so they want to, just take a year extension. In other cases we use the opportunity to take advantage of maybe some rent relief in exchange for a couple years of additional term. So, we have been fairly entrepreneurial in doing that.   And then there is also some practical reasons, I will tell you kind of an interesting story of an [OVGYN] (Ph), who was 70 something years old who was going to retire. But then he sat back and he thought you know what with his shelter at home, maybe there is going to be a lot of bursts next time, in nine-months from now. So, I'm going to extend for one more year. I'm going to work and cash in on this opportunity. So, it is been a mixture of things.  \nQ - John Kim:   Great. Thank you.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Thanks John.  \nOperator:   Your next question comes from Lukas Hartwich from Green Street Advisors.  \nQ - Lukas Hartwich:   Great, thanks. Whenever we do come out the other side of the COVID pandemic. I'm just curious what you think the recovery in SHOP looks like. Do you expect there to be pent up demand or expect do you expect something more gradual?  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Well, I think our focus right now is really getting through the biggest part of the pandemic Lucas and then there remains really a lot of uncertainty about the depths and then the time period where it will be most active and then what the slope and pace to recovery will look like and those could very significantly affect what the recovery and senior housing looks like.   So, we are really happy for the day when we can discuss that with more specificity in terms of timing, pay and slope. But right now, we are focused on maximizing during the course of the toughest period of pandemic.  \nQ - Lukas Hartwich:   Great and then the second one for me is just. Can you provide a little more color on the performance trends of the Sunrise shop portfolio?  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Justin.  \nA - Justin Hutchens:   Yep, sure. So, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the year-over-year stats that were down and the reasons for that, given the fact that we are starting off at a lower starting point. I also mentioned the strong sequential performance.   That performance was driven by Atria and ESL. Sunrise was not as big acontributor to that. There are some less good performance from the sunrise portfolio during that time, so it was actually contributing on a sequential basis, closer to down around 9%.  \nQ - Lukas Hartwich:   Thank you.  \nOperator:   Your next question comes from Omotayo Okusanya form Mizuho.  \nQ - Omotayo Okusanya:   Yes. Good morning everyone. Justin, good to have you back from Jolly Old England old cap.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Hi.  \nQ - Omotayo Okusanya:   Hi Debbie.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Good.  \nQ - Omotayo Okusanya:   Good. I'm glad to hear that. A couple of questions. The first one is actually on the office side. The 96% of April rent collected, is there way you could help us break it down kind of what you know the rates of MOB versus Life Sciences or other differences there?  \nA - Pete Bulgarelli:   Hey Tayo. This is Pete. How are you? So, the 96% we are very, very pleased with, and one of the items I did want to point out is that those are receipts. Deferrals are not included in that number, and as a matter of fact for April, there were almost zero deferrals.   We are talking like $150,000 worth of deferrals in April, and those were for retail tenants. So, this is true cash receipts and collected in a very positive way. The MOB Portfolio had a slightly higher collection rate for April and the R&I had a slightly lower number. But really nothing material.   It is interesting that many of the universities are just - they do hand checks. They actually write checks out and it is a slower process in a normal month and it is a slower process in a turbulent month. So, that is my assessment.  \nQ - Omotayo Okusanya:   Okay.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   So. I mean those portfolios performed very well.  \nQ - Omotayo Okusanya:   Gotcha. Okay. And then on the Life Sciences side, again very strong same-store NOI this quarter, again it has been a positive on the overall Ventas story. So I guess, a little bit surprised when we looked at the development pipeline that is the projects that were halted or all kinds of Life Science Wexford projects and there was one other projects also Life Sciences, where the completion date was deferred or pushed back a year. So, just kind of curious kind of thinking about that business that is such a big positive on your overall story. And again, a part of what is kind of happening on the development front later you know halting or delaying some of these development projects.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   You are absolutely right. We are happy that, we have grown our office portfolio in particularly this exciting Life Science University based portfolio over the past years, it is really, you are seeing the benefit of that right now.   Both in the fact that is where all the action is on the virus and the vaccines in the search for a cure, as well as the diversification benefits we are getting from that portfolio, within the broader Ventas Enterprise.   And so, it is a significant capital allocation priority. We do have a number of ongoing projects with Arizona State and [Pitt] to name a few. And basically, what we did as a matter of I think, really good discipline and approach is that, when we really understood quickly the potential from this Coronavirus, we aggressively paused on the two developments that really were not yet significantly underway.   And so the ones that are ongoing are going to be delivered and we will have our 80% pre-leased and the ones that are on the drawing board have been paused I think intelligently to take a look at capital conservation.   And of course, as I mentioned, we will be able to make a decision on those at the appropriate time as to moving forward and timing and the life, we are happy to have this portfolio and it will continue to be an important part of the Ventas\u2019 story.  \nQ - Omotayo Okusanya:   Got you. Okay. One more if you would indulge me. So, when Justin was announced as joining the team and you guys announced your kind of plans around senior housing stock outperformed that day. Today, you announced solid plans around Holiday the stock is outperforming. So, clearly, I think the market is looking for you guys to kind of rectify potential issues that people see in the portfolio.   Just kind of given that, I guess why you guys maybe not a little bit more aggressive in regards to kind of trying to address some of these issues, whether it is some of the triple-net portfolio that still has a weak rent coverage and things of that nature, it just kind of feels like the market is basically saying, do it. We are expecting you to do it, but in the near-term it is just doesn\u2019t seem to be happening as quickly as I think some of us anticipating.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Well, I would say that we over a long period of time have a good track record of taking action, and that we think is going to be beneficial for our shareholders and we have taken many actions to evidence that whether they have been with Kindred or today with Holiday and we will continue to do that.   We have made a ton of progress, we are proud of what we have done on the leadership front, as you mentioned along with the portfolio front and we will continue to do that with urgency and purpose. And hopefully we will continue to get rewarded for doing the right things at the right time.  \nQ - Omotayo Okusanya:   Okay that is helpful. Well I just feel like the runway is clearly open and everyone is waiting for you guys to take off.  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   Well, thank you. We appreciate that support. Our wings are flapping. Thank you, Tayo.  \nQ - Omotayo Okusanya:   Thank you.  \nEnd of Q&A:  \nA - Debra Cafaro:   I think we have one more operator. Anything further? Okay, if we don't have any further questions, I want to sincerely thank you for your time, your attention, your interest in Ventas. We have a great team here that is really committed to protecting and preserving the Company and for really delivering for all the stakeholders who depend upon us. So, we look forward to seeing you on the other side of this terrible pandemic and until then, stay safe and strong. We will see you soon. Bye-bye.  \nOperator:   Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Peter Bulgarelli",
            "content": "Thanks Justin. We are certainly glad to have you and Carey on board. I will quickly touch on the first quarter results for our office segment, which represents 27% to Ventas NOI and then focus on the latest trends in our latest second quarter COVID framework.   For the first quarter of 2020 office same-store cash NOI increased by 5.8% year-on-year. This outstanding results was fueled by our R&I portfolio, which grew 22% driven by strong lease up and complimented by strong performance from the MOB portfolio.   In R&I, first quarter average rent per square foot was up 9.4% and occupancy was robust at just under 97%. Strong performance at our university based developments affiliated with University of Pennsylvania and Philadelphia and Washington University in St. Louis fueled our growth. Complimenting the fast growing R&I business is our MOB business. MOB same-store cash NOI for the first quarter of 2020 increased 1.9% year-on-year, also above our expectations.   Now let's shift to the latest COVID trends we are seeing in our office portfolio. I will start with medical office. Our top priority has been to partner with our tenants and the associated health systems to ensure the safety of health professionals, patients and our employees.   We have sourced substantial amounts of PPE, coordinated visitor screening, licensed short-term spaces, set up drive-through testing centers in our parking lots, provide a supplemental cleaning and otherwise supported our tenants during this challenging time.   We are happy to report that all of our buildings are open and none of our site based employees have tested positively for COVID-19. We sincerely thank all of our on-site employees and partners who fight the fight every day. We are very proud of them. I will also say regarding our MOB business, that parking receipts have slowed and while safety concerns have caused an increase in cleaning costs.   Given the current uncertainty, the pace of new leasing has slowed. However, we still leased 573,000 square feet during the first quarter and 381,000 square feet during April, with an additional 200,000 square feet of leases at the letter of intent stage.   Also, tenant retention has increased. I'm proud to say that MOB reported record retention of 83% for the trailing 12-months, 90% retention for the first quarter, 94% retention for March and an outstanding 98% in April.   Turning to our R&I portfolio. Our R&I buildings are a 100% open and are supporting critical research focused on the detection, prevention, and cure of COVID-19. We are proud to be partnered with leading research institutions such as Yale, Penn Gene Therapy Center, Wake Forest Health Sciences, Virginia Commonwealth University, Integral Molecular, Alexion and others in fighting this virus.   And we look forward to expanding our portfolio with other leading research institutions such as Arizona State and University of Pittsburgh in new under construction, world-class research building.   As previously mentioned, our R&I portfolio is 97% leased with an active leasing pipeline. Last phase continues to be in high demand. Net-net as of April 30th, we had 91.5% occupancy in our office business, representing 150 basis points year-on-year increase from April 2019. From March 31st through April 30th, we experienced a 10 basis point increase in occupancy for MOB and a 10 basis point increase for R&I.   So, let's talk rent payments. During the first quarter, our tenants paid essentially 100% of the office rent. Our historical bad debt expense has only been 20 basis points. We have high quality tenants that pay their rent.   In April, our tenants paid 96% of office rents. We expect a significant proportion of the unpaid rent to be ultimately collected. And I'm encouraged that so far in May, our office tenants have paid nearly 80% of the rents due, to-date we are seeing a faster payment rate than what we experienced in April.   I will say the tenants experiencing the most pressure are the smaller third party position groups in MOB, the smaller private companies in R&I and retail. Taken together, these customer segments represent a relatively small portion of our office portfolio. We are supporting these tenants by raising awareness and assisting them with securing federal relief.   On a selective basis, we are also offering to differ May rent for these small tenants to be repaid no later than the fourth quarter. To-date only a small number of tenants who have utilized the rents deferral opportunity.   Supporting the durability of our office portfolio are a couple of our additional facts. First, our MOB portfolio is largely on campus 71%. We also have a high level of acuity in our buildings, with 88% of our physician tenants being specialists. Our buildings and our tenants are essential to the delivery of care during this difficult time. Less than 10% of our tenant suites closed during the pandemic.   Second, as of May 7th, over 80% of the MOB NOI is in states that have either reopened for elective procedures or have announced the resumption of elective procedures. In locations that have reopened, we are seeing material increases in activity, although still below pre-COVID levels.   As a reminder that our nation is resilient and that normalcy returns following catastrophes. I'm happy to report that Ventas is delivering [Technical Difficulty] that was devastated by Hurricane Michel in 2018.   With that happy news, I will pass the turn to Bob to finish up our prepared remarks. Thanks Justin. We are certainly glad to have you and Carey on board.

            "content": "Sure. This is an analysis Michael, that again pre-COVID that is the analysis of our SG&A. We are well underway in that analysis. Everything I would say is on the table, as we think about that. I would expect to have some more news this quarter as we are well underway on that analysis and we do see opportunity. But at the end of the day, we have a 20-year record of being efficient and effective and that continues to be our goal and we have a duty to make sure we are doing that. Sure. I will give you some building blocks Vikram using April as our case study here. We saw move-ins approximately 25% of our historic levels or down 75%, to put the other way. The move-outs have trended pretty consistently with historical patterns and the net of that is approximately a 70 basis point impact on occupancy on a weekly basis.   One way to think about revenue impact is that, and this is the Page 7 of the investor deck. If you haven't seen this is, a 100 basis points of occupancy generally, sequentially on average is about $2 million to $3 million of revenue per month. So, you can do math there.   And we expect that trend as we see it right now to carry on into May. On the expense side, we mentioned about 10% OpEx increase, driven by labor and supplies including PP&E. We had about $125 million of monthly OpEx in our portfolio in SHOP. So, it gives you some more facts if you like to do the math. Let me clarify, just to make sure we are on the same page. The 330 basis points was the spot-to-spot effectively beginning to end of April, occupancy moves. And my 100 basis points was simply a rule of thumb to help you.   So, that is an important clarification, beyond what we are seeing in April and early May, I'm not able to project what I think is going to be for the second quarter, for example. But those will give you some building blocks to make your own assumptions. Sure. This is an analysis Michael, that again pre-COVID that is the analysis of our SG&A.

            "name": "A - Debra Cafaro",
            "content": "Good morning Nick its Debby. I'm going to ask Justin to comment on that. Hey Michael. Sure, and I'm happy to talk about that and turn it over to Bob, for a little bit more detail. But most of our executive compensation is very aligned with shareholders and is the vast majority of which is in the form of performance based equity compensation.   When you think about the overall enterprise, I'm going to turn it over to Bob to talk about some of the insights he has about making sure that the company is efficient and cognizant of the environment that we are in. I think that, consistent with the idea that one of the cost efficient, our expectation is that, I would continue to hold those roles, obviously serving at the pleasure of our shareholders and our Board of Directors. Thank you. Hi, Rich. Good to talk with you, Rich. Let me take that. A couple of things. One is we are pleased with the Holiday transaction. We think it really does a lot of good things and we are happy to take a page out of our friends with matrices book, and we preserved that upside in the assets and a lot of operational flexibility. So, we feel good about that and look forward to optimizing that portfolio.   In terms of the triple-net lease, what I would say is, triple-net leases are a little bit like mortgages in one sense, which is that they magnify ups and downs for the operators and in any challenging environment, they are going to be disfavored. And of course that is the situation we find ourselves in now. In other environments, they could be very attractive to both land owners as well as the operators.   So, I think there is many tools in the bag, many I guess you would say clubs in the bag, tools in the toolkit, and the triple-net lease I think will continue to be one. And there are many ways that you can customize leases also to create alignment.   So, we think the triple-net lease will survive and we think we will continue to be creative and collaborative in how we work with our operators, be they tenants or managers in optimizing our portfolio and then being good partners. That is a good one too. Absolutely. Yes. I mean, our investment most, we have a significant Canadian portfolio. Obviously, the pandemic has affected assets there as well. Those operators have also received significant government support and one thing we have liked about the Quebec portfolio with LGM is that they have a younger healthier population a longer lengths of stay.   They are very rigorous and have been very active from early on working to protect the residents. Obviously, that portfolio will be effected as well. But there are some characteristics of the LGM portfolio that make it probably a better performer on a relative basis, despite being impacted by pandemic. Thank you. great talking to you Rich. Great question. Yes, the cash and notes are effectively income and I think we mentioned this in the release and so those will be included in net income and yes we actually would expect as part of our ongoing this for ongoing notes we would expect to book and receive some amount of interest income as we go forward. We would expect it to be cash. Yes. Right, I mean we have had Holiday in the heat map, obviously and it had been below a 101 and EBITDARM basis. So, as we reported the last time and really what I would say is that just like everything else in the portfolio as you point out, it is really going to depend on how the pandemic really plays out and so I think we will just defer that as we get more real time information about the portfolio. I'm happy to talk to you about it as things progress. Yes, I mean, I think you should, you should look at about a 0.9 EBITDARM coverage, something like that in the first quarter, rough numbers. Thank you. Hello. Thank you. Thank you. Yes, I mean, I think really want to just touch on the fact that, while we are in this period of uncertainty, we generally want to match our decision making speed with what is required. And our Board is going to look at all relevant information when it addresses the dividend, as I mentioned in mid to late June. It has been. Yes, Vikram. I'm going to ask Bob to address that Vikram. Vikram, we thought you love those rules of thumb. And that is shows the difference between really the quote and unquote spot, beginning of month to end of month versus the average occupancies for the month. So, let's carry on. Thank you. Great. Good morning. So, we are very excited about this initiative and we are taking the first step with Atria and it is really to accelerate employee e-testing at Ventas buildings with select operators to make our communities safer, and facilitate thoughtful reopening and confidence and trust as Justin talked about.   And so, we have this first compliment of 10,000 testing kits with Mayo Lab's analysis, which is very important, they have a very high accuracy rate at Mayo, as you would imagine and we really think this is a great first step that we can make available. Atria has already done it, ESL will be next and we will make it available to select operators, principally for their employee testing program.   Once we see how that goes again, we are early days are, still a lot of uncertainty, new testing and tools coming out all the time, we will determine if we want to are-up or if we want to take a different step moving forward, but we think this is a great opportunity to do the right thing and really have a differentiated partnership with our operators and really build that trust and confidence with residents and their families that is so sorely needed. The turnaround is a day or two and it will indeed build confidence as a component of the thoughtful reopening and admissions plan. Okay. Right. And that is a good point, because the test may also be available for new residents in certain cases. Thank you. Mike. Thanks Jordan. We are. Well, I will turn it over to Bob, but one thing we know for sure is that, having went through many decades of this that, having assured liquidity is the number one, two and three attributes that you want to have to manage successfully through any kind of uncertainty. And so, we have that and that is kind of a golden rule, and it served us very, very well.   In terms of the pass of the peak, again, there are numerous models. There is a lot of uncertainty, but as of a point in time, I'm glad that you noticed data that shows that a lot of our NOI in our senior housing on those triple-net and SHOP is in states where according to a single model as of a certain day, the peak of mortality is behind us. Now that could change again and that of course would affect our outlook. Yes. I mean, I think what we have said clearly about the dividends is that the board will make that decision at the right time, which are dividends is a July dividends historically and so that would basically defer that decision to be made by our board until mid to late June. So, do you have a question for Bob about the revolver draw just Jordon? Yes, I think that under skilled nursing, I think I'm glad you reminded us that, that we really did that, at the absolute peak time in valuations at a seven cap on rent at that time. And we really continue to believe that was a very sound strategic decision, particularly as we look at infection mortality rates in skilled nursing now.   I think we given all the uncertainty right now we are focused on health and safety as Justin said really just strong effort to keep Ventas strong and stable and get ready for any scenario and the opportunities in the future. So, we will defer that discussion if you don't mind. Thanks Jordan. I clearly had too many people with the first initial J in my life. Anyways go ahead I will try to get it right this time. Well, we have talked about Holiday for a while and have been pretty clear about what the performance was over the past couple of years. I think we were in a good spot, because Holiday remains current and paying full rent all the way through the first quarter and they have been great about that and we were the sole beneficiary of the guarantors.   So, of course, we had a EBITDAR kind of one-to-one coverage. So, we felt like we were in a good spot. But we did feel mutually that it was the right time to take a different approach and we did so in a way that we think was beneficial for both and preserved upside and on operational flexibility.    So, we are happy that we have done it, and we are going to optimize that portfolio especially now that Justin is here. Right Justin. Thank you. Hi John. Pete. Thanks John. Well, I think our focus right now is really getting through the biggest part of the pandemic Lucas and then there remains really a lot of uncertainty about the depths and then the time period where it will be most active and then what the slope and pace to recovery will look like and those could very significantly affect what the recovery and senior housing looks like.   So, we are really happy for the day when we can discuss that with more specificity in terms of timing, pay and slope. But right now, we are focused on maximizing during the course of the toughest period of pandemic. Justin. Hi. Good. So. I mean those portfolios performed very well. You are absolutely right. We are happy that, we have grown our office portfolio in particularly this exciting Life Science University based portfolio over the past years, it is really, you are seeing the benefit of that right now.   Both in the fact that is where all the action is on the virus and the vaccines in the search for a cure, as well as the diversification benefits we are getting from that portfolio, within the broader Ventas Enterprise.   And so, it is a significant capital allocation priority. We do have a number of ongoing projects with Arizona State and [Pitt] to name a few. And basically, what we did as a matter of I think, really good discipline and approach is that, when we really understood quickly the potential from this Coronavirus, we aggressively paused on the two developments that really were not yet significantly underway.   And so the ones that are ongoing are going to be delivered and we will have our 80% pre-leased and the ones that are on the drawing board have been paused I think intelligently to take a look at capital conservation.   And of course, as I mentioned, we will be able to make a decision on those at the appropriate time as to moving forward and timing and the life, we are happy to have this portfolio and it will continue to be an important part of the Ventas' story. Well, I would say that we over a long period of time have a good track record of taking action, and that we think is going to be beneficial for our shareholders and we have taken many actions to evidence that whether they have been with Kindred or today with Holiday and we will continue to do that.   We have made a ton of progress, we are proud of what we have done on the leadership front, as you mentioned along with the portfolio front and we will continue to do that with urgency and purpose. And hopefully we will continue to get rewarded for doing the right things at the right time. Well, thank you. We appreciate that support. Our wings are flapping. Thank you, Tayo. Good morning Nick its Debby. I'm going to ask Justin to comment on that. Hey Michael. Sure, and I'm happy to talk about that and turn it over to Bob, for a little bit more detail. But most of our executive compensation is very aligned with shareholders and is the vast majority of which is in the form of performance based equity compensation.   When you think about the overall enterprise, I'm going to turn it over to Bob to talk about some of the insights he has about making sure that the company is efficient and cognizant of the environment that we are in. I think that, consistent with the idea that one of the cost efficient, our expectation is that, I would continue to hold those roles, obviously serving at the pleasure of our shareholders and our Board of Directors. Thank you. Hi, Rich. Good to talk with you, Rich. Let me take that. A couple of things. One is we are pleased with the Holiday transaction. We think it really does a lot of good things and we are happy to take a page out of our friends with matrices book, and we preserved that upside in the assets and a lot of operational flexibility. So, we feel good about that and look forward to optimizing that portfolio.   In terms of the triple-net lease, what I would say is, triple-net leases are a little bit like mortgages in one sense, which is that they magnify ups and downs for the operators and in any challenging environment, they are going to be disfavored. And of course that is the situation we find ourselves in now. In other environments, they could be very attractive to both land owners as well as the operators.   So, I think there is many tools in the bag, many I guess you would say clubs in the bag, tools in the toolkit, and the triple-net lease I think will continue to be one. And there are many ways that you can customize leases also to create alignment.   So, we think the triple-net lease will survive and we think we will continue to be creative and collaborative in how we work with our operators, be they tenants or managers in optimizing our portfolio and then being good partners. That is a good one too. Absolutely. Yes. I mean, our investment most, we have a significant Canadian portfolio. Obviously, the pandemic has affected assets there as well.

            "name": "Justin Hutchens",
            "content": "Thanks, Debbie. Let me just start off by saying I'm extremely excited to be working with the Ventas team. Given the circumstances, I have certainly had the opportunity to jump right in and immediately put my operating experience to work.   I'm also happy to be working again with long standing colleagues and industry leaders like Atria, Brookdale, SDL, Holiday, and Sunrise. COVID notwithstanding, I see great opportunities ahead for Ventas in its senior housing business.   In my first Ventas earnings call, I would like to discuss the momentum of our SHOP, the same-store portfolio showed in the first quarter. Outline how Ventas has worked with integrity to support our tenants and operators during a very challenging time. Describe the operational and clinical environment in SHOP, in triple-net, delve into April and May trends and provide our outlook for safe and staged reopening in senior housing.   Our SHOP portfolio started the year ahead of our expectations and with good momentum. Sequentially, NOI and our same-store SHOP portfolio grew 2.3% in the first quarter with COVID costs embedded.   Without COVID impacts NOI grew 6% versus the fourth quarter, with credit due to solid sequential performance from Atria through strong rate growth and expense control, and some welcome stabilization from ESL.   As expected, the year-over-year same-store SHOP comparisons were negatively affected by six million in COVID costs incurred in the quarter. The reduction in occupancy as a result of COVID in the back half of March as well as the previously discussed lower star point heading into 2020. Ex-COVID costs the year-over-year, same-store NOI would have declined 6.9%, better than our expectations given the difficult prior year comparison.   While we are mostly focused on the impact of COVID-19 to our operating performance, it is worth noting new construction starts in senior housing continue to decelerate with the first quarter of 2020, having the lowest number of new starts in several years at 1,000 units in Ventas markets.   Moving to our support for senior housing tenants and operators. I have been proud that Ventas has been out front and willing to work with integrity in support of our senior housing tenants, who are on the front lines of caring for seniors. This support has taken many forms.   I will just focus on some creative programs we have offered to our triple-net tenants. The company offered support to its triple-net senior housing tenants affected by the COVID-19 pandemic by implementing a 25% rent deferral program in April to enable them to care for seniors, purchase needed supplies and pay employees. This program ultimately reduced April cash rent receipts by approximately $3 million.   Adjusting for this tenant support program, tenants paid substantially all triple-net senior housing rents in April. For the month of May, the company offered qualified senior housing tenants the opportunity to pay up to 25% of their rent with cash as escrows and security deposits and based on participating tenants, we expect about $2 million of our rent to be paid this way.   We are encouraged to see that, some of our tenants have availed themselves of government relief programs for which they are eligible. We will continue to engage in constructive ongoing dialogue with our triple-net tenants regarding their COVID-19 challenges on a case-by-case basis.   We have many tools available to us to work through a near-term conditions including our backstop of corporate and personal guarantees in over $100 million of security deposits that stand behind these lease obligations.   Turning to the clinical and operational environment. These trying times underlined the importance of partnering with true industry leaders. We have been inspired by the tireless work of our operating partners to keep seniors safe.   Senior housing operators across the industry continue to aggressively implement protocols to protect against COVID-19. The result of these protocols is that almost all operators are only offering virtual tours and at the present time, about 29% of our 400 SHOP communities have suspended their move-ins.   In terms of the clinical impact on our SHOP portfolio as of April 30, it is a tale of two cities. Having a large New York and New Jersey footprint is a strategic advantage for Ventas, but those States where the epicenter for the COVID-19 infection and mortality rate.   On a full portfolio basis, about a quarter of our SHOP communities experienced at least one positive COVID-19 resident diagnosis since the beginning of the pandemic, registering accumulative percentage of resident cases at slightly over 2% of the resident population. Excluding New York and New Jersey, these figures improved dramatically with only 1% of our residents cumulatively effective since day one.   In our triple-net senior housing portfolio benefiting from geographic diversification, the percentage of resident cases is 1%. As is best practice, the care providers to great lengths to isolate or transfer to a higher acuity setting, the limited number of residents who receive positive diagnosis.   Brookdale in particular has been compassionate, but also fairly disciplined and rigorous in its preparation for and management of COVID conditions for the benefit of residents and their families.   In SHOPs, as a result of restricted access to communities nationally, April move-ins approximated 25% of typical levels. While overall move-outs were largely in-line with historic patterns. April average occupancy was approximately 82.4%. As of May 1, spot occupancy was estimated as 80.7% representing a 330 basis points declined since the beginning of April based on interim information provided by Ventas operators.   When excluding New York and New Jersey, occupancy would have declined to 280 basis points. Operating expenses are trending around 10% higher, particularly for labor and supplies, including PPE. These revenue and expense trends we are seeing for April, are expected to continue in May.   Financial and operational trends are expected to be directionally similar for our triple-net portfolio in the second quarter. For senior housing overall, as we look beyond the second quarter, there are three critical considerations we are monitoring that will materially affect the outlook for senior housing.   One, timing of reopening of communities to physical tours and move-ins. Two, cost and access to labor. Three, local demand characteristics including evolving protocols required to protect against the virus. The timing of openings will be driven by state specific guidelines, CDC guidelines and local community considerations. Ventas along with our operating partners is closely tracking state specific guidelines and COVID infection curves in each of our markets.   I'm encouraged to report that we have roughly 300 deposits for move-ins, which is a good sign of ongoing demand for our senior housing communities. Senior housing operators will find success in many ways, including and most importantly building trust with prospective residents and their families by demonstrating a concerted effort to keep communities free of infection. To do so, we anticipate elevated levels of costs over the course of the next several months.   Trust and confidence in senior housing or the near-term will be supported with best in class infection control practices, availability of PPE and testing residents and employees. As Debbie described, Ventas has played an important role alongside our operators and tenants to combat into pandemic and helping operators prepare to open successfully.   Through this challenging stretch, we continue to resolutely believe in the long-term value that senior living offers residents and their families and are sharply focused on positioning Ventas' senior housing business for long term success.   With that, I will hand the floor to Pete to discuss our office business. Thanks, Debbie. Let me just start off by saying I'm extremely excited to be working with the Ventas team.

Today, the Ventas team is working remotely, but we are together in spirit as we outline our outstanding first quarter results, describe the challenging conditions in the markets, the economy and or Company brought on by the terrible COVID-19 pandemic, discuss near-term business trends and evaluate the macro outlook.   At this time, we face unprecedented conditions nationally and globally created by the pandemic. Those of us in real estate has been around a long time have managed through many severe crises over the decades, including the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the great financial crisis, and the deep recession that followed both. Yet today's complex mix of public health, remote working, economic, operational and market conditions make this pandemic a uniquely challenging adversary.   Let me begin today by setting the stage and then outlining the swift and decisive actions we have taken to ensure that Ventas remains strong and stable. As we rolled into March, we were excited to see how our previously announced initiatives were gaining traction and making an impact and how well our overall enterprise and each of our business lines were performing.   You can see the power of our diversified business model in the strong normalized FFO per share results we reported today at $0.97 per share, inclusive of the financial impact of COVID-19 toward the end of the quarter. In short, we were hitting on all cylinders with terrific momentum.   As soon as, we realized the potential scope and impact of the novel Coronavirus in February and early in March, we identified as our key priority that health and safety of Ventas' employees and their family and the employees patients and senior living residents in our 1200 healthcare sites.   Although this particular crisis reflecting unique combination of forces, our experience, deep analysis based on early real time inputs and core principles have given us a solid framework for action.   Here are some of the strong measures we have taken to preserve and protect the Company and the many stakeholders who depend upon us. We have devoted significant efforts to support our tenants and operators across our portfolio during the COVID-19 pandemic.   We have established financial support programs for those who are experiencing financial hardship. We have assisted operators, who may be eligible for complex and various government programs, and we have leveraged our national scale to help operators source supplies, including scarce Personal Protective Equipment or PPE.   And today, we have announced a powerful new initiative for Ventas Senior Living Operators. Ventas will be providing access to COVID-19 testing kits and analysis from Mayo Clinic laboratories without charge to certain of our senior housing operators to further enhance safety at Ventas communities by accelerating employee testing.   Ventas and Atria working through Atria's ongoing relationship have secured access to testing capacity in excess of 30,000.   Atria is already nearly done testing all of this 14,000 U.S. on site and regional staff with approximately 9,000 results in less than 1% of Atria's employee tests have been returned positive.   Combined with digital tracking and tracing and appropriate use of PPE, Atria is building a new normal model to run its senior housing business safely and thoughtfully. In a positive sign, Atria has moved in 300 residents since early March all under full quarantine and PPE protocol.   Ventas plans to make available to certain of its other operators at least 10,000 COVID-19 test kits and analysis from Mayo Clinic Labs, ESL will be the next Ventas' operators to use this testing for its Ventas communities, and it is already getting ready to test all this staff in May.   We look forward to finding more ways to work with Mayo Clinic Labs and our operators to further enhance safety in our communities for residents and caregivers. We will continue to evaluate additional action as appropriate.   Second, on our action hit list, we move early to review and implement our pre-existing business continuity plan. So, we could maintain a high level of productivity and manage a seamless transition to remote working arrangements.   With an interdisciplinary team of Ventas leaders coordinating our efforts, strongly IT support and capabilities, full buy in by our employees and enhanced communication. The company experienced no downtime and we have been highly effective during these challenging times. I'm so proud of how Ventas employees have reacted in rally and I want to thank them for their extraordinary efforts.   Third, we are pleased that we have reached a positive consensual resolution of our Holiday lease. After receiving full rents from Holiday since lease inception in 2013, through the end of the first quarter 2020. We have now received an additional $100 million in cash and secured notes.   We have entered into a new management agreement with Holiday for a 26 independent living assets and we have terminated the Holiday lease all effective April 1. This management structure retains our upside in our 26 communities and provides us with operational flexibility. We appreciate Holiday management's engagement and cooperation to complete this transaction.   Fourth, we were excited to augment our leadership team with Justin Hutchens and Carey Roberts when they join Ventas on March the 4th. Justin and Carey have added new energy and insight to our tight knit group at this crucial time. They've already made many meaningful contributions to Ventas. As we have collaborated to analyze and attack the business challenges presented by the pandemic.   Our experience has instilled in us the importance of liquidity in a crisis. As a result, we shared the courage of our convictions in mid-March by drawing on our revolver and then issuing senior notes generating $3.3 billion in liquidity. This financial flexibility will serve us well as we manage through to the other side of the COVID-19 pandemic.   In addition, we further enhanced our financial flexibility by acting immediately to reduce 2020 capital expenditures by $300 million, mainly by pausing certain of our previously announced ground-up developments that were not yet substantially underway. We are also carefully reviewing other areas of our Company for cost savings, including general and administrative expenses.   At the same time, we promptly withdrew our financial guidance on March 17th, nearly two months ago, when our early analysis informed by real time data let us to conclude that our financial performance could be materially affected by the pandemic. Our foresight proved correct and we fulfilled our commitment to transparency to our stakeholders by the actions we took in a timely way.   Finally, Ventas has served and continues to work tirelessly as a proactive and evidence-based advocate for seniors as federal policy makers. Working with industry groups and in alliance with senior living CEOs, we are demonstrating the crucial role senior living care providers play in protecting our senior population that is particularly vulnerable to this novel Coronavirus.   While we have taken plenty of actions, policymakers have done exponentially more. The Fed, the administration and Congress have implemented a comprehensive array of bold policy actions to partially mitigate the virus' severe implications for public health, capital markets and the economy.   Many businesses and households, including many of our tenants and operators have already benefited from this arsenal of federal programs. With this powerful support and more financial relief likely to follow, it is our responsibility now to take action to safely and responsibly move our Company toward a new normal.   As we do so, our visibility is limited and uncertainty remains very high. Indeed, we faced the COVID-19 paradox on the one side, reputable models and even certain government projections show an expected increase in COVID-19 confirmed cases and mortality numbers in many jurisdictions. These expectations if they materialize, could derail even the best laid plans for economic recovery. And this morning we saw a historic levels of unemployment claims in the U.S.   On the other hand, there is palpable optimism in the air as most states plan staged re-openings of their economies and businesses, many companies including ours are preparing for a gradual return to office work, patients and physicians are scheduling appointments in elective procedures, families are making deposits for senior housing move in, universities are planning to welcome students in the fall, and most importantly, our best scientific and medical minds are racing to find treatment, cures and vaccines for the Coronavirus.   We are proud to say that, many of our key research and innovation university relationships and tenants, including Duke, Wake Forest, Penn, Yale, and Integral Molecular are at the forefront of this research. All these promising developments provide hope for a speedier and sustained bounce back.   We don't have to know how these opposing trends will play out. Our job is to preserve and protect our Company and our stakeholders, and be ready for a variety of scenarios and opportunities. Before closing, I want to address our dividends in the context of this COVID-19 uncertainty.   As you know, we declared and paid our last quarterly dividend in April. Because we normally pay our next dividend in July, our board will consider the dividends in mid to late June. As it always does, our responsible and experienced board will make a decision using it is good faith business judgment, taking into account all of the information available to it at that time.   In a situation like the fast moving rapidly changing global pandemic, we have the advantage of aggregating and analyzing the best and most current information available in order to make the optimal decision.   The cycle test events as team and the Company are well prepared to manage through current conditions and to take further action as necessary. Guided by our experience, analysis and ethics, we will safeguard our employees, our senior housing residents and caregivers, our capital and our reputation, so that Ventas will remain a leading healthcare property owner in the businesses and geographies where we invest a desirable employer and an attractive investment vehicle.   And now for the first time, I'm pleased to ask Justin Hutchins to address you about Venta's senior housing business. Thank you, Juan. and good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants and welcome to the Ventas' first quarter 2020 earnings call.

            "name": "Robert Probst",
            "content": "Thank you Pete. I will start with our triple-net lease portfolio overall before I close with some enterprise level commentary. The triple-net portfolio grew same-store cash NOI by 3.9% year-over-year in the first quarter. Growth was driven by in-place lease escalations, and a $3 million cash fee received in the quarter from capital senior living.   Trailing 12-months coverage as of the fourth quarter of 2019, for the overall triple-net portfolio for triple-net senior housing remains stable at 1.5 times and 1.1 times respectively. Post acute coverage declined sequentially by 10 basis points to 1.3 times, due to a decline in volumes at Kindred, driven by managed care and purposeful reduction of non-compliant patients.   Adjusting for the 25% rent deferral program in senior housing, we collected close to 100% of our overall expected triple-net portfolio rents in April. We have already received almost a 100% of triple-net healthcare rent for May and we are on-track with triple-net senior housing May collections.   We expect the impact of COVID on our triple-net healthcare rents from acute care providers to be muted in the second quarter. Acute care hospitals have been impacted by the reduction of elective procedures, but have had significant access to government funding and support.   Additionally for Ardent, as of May 1st, all 10 of the Ventas owned hospitals have reopened or will reopen in May for elective procedures. For the post acute providers in our triple-net health care portfolio, volume trends have varied. Deltek, Ventas has been higher than budgeted, the costs have increased. We expect that the concern over respiratory disease will enhance Kindred Deltek business going forward.   Urban census initially declined due to lower surgeries and acute care volumes, but census has improved since mid April. Smiths are experiencing notably higher mortality rates with census down dramatically and the most profitable rehab patients also down. Positive post-acute trends include access to government funding, relief from site neutral pricing, waiver of length of stay requirements and the 2% sequestration delay.   I will close with some comments regarding the overall enterprise and our financial position. I want to underscore how pleased we are with our first quarter results including property performance ahead of our expectations, record quarterly revenues, strong FFO delivery of $0.97 per share and enhanced balance sheet 5.7 times of net debt to EBITDA and excellent liquidity. And we took decisive action in the face of the pandemic to bolster our financial flexibility.   In March, we drew $2.75 billion under our $3 billion revolver and followed it up in early April with a $500 million senior note issuance. As a result, as of May 6th, Ventas has approximately $3.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand with no commercial paper outstanding. We also have very limited debt maturing in 2020 or 2021 and we have the ability to extend our revolver for up to one year.   We plan to bolster financial flexibility by reducing 2020 total capital expenditures by nearly 300 million to a total of 500 million with the decline led by pausing ground-up developments not yet substantially underway. Notably one used to be in Philadelphia and 42/10 in St. Louis.   Our ongoing development projects are on average 81% free leaks to high quality credit tenants in the R&I business. I note that Ventas has a $400 million committed construction line of credit to fund development with $250 million of available capacity as of the end of March. Ventas is expected unfunded investment in all of ground up developments in 2020 net of committed financing is approximately $100 million.   In addition to conserving CapEx, the company is reviewing its cost structures across the enterprise, including its SG&A and organizational costs. As Debbie says, we are on it.   Given our early understanding of the potential impacts of the pandemic, Ventas went through a previously issued financial guidance on March 17th. We believe the adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition will be driven by many factors, most of which are outside of the Company's control and ability to forecast.   Wherever provide investors with incremental observations and transparency, we included today the investor deck outlining our COVID response and latest business trends, as well as expanded disclosure as summarized on Page 44 of the supplemental.   To close we are pleased with our start to year and with the actions taken thus far, and are committed to continuing to take the actions necessary to manage through these unprecedented times. That concludes our prepared remarks.   Before we start with Q&A, we are limiting each caller to two questions given a busy calendar request from a few analysts to be respectful of everyone on the line. Also, given the fact that we are all remote, we will have Debby quarterback to the QA and to pass questions to the Ventas' team if needed.   With that, I will turn the call back to the operator.

            "name": "A - Justin Hutchens",
            "content": "Thank you Debby. First of all, I think it is important to know, our biggest priority is that our operators are looking out for the health and safety of our residents in our communities. That is priority number one, in the near-term.   I will also point two, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks that we have already started to take action, we mentioned the rent deferral in April, we mentioned the opportunity for tenants to pay down rent - pay some of their rent with their cash escrows in May and that the Holiday restructuring.   What we are committed to do is to take action that is going to give us the best opportunity to create value in a portfolio and work with our operators to determine the best outcome. It is still early, some uncertainty ahead of us still, but we will certainly be watching everything closely. This is Justin. And I'm going to add a little color to that might be helpful and I will just preface this that I'm going to give you April average occupancy numbers that are presented by our operators and these are fully vetted, we only report these numbers.   But I'm going to compare March first. So March average occupancy was 85%, April average is at 82.4%. So, there is 260 basis points difference. If you take New York and New Jersey out, as I did in my prepared remarks when I was using spot occupancy, March average is 85.1, April at 82.9. So, the 220 basis point change. And I will just add one other point to that. This is Justin. All of our operators are considering the move-in protocols at this point, and about 70% of our operators are operating in states that are starting to loosen their stay-at-home policy. So this is a very active conversation.   And the advantage that testing gives you, obviously it gives you a lot more certainty around the potential for spread of infection. But the other advantage is, it is recognized in the CDC guidelines. If testing occurs, then it can accelerate the time that someone can move in, where the regular quarantine is around 14-days and the testing allows for something closer to two or three days. Yes. It is actually very low percentage, if you think about around 30 million of rent per month and only round two million or up to two million we think will be paid with the cash escrows s to carry deposits. So not a lot.   I will mention two other things on the triple-net, one is that as we said it is our May collections are really right on track, so looking good in May. Also some of April tenants that took advantage of that deferral have already paid back.   So that was good encouraging sign as well, and in that case, there were smaller operators that had advantage of government assistance. But our tap was to Allow some liquidity for operators during a very tough and uncertain time, and we are happy that some of the operators have taken advantage of that. Hello, this is Justin. Let me just mention first of all, we don't normally track deposits, because senior housing particularly assisted living, and memory care are what we focused is need driven. So tracking deposits is usually a very short-term indictor of move-in.   But given the environment we started to track recently a lot of those deposits are in Sunrise and Sunrise has kind of a north east footprint with us. So there is certainly some New York and Massachusetts are few for our Sunrise footprint, a lot of those deposits are with them.   There is another stab I will mention, that is round lead which is something that we do track regularly and leads have stabilized over the past few weeks about half of our lead volume, which is you know encouraging in a sense, because it shows that there is still ongoing demand.   Even though we are not doing physical tours, and we are doing virtual tours and in-lue of those there is still ongoing demand and is ahead of that moving pace that we have been experiencing so far. But there is long answer to short question and that is not ready to really point out specific geographies except to say that Sunrise is a big part of those deposits. Yep, sure. So, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the year-over-year stats that were down and the reasons for that, given the fact that we are starting off at a lower starting point. I also mentioned the strong sequential performance.   That performance was driven by Atria and ESL. Sunrise was not as big acontributor to that. There are some less good performance from the sunrise portfolio during that time, so it was actually contributing on a sequential basis, closer to down around 9%. Thank you Debby. First of all, I think it is important to know, our biggest priority is that our operators are looking out for the health and safety of our residents in our communities. That is priority number one, in the near-term.   I will also point two, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks that we have already started to take action, we mentioned the rent deferral in April, we mentioned the opportunity for tenants to pay down rent - pay some of their rent with their cash escrows in May and that the Holiday restructuring.

If you take New York and New Jersey out, as I did in my prepared remarks when I was using spot occupancy, March average is 85.1, April at 82.9. So, the 220 basis point change. And I will just add one other point to that. This is Justin. All of our operators are considering the move-in protocols at this point, and about 70% of our operators are operating in states that are starting to loosen their stay-at-home policy. So this is a very active conversation.   And the advantage that testing gives you, obviously it gives you a lot more certainty around the potential for spread of infection. But the other advantage is, it is recognized in the CDC guidelines. If testing occurs, then it can accelerate the time that someone can move in, where the regular quarantine is around 14-days and the testing allows for something closer to two or three days. Yes. It is actually very low percentage, if you think about around 30 million of rent per month and only round two million or up to two million we think will be paid with the cash escrows s to carry deposits. So not a lot.   I will mention two other things on the triple-net, one is that as we said it is our May collections are really right on track, so looking good in May. Also some of April tenants that took advantage of that deferral have already paid back.   So that was good encouraging sign as well, and in that case, there were smaller operators that had advantage of government assistance. But our tap was to Allow some liquidity for operators during a very tough and uncertain time, and we are happy that some of the operators have taken advantage of that. Hello, this is Justin. Let me just mention first of all, we don't normally track deposits, because senior housing particularly assisted living, and memory care are what we focused is need driven. So tracking deposits is usually a very short-term indictor of move-in.   But given the environment we started to track recently a lot of those deposits are in Sunrise and Sunrise has kind of a north east footprint with us. So there is certainly some New York and Massachusetts are few for our Sunrise footprint, a lot of those deposits are with them.   There is another stab I will mention, that is round lead which is something that we do track regularly and leads have stabilized over the past few weeks about half of our lead volume, which is you know encouraging in a sense, because it shows that there is still ongoing demand.   Even though we are not doing physical tours, and we are doing virtual tours and in-lue of those there is still ongoing demand and is ahead of that moving pace that we have been experiencing so far. But there is long answer to short question and that is not ready to really point out specific geographies except to say that Sunrise is a big part of those deposits. Yep, sure. So, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the year-over-year stats that were down and the reasons for that, given the fact that we are starting off at a lower starting point. I also mentioned the strong sequential performance.   That performance was driven by Atria and ESL. Sunrise was not as big acontributor to that. There are some less good performance from the sunrise portfolio during that time, so it was actually contributing on a sequential basis, closer to down around 9%."

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to Ventas Fourth Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions]  Sarah Whitford, Director of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nSarah Whitford: Thank you, David. Good morning, and welcome to the Ventas fourth quarter financial results conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued our fourth quarter earnings release supplemental and investor presentation. These materials are available on the Ventas website at ir.ventasreit.com. As a reminder, remarks made today may include forward-looking statements, including certain expectations related to COVID-19 and other matters. . Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, all of which are available on the Ventas website. Certain non-GAAP financial measures will also be discussed on this call. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to our supplemental posted on the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Deborah Cafaro, Chairman and CEO.\nDebra Cafaro: Thank you, Sarah, and I want to welcome all of our shareholders and other participants to the Ventas fourth quarter and year-end 2021 earnings call. 2021 was a year that was bracketed by two very positive developments. At the beginning of the year, we rolled out life-saving vaccines in our senior housing communities, to keep residents and caregivers safe from COVID-19. And as we close out 2021 and begin a new year, we look forward to posting growth in the first quarter and sustained improvement in our senior housing business through 2022. In between those book ends, our Ventas team found a way to drive our business forward in a highly dynamic environment. While prioritizing health and safety, we took proactive steps to capture upside in the senior housing recovery, delivered strong organic growth in our office and triple-net healthcare businesses and stayed financially strong. We also extended our long track record of value-creating external growth with $3.7 billion in new investments focused on our strategic priorities of senior housing and life science. As we enter 2022, we are reporting a fourth quarter that exceeded our expectations on the strength of senior housing and office performance. Carrying that momentum forward, we expect total portfolio NOI growth, once again led by our senior housing and office businesses, with additional contributions from investment activity and deeply appreciated grants from HHS for our assisted living communities in the first quarter. We're pleased that we can benefit from both organic and external growth in the first quarter, consistent with our long-standing value proposition for shareholders. Let me put our investment activity in a broader context and discuss some of the highlights. Since 2010, we've averaged over $3 billion per year in average investment activity across asset classes, executed in a variety of transaction types, large and small. 2021 provided excellent examples of our approach and execution. Consistent with our current capital allocation priorities at this point in the cycle, our 2021 investment activity was allocated 70% to senior housing in attractive markets with significant growth potential, 20% to our high-value life sciences business, including the ground-up development of a new research facility anchored by University of California, Davis and 10% to expanding our successful medical office building franchise. Within the senior housing capital allocation sleeve, we completed both the new senior investment, acquiring over 100 independent living communities in advantaged submarkets at attractive pricing below replacement costs. And we also closed a Canadian senior living deal with a handful of well-performing assets with additional lease-up upside. The Ventas investment team is using its decades of industry experience strong and varied relationships and deal structuring ability to address an extremely robust pipeline as we enter 2022. We continue to identify areas of competitive advantage and pick our spots consistent with our strategic priorities and our analytic assessment of risk reward. We started the year off well, closing over $300 million of investments in the medical office and senior housing areas both with good in-place returns and both generated by ongoing relationships. With significant opportunities in our sites, we are also confident in the array of funding sources available to us as we demonstrated by recycling over $1 billion of capital in 2021, split between $850 million of divestitures of noncore senior housing and MOB assets at attractive valuations and over $350 million of full repayment of well-structured loans that yielded unlevered IRRs exceeding 11%. In addition to capital recycling, these transactions improve the quality of our portfolio and the sustainability of our go-forward cash flows, which also supports our well-covered dividend. We also grew our Ventas Investment Management business during the year and successfully accessed multiple capital markets opportunistically. ZIm is a huge success story and now has over $4.5 billion in assets under management with leading global institutional investors. Our perpetual fund alone raised nearly $0.75 billion in untapped commitments this year. These embedded capital relationships provide another powerful tool to fund growth and build a valuable business at the same time. Turning to our values that dovetail with shareholder priorities. I'd like to highlight our enduring commitment achievement and recognition in the area of environmental, social and governance, or ESG. Our ESG leadership continued during 2021 as we substantially elevated our ESG profile. Among other things, Ventas made meaningful investments in energy-saving technologies at our properties. We were named to CDP's A List, the top 2% of global companies for tackling climate change and also named NAREIT Healthcare's Leader in the Light for the fifth consecutive year. We have also ramped up our actions to improve diversity, equity and inclusion in our company, our industry and our country. We've taken definitive steps in recruiting, investment and community engagement and adopt the goals to drive ourselves even harder in the coming years. Finally, our commitment to outstanding governance continues with rigorous and regular board refreshment, adding directors who are independent and diverse and who bring a record of accomplishment and subject matter expertise to our company, such as recently added directors, Maurie Smith and Margerie Nader. In closing, I'd like to give a huge shout out to my Ventas colleagues whose talent, resilience, agility and commitment to doing their best over these past two years has been inspiring and to our operating partners who have navigated the pandemic on the front lines with courage, caring and commitment. We also deeply value and appreciate our lenders and equity investors who support and encourage us. We are committed to using all the tools at our disposal, including our high-quality, diverse portfolio, experienced team and platform to excel for their benefit. Justin?\nJ. Justin Hutchens: Thank you, Debbie. The senior housing outlook remains bright. Today, I will speak to the favorable trends informing our outlook for growth in the first quarter, provide an update on key portfolio strategy and actions and recap our strong fourth quarter results. I'm happy to report that we expect occupancy revenue and NOI to grow in the first quarter. Demand remains robust with January lead volumes at all-time highs since the onset of the pandemic and clinical conditions are dramatically improving. Core operational performance continues to deliver strong results as operators weather cost challenges, and the macro supply demand backdrop should continue to power underlying growth. I'm proud of the team and operator base we've assembled as we've accomplished a lot over the last 2 years. Our senior housing business is competitively positioned to capture the benefits of the ongoing sector recovery and I could not be more excited for the path ahead. During recent community visits, my team and I witnessed firsthand the strength of the top of the sales funnel, as tours were abundant. As COVID cases have declined and tours have picked up, the energy at our communities has been evident. We are expecting significant revenue growth of 10% in the first quarter supported by pricing power and robust underlying demand. We executed our pricing strategy to drive outsized rent increases led by Atria and Sunrise. Leads in our year-over-year same-store pool of 321 assets exceeded 16,400 in January, the highest volume achieved since before the pandemic. We expect a strong supply-demand backdrop to further support lead and occupancy growth. Supply levels are expected to trend favorably as construction starts and deliveries have improved significantly versus pre-COVID levels. Additionally, our footprint is well positioned as we witnessed new starts in just three of our top 20 markets. Needless to say, I am very encouraged by the fundamentals supporting our business and the opportunity for growth moving forward. Bob will cover our first quarter guidance shortly. But for SHOP, it includes 10% revenue growth at the midpoint and 6% to 15% NOI growth at the lower and upper ends, respectively. The main variable affecting the NOI range will be operating costs. In January, the surge in COVID cases among employees pressured the availability of caregivers in what was already a challenging labor market. Our communities have continued to make progress implementing workforce management and efficiency initiatives. Net hiring trends are showing early signs of improvement as recruiting resources have been bolstered, labor monitoring capabilities have been enhanced and targeted competitive wage increases have been executed. We are hopeful the improving clinical backdrop and the operating initiatives will take hold and support the high end of our guidance range, but the midpoint assumes the costs remain elevated. Moving on to portfolio actions. Having been here for two years now, I couldn't be happier with the ability of Ventas to execute on key priorities related to senior housing. We have been extremely action-oriented, executing on acquisitions, dispositions, transitions, resolutions and targeted capital investments and strengthening our strategic approach to managing the senior housing platform. The Ventas advantage is that we have very deep operational experience in the senior housing sector. We've married this operational expertise with our sophisticated analytical capabilities to execute strategic portfolio actions, enhanced performance management and drive targeted capital investment. Building on the strength of our experienced best-in-class operating partners, we are fully engaged in our aligned interest to create value in our senior housing business. Our latest initiative involves the deployment of our Ventas OI in close partnership with our operators. Ventas brings to the table an emphasis on operational insights, geospatial analytics and capital allocation priorities. I couldn't be more pleased with the excitement amongst the operators and my team as they've engaged in this together. Some examples of outputs include in-depth pricing strategies, workforce recruitment and retention management, targeted value-creating CapEx and formulation of best practices. This approach takes the best of what Ventas has to offer in a collaborative effort with our operators to drive business results. We've taken several decisive actions as we continue executing on our strategy of the right asset in the right market with the right operator. Since the start of 2021 Ventas has added 6 new senior housing operating partners, bringing our portfolio to a total of 37 relationships. This portfolio balance, along with the deep industry experience of our operators in their respective markets positions us to grow our relationships and strengthen our senior housing platform over time. Recent portfolio actions include: The sales of 29 noncore senior housing properties in 2021, resulting in approximately $400 million of gross proceeds. These communities represented orphan assets in markets with elevated competition and in need of significant capital investment. More recently, we completed the acquisition of Mangrove Bay and are thrilled to add this premium, 160-unit senior housing campus through our growing portfolio. What a great opportunity to recycle capital out of noncore assets at a 2.5% yield and into a Class A asset at 5.5% in an attractive market. Turning to fourth quarter performance. Total SHOP NOI achieved the high end of our expectations in the fourth quarter of '21 and same-store average occupancy -- in the fourth quarter of '21 versus the fourth quarter of '20 grew by 200 basis points to 83.4%. Rate and revenue grew for the first time since the start of the pandemic as same-store revenue increased 3.3% year-over-year. As we anticipated, operating expenses, excluding HHS grants increased sequentially by $8.7 million or 2.6%, the majority of which was driven by incremental labor expenses. SHOP NOI, excluding HHS grants for the sequential same-store pool declined modestly by just $1 million or 90 basis points and NOI for the year-over-year same-store pool declined $3.8 million or 3.6%. Both are leading results among peers. For the non-same-store pool, underlying performance was stable. In closing, my enthusiasm for the outlook in our senior housing business remains high as we are well positioned to succeed in what we expect to be a favorable macro backdrop. With that, I'll hand the call over to Bob.\nBob Probst: Thank you, Justin. I'm going to jump straight to our first quarter outlook and finish up with a few summary thoughts on our balance sheet before turning the call to Q&A. Our Q1 guidance is for net income to range from $0.07 to $0.11 per fully diluted share. Q1 normalized FFO is expected to range from $0.76 to $0.80 or $0.78 at the midpoint. . Incorporated in our guidance is $0.08 of HHS grants received in Q1 '22. When excluding HHS grants in both periods and adjusting our Q4 for the onetime $0.03 Kindred M&A fee received in the quarter, we are describing a Q4 of $0.68 to a Q1 of $0.70. That growth can be simply described by $0.02 sequential growth from our senior housing portfolio. In terms of Q1 '22 property expectations, net of HHS grants, we expect Q1 year-over-year same-store cash NOI for the total same-store portfolio to grow in the range of 2.5% to 5.5%. At a segment level, our SHOP guidance is to increase occupancy, 410 basis points year-over-year to grow revenue by 10% led by occupancy gains and strong in-place rate increases and to grow NOI in the range of 6% to 15% ex HHS grants. At the guidance midpoint, Ventas expects operating costs to remain elevated through the first quarter even as COVID-19 clinical conditions moderate. We expect our triple-net portfolio to be down 1.5% to flat in the first quarter, with escalator led growth, offset by modest rent reductions in the triple-net senior housing portfolio from the impact of the pandemic on some of our smaller tenants. Over time, we anticipate the benefits of the senior housing recovery will accrue to these operators as well as to Ventas. We expect one-third of our portfolio that is the office business to grow Q1 same-store NOI by an attractive 4% to 5%. Pete Bulgarelli has led a series of differentiated operational initiatives in MOBs in the last few years which are really bearing fruit. The results of these efforts were evident in the excellent fourth quarter performance for the MOB portfolio, which grew same-store fourth quarter NOI by 3.4%. The second quarter in a row where same-store growth exceeded 3%. Meanwhile, MOB new leasing was up approximately 55% and customer retention was 92% for the quarter. That strength is expected to carry into the first quarter. Final Q1 guidance assumptions of note include no new HHS grants beyond the $33 million already received, no new unannounced material acquisitions or capital markets activities and 403 million fully diluted shares. We have provided additional insights and disclosure in our business update deck and our supplemental including our Q1 versus Q4 sequential shop assumptions as well as a reported segment NOI to FFO trending schedule to allow for easier insight into unique items in our results. Some final comments on balance sheet leverage and liquidity. In 2021, the company enhanced its portfolio and strengthened its balance sheet through $1.2 billion in asset dispositions and loan repayments used to reduce near-term debt. Meanwhile, we extended duration and increased our fixed rate debt to 91% by tapping into the bond markets in the U.S. and Canada, including a 10-year U.S. unsecured offering at 2.5%, the best 10-year health care REIT rate in 2021. Net debt to EBITDA was stable at 7.2 times in the fourth quarter, with the senior housing recovery now underway, expected to improve that ratio over time. And that's a good segue to close with our enthusiasm as we look into 2022 based on the strong senior housing recovery that is now underway and the confidence that we have the portfolio, partners and team to create value for all our stakeholders. And that concludes our prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will turn the call back to the operator.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Nick Joseph with Citi. The line is open.\nNick Joseph: And first of all, thank you for the increased disclosure. It is very helpful. But I guess my question will be on senior housing. So clinical trends continue to trend favorably and assuming there's no disruption from another variant or anything, how do you think about the ability to decrease the use of agency labor going forward?\nJ. Justin Hutchens: It's Justin. So if we step back and you look at the kind of macro backdrop that was causing labor shortages, this was happening in the third quarter. We anticipated that, that would continue into the fourth quarter. What happened -- during that period is we had net hiring in our portfolio so that we are encouraged about the hiring trends. And then Omicron happens, and that really had a big impact in the first part of the first quarter. You can see some trends in our business update, where we show the clinical cases among our employees. . And what's encouraging is you can see that those cases are coming down. But we're not all the way out of the woods yet. So the first thing we're going to look for is to have a healthy workforce, the second thing is to continue those net hiring trends. And then as that continues, then we would expect the agency cost to be able to come down.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.\nSteve Sakwa: I just wanted to stay on senior housing. Justin, the leads and they're certainly positive here. And I'm just wondering if you could talk about the -- maybe the sales cycle. And I realize you're forecasting for a modest decline in occupancy but I'm just wondering, given the pent-up demand that seems to be there and the fact that cases are coming down so quickly, what's the chance that you could actually move folks in maybe later this month and into March and exceed kind of the minus 20 basis points on the occupancy side?\nJ. Justin Hutchens: Sure. So you've probably noted that leads are really high. In fact, I mentioned that they're the highest event since the onsite of the pandemic. Leads are going to be critical to supporting this -- the senior housing recovery that's underway. Getting to the kind of your question, it certainly seems possible that the move-ins that didn't move in late January, could flow over into February, and we would definitely qualify that as pent-up demand. As you know, a lot of the move-in activity happens towards the end of the month. So we're looking forward to see how that plays out.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Rich Anderson with SMBC. Your line is open.\nRich Anderson: So Well tower had their call this week and I suggested that there would never be an elephant hunting type of company in terms of external growth. I'm curious if you have a red line through that mentality as well. And specifically, I'm thinking about how you identified senior housing and life sciences, your strategic priorities. Could a scenario unfold where MOBs become -- given the pricing that's being attributed to that sector, be a significant source of funds to be redeployed into in some significant way that would qualify as elephant hunting.\nDebra Cafaro: Rich, good to hear your voice. Look, I think our competitive advantage has really always been our ability to do all different types of deals across our asset classes and to do so in a way that's created value and that includes sort of getting into MOBs early and building a great business. It includes, of course, allocating capital to senior housing and most recently, our significant investment in value-added life sciences. I mean, that has just been really really incredibly positive for our shareholders. So we have sold MOBs as we talked about this quarter, I think recycling that capital has enabled us to upgrade our portfolio in a very positive way. And we'll continue to look for opportunities to do that while at the same time, our investment activities will continue our long pattern of really picking our spots where we have a competitive advantage and think we're going to add value from good risk-adjusted return.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nNick Yulico: In terms of just going back to the agency labor costs, I wanted to see if you guys had the number for the whole portfolio or at least, I know you break it out for the same store in the presentation, which is very helpful. It's 7.7% of labor, but you have the bigger portfolio now with new senior and others. So I'm just trying to understand like a full agency labor number that was in for the fourth quarter and when you're saying for the first quarter that it's going to be elevated? Or is it just literally like the same amount of agency labor in the first quarter?\nBob Probst: Hey, Nick, it's Bob. I direct you to Page 16 of our investor deck. I think there's a nice description of the pie chart of of revenue and its decomposition. And you can see within that in-house labor is 42%, contract labor is 4%. You can apply that to the entire portfolio or subsets of the portfolio. It will give you the same relative composition and you'll see the picture down below of what that means for the year-over-year pool. Though contract labor is important, and it has accelerated and indeed in January, accelerate even further, the underlying costs really are driven by the in-house labor. And that is really the key. And hence, that's why we're so focused on bringing that in-house. Should we do that successfully, that's clearly upside given the cost per hour. But ultimately, it's a much smaller piece of the overall cost than in-house labor, but clearly an opportunity there. And you can apply that percentage to wherever you like to get to the answer.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nJordan Sadler: Can you guys discuss -- Justin, you touched on the non-same-store portfolio in the quarter I think the comment I heard was that performance was stable. I'm curious if you could kind of flesh that out for us a little bit, specifically as it relates to the NAND transition properties that took place? What's going on with those? And then what's embedded in your guidance for 1Q sequentially for the transition portfolio?\nBob Probst: Let me take the numbers first, then I'll let Justin give some of the color. So the outperformance at the high end of our range that we delivered in the fourth was led by senior housing within led by the non-same-store portfolio. There are two pieces of that in the fourth. There's new senior in the transition 90 assets. Both those pools performed well at the higher end of our expectations. which we're really pleased with. The assumption carrying that then into the first is continued stability, notably within the transition. The new senior assets I'd highlight are in the sequential pool in the first. And so as you look at the guidance for the sequential pool, you'll see the impact of new senior, which is growing nicely. And that's the outlook. So Justin, any commentary on the 90 and how it's going?\nJ. Justin Hutchens: Yes. The only thing I'd add is that we -- as planned, we successfully transitioned all of those communities by the first of the year to different operators and everything is going relatively smooth.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Your line is open.\nSteven Valiquette: So just a question or two here on the triple-net portfolio. So Ventas during the corner with a so positive SS NOI in the fourth quarter in triple net. And with the guide for that to be down 1.5% to flat in the first quarter with senior housing and the road to recovery overall, can we assume that the rent resets are hopefully behind us now within the triple net portfolio?\nDebra Cafaro: Thanks for your question. I think we have a page on this also in the business update. We have really been action-oriented, as Justin talked about and have addressed the lion's share of our senior housing portfolio, which is really 50% Brookdale, and you've seen the EBITDA guide they have there. . Because of the length of the pandemic, there are a couple of small operators that are still challenged by the length of the pandemic. And really, the outcome there is pretty dependent upon HHS support, but more importantly, the recovery in the senior housing business, which we expect to be robust, and we expect to get the benefit of that over time.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Juan Sanabria with BMO. Your line is open.\nJuan Sanabria: Just hoping to follow up on Stephen's question. The triple net portfolio, what percentage is paying kind of cash 1 times EBITDAR? Can you quantify the potential upside as those leases revert to market to the contract rents?\nJ. Justin Hutchens: Yes, sure. So there's -- as Debbie said, that operators that have had elongated challenges. there's just a few and they each represent less than 1% of our overall portfolio. Those those operators will benefit from HHS funds, they'll benefit from operational improvements and the recovery of senior housing just as our SHOP portfolio does as well. So we're anticipating that the triple net would behave similarly through our shop portfolio. We do have some cash flow paying tenants, and that's in a range of around 15% to 20%.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho.\nVikram Malhotra: So maybe just stepping back, Debbie and Justin, just thinking about sort of the external growth piece of it, as you outlined the track record and what you've done in 2021. As we look to '22 and '23, can you talk about just how you think about growing in senior housing, in particular, with what you're seeing fundamentally the longer-term growth opportunities and maybe especially talk about on balance sheet versus maybe using more of a JV structure.\nDebra Cafaro: Good. I'm going to ask John Cobb to address the senior housing question, and I would expect most of our senior housing to be on balance sheet. .\nJohn Cobb: Yes, this is John Cobb. Yes, I mean, I think most of our pipeline, which is fairly robust today really kind of mirrors what we talked about in 2021. We're seeing a lot of senior housing. We're seeing some select life science development opportunities with our partners, Wexford. And we're seeing a few medical office buildings, mainly with our existing partners that we have in our portfolio. But by and large, it's senior housing, we're seeing some really good high-quality portfolios out there that are -- we expect to transact in 2022. So we're very excited and looking looking at these transactions and hopefully, acquiring them.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to to Otayo Okusanya with Credit Suisse. Yoiur line is open.\nDebra Cafaro: Otayo?\nOmotayo Okusanya: You hear me?\nDebra Cafaro: Yes, we can.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Good quarter, great to see things heading in the right direction. I wanted to move off senior housing, talk a little bit about the office portfolio. And then in 4Q, really strong same-store NOI growth yet again from the MOB, somewhat weaker on the Life Sciences side. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about what happened with both areas to kind of perform the strong performance at somewhat underperformance? And then how do we think about that going forward in 2022?\nDebra Cafaro: Well, you made Pete Bulgarelli here. So Pete, can you address the force in the first? .\nPeter Bulgarelli: Yes, to figure out how to turn on my mic. It's just so rare [Indiscernible] Yes. So let's first talk about MOBs. We had a terrific really second half in 2021. As Bob had already mentioned, we did a significant amount of new leasing. Really, for all of office, we did 3.7 million square feet of total leasing. The new leasing was substantially higher than 2020 and for MOBs and even higher than 2019. Our retention, as Bob mentioned, was 86% for the full year. For the quarter, it was 92% and most exciting for December was 95%. What I would say is that it just wasn't a lot of leasing in MOBs. It was really high-quality leasing. Just to give you an example or 2, our weighted average lease term for new leases were 9 years. And what that did in the -- that's for the quarter, and what that did is extended the whole portfolio's Walt from 4.8 years to 5 years. Same thing on escalators. Our escalators for new leasing were 2.9% for the quarter. And that increased the whole portfolios escalators by 30 basis points. So very substantial. And what that allowed us to do is to grow for the first time in a long time, 2 quarters in a row at per quarter. So if you project forward on MOBs in the first quarter of '22, we'd expect that trend to continue, really on the basis of having higher occupancy late in the year and that carrying over. And I can tell you, in January, we're on track in MOBs to achieve what we said we're going to do. So moving to R&I, and I'll go back to the fourth quarter I think you need a little context. In R&I, we had a very good year. We grew by 13.9% for the full year. And without the termination fee, we still grew by almost 4%. And if you look at the supplemental, revenue was fine. We had good revenue for R&I in the fourth quarter. but we had some higher expenses than normal in the fourth quarter, mainly around as buildings start up, you go from rogue dirt to a building to an occupied building Real estate taxes take a while to kind of catch up. And that's one of the factors in the fourth quarter. We had a very large tax payment in the fourth quarter. Secondarily, many of the buildings kind of came back to life became occupied again in the fourth quarter. As a result, utilities went up significantly in addition to in Baltimore and in Philadelphia, 2 of our larger locations, there were large utility rate increases. So now -- so we're very happy with the R&I performance in '21. So if you project forward to '22, they will cover the balance of what I already described for MOBs, it will be largely on rate -- sorry, on occupancy growth carrying into the first quarter and strong expense control. So I'm very bullish about the office business really in 2022. Sorry for the long answer, I got carried away.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.\nJoshua Dennerlein: I just wanted to ask about maybe the residential -- or the resident renewals going out now? I know for the January 1, I think it was 8%. Just curious how they trended for the people rolling later -- And then maybe just an update on the re-leasing spreads and how we should think about them going forward.\nDebra Cafaro: Yes. I'm glad you raised that because obviously, as we talk about revenue growth and the in-place January 1 rate increases are extremely important I think it's important to note that, that applies to a part of our portfolio, and we'll continue to have pricing opportunities as we deal with the anniversary renewals and rate increases as we deal with new residents coming into the portfolio as occupancy is increasing and also the care component, which can increase throughout the year. So those are all opportunities that we have in front of us. And obviously, it was a good start with the 8% increase in January.\nJ. Justin Hutchens: And then I would just add that as we're working to identify what the appropriate pricing is moving forward. As I mentioned, Ventas OI, which really stands for operational insights, and really taking the best of our data analytics, combining it with our operating experience and the experience and expertise of our operating partners. We collect vast amounts of geospatial data and demographics wealth penetration rates, new construction to train our demand and supply forecasting models, which have been remarkably accurate as it pertains to decision-making on pricing, acquisitions, dispositions. So we have that approach our disposal and the levers that Debbie mentioned around care, street rates and the anniversary rent increases that will happen throughout the rest of the year.\nDebra Cafaro: And the demand that we're seeing from the leads obviously demonstrates the value proposition and the strong consumer demand for these services. And so that is tailwind as well that should support these efforts.\nBob Probst: I'll add. I don't know if you mentioned this, the re-leasing spreads have been improving. Market price is firming. It's obviously fundamental Yes. So the combination of the in-place increases and improving re-leasing spread, the care component, which can be priced throughout the year and the anniversary pricing. In a dynamic inflationary environment, there's a number of different levers at our disposal.\nDebra Cafaro: Thanks, Josh.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Feinstein: You have Adam on for Rich. I hope you guys are all well. I just wanted to kind of ask about the kind of the expense control and the agency labor. I recognize that the kind of the pressures there. kind of wanted to see if you could maybe kind of quantify the kind of December versus January versus February to date impacts. How have trends gone the agency labor usage increased over these 3 months, decrease kind of if you could just kind of quantify the sequential move that I think would be kind of helpful to think about how kind of the quarter is playing out and what kind of the outlook would be for the next couple of quarters?\nBob Probst: Sure. Again, I'll direct you to Page 16 of the business deck. I think it's nice to be able to see how labor breaks down. And for this pool, there's $16 million of contract labor in the fourth quarter. I'll call it, just $5 million-ish on a run rate basis. We saw that accelerate to call it $6 million in December and into January. And that's what we've effectively carried forward in our assumptions. Each pool is different, but that kind of gives you a flavor of it. Clearly, if the clinical situation improves, the staffing continues to get traction, that would be an opportunity. But that's how we dimensional that cost.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.\nMichael Carroll: You guys did a good job detailing your recent capital recycling transactions. I guess where does Ventas stand in that overall process? Mean how much of the current portfolio specifically in the seniors housing kind of falls in that noncore bucket that the company would likely to eventually sell out of?\nJ. Justin Hutchens: It's Justin. I'm happy to report, as I mentioning all the actions we've taken that -- the heavy lifting is really behind us. There'll always be some noncore assets that we're looking to sell or transition or invest in or do something to create value, but it will be a small number moving forward.\nOperator: Okay. Next, we'll go to Mike Mueller with JP Morgan.\nMike Mueller: For the $205 million of 4Q shop labor, where do you think that number goes to you're fully staffed at market prices but without the heavy contract labor component?\nBob Probst: The real question I think that you have to answer for that is what's happening to the $189 million of in-house labor. Again, I think the focus is very much and rightly so been on contract labor, but the key in terms of total cost is in-house labor. And that gets to the macro question of where the labor market and therefore, inflation go, which I'm not going to pretend I know the answer to. I think the economists will tell you many of them that, that will -- that macro situation will improve in the back half. We subscribe to that, but very tough to call. And so we're not going to make a long-term focus.\nDebra Cafaro: And in the near term, we're projecting essentially a run rate in the quarter. .\nOperator: Next, we'll go to John Pawlowski with Green Street.\nJordan Sadler: Justin, a quick question for you, and apologies if you've chatted about this in recent quarters, but I am hoping you can help quantify the operating upside of recent initiatives you rolled out and you are currently rolling out new to the company? So just trying to understand how much higher the earnings and the NOI power of the SHOP portfolio will be under your purview versus the betas bold?\nJ. Justin Hutchens: Yes. Well, so the -- there's been a lot of actions over the last couple of years. Certainly, some priorities were accelerated based on the fact that we were going through the pandemic. And the goal of all of the actions, whether we're acquiring or disposing or making a decision to invest CapEx, transitioning assets under new management is to create value and create just a greater opportunity to drive NOI over time. So I think really, time is going to tell. We're off to a good start. We're pleased with that we set expectations in the fourth quarter, and we're able to meet those expectations, and we are excited about the growth in the first quarter off to a good start.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Daniel Bernstein with Capital One. Your line is open.\nDaniel Bernstein: Nobody get excited. I'm going to ask an MOB question. I just -- go ahead. Not just you guys, but your peers have I've also spoken in the last several quarters about better re-leasing spreads, better annual rent bumps and MOBs. And so given the inflationary environment, kind of what -- how do you think the rent bumps can improve going forward? I mean can we push north of 3% on rent bumps? Can we see higher re-leasing spreads and kind of what's the willingness of tenants and MOBs to accept that in the past, that hasn't been the case. But recently, it seems like it has been.\nDebra Cafaro: I mean one thing that's really important to remember in the MOB business is that the assets are priced and have a low cap rate because of the reliability of the cash flows, as we've seen over the past two years, the benefit of that and the reliable growth. They also have higher margin, a much lower labor component. And so you have to look at both sides of the equation, I think, when you're thinking about the risk/reward of an asset class. And so Pete can answer, we ask him every 15 minutes if they can get higher escalators. And so we'll let him answer that.\nPeter Bulgarelli: Daniel, I think it's a great question. This is Pete. And given that our portfolio is largely on-campus, there aren't a lot of options just sitting there waiting to compete with you. Usually, it requires new construction to compete. And certainly, with inflation and the environment we have today, the cost of building a new MOB and the required leasing rates have gone up. And so our leasing team are is all -- it's very location in city-specific as far as what's happening to the demand of medical office space as well as construction costs. But in many cases, we're competing against brand-new medical office buildings, which does give us room to raise our escalators and honestly, our initial rental rates.\nDebra Cafaro: Yes. And remember, you're pushing through the expense increases to the tenants as well. So you really have to look at the revenue and the expense side to really evaluate the benefits of the MOB.\nPeter Bulgarelli: Yes. We only have a couple of percent of our leases that are gross leases. Rest are some fashion of pass-throughs of expenses. .\nOperator: And next, we have a follow-up from Juan Sanabria with BMO.\nJuan Sanabria: Just a quick modeling question. For 2020, realizing you're not giving full year guidance for earnings. But just wanted to get a sense of what you guys are expecting from a FAD CapEx and G&A perspective for those 2 line items?\nBob Probst: Sure. So I'll start with G&A. We did give a $37 million number for the first quarter. with stock comp amortization, which is our FFO treatment on that. So $37 million. And if you look at just 2021 G&A Obviously, that was a very good year in terms of year-over-year in cost management. We hope this year, we get back to normal business as usual, to some degree, which will obviously have an impact in terms of just T&E and things like that going up. . But first quarter, very much in line with risk quarter year-over-year, frankly. In terms of FAD CapEx, really, there's things -- a few things I'd highlight. Obviously, with the acquisitions we've done, particularly in new senior in a higher shop portfolio base. There's more FAD CapEx dollars. And secondly, and Justin should touch on this, more opportunities for us, I think, to really focus using our OI as now branded to identify opportunities to invest in the portfolio. And so we'll see some acceleration there.\nJ. Justin Hutchens: Yes. And I'd just say consistent with some of my other comments, the goal is to create value. CapEx is a tool at disposal and with the use of our analytics and operational expertise and combined with the operating partners, local market experience, we can make smart choices and anticipate returns on that investment.\nOperator: We have a follow-up from Jordan. We have a follow-up from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nJordan Sadler: A quick one here for you, Justin, and then a follow-up to Bob. Just Justin, shape of the recovery this year, just mathematically, I'm curious if you've taken a look at the portfolio uplift potential throughout the year, I mean, could this year look similar to last year in terms of the occupancy gains, given sort of the strengths and lead you're seeing early on? I know it's very difficult to look out. But I'm kind of saying mathematically, given sort of the -- a bit of an increase in occupancy already. How are you thinking about sort of the potential uplift in occupancy throughout the year in the SHOP portfolio? And then, Bob, just on the asset sales or actually, there's a loan maturing this year, let's say, almost $500 million. I'm just curious about timing or expectations will it be repaid or extended?\nDebra Cafaro: Yes. I'll take the loan. That's a loan that can be extended. And so we -- that's our expectation at the current time. And then in terms of occupancy, I think we're projecting significant year-over-year occupancy in the first quarter, which has been outperforming yet following seasonal patterns. And so that is something to think about when you're looking at the slope for the year.\nOperator: Next, we have a follow-up from Omotayo Okusanya with Credit Suisse.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Yes. Just 1 for Justin maybe Bob. You did talk about the releasing spreads improving, but still being negative. And I guess the question I have is, with that to being negative, I guess I'm still so what surprised that you can push renewals as high as especially kind of given again, industry-wide occupancy is still kind of well delivered, it was prepandemic. So trying to understand those dynamics of why is it that you don't get that much pushback when there's still a high vacancy industry-wise and market rate just to kind of below where renewal rates are.\nDebra Cafaro: That's a great observation. And I think it really does go to a value proposition that being offered by the communities for the theaters and their families that at this level of occupancy, we have been able to successfully drive pricing in the first as of the beginning of the year, and that portends well kind of for the future as occupancy increases. So Justin, do you want to talk about the normal re-leasing spreads and how...\nJ. Justin Hutchens: Sure. Yes. So the re-leasing spread, Bob mentioned this, that we saw it tighten through the end of '21, even all the way back to pre-pandemic levels, which were like negative mid-single digits. That -- the high-class problem is that we have the large increases that happen in January, and then you start comparing to relatively higher rents. And so technically, the releasing spread widens, but it doesn't mean that your pricing power doesn't continue to improve. And one thing that we do look forward to that this backdrop seems to support is the opportunity given the demand at the doorstep, to eventually get to a place where you have positive re-leasing spreads again, which we've had in other parts -- other -- throughout the sector's history, we've seen that at times. And certainly, there seems to be support moving forward for that to happen again.\nOperator: Okay. Next, we'll go to a follow-up for Vikram Mahata with Mizuo.\nVikram Malhotra: Just maybe one broader question as we look into second half '22 and '23. With new senior and just your other acquisitions, you now have more of a tilt towards IL versus AL in the RIDEA pool eventually same-store pool. What does that mean from an expense growth standpoint and then a pricing power standpoint for the second half in '23?\nJ. Justin Hutchens: Well, certainly, independent living is a high-margin business, has relatively low labor costs compared to assisted living. It it's a little less need driven. So you may not see the occupancy pop, but we expect a higher ceiling in occupancy and independent living over time because there's less fly that faces it. And that's consistent with historical track record of independent living as well. So we look forward to revenue growth in the independent living communities and certainly assisted living is need-driven. It performs well. It seems like no matter what the backdrop is as long as there's a way to pay for the service, which given the housing values and wealth demographics there is. And so we expect that to continue as well. And the opportunity really is to price in labor costs over time. And we're -- as we've said, we're off to a good start given our high in-house brand increases.\nDebra Cafaro: One other thing we like about independent living is really -- it meets -- this is -- we're getting to the period now we're over 8% growing over 3%. So we're really hitting kind of that demographic boom. And the independent living tenant customer had a little bit earlier age. So that's another part of the business in addition kind of the lower labor hits that we like. Great. Okay. we have one more question. Okay.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Nick Joseph with Citi.\nMichael Bilerman: It's Michael Bilerman here with Nick. I was wanting to go just in terms of acquisitions in terms of the fund, as your cost of capital has improved, both from a debt and equity perspective, how do you sort of look at that opportunity to buy within the fund relative to on balance sheet? And how are you balancing that as you're looking at the transaction market for opportunities?\nDebra Cafaro: Yes. Thank you. Yes. So the fund is a great tool. Obviously, our VIM business is going strong, and it gives us a great tool to continue to grow. It was very -- the fund itself was very thoughtfully conceived in order to be a net additive component of our growth strategy so that it really is designed to address -- we're very disciplined about capital cost and capital allocation. And so it's really designed to address many of the opportunities that were really not as attractive to us on balance sheet because of the relationship between our cost of capital and the pricing of that type of assets. A great example is our South San Francisco life science building, our John Hopkins life science building, which were put in the fund with great success. And those are things that we may not have been able to acquire had we been doing it on balance sheet, but now we have 20% interest in it. We have asset management fees. We have ultimately, other types of economic incentives if the performance is good, which it has been. So a very thoughtful kind of defined strategy to use them to grow our business for the benefit both of our public shareholders and the third-party institutional capital. .\nOperator: And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn it back over to Deborah Cafaro, Ventas' Chairman and CEO.\nDebra Cafaro: Well, it's been a great call, and I'm very glad to end the year on a very good quarter and look forward to another positive one in the first. I really want to thank everyone for joining our call today. I can't tell you how much we appreciate your ongoing support and interest in the company, and we look forward to seeing you in person soon. Thank you.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bob Probst",
            "content": "Thank you, Justin. I'm going to jump straight to our first quarter outlook and finish up with a few summary thoughts on our balance sheet before turning the call to Q&A. Our Q1 guidance is for net income to range from $0.07 to $0.11 per fully diluted share. Q1 normalized FFO is expected to range from $0.76 to $0.80 or $0.78 at the midpoint. . Incorporated in our guidance is $0.08 of HHS grants received in Q1 '22. When excluding HHS grants in both periods and adjusting our Q4 for the onetime $0.03 Kindred M&A fee received in the quarter, we are describing a Q4 of $0.68 to a Q1 of $0.70. That growth can be simply described by $0.02 sequential growth from our senior housing portfolio. In terms of Q1 '22 property expectations, net of HHS grants, we expect Q1 year-over-year same-store cash NOI for the total same-store portfolio to grow in the range of 2.5% to 5.5%. At a segment level, our SHOP guidance is to increase occupancy, 410 basis points year-over-year to grow revenue by 10% led by occupancy gains and strong in-place rate increases and to grow NOI in the range of 6% to 15% ex HHS grants. At the guidance midpoint, Ventas expects operating costs to remain elevated through the first quarter even as COVID-19 clinical conditions moderate. We expect our triple-net portfolio to be down 1.5% to flat in the first quarter, with escalator led growth, offset by modest rent reductions in the triple-net senior housing portfolio from the impact of the pandemic on some of our smaller tenants. Over time, we anticipate the benefits of the senior housing recovery will accrue to these operators as well as to Ventas. We expect one-third of our portfolio that is the office business to grow Q1 same-store NOI by an attractive 4% to 5%. Pete Bulgarelli has led a series of differentiated operational initiatives in MOBs in the last few years which are really bearing fruit. The results of these efforts were evident in the excellent fourth quarter performance for the MOB portfolio, which grew same-store fourth quarter NOI by 3.4%. The second quarter in a row where same-store growth exceeded 3%. Meanwhile, MOB new leasing was up approximately 55% and customer retention was 92% for the quarter. That strength is expected to carry into the first quarter. Final Q1 guidance assumptions of note include no new HHS grants beyond the $33 million already received, no new unannounced material acquisitions or capital markets activities and 403 million fully diluted shares. We have provided additional insights and disclosure in our business update deck and our supplemental including our Q1 versus Q4 sequential shop assumptions as well as a reported segment NOI to FFO trending schedule to allow for easier insight into unique items in our results. Some final comments on balance sheet leverage and liquidity. In 2021, the company enhanced its portfolio and strengthened its balance sheet through $1.2 billion in asset dispositions and loan repayments used to reduce near-term debt. Meanwhile, we extended duration and increased our fixed rate debt to 91% by tapping into the bond markets in the U.S. and Canada, including a 10-year U.S. unsecured offering at 2.5%, the best 10-year health care REIT rate in 2021. Net debt to EBITDA was stable at 7.2 times in the fourth quarter, with the senior housing recovery now underway, expected to improve that ratio over time. And that's a good segue to close with our enthusiasm as we look into 2022 based on the strong senior housing recovery that is now underway and the confidence that we have the portfolio, partners and team to create value for all our stakeholders. And that concludes our prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will turn the call back to the operator. Hey, Nick, it's Bob. I direct you to Page 16 of our investor deck. I think there's a nice description of the pie chart of of revenue and its decomposition. And you can see within that in-house labor is 42%, contract labor is 4%. You can apply that to the entire portfolio or subsets of the portfolio. It will give you the same relative composition and you'll see the picture down below of what that means for the year-over-year pool. Though contract labor is important, and it has accelerated and indeed in January, accelerate even further, the underlying costs really are driven by the in-house labor. And that is really the key. And hence, that's why we're so focused on bringing that in-house. Should we do that successfully, that's clearly upside given the cost per hour. But ultimately, it's a much smaller piece of the overall cost than in-house labor, but clearly an opportunity there. And you can apply that percentage to wherever you like to get to the answer. Let me take the numbers first, then I'll let Justin give some of the color. So the outperformance at the high end of our range that we delivered in the fourth was led by senior housing within led by the non-same-store portfolio. There are two pieces of that in the fourth. There's new senior in the transition 90 assets. Both those pools performed well at the higher end of our expectations. which we're really pleased with. The assumption carrying that then into the first is continued stability, notably within the transition. The new senior assets I'd highlight are in the sequential pool in the first. And so as you look at the guidance for the sequential pool, you'll see the impact of new senior, which is growing nicely. And that's the outlook. So Justin, any commentary on the 90 and how it's going? I'll add. I don't know if you mentioned this, the re-leasing spreads have been improving. Market price is firming. It's obviously fundamental Yes. So the combination of the in-place increases and improving re-leasing spread, the care component, which can be priced throughout the year and the anniversary pricing. In a dynamic inflationary environment, there's a number of different levers at our disposal. Sure. Again, I'll direct you to Page 16 of the business deck. I think it's nice to be able to see how labor breaks down. And for this pool, there's $16 million of contract labor in the fourth quarter. I'll call it, just $5 million-ish on a run rate basis. We saw that accelerate to call it $6 million in December and into January. And that's what we've effectively carried forward in our assumptions. Each pool is different, but that kind of gives you a flavor of it. Clearly, if the clinical situation improves, the staffing continues to get traction, that would be an opportunity. But that's how we dimensional that cost. The real question I think that you have to answer for that is what's happening to the $189 million of in-house labor. Again, I think the focus is very much and rightly so been on contract labor, but the key in terms of total cost is in-house labor. And that gets to the macro question of where the labor market and therefore, inflation go, which I'm not going to pretend I know the answer to. I think the economists will tell you many of them that, that will -- that macro situation will improve in the back half. We subscribe to that, but very tough to call. And so we're not going to make a long-term focus. Sure. So I'll start with G&A. We did give a $37 million number for the first quarter. with stock comp amortization, which is our FFO treatment on that. So $37 million. And if you look at just 2021 G&A Obviously, that was a very good year in terms of year-over-year in cost management. We hope this year, we get back to normal business as usual, to some degree, which will obviously have an impact in terms of just T&E and things like that going up. . But first quarter, very much in line with risk quarter year-over-year, frankly. In terms of FAD CapEx, really, there's things -- a few things I'd highlight. Obviously, with the acquisitions we've done, particularly in new senior in a higher shop portfolio base. There's more FAD CapEx dollars. And secondly, and Justin should touch on this, more opportunities for us, I think, to really focus using our OI as now branded to identify opportunities to invest in the portfolio. And so we'll see some acceleration there."

            "name": "Peter Bulgarelli",
            "content": "Yes, to figure out how to turn on my mic. It's just so rare [Indiscernible] Yes. So let's first talk about MOBs. We had a terrific really second half in 2021. As Bob had already mentioned, we did a significant amount of new leasing. Really, for all of office, we did 3.7 million square feet of total leasing. The new leasing was substantially higher than 2020 and for MOBs and even higher than 2019. Our retention, as Bob mentioned, was 86% for the full year. For the quarter, it was 92% and most exciting for December was 95%. What I would say is that it just wasn't a lot of leasing in MOBs. It was really high-quality leasing. Just to give you an example or 2, our weighted average lease term for new leases were 9 years. And what that did in the -- that's for the quarter, and what that did is extended the whole portfolio's Walt from 4.8 years to 5 years. Same thing on escalators. Our escalators for new leasing were 2.9% for the quarter. And that increased the whole portfolios escalators by 30 basis points. So very substantial. And what that allowed us to do is to grow for the first time in a long time, 2 quarters in a row at per quarter. So if you project forward on MOBs in the first quarter of '22, we'd expect that trend to continue, really on the basis of having higher occupancy late in the year and that carrying over. And I can tell you, in January, we're on track in MOBs to achieve what we said we're going to do. So moving to R&I, and I'll go back to the fourth quarter I think you need a little context. In R&I, we had a very good year. We grew by 13.9% for the full year. And without the termination fee, we still grew by almost 4%. And if you look at the supplemental, revenue was fine. We had good revenue for R&I in the fourth quarter. but we had some higher expenses than normal in the fourth quarter, mainly around as buildings start up, you go from rogue dirt to a building to an occupied building Real estate taxes take a while to kind of catch up. And that's one of the factors in the fourth quarter. We had a very large tax payment in the fourth quarter. Secondarily, many of the buildings kind of came back to life became occupied again in the fourth quarter. As a result, utilities went up significantly in addition to in Baltimore and in Philadelphia, 2 of our larger locations, there were large utility rate increases. So now -- so we're very happy with the R&I performance in '21. So if you project forward to '22, they will cover the balance of what I already described for MOBs, it will be largely on rate -- sorry, on occupancy growth carrying into the first quarter and strong expense control. So I'm very bullish about the office business really in 2022. Sorry for the long answer, I got carried away. Daniel, I think it's a great question. This is Pete. And given that our portfolio is largely on-campus, there aren't a lot of options just sitting there waiting to compete with you. Usually, it requires new construction to compete. And certainly, with inflation and the environment we have today, the cost of building a new MOB and the required leasing rates have gone up. And so our leasing team are is all -- it's very location in city-specific as far as what's happening to the demand of medical office space as well as construction costs. But in many cases, we're competing against brand-new medical office buildings, which does give us room to raise our escalators and honestly, our initial rental rates. Yes.

            "name": "Debra Cafaro",
            "content": "Thank you, Sarah, and I want to welcome all of our shareholders and other participants to the Ventas fourth quarter and year-end 2021 earnings call. 2021 was a year that was bracketed by two very positive developments. At the beginning of the year, we rolled out life-saving vaccines in our senior housing communities, to keep residents and caregivers safe from COVID-19. And as we close out 2021 and begin a new year, we look forward to posting growth in the first quarter and sustained improvement in our senior housing business through 2022. In between those book ends, our Ventas team found a way to drive our business forward in a highly dynamic environment. While prioritizing health and safety, we took proactive steps to capture upside in the senior housing recovery, delivered strong organic growth in our office and triple-net healthcare businesses and stayed financially strong. We also extended our long track record of value-creating external growth with $3.7 billion in new investments focused on our strategic priorities of senior housing and life science. As we enter 2022, we are reporting a fourth quarter that exceeded our expectations on the strength of senior housing and office performance. Carrying that momentum forward, we expect total portfolio NOI growth, once again led by our senior housing and office businesses, with additional contributions from investment activity and deeply appreciated grants from HHS for our assisted living communities in the first quarter. We're pleased that we can benefit from both organic and external growth in the first quarter, consistent with our long-standing value proposition for shareholders. Let me put our investment activity in a broader context and discuss some of the highlights. Since 2010, we've averaged over $3 billion per year in average investment activity across asset classes, executed in a variety of transaction types, large and small. 2021 provided excellent examples of our approach and execution. Consistent with our current capital allocation priorities at this point in the cycle, our 2021 investment activity was allocated 70% to senior housing in attractive markets with significant growth potential, 20% to our high-value life sciences business, including the ground-up development of a new research facility anchored by University of California, Davis and 10% to expanding our successful medical office building franchise. Within the senior housing capital allocation sleeve, we completed both the new senior investment, acquiring over 100 independent living communities in advantaged submarkets at attractive pricing below replacement costs. And we also closed a Canadian senior living deal with a handful of well-performing assets with additional lease-up upside. The Ventas investment team is using its decades of industry experience strong and varied relationships and deal structuring ability to address an extremely robust pipeline as we enter 2022. We continue to identify areas of competitive advantage and pick our spots consistent with our strategic priorities and our analytic assessment of risk reward. We started the year off well, closing over $300 million of investments in the medical office and senior housing areas both with good in-place returns and both generated by ongoing relationships. With significant opportunities in our sites, we are also confident in the array of funding sources available to us as we demonstrated by recycling over $1 billion of capital in 2021, split between $850 million of divestitures of noncore senior housing and MOB assets at attractive valuations and over $350 million of full repayment of well-structured loans that yielded unlevered IRRs exceeding 11%. In addition to capital recycling, these transactions improve the quality of our portfolio and the sustainability of our go-forward cash flows, which also supports our well-covered dividend. We also grew our Ventas Investment Management business during the year and successfully accessed multiple capital markets opportunistically. ZIm is a huge success story and now has over $4.5 billion in assets under management with leading global institutional investors. Our perpetual fund alone raised nearly $0.75 billion in untapped commitments this year. These embedded capital relationships provide another powerful tool to fund growth and build a valuable business at the same time. Turning to our values that dovetail with shareholder priorities. I'd like to highlight our enduring commitment achievement and recognition in the area of environmental, social and governance, or ESG. Our ESG leadership continued during 2021 as we substantially elevated our ESG profile. Among other things, Ventas made meaningful investments in energy-saving technologies at our properties. We were named to CDP's A List, the top 2% of global companies for tackling climate change and also named NAREIT Healthcare's Leader in the Light for the fifth consecutive year. We have also ramped up our actions to improve diversity, equity and inclusion in our company, our industry and our country. We've taken definitive steps in recruiting, investment and community engagement and adopt the goals to drive ourselves even harder in the coming years. Finally, our commitment to outstanding governance continues with rigorous and regular board refreshment, adding directors who are independent and diverse and who bring a record of accomplishment and subject matter expertise to our company, such as recently added directors, Maurie Smith and Margerie Nader. In closing, I'd like to give a huge shout out to my Ventas colleagues whose talent, resilience, agility and commitment to doing their best over these past two years has been inspiring and to our operating partners who have navigated the pandemic on the front lines with courage, caring and commitment. We also deeply value and appreciate our lenders and equity investors who support and encourage us. We are committed to using all the tools at our disposal, including our high-quality, diverse portfolio, experienced team and platform to excel for their benefit. Justin? Rich, good to hear your voice. Look, I think our competitive advantage has really always been our ability to do all different types of deals across our asset classes and to do so in a way that's created value and that includes sort of getting into MOBs early and building a great business. It includes, of course, allocating capital to senior housing and most recently, our significant investment in value-added life sciences. I mean, that has just been really really incredibly positive for our shareholders. So we have sold MOBs as we talked about this quarter, I think recycling that capital has enabled us to upgrade our portfolio in a very positive way. And we'll continue to look for opportunities to do that while at the same time, our investment activities will continue our long pattern of really picking our spots where we have a competitive advantage and think we're going to add value from good risk-adjusted return. Thanks for your question. I think we have a page on this also in the business update. We have really been action-oriented, as Justin talked about and have addressed the lion's share of our senior housing portfolio, which is really 50% Brookdale, and you've seen the EBITDA guide they have there. . Because of the length of the pandemic, there are a couple of small operators that are still challenged by the length of the pandemic. And really, the outcome there is pretty dependent upon HHS support, but more importantly, the recovery in the senior housing business, which we expect to be robust, and we expect to get the benefit of that over time. Good. I'm going to ask John Cobb to address the senior housing question, and I would expect most of our senior housing to be on balance sheet. . Otayo? Yes, we can. Well, you made Pete Bulgarelli here. So Pete, can you address the force in the first? . Yes. I'm glad you raised that because obviously, as we talk about revenue growth and the in-place January 1 rate increases are extremely important I think it's important to note that, that applies to a part of our portfolio, and we'll continue to have pricing opportunities as we deal with the anniversary renewals and rate increases as we deal with new residents coming into the portfolio as occupancy is increasing and also the care component, which can increase throughout the year. So those are all opportunities that we have in front of us. And obviously, it was a good start with the 8% increase in January. And the demand that we're seeing from the leads obviously demonstrates the value proposition and the strong consumer demand for these services. And so that is tailwind as well that should support these efforts. Thanks, Josh. And in the near term, we're projecting essentially a run rate in the quarter. . I mean one thing that's really important to remember in the MOB business is that the assets are priced and have a low cap rate because of the reliability of the cash flows, as we've seen over the past two years, the benefit of that and the reliable growth. They also have higher margin, a much lower labor component. And so you have to look at both sides of the equation, I think, when you're thinking about the risk/reward of an asset class. And so Pete can answer, we ask him every 15 minutes if they can get higher escalators. And so we'll let him answer that. Yes. And remember, you're pushing through the expense increases to the tenants as well. So you really have to look at the revenue and the expense side to really evaluate the benefits of the MOB. Yes. I'll take the loan. That's a loan that can be extended. And so we -- that's our expectation at the current time. And then in terms of occupancy, I think we're projecting significant year-over-year occupancy in the first quarter, which has been outperforming yet following seasonal patterns. And so that is something to think about when you're looking at the slope for the year. That's a great observation. And I think it really does go to a value proposition that being offered by the communities for the theaters and their families that at this level of occupancy, we have been able to successfully drive pricing in the first as of the beginning of the year, and that portends well kind of for the future as occupancy increases. So Justin, do you want to talk about the normal re-leasing spreads and how... One other thing we like about independent living is really -- it meets -- this is -- we're getting to the period now we're over 8% growing over 3%. So we're really hitting kind of that demographic boom. And the independent living tenant customer had a little bit earlier age. So that's another part of the business in addition kind of the lower labor hits that we like. Great. Okay. we have one more question. Okay. Yes. Thank you. Yes. So the fund is a great tool. Obviously, our VIM business is going strong, and it gives us a great tool to continue to grow. It was very -- the fund itself was very thoughtfully conceived in order to be a net additive component of our growth strategy so that it really is designed to address -- we're very disciplined about capital cost and capital allocation. And so it's really designed to address many of the opportunities that were really not as attractive to us on balance sheet because of the relationship between our cost of capital and the pricing of that type of assets. A great example is our South San Francisco life science building, our John Hopkins life science building, which were put in the fund with great success. And those are things that we may not have been able to acquire had we been doing it on balance sheet, but now we have 20% interest in it. We have asset management fees. We have ultimately, other types of economic incentives if the performance is good, which it has been. So a very thoughtful kind of defined strategy to use them to grow our business for the benefit both of our public shareholders and the third-party institutional capital. . Well, it's been a great call, and I'm very glad to end the year on a very good quarter and look forward to another positive one in the first. I really want to thank everyone for joining our call today. I can't tell you how much we appreciate your ongoing support and interest in the company, and we look forward to seeing you in person soon. Thank you."

            "name": "J. Justin Hutchens",
            "content": "Thank you, Debbie. The senior housing outlook remains bright. Today, I will speak to the favorable trends informing our outlook for growth in the first quarter, provide an update on key portfolio strategy and actions and recap our strong fourth quarter results. I'm happy to report that we expect occupancy revenue and NOI to grow in the first quarter. Demand remains robust with January lead volumes at all-time highs since the onset of the pandemic and clinical conditions are dramatically improving. Core operational performance continues to deliver strong results as operators weather cost challenges, and the macro supply demand backdrop should continue to power underlying growth. I'm proud of the team and operator base we've assembled as we've accomplished a lot over the last 2 years. Our senior housing business is competitively positioned to capture the benefits of the ongoing sector recovery and I could not be more excited for the path ahead. During recent community visits, my team and I witnessed firsthand the strength of the top of the sales funnel, as tours were abundant. As COVID cases have declined and tours have picked up, the energy at our communities has been evident. We are expecting significant revenue growth of 10% in the first quarter supported by pricing power and robust underlying demand. We executed our pricing strategy to drive outsized rent increases led by Atria and Sunrise. Leads in our year-over-year same-store pool of 321 assets exceeded 16,400 in January, the highest volume achieved since before the pandemic. We expect a strong supply-demand backdrop to further support lead and occupancy growth. Supply levels are expected to trend favorably as construction starts and deliveries have improved significantly versus pre-COVID levels. Additionally, our footprint is well positioned as we witnessed new starts in just three of our top 20 markets. Needless to say, I am very encouraged by the fundamentals supporting our business and the opportunity for growth moving forward. Bob will cover our first quarter guidance shortly. But for SHOP, it includes 10% revenue growth at the midpoint and 6% to 15% NOI growth at the lower and upper ends, respectively. The main variable affecting the NOI range will be operating costs. In January, the surge in COVID cases among employees pressured the availability of caregivers in what was already a challenging labor market. Our communities have continued to make progress implementing workforce management and efficiency initiatives. Net hiring trends are showing early signs of improvement as recruiting resources have been bolstered, labor monitoring capabilities have been enhanced and targeted competitive wage increases have been executed. We are hopeful the improving clinical backdrop and the operating initiatives will take hold and support the high end of our guidance range, but the midpoint assumes the costs remain elevated. Moving on to portfolio actions. Having been here for two years now, I couldn't be happier with the ability of Ventas to execute on key priorities related to senior housing. We have been extremely action-oriented, executing on acquisitions, dispositions, transitions, resolutions and targeted capital investments and strengthening our strategic approach to managing the senior housing platform. The Ventas advantage is that we have very deep operational experience in the senior housing sector. We've married this operational expertise with our sophisticated analytical capabilities to execute strategic portfolio actions, enhanced performance management and drive targeted capital investment. Building on the strength of our experienced best-in-class operating partners, we are fully engaged in our aligned interest to create value in our senior housing business. Our latest initiative involves the deployment of our Ventas OI in close partnership with our operators. Ventas brings to the table an emphasis on operational insights, geospatial analytics and capital allocation priorities. I couldn't be more pleased with the excitement amongst the operators and my team as they've engaged in this together. Some examples of outputs include in-depth pricing strategies, workforce recruitment and retention management, targeted value-creating CapEx and formulation of best practices. This approach takes the best of what Ventas has to offer in a collaborative effort with our operators to drive business results. We've taken several decisive actions as we continue executing on our strategy of the right asset in the right market with the right operator. Since the start of 2021 Ventas has added 6 new senior housing operating partners, bringing our portfolio to a total of 37 relationships. This portfolio balance, along with the deep industry experience of our operators in their respective markets positions us to grow our relationships and strengthen our senior housing platform over time. Recent portfolio actions include: The sales of 29 noncore senior housing properties in 2021, resulting in approximately $400 million of gross proceeds. These communities represented orphan assets in markets with elevated competition and in need of significant capital investment. More recently, we completed the acquisition of Mangrove Bay and are thrilled to add this premium, 160-unit senior housing campus through our growing portfolio. What a great opportunity to recycle capital out of noncore assets at a 2.5% yield and into a Class A asset at 5.5% in an attractive market. Turning to fourth quarter performance. Total SHOP NOI achieved the high end of our expectations in the fourth quarter of '21 and same-store average occupancy -- in the fourth quarter of '21 versus the fourth quarter of '20 grew by 200 basis points to 83.4%. Rate and revenue grew for the first time since the start of the pandemic as same-store revenue increased 3.3% year-over-year. As we anticipated, operating expenses, excluding HHS grants increased sequentially by $8.7 million or 2.6%, the majority of which was driven by incremental labor expenses. SHOP NOI, excluding HHS grants for the sequential same-store pool declined modestly by just $1 million or 90 basis points and NOI for the year-over-year same-store pool declined $3.8 million or 3.6%. Both are leading results among peers. For the non-same-store pool, underlying performance was stable. In closing, my enthusiasm for the outlook in our senior housing business remains high as we are well positioned to succeed in what we expect to be a favorable macro backdrop. With that, I'll hand the call over to Bob. It's Justin. So if we step back and you look at the kind of macro backdrop that was causing labor shortages, this was happening in the third quarter. We anticipated that, that would continue into the fourth quarter. What happened -- during that period is we had net hiring in our portfolio so that we are encouraged about the hiring trends. And then Omicron happens, and that really had a big impact in the first part of the first quarter. You can see some trends in our business update, where we show the clinical cases among our employees. . And what's encouraging is you can see that those cases are coming down. But we're not all the way out of the woods yet. So the first thing we're going to look for is to have a healthy workforce, the second thing is to continue those net hiring trends. And then as that continues, then we would expect the agency cost to be able to come down. Sure. So you've probably noted that leads are really high. In fact, I mentioned that they're the highest event since the onsite of the pandemic. Leads are going to be critical to supporting this -- the senior housing recovery that's underway. Getting to the kind of your question, it certainly seems possible that the move-ins that didn't move in late January, could flow over into February, and we would definitely qualify that as pent-up demand. As you know, a lot of the move-in activity happens towards the end of the month. So we're looking forward to see how that plays out. Yes. The only thing I'd add is that we -- as planned, we successfully transitioned all of those communities by the first of the year to different operators and everything is going relatively smooth. Yes, sure. So there's -- as Debbie said, that operators that have had elongated challenges. there's just a few and they each represent less than 1% of our overall portfolio. Those those operators will benefit from HHS funds, they'll benefit from operational improvements and the recovery of senior housing just as our SHOP portfolio does as well. So we're anticipating that the triple net would behave similarly through our shop portfolio. We do have some cash flow paying tenants, and that's in a range of around 15% to 20%. And then I would just add that as we're working to identify what the appropriate pricing is moving forward. As I mentioned, Ventas OI, which really stands for operational insights, and really taking the best of our data analytics, combining it with our operating experience and the experience and expertise of our operating partners. We collect vast amounts of geospatial data and demographics wealth penetration rates, new construction to train our demand and supply forecasting models, which have been remarkably accurate as it pertains to decision-making on pricing, acquisitions, dispositions. So we have that approach our disposal and the levers that Debbie mentioned around care, street rates and the anniversary rent increases that will happen throughout the rest of the year. It's Justin. I'm happy to report, as I mentioning all the actions we've taken that -- the heavy lifting is really behind us. There'll always be some noncore assets that we're looking to sell or transition or invest in or do something to create value, but it will be a small number moving forward. Yes. Well, so the -- there's been a lot of actions over the last couple of years. Certainly, some priorities were accelerated based on the fact that we were going through the pandemic. And the goal of all of the actions, whether we're acquiring or disposing or making a decision to invest CapEx, transitioning assets under new management is to create value and create just a greater opportunity to drive NOI over time. So I think really, time is going to tell. We're off to a good start. We're pleased with that we set expectations in the fourth quarter, and we're able to meet those expectations, and we are excited about the growth in the first quarter off to a good start. Yes. And I'd just say consistent with some of my other comments, the goal is to create value. CapEx is a tool at disposal and with the use of our analytics and operational expertise and combined with the operating partners, local market experience, we can make smart choices and anticipate returns on that investment. Sure. Yes. So the re-leasing spread, Bob mentioned this, that we saw it tighten through the end of '21, even all the way back to pre-pandemic levels, which were like negative mid-single digits. That -- the high-class problem is that we have the large increases that happen in January, and then you start comparing to relatively higher rents. And so technically, the releasing spread widens, but it doesn't mean that your pricing power doesn't continue to improve. And one thing that we do look forward to that this backdrop seems to support is the opportunity given the demand at the doorstep, to eventually get to a place where you have positive re-leasing spreads again, which we've had in other parts -- other -- throughout the sector's history, we've seen that at times. And certainly, there seems to be support moving forward for that to happen again. Well, certainly, independent living is a high-margin business, has relatively low labor costs compared to assisted living. It it's a little less need driven. So you may not see the occupancy pop, but we expect a higher ceiling in occupancy and independent living over time because there's less fly that faces it. And that's consistent with historical track record of independent living as well. So we look forward to revenue growth in the independent living communities and certainly assisted living is need-driven. It performs well. It seems like no matter what the backdrop is as long as there's a way to pay for the service, which given the housing values and wealth demographics there is. And so we expect that to continue as well. And the opportunity really is to price in labor costs over time. And we're -- as we've said, we're off to a good start given our high in-house brand increases."

And we're seeing a few medical office buildings, mainly with our existing partners that we have in our portfolio. But by and large, it's senior housing, we're seeing some really good high-quality portfolios out there that are -- we expect to transact in 2022.

Please refer to our supplemental posted on the Investor Relations Section of our website.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Thanks, Sarah, and good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants. And welcome to the Ventas Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. I'm so happy to be hosting this call in person with my trusted colleagues for the first time since early 2020. Ventas delivered positive results in the third quarter, saw outstanding sequential SHOP average occupancy growth, benefited from its large medical office, life science, and healthcare triple-net businesses, and executed on its investment priorities, delivering $0.73 of normalized FFO per share which is in the upper half of our guidance range. Our same-store shop portfolio increased rate and grew occupancy at record levels in Q3. Despite the high incidence of COVID-19 in the broader environment.  Occupancy in this portfolio has now increased for 8 consecutive months through October. Demonstrating powerful demand, our U.S. same-store shop portfolio has increased occupancy, 750 basis points since mid-March 2021, lifting the entire same-store shop portfolio, nearly 600 basis points during the same period. I'm also encouraged that our year-over-year shop occupancy turned positive for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. So a robust senior housing recovery is well underway. But as we stated, it may not progress in a straight line. Consistent with macro trends and as we anticipated in our last call with you, the pandemic has created a tight labor market, resulting in labor cost pressures that accelerated in September. Looking ahead, we expect to see meaningful revenue increases in the first quarter of 2022 and improving pricing power.  At a macro level, many economists forecast that labor force participation will expand from its current low rate for a variety of reasons. These factors should cause current conditions to ease considerably over time. Even more importantly, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who has been consistently the most accurate expert throughout the pandemic, stated today that the COVID-19 pandemic is effectively behind us in the U.S. given all the tools we now have to combat it, including Pfizer's new treatment. If Scott continues to be right, it is a momentous day for all of us. We continue to be delighted that 1/3 of our business consists of medical office, outpatient, and life science research and innovation. Our operational initiatives in medical office and aggressive capital deployment in life science are providing reliable growth and value creation for our enterprise and stakeholders. Turning to Capital allocation, we have been highly active with $3.7 billion of investments announced or closed year-to-date.  Our current Capital allocation focus remains Senior Living, selective private medical office building opportunities, and Life Science R&I. Let me highlight a few new investments we've made. We've completed $2.5 billion in independent living investments, including our accretive acquisition of New Senior's, 100-plus independent living communities at an attractive valuation, well below replacement cost. And a 6-community Canadian senior living portfolio with one of the new senior Operators, Hawthorne. In medical office, we've completed or announced $300 million of investments. First, establishing a new relationship with industry leader eating recovery center, we acquired a class A asset under a long-term lease in this rapidly growing sector. Second, by acquiring our partner PMBs interest in the center Ventas, trophy MOB in downtown San Francisco.  We now own a 100% of this asset at a 6% yield. With 92% of the MOB already leased, we intend to capture additional NOI growth and value. Finally, we intend to expand our relationship with Arden Healthcare by acquiring 18 of their 100% leased medical office buildings for $200 million by year-end. On our third capital allocation priority, we are delighted to announce that we have commenced development of a 1 million square foot life science project anchored by Premier Research University, UC Davis, with our exclusive partner, Wexford. Purpose-built for clinical research, this project will be 60% pre -leased to UC Davis, and total project costs are expected to be $0.5 billion. Turning to our robust investment pipeline, our team remains busy evaluating attractive opportunities. In fact, we've now reviewed more deal volume this year than we saw in all of 2019, over $40 billion and we continue to pursue those that meet our multi-factor investment framework.  Capital continues to flow into our sectors as global institutional investors agree with our thesis on the favorable trends benefiting all of our asset classes. These strong capital flows are also supporting our intention to recycle $1 billion of capital this year to enhance both our Balance Sheet and our portfolio. Our diversified business model continues to provide significant benefits. Our early and aggressive investments into medical office and life science are creating significant value. We are also proud to be associated with so many leading care providers, operators, and developers in all our business lines, and to be establishing new platforms for growth, through both our investment and our portfolio actions.  In closing, the U.S. is in the midst of an impressive economic recovery that together with demographic demand for our asset classes gives us confidence and optimism in our future. We believe that the more widespread administration of vaccines and new efficacious treatments for COVID-19 will benefit both the broader economic recovery, and our Company. Our aligned and experienced team continues to be focused on capturing the double upside in Senior Housing from both pandemic recovery and the projected growth in the senior population and also to continuing our long track record of external growth. Justin?\nJustin Hutchens: Thank you, Debbie. I'll start by saying it is very exciting to see the strong supply demand fundamentals supporting occupancy growth in the Senior Housing sector. We have been busy taking actions through acquisitions, dispositions, and transitions to ensure we are strongly positioned during this period of sector recovery. Our industry-leading operators are successfully driving revenue growth in the early stages of the recovery and taking actions to address elevated labor costs driven by the macro backdrop. Moving onto third quarter performance. In SHOP, leading indicators continue to trend favorably during the quarter as leads and move-ins each surpassed a 100% of 2019 levels, while move-outs remains steady. Strong sales activity has now driven eight consecutive months of occupancy growth inclusive of October. In the third quarter, average occupancy grew by 230 basis points over the second quarter, led by the U.S. with growth of 290 basis points and a 110 basis points in Canada, which is over 93% occupied.  October leading indicators remain solid as leads and move-ins continue to perform above pre -pandemic levels, and move-outs remained relatively stable. Turning to SHOP operating results. Same-store revenue in the third quarter increased sequentially by $13.6 million or 3.1% driven by strong occupancy growth and slight rate growth. Regarding rate growth, our operators have proposed rent increases to the residents of 8% in the U.S. and 4% in Canada, which on a blended basis is approximately 200 basis points higher than the historical levels. We also continued to see improvement in our releasing spreads, which are trending close to pre -pandemic levels. Operating expenses increased sequentially by $16.7 million or 5.4% of which approximately half is due to overtime and agency costs.  Although we largely anticipated the additional labor costs, September spiked and represented approximately half of the sequential agency expense increase. We carried the elevated September costs forward in our Q4 guidance, which Bob will cover shortly. Despite the higher agency and overtime costs, our operators our now witnessing net positive hiring, and are actively addressing labor challenges through a number of initiatives. These include centralized recruitment of line staff, implementation of applicant tracking systems, delivering on the increased demand by employees for flexible schedules, and other workplace improvements to become more competitive. For the sequential same-store pool, SHOP generated a 106.7 million of NOI in the third quarter, which represents a sequential decrease of 3.7 million or 3.4%. Moving on to portfolio actions. Our new senior acquisition closed on September 21st. The portfolio consists of a 103 independent living communities located in attractive markets with favorable demand characteristics. Integration efforts have gone extremely smoothly and we are on track to realize our expected synergies. We are pleased with the performance and operating trends of the portfolio. It's third quarter spot occupancy grew a 110 basis points sequentially. The same-store pool, which excludes the 33 communities that transitioned to new operators this year, grew 180 basis points in the third quarter and then another 10 basis points in October, marking occupancy growth in 6 out of the past 7 months.  We have also recently closed on an acquisition in Canada, which includes 5 independent living and 1assisted living communities. These acquisitions expand our independent living exposure to 59% of NOI on a stabilized basis. We believe the structural benefits of the independent living model present attractive opportunities to further strengthen our Senior Housing NOI margin through less intensive staffing requirements, longer resident length of stays, and accessible price points. All underpinned by exposure to a large and growing middle market. This is in combination with our existing portfolio positions as well to capture demographic demand with the 80 plus population expected to grow over 17% over the next five years, while facing less new supply, versus historical levels. I'd also like to note our previously announced transition of 90 assisted living in memory care communities, is off to a solid start. As 65 communities have already transitioned, and the rest are planned by year-end. We believe the enhanced oversight provided by the experienced mid-market, midsize assisted living operators will improve the execution of local market strategy, and with increased accountability.  I have longstanding relationships and familiarity with the incoming CEO's, and I can say they are really fired up about the new portfolios. They're actively engaged with personal site visits to the communities and transition planning. Ventas has 37 operator relationships, including 7 of the top 10 largest operators in the sector, and 8 new relationships added this year. We look forward to the opportunity to grow our relationships with these companies over time. In summary, the Senior Housing sector is benefiting from a strong macro supply demand backdrop. We are actively positioning ourselves for success through portfolio actions and our operators are driving revenue and managing the elevated labor situation. We look forward to forging ahead during a very exciting time of sector recovery. Bob.\nRobert Probst: Thanks, Justin. I'll close out our prepared remarks by quickly touching on our third-quarter office and enterprise results, discussing our recent Balance sheet and Capital activities, and laying out our fourth quarter expectations. Our life science and MOB businesses led by Pete Bulgarelli, in which we represent nearly 1/3 of our Company's NOI once again, delivered robust and reliable growth in the third quarter. These businesses taken together increased same-store NOI by 4.2% year-over-year and increased 1.2% sequentially on an adjusted basis. MOB NOI grew 3.2% year-over-year and R&I increased 7.1%. Some stats of interest that underpin this strong performance. MOB occupancy is up 130 basis points year-to-date, same-store MOB occupancy of 91.3% is at its highest point since the first quarter of 2018.  MOB tenant retention was 91% in the third quarter, and MOB new leasing increased 43% versus prior year. R&I occupancy remains outstanding at 94.4% and improved 50 basis points sequentially due to exciting demand for lab space. MLP expenses increased less than 1% year-on-year as a result of completed energy conservation projects in sourcing initiatives. And for the second year in a row, we ranked in the top quartile of our peer group for tenant satisfaction as measured by Kingsley Associates. 2021 rankings for each major key performance indicator increased when compared to 2020. At the enterprise level, we delivered $0.73 of FFO per share in the third quarter.  This result is at the higher end of our $0.70 to $0.74 guidance range, and benefited from the stable performance of our diversified portfolio, as well as the $0.04 ardent bond prepayment fee that was included in our guidance. We're also very active in the third quarter, managing our balance sheet and capital structure. Consistent with our prior $1 billion disposition guidance, We now have 875 million of disposition proceeds in the bank with a 170 million of Senior Housing and MOB portfolios under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter. These dispositions have enhanced and reshaped our portfolio. and we've used these proceeds to reduce $1.1 billion of near-term debt so far this year.  We also issued $1.4 billion of equity in the third quarter, including $800 million for New Senior and $600 million in ATM issuance at $58 a share. As a result, our net debt to EBITDA ratio excluding New Senior improves sequentially to 6.9 times, while including New Senior Q3 leverage was better than forecast at 7.2 times. As an administrative side note, we plan to enter into a new ATM program, replacing our 2018 program which is nearly complete. Turning to Q4 guidance. We expect Fourth Quarter net income will range from a penny to $0.05 per fully diluted share. Q4 normalized FFO is expected to range from $0.67 to $0.71 per share. The Q4 FFO mid-point of $0.69 can be bridged from Q3 of $0.73 by $0.01 net impact of tenant fees.  The impact of capital recycling for debt reduction, and pre -funding of new investments is $0.02, and various items round up to explain the last penny. Our SHOP portfolio NOI is estimated to be flat sequentially. Key fourth quarter assumptions underlying our guidance are as follows: starting with our shop same-store expectations; SHOP Q4 average occupancy is forecast to increase between 80 and 120 basis points versus the Q3 average. Growing ahead of pre -pandemic levels, while following seasonal trends. At the guidance midpoint, Spot occupancy, September 30 to December 31, is expected to be approximately flat. The resulting sequential SHOP revenue growth is expected to be offset by increased operating expenses due to continued elevated labor costs.  No HHS grants are assumed to be received in the fourth quarter, though our licensed assisted living communities have applied for qualified grants under Phase 4 of the provider relief fund for COVID losses incurred at the communities. Outside of SHOP, continued stable performance is expected in the office in triple-net segments, we expect to receive an M&A fee in Q4 of $0.03 for the announced Kindred sale, which Kindred communicated is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter subject to customary closing conditions. We continue to expect a billion asset sales and loan repayments for the full-year 2021 at a blended yield in the high 5s. And our fully diluted share count is now 403 million shares, reflecting the equity raised to date. I'd like to underscore that we're still in a highly uncertain environment. And the pandemic's impact on our business remains very difficult to predict.  To close, my colleagues and I are excited for the future of Ventas given the expected robust recovery in senior housing, and the external growth opportunities, both under our belt and that lie ahead. That concludes our prepared remarks. With that, I will turn the call back to the Operator.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Michael Carroll, RBC Capital Markets.\nMichael Carroll : Yes. Thanks. Debbie, I want to talk a little bit about the investment markets. I guess with the Delta wave and the labor pressures have you seen an uptick in the number of investment opportunities, particularly in Senior Housing? I mean, should we continue to see that activity from year-end persist over the next several months in quarters?\nDebra A. Cafaro : Good morning, Mike. I mean, as I mentioned, we have just seen a tremendous volume across the board all year long, more than we've ever seen. And we do expect that to continue.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nicholas Joseph of Citi.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. I appreciate all the comments on expenses, and rate and occupancy, but just as you step back and think about kind of margin, once we get through some of these transitory issues, how do you think margin long-term for Senior Housing will compare versus pre -COVID levels?\nDebra A. Cafaro: Thank you, Justin.\nJustin Hutchens : Sure. Hi, Nick. So just stepping back and thinking about the ultimate drivers of margin, you've probably heard us describe a train before. The front of the train really is leads, leads come first, that drives move-ins, net movement activity drives occupancy, pricing certainly supports revenue growth as well. And then there's expense management. And over time, we certainly expect that there will be margin expansion for 2 reasons. 1 is; that the supply demand characteristics that we're facing do support occupancy growth and should present opportunity for pricing power. Clearly in the near-term, there's expense pressure due to labor that we mentioned, but the macro backdrop does seem to be improving. And as I mentioned, our Operators are taking significant actions to address the issue.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson of SMBC.\nRich Anderson: Hey, good morning. I have a question about vaccine mandates, and at the property level, and how that's being managed. And I'm curious -- I don't know if I remember what that number is for Ventas, and if you could share that, I'm sure at some place I'm just not remembering it right now. But who makes the call on that? I assume in a SHOP 's execution that Ventas has at least a say in that, maybe I'm wrong. And I'm just curious what your thesis is or your ideas around vaccine mandates at the property level now and perhaps taking into account the Pfizer news and what you're thinking about it going forward. Thanks.\nDebra A. Cafaro : Hi, Rich. I'll start and then turn it to Justin. Our operators have, by in large, been early adopters of vaccine mandates within the communities to keep the residents safe and we're at very high levels now, nearly 100% of both resident and staff. We've been way ahead of the federal requirements for vaccines because we are carrying for vulnerable seniors and also had access early on from the vaccine rollout, both employees and residents. And so that has been both a moral and a business imperative. It's worked really well. Our operators have lead on it and they have made the decision, but with our financial support and encouragement.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico, of Scotiabank.\nNick Yulico: Thanks. Good morning. So I was hoping you could -- I don't think you break out labor expenses and the change there. If you could just give us a feel for how much they did increase quarter-over-quarter, and year-over-year, and just how we should think about the trend of labor expenses next year, because I know there's some optimism that you think that it's going to get a little bit better, but I'm still just not entirely clear why use of contract labor and other items would go down in this type of job market?\nDebra A. Cafaro : Bob's going to address the quantitative parts of your question. I think from a high level, again, the timing is unknown, the extent is unknown, but there are multiple factors at a macro level that will support increased labor and workforce participation. And those include children back in school, children vaccinated, the exploration of public policy such as the federal stipend on unemployment, and also just people's savings running out as a result of that. And the schools being open and the like. And so all of those factors really play into the macro thinking around easing of current labor conditions. I think -- again, if you just step back, what's great about this recovery is that demand has sprung back, not just in our business, but broadly speaking, it has surged. And the supply chain and the labor force are still adapting and adjusting and haven't caught up yet. And over time, those things will get more in balance. And that's what the economists forecast, and that's why those are the factors that you would expect to improve the workforce participation. So Bob, do you want to talk about the specifics?\nRobert Probst: Sure. And the next, page 12 of the business update that we issued this morning, could be helpful. Because it lays out the operating expense increase, we saw sequentially between the second and third quarter, which is roughly $17 million. And within that labor representing, call it, half of that increase. And if you further double-clicked on the labor piece, call it 2/3 of that would be contract labor. I reinforced the fact in our guidance for the fourth, we saw this acceleration in contract labor in September. We effectively assume that to continue through the fourth quarter in light of the backdrop. Important to note that contract labor is at least 2 times as expensive as in-house labor, and so these initiatives adjust and laid out to increase staffing, reduce that contract labor would have a positive mix benefit. But quantitatively that hopefully helps you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley.\nRichard Hill: Hey, good morning guys. And thanks for having me on the call. It's good to be a first-time caller, long-term listener. I did want to talk through and maybe hear a little bit more about your operator contracts. One of your peers have talked about maybe half of them renewing in 1Q, and the other half rateably throughout the year. I'm wondering if you see something similar and maybe you can unpack that for us\nDebra A. Cafaro : Good and welcome. Yes, this is addressed also in our business update. Justin, do you want to take that?\nJustin Hutchens : Sure, yeah. If you look at page 14 in the business update, you'll see this. And first of all the headline is that our Operators are proposed to our residents an 8% increase in rent in the U.S. and 4% in Canada. If you look to the left, you'll see how this breaks down. And that is at 55% of our residents are eligible for an increases in the first quarter, 35% get an anniversary rent increase, and so those will happen throughout the rest of the year, and then those that moved in the late, in '21, obviously, wouldn't be eligible for an increase yet. So there's a huge opportunity to grow revenue. This is a consistent process, it's tried and true. It's just that we're going to pass along more rent increases this year, and I will just add that our operators are very careful about taking local market considerations into their planning so that they're in line with market and they can successfully execute. And then there's also level of care which is really acuity driven, and that can increase throughout the year as well, both in terms of how much we charge, but also the acuity level of the resident would drive additional charges and that's just standard as part of the revenue package that operators offer.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Derik Johnston, with Deutsche Bank.\nDerik Johnston: Hi everyone. Good morning. Can we go into some detail on the SHOP transitions to the more experienced local operators in various markets, but really specifically, how that may have impacted these transitions, the 4Q guide. But at the same time, how the transitions could benefit first Q in 2022. Thanks.\nDebra A. Cafaro : Thank you. Yes. I'm going to turn that to Bob and Justin to talk about the transitions, which as Justin said, are well underway.\nJustin Hutchens : Okay. Thank you. And I'll start with really just some of the rationale for why we did it and why we think this is going to be helpful to performance. And you'll notice on Page 13 on the right-hand side that we highlight this. We selected operators that have experience. They have experience within these markets and they have experience running regional markets. And one thing I've been very encouraged about is that the CEOs of these companies have been actively engaged in the transitions. We have a co-operative transition with the former manager, so we've actually been able to get on the ground, into the communities, start assessing, getting to know people, and be ready to try to get off to a strong start when the transition begins. And you have the advantage, when you have a mid-sized Company with a regional presence is that you have senior management that is very close to the community.  So we do expect the oversight to be very strong, and then these companies are excited to grow. And there's just an energy to it that's really positive and it's well assessed, and we look forward to positive results. Having said that, we would expect to have some transition noise in the early going that was factored into the fourth quarter. And I'll hand over to Bob.\nRobert Probst: Yeah, that's really again back to the labor theme frankly. This normal noise is a function of turnover at the communities, new staff, etc. So that's the context obviously, then with this tight labor market, we've assumed increases in the labor costs in the fourth for this portfolio. So that's embedded in the guidance for overall shopping plan.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria of BMO Capital Markets.\nJuan Sanabria: Hi, good morning. Just a question for Justin on asset management. You seem to be making a transition to more smaller regional operators, which makes sense. But just curious on a couple fronts on the data analytics front, what you guys are doing and maybe some hires you've made there in the efforts that are being put forth? And then secondly, just as we look forward, should we expect more dispositions heading into '22, given some of the stuff that was on the market didn't transact, and you haven't necessarily sold a ton of assets, and the leverage is still a bit high. So just curious on go-forward dispositions, thinking about '22 and any clean up that thing you guys want to do for the portfolio as we exit COVID.\nJustin Hutchens : Hi Juan. I'll start and then I'll -- Bob will jump in as well. And we start with the data analytics. We have made new hires. We've become much deeper and was already a strength in terms of market analytics. We certainly study supply and demand in great detail and have really good familiar with local markets. And which has helped to inform some of the decisions we've made, but also it help to inform growth decisions we make moving forward. Great team. We've also enhanced our operational analysis through hiring people that have experienced in operating companies and have high analytical strategic experience as well. So that's given us insights into the business that are extremely valuable and inform our decisions but also help to inform the decisions that the operators make in their planning as well.\nRobert Probst: And I'll take the disposition question, Juan. The short answer is no. We don't as we think about '22 expect significant dispositions in Senior Housing, we do have a 170 million yet to go under contract this year. And a good chunk of that is Senior Housing. But beyond that, no significant plans.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette of Barclays.\nEric Glenn: Hi, this is Eric Glenn on for Steve. I guess, as the labor pressure eventually starts to subside, how do you think this affects long-term productivity? I know one of your peers had mentioned, that it would take several quarters to reach the same level of historical productivity, Due to the time that it takes to re-amp new staff up to speed, and deal with onboarding. I was just curious if this is affecting you at all or is the actual staff turnover not really high enough to have an impact here? Thanks.\nDebra A. Cafaro : I would just say simply that, that is a part of the labor pressure in the timing of when we would expect conditions to ease. Certainly, the industry is experienced that on-boarding new workers and that's -- it's an industry where there is consistent shifting of on-site workers, and so that is the strength of the industry. But it will take some time for these conditions to abate, again, for a variety of factors, including getting up the speed and training. So that is correct. It's just a multi-factor analysis.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler, KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nJordan Sadler : Hi, there. I just wanted to circle back on the ESL transition assets and maybe I think in the press release last month, you talked about no contribution of NOI in the second quarter. I'm curious what the progression was sequentially? I know we haven't same-store numbers, but I'm curious what the ESL portfolio did sequentially? And then I'm curious what the outlook would be because I would think that an operators transitions historically have caused some disruption. So it's was what sort of the outlook would be in terms of looking at the curve of a recovery in the cash flow to go for that portfolio when we should expect that to start to, at least bottom and then start to recover. Thank you.\nRobert Probst: Yeah, Jordan. I'll take that. I wish I could draw this picture in front of you. Because I do think you'll see some -- as we saw our second quarter into third quarter, some erosion in NOI in this portfolio. And as I mentioned, we're expecting that to continue into the fourth, given the labor cost pressures, and just the normal noise associated with the transitions. The strategy which Justin was speaking to though, is once these are in the hands of these, these new operators, they will employ their skill to really drive that performance of that portfolio in 2022 and beyond. So that's the goal. And we're right in the middle of that right now.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.\nMike Mueller: Hi. I'm wondering, how much of the higher labor expense pace do you think is attributable to recent rate pressures for existing staff that maybe be a little bit more sticky versus the idea of just having to utilize more higher-cost contract labor?\nDebra A. Cafaro : Yeah. Good question. Justin, do you want to comment on that?\nJustin Hutchens : Sure. It's really more around just the availability of staff. The availability to staff fully with your existing people. One thing, there's a series of steps that operators take. The first thing they do is they try to make sure that they're utilizing all the full-time hours available for their existing staff. Most operators don't schedule the 40-hour week, since there's always room to expand a little bit, so they'll do that first. Next step is they'll use over time, obviously of your continuity of your existing staff to deliver care and services, and then the last resort is really to add agency. And one interesting tidbit around this is that there's not really a certain MSA where we are seeing agency use. It's clearly a macro backdrop issue. But within MSAs, there's certain communities that really have an out-sized amount of agency that's being utilized, which points to the opportunity for an operational solution. So we have plenty of evidence that this can be managed, and as I said in prepared remarks, we're already starting to see hiring, picking up across the operators.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Dennerlein of Bank of America.\nDebra A. Cafaro : Josh.\nOperator: Josh, your line is open.\nJoshua Dennerlein : Sorry guys. I was on mute there. I was looking at the rep for growth for the same-store pool, just kind of curious if you have any kind of expectations as we go forward when it might turn to positive growth on a year-over-year basis?\nDebra A. Cafaro : I mean, it's -- the trends have been encouraging and Justin, do you want to comment specifically?\nJustin Hutchens : Sure. Yes. There's a few moving parts in RevPOR; 1 is mix, which is really just the contribution of RevPOR from certain product types. And we are benefiting this year. I've mentioned this before that we would benefit from the U.S. recovery because we'll see our higher price point product, particularly in Sunrise for instance, that's a driver of RevPOR overall. So we're getting some mix shift benefit. Probably more importantly, though, is we are getting the benefit of better re-leasing spreads. And that's been consistent. We saw the underlying trends in the second quarter, we saw it through the third quarter. And when we get into next year, obviously we have the in-house rent increases that we mentioned, but the pricing power should continue to improve because what starts to happen is you're covering movements that occurred in 2020. They came in at a relatively low rate and as the momentum picks up in the sector, our operators are able to charge more. And so we're looking forward to a period of really improved pricing in RevPAR moving ahead.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll, RBC Capital Markets.\nMichael Carroll : Yeah. And I know that existing Senior's Housing residents generally don't like to move away from the communities that they are in. There has been a small percentage that didn't like to do that pre [Indiscernible]. Has that trend come back post - COVID, or residents still hesitate to move in because of the pandemic, or move out, sorry?\nDebra A. Cafaro : Could you repeat that Mike? And welcome back. You got a short question the first time, so can you repeat that last part?\nOperator: Michael, please press star one again. Please proceed. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Carroll : Yes. I know residents generally don't like to move out from their facilities on the seniors housing residence, but there was a small percentage pre -COVID that was willing to do that. Has that trend come back at all or are residents still hesitant to move out because of the pandemic?\nJustin Hutchens : Hi, it's Justin. So there was actually -- since we've been in this period of recovery, there was one month, I want to say it was April, we did see a little bit more move-out activity, and we did really correlate that to people being able to make a move where they weren't moving during the pandemic, and they had an opportunity to move around in the month of April, but you also know there was that move in activity was picking up and so I think there was -- you're just trading seats with other operators, and so there was a lot of movement then. But since then it's been very stable, very consistent in terms of move-out activity.\nDebra A. Cafaro : Operator, did you have [Indiscernible] questions?\nOperator: At this time, there are no further questions. Do you have any closing remarks?\nDebra A. Cafaro : I do. As I said, we have a lot of optimism and confidence. It just happens to be a momentous day with the advent of additional COVID treatments and a real line-of-sight to this pandemic possibly being over. Our business is doing really well. It is diversified and benefiting from the internal and external growth. Avenues that we have. We have a great set of partners and a great team here at Ventas. We're very appreciative as always of your interest and your support in our Company. And we look forward to seeing you soon Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Justin. I'll close out our prepared remarks by quickly touching on our third-quarter office and enterprise results, discussing our recent Balance sheet and Capital activities, and laying out our fourth quarter expectations. Our life science and MOB businesses led by Pete Bulgarelli, in which we represent nearly 1/3 of our Company's NOI once again, delivered robust and reliable growth in the third quarter. These businesses taken together increased same-store NOI by 4.2% year-over-year and increased 1.2% sequentially on an adjusted basis. MOB NOI grew 3.2% year-over-year and R&I increased 7.1%. Some stats of interest that underpin this strong performance. MOB occupancy is up 130 basis points year-to-date, same-store MOB occupancy of 91.3% is at its highest point since the first quarter of 2018.  MOB tenant retention was 91% in the third quarter, and MOB new leasing increased 43% versus prior year. R&I occupancy remains outstanding at 94.4% and improved 50 basis points sequentially due to exciting demand for lab space. MLP expenses increased less than 1% year-on-year as a result of completed energy conservation projects in sourcing initiatives. And for the second year in a row, we ranked in the top quartile of our peer group for tenant satisfaction as measured by Kingsley Associates. 2021 rankings for each major key performance indicator increased when compared to 2020. At the enterprise level, we delivered $0.73 of FFO per share in the third quarter.  This result is at the higher end of our $0.70 to $0.74 guidance range, and benefited from the stable performance of our diversified portfolio, as well as the $0.04 ardent bond prepayment fee that was included in our guidance.

We expect Fourth Quarter net income will range from a penny to $0.05 per fully diluted share. Q4 normalized FFO is expected to range from $0.67 to $0.71 per share.

That concludes our prepared remarks. With that, I will turn the call back to the Operator. Sure. And the next, page 12 of the business update that we issued this morning, could be helpful. Because it lays out the operating expense increase, we saw sequentially between the second and third quarter, which is roughly $17 million. And within that labor representing, call it, half of that increase. And if you further double-clicked on the labor piece, call it 2/3 of that would be contract labor. I reinforced the fact in our guidance for the fourth, we saw this acceleration in contract labor in September. We effectively assume that to continue through the fourth quarter in light of the backdrop. Important to note that contract labor is at least 2 times as expensive as in-house labor, and so these initiatives adjust and laid out to increase staffing, reduce that contract labor would have a positive mix benefit. But quantitatively that hopefully helps you. Yeah, that's really again back to the labor theme frankly. This normal noise is a function of turnover at the communities, new staff, etc. So that's the context obviously, then with this tight labor market, we've assumed increases in the labor costs in the fourth for this portfolio. So that's embedded in the guidance for overall shopping plan. And I'll take the disposition question, Juan. The short answer is no. We don't as we think about '22 expect significant dispositions in Senior Housing, we do have a 170 million yet to go under contract this year. And a good chunk of that is Senior Housing. But beyond that, no significant plans. Yeah, Jordan. I'll take that. I wish I could draw this picture in front of you. Because I do think you'll see some -- as we saw our second quarter into third quarter, some erosion in NOI in this portfolio. And as I mentioned, we're expecting that to continue into the fourth, given the labor cost pressures, and just the normal noise associated with the transitions.

            "name": "Justin Hutchens",
            "content": "Thank you, Debbie. I'll start by saying it is very exciting to see the strong supply demand fundamentals supporting occupancy growth in the Senior Housing sector. We have been busy taking actions through acquisitions, dispositions, and transitions to ensure we are strongly positioned during this period of sector recovery. Our industry-leading operators are successfully driving revenue growth in the early stages of the recovery and taking actions to address elevated labor costs driven by the macro backdrop. Moving onto third quarter performance. In SHOP, leading indicators continue to trend favorably during the quarter as leads and move-ins each surpassed a 100% of 2019 levels, while move-outs remains steady. Strong sales activity has now driven eight consecutive months of occupancy growth inclusive of October. In the third quarter, average occupancy grew by 230 basis points over the second quarter, led by the U.S. with growth of 290 basis points and a 110 basis points in Canada, which is over 93% occupied.  October leading indicators remain solid as leads and move-ins continue to perform above pre -pandemic levels, and move-outs remained relatively stable. Turning to SHOP operating results. Same-store revenue in the third quarter increased sequentially by $13.6 million or 3.1% driven by strong occupancy growth and slight rate growth. Regarding rate growth, our operators have proposed rent increases to the residents of 8% in the U.S. and 4% in Canada, which on a blended basis is approximately 200 basis points higher than the historical levels. We also continued to see improvement in our releasing spreads, which are trending close to pre -pandemic levels. Operating expenses increased sequentially by $16.7 million or 5.4% of which approximately half is due to overtime and agency costs.  Although we largely anticipated the additional labor costs, September spiked and represented approximately half of the sequential agency expense increase. We carried the elevated September costs forward in our Q4 guidance, which Bob will cover shortly. Despite the higher agency and overtime costs, our operators our now witnessing net positive hiring, and are actively addressing labor challenges through a number of initiatives. These include centralized recruitment of line staff, implementation of applicant tracking systems, delivering on the increased demand by employees for flexible schedules, and other workplace improvements to become more competitive. For the sequential same-store pool, SHOP generated a 106.7 million of NOI in the third quarter, which represents a sequential decrease of 3.7 million or 3.4%. Moving on to portfolio actions. Our new senior acquisition closed on September 21st. The portfolio consists of a 103 independent living communities located in attractive markets with favorable demand characteristics. Integration efforts have gone extremely smoothly and we are on track to realize our expected synergies. We are pleased with the performance and operating trends of the portfolio. It's third quarter spot occupancy grew a 110 basis points sequentially. The same-store pool, which excludes the 33 communities that transitioned to new operators this year, grew 180 basis points in the third quarter and then another 10 basis points in October, marking occupancy growth in 6 out of the past 7 months.  We have also recently closed on an acquisition in Canada, which includes 5 independent living and 1assisted living communities. These acquisitions expand our independent living exposure to 59% of NOI on a stabilized basis. We believe the structural benefits of the independent living model present attractive opportunities to further strengthen our Senior Housing NOI margin through less intensive staffing requirements, longer resident length of stays, and accessible price points. All underpinned by exposure to a large and growing middle market. This is in combination with our existing portfolio positions as well to capture demographic demand with the 80 plus population expected to grow over 17% over the next five years, while facing less new supply, versus historical levels. I'd also like to note our previously announced transition of 90 assisted living in memory care communities, is off to a solid start. As 65 communities have already transitioned, and the rest are planned by year-end. We believe the enhanced oversight provided by the experienced mid-market, midsize assisted living operators will improve the execution of local market strategy, and with increased accountability.  I have longstanding relationships and familiarity with the incoming CEO's, and I can say they are really fired up about the new portfolios. They're actively engaged with personal site visits to the communities and transition planning. Ventas has 37 operator relationships, including 7 of the top 10 largest operators in the sector, and 8 new relationships added this year. We look forward to the opportunity to grow our relationships with these companies over time. In summary, the Senior Housing sector is benefiting from a strong macro supply demand backdrop. We are actively positioning ourselves for success through portfolio actions and our operators are driving revenue and managing the elevated labor situation. We look forward to forging ahead during a very exciting time of sector recovery. Bob. Sure. Hi, Nick. So just stepping back and thinking about the ultimate drivers of margin, you've probably heard us describe a train before. The front of the train really is leads, leads come first, that drives move-ins, net movement activity drives occupancy, pricing certainly supports revenue growth as well. And then there's expense management. And over time, we certainly expect that there will be margin expansion for 2 reasons. 1 is; that the supply demand characteristics that we're facing do support occupancy growth and should present opportunity for pricing power. Clearly in the near-term, there's expense pressure due to labor that we mentioned, but the macro backdrop does seem to be improving. And as I mentioned, our Operators are taking significant actions to address the issue. Sure, yeah. If you look at page 14 in the business update, you'll see this. And first of all the headline is that our Operators are proposed to our residents an 8% increase in rent in the U.S. and 4% in Canada. If you look to the left, you'll see how this breaks down. And that is at 55% of our residents are eligible for an increases in the first quarter, 35% get an anniversary rent increase, and so those will happen throughout the rest of the year, and then those that moved in the late, in '21, obviously, wouldn't be eligible for an increase yet. So there's a huge opportunity to grow revenue. This is a consistent process, it's tried and true. It's just that we're going to pass along more rent increases this year, and I will just add that our operators are very careful about taking local market considerations into their planning so that they're in line with market and they can successfully execute. And then there's also level of care which is really acuity driven, and that can increase throughout the year as well, both in terms of how much we charge, but also the acuity level of the resident would drive additional charges and that's just standard as part of the revenue package that operators offer. Okay. Thank you. And I'll start with really just some of the rationale for why we did it and why we think this is going to be helpful to performance. And you'll notice on Page 13 on the right-hand side that we highlight this. We selected operators that have experience. They have experience within these markets and they have experience running regional markets. And one thing I've been very encouraged about is that the CEOs of these companies have been actively engaged in the transitions. We have a co-operative transition with the former manager, so we've actually been able to get on the ground, into the communities, start assessing, getting to know people, and be ready to try to get off to a strong start when the transition begins. And you have the advantage, when you have a mid-sized Company with a regional presence is that you have senior management that is very close to the community.  So we do expect the oversight to be very strong, and then these companies are excited to grow. And there's just an energy to it that's really positive and it's well assessed, and we look forward to positive results. Having said that, we would expect to have some transition noise in the early going that was factored into the fourth quarter. And I'll hand over to Bob. Hi Juan. I'll start and then I'll -- Bob will jump in as well. And we start with the data analytics. We have made new hires. We've become much deeper and was already a strength in terms of market analytics. We certainly study supply and demand in great detail and have really good familiar with local markets. And which has helped to inform some of the decisions we've made, but also it help to inform growth decisions we make moving forward. Great team. We've also enhanced our operational analysis through hiring people that have experienced in operating companies and have high analytical strategic experience as well. So that's given us insights into the business that are extremely valuable and inform our decisions but also help to inform the decisions that the operators make in their planning as well. Sure. It's really more around just the availability of staff. The availability to staff fully with your existing people. One thing, there's a series of steps that operators take. The first thing they do is they try to make sure that they're utilizing all the full-time hours available for their existing staff. Most operators don't schedule the 40-hour week, since there's always room to expand a little bit, so they'll do that first. Next step is they'll use over time, obviously of your continuity of your existing staff to deliver care and services, and then the last resort is really to add agency. And one interesting tidbit around this is that there's not really a certain MSA where we are seeing agency use. It's clearly a macro backdrop issue. But within MSAs, there's certain communities that really have an out-sized amount of agency that's being utilized, which points to the opportunity for an operational solution. So we have plenty of evidence that this can be managed, and as I said in prepared remarks, we're already starting to see hiring, picking up across the operators. Sure. Yes. There's a few moving parts in RevPOR; 1 is mix, which is really just the contribution of RevPOR from certain product types. And we are benefiting this year. I've mentioned this before that we would benefit from the U.S. recovery because we'll see our higher price point product, particularly in Sunrise for instance, that's a driver of RevPOR overall. So we're getting some mix shift benefit. Probably more importantly, though, is we are getting the benefit of better re-leasing spreads. And that's been consistent. We saw the underlying trends in the second quarter, we saw it through the third quarter. And when we get into next year, obviously we have the in-house rent increases that we mentioned, but the pricing power should continue to improve because what starts to happen is you're covering movements that occurred in 2020. They came in at a relatively low rate and as the momentum picks up in the sector, our operators are able to charge more. And so we're looking forward to a period of really improved pricing in RevPAR moving ahead. Hi, it's Justin. So there was actually -- since we've been in this period of recovery, there was one month, I want to say it was April, we did see a little bit more move-out activity, and we did really correlate that to people being able to make a move where they weren't moving during the pandemic, and they had an opportunity to move around in the month of April, but you also know there was that move in activity was picking up and so I think there was -- you're just trading seats with other operators, and so there was a lot of movement then. But since then it's been very stable, very consistent in terms of move-out activity."

            "name": "Debra A. Cafaro",
            "content": "Thanks, Sarah, and good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants. And welcome to the Ventas Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. I'm so happy to be hosting this call in person with my trusted colleagues for the first time since early 2020. Ventas delivered positive results in the third quarter, saw outstanding sequential SHOP average occupancy growth, benefited from its large medical office, life science, and healthcare triple-net businesses, and executed on its investment priorities, delivering $0.73 of normalized FFO per share which is in the upper half of our guidance range. Our same-store shop portfolio increased rate and grew occupancy at record levels in Q3. Despite the high incidence of COVID-19 in the broader environment.  Occupancy in this portfolio has now increased for 8 consecutive months through October. Demonstrating powerful demand, our U.S. same-store shop portfolio has increased occupancy, 750 basis points since mid-March 2021, lifting the entire same-store shop portfolio, nearly 600 basis points during the same period. I'm also encouraged that our year-over-year shop occupancy turned positive for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. So a robust senior housing recovery is well underway. But as we stated, it may not progress in a straight line. Consistent with macro trends and as we anticipated in our last call with you, the pandemic has created a tight labor market, resulting in labor cost pressures that accelerated in September. Looking ahead, we expect to see meaningful revenue increases in the first quarter of 2022 and improving pricing power.  At a macro level, many economists forecast that labor force participation will expand from its current low rate for a variety of reasons. These factors should cause current conditions to ease considerably over time. Even more importantly, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who has been consistently the most accurate expert throughout the pandemic, stated today that the COVID-19 pandemic is effectively behind us in the U.S. given all the tools we now have to combat it, including Pfizer's new treatment. If Scott continues to be right, it is a momentous day for all of us. We continue to be delighted that 1/3 of our business consists of medical office, outpatient, and life science research and innovation. Our operational initiatives in medical office and aggressive capital deployment in life science are providing reliable growth and value creation for our enterprise and stakeholders. Turning to Capital allocation, we have been highly active with $3.7 billion of investments announced or closed year-to-date.  Our current Capital allocation focus remains Senior Living, selective private medical office building opportunities, and Life Science R&I. Let me highlight a few new investments we've made. We've completed $2.5 billion in independent living investments, including our accretive acquisition of New Senior's, 100-plus independent living communities at an attractive valuation, well below replacement cost. And a 6-community Canadian senior living portfolio with one of the new senior Operators, Hawthorne. In medical office, we've completed or announced $300 million of investments. First, establishing a new relationship with industry leader eating recovery center, we acquired a class A asset under a long-term lease in this rapidly growing sector. Second, by acquiring our partner PMBs interest in the center Ventas, trophy MOB in downtown San Francisco.  We now own a 100% of this asset at a 6% yield. With 92% of the MOB already leased, we intend to capture additional NOI growth and value. Finally, we intend to expand our relationship with Arden Healthcare by acquiring 18 of their 100% leased medical office buildings for $200 million by year-end. On our third capital allocation priority, we are delighted to announce that we have commenced development of a 1 million square foot life science project anchored by Premier Research University, UC Davis, with our exclusive partner, Wexford. Purpose-built for clinical research, this project will be 60% pre -leased to UC Davis, and total project costs are expected to be $0.5 billion. Turning to our robust investment pipeline, our team remains busy evaluating attractive opportunities. In fact, we've now reviewed more deal volume this year than we saw in all of 2019, over $40 billion and we continue to pursue those that meet our multi-factor investment framework.  Capital continues to flow into our sectors as global institutional investors agree with our thesis on the favorable trends benefiting all of our asset classes. These strong capital flows are also supporting our intention to recycle $1 billion of capital this year to enhance both our Balance Sheet and our portfolio. Our diversified business model continues to provide significant benefits. Our early and aggressive investments into medical office and life science are creating significant value. We are also proud to be associated with so many leading care providers, operators, and developers in all our business lines, and to be establishing new platforms for growth, through both our investment and our portfolio actions.  In closing, the U.S. is in the midst of an impressive economic recovery that together with demographic demand for our asset classes gives us confidence and optimism in our future. We believe that the more widespread administration of vaccines and new efficacious treatments for COVID-19 will benefit both the broader economic recovery, and our Company. Our aligned and experienced team continues to be focused on capturing the double upside in Senior Housing from both pandemic recovery and the projected growth in the senior population and also to continuing our long track record of external growth. Justin? Good morning, Mike. I mean, as I mentioned, we have just seen a tremendous volume across the board all year long, more than we've ever seen. And we do expect that to continue. Thank you, Justin. Hi, Rich. I'll start and then turn it to Justin. Our operators have, by in large, been early adopters of vaccine mandates within the communities to keep the residents safe and we're at very high levels now, nearly 100% of both resident and staff. We've been way ahead of the federal requirements for vaccines because we are carrying for vulnerable seniors and also had access early on from the vaccine rollout, both employees and residents. And so that has been both a moral and a business imperative. It's worked really well. Our operators have lead on it and they have made the decision, but with our financial support and encouragement. Bob's going to address the quantitative parts of your question. I think from a high level, again, the timing is unknown, the extent is unknown, but there are multiple factors at a macro level that will support increased labor and workforce participation. And those include children back in school, children vaccinated, the exploration of public policy such as the federal stipend on unemployment, and also just people's savings running out as a result of that. And the schools being open and the like. And so all of those factors really play into the macro thinking around easing of current labor conditions. I think -- again, if you just step back, what's great about this recovery is that demand has sprung back, not just in our business, but broadly speaking, it has surged. And the supply chain and the labor force are still adapting and adjusting and haven't caught up yet. And over time, those things will get more in balance. And that's what the economists forecast, and that's why those are the factors that you would expect to improve the workforce participation. So Bob, do you want to talk about the specifics? Good and welcome. Yes, this is addressed also in our business update. Justin, do you want to take that? Thank you. Yes. I'm going to turn that to Bob and Justin to talk about the transitions, which as Justin said, are well underway. I would just say simply that, that is a part of the labor pressure in the timing of when we would expect conditions to ease. Certainly, the industry is experienced that on-boarding new workers and that's -- it's an industry where there is consistent shifting of on-site workers, and so that is the strength of the industry. But it will take some time for these conditions to abate, again, for a variety of factors, including getting up the speed and training. So that is correct. It's just a multi-factor analysis. Yeah. Good question. Justin, do you want to comment on that? Josh. I mean, it's -- the trends have been encouraging and Justin, do you want to comment specifically? Could you repeat that Mike? And welcome back. You got a short question the first time, so can you repeat that last part? Operator, did you have [Indiscernible] questions? I do. As I said, we have a lot of optimism and confidence. It just happens to be a momentous day with the advent of additional COVID treatments and a real line-of-sight to this pandemic possibly being over. Our business is doing really well. It is diversified and benefiting from the internal and external growth. Avenues that we have. We have a great set of partners and a great team here at Ventas. We're very appreciative as always of your interest and your support in our Company. And we look forward to seeing you soon Thank you."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Sarah Whitford, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nSarah Whitford: Thanks Tammy. Good morning and welcome to the Ventas second quarter financial results conference call.

I will now turn the call over to Debra A. Cafaro, Ventas Chairman and CEO.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Sarah, well done. Your first public company merger. Congratulations. Well, good morning everyone. I want to welcome our shareholders and other participants to the Ventas second quarter 2021 earnings call. Ventas delivered an outstanding second quarter and we have strong momentum across the board, in health and safety, capital deployment and access, realization of the benefits of prior successful investments, financial strength and most importantly in portfolio growth led by our high quality SHOP business with significant contributions from office and stability in our triple-net lease business. We see a clear path to growth in our demographically driven diversified enterprise through capturing the embedded upside in our senior housing business, the benefit of external investments, reliable cash flow from our office and triple-net businesses and delivery and stabilization of ongoing developments, primarily in the life sciences, research and innovation and Canadian senior housing areas. Our experienced team is committed to winning the recovery for all of our stakeholders. Let me first turn to our second quarter results. We posted $0.73 of normalized FFO per share, which is above the high-end of our previously provided guidance. I am delighted that our same-store property portfolio grew 3.6% sequentially. Our outperformance was driven by SHOP, which produced a $111 million in quarterly NOI, a recovery of $50 million of annualized NOI, representing industry-leading growth in same-store cash NOI and occupancy. July continued these positive SHOP trends for the fifth consecutive month of occupancy growth. Importantly, by the end of July, lease reached their highest levels since the pandemic began. Justin will unpack these trends more fully in his remarks. As a result, we have never been more confident that the senior living business is supported by powerful demand that is growing and resilient, while supply remains constrained. If the last 18 months have taught us anything, it is that as soon as our communities and care providers are ready to welcome residents and their families, we experienced a surge of leads and move-ins almost immediately, which then build sustainably and rapidly. That said, given the macro uncertainty in the COVID-19 environment, particularly the national and regional rise in cases and the measures that have been taken or may be taken to contain COVID spread. The path to full recovery may not be a straight line, but we believe that will point inexorably upward. In our third quarter outlook, we have assumed the increase in COVID cases throughout the U.S. may have some impact on the velocity of leasing and expenses. Rounding out our portfolio performance, office grew nicely in the quarter and our triple-net portfolio continued its stability. Pete's efforts to increase leasing, keep high retention rates, improved customer relationships and grow NOI are showing results. Our on-campus and affiliated MLP strategy with leading health system continues to shine. Turning to health systems, our investment in Ardent also continues to deliver benefit. In addition to strong cash flow coverage on our $1.3 billion leasehold position, our 10% equity stake in the Ardent enterprise is benefiting from excellent Ardent results and our prior purchase of $200 million of Ardent senior notes recently paid off with a $15 million prepayment fee, providing us with a 13% unlevered return on our investment in the Ardent notes. When all is said and done, I believe and hope that our Ardent investment in real estate, equity and debt will prove to be one of our best risk adjusted return investments. Turning to other capital allocation priorities, we certainly are on our front foot regarding external investments. In total, in 2021 we have over $3.5 billion in investments completed, pending or underway with another $1 billion life science, research and innovation pipeline with our exclusive development partner Wexford, right behind that. Our team is also busy evaluating attractive deals across our asset classes. This year-to-date, we have already reviewed about as many investment opportunities as we saw in all of 2019. We will pursue those that meet our multi-factor investment philosophy, which is focused on growing reliable cash flow and favorable risk adjusted returns, taking into account factors such as cost per square foot or unit, downside protection and ultimate potential for cash flow growth and asset appreciation. Our $2.3 billion pending investment in New Senior, announced in the second quarter, is a great example. In this deal, we are acquiring over a 100 high-quality independent living communities that are well-invested and located in advantaged markets at compelling pricing. The per unit cost is estimated to be 20% to 30% below replacement cost. The 5% cash going in cap rate is expected to grow to a 6% cap rate on expected 2022 NOI with upside as the senior housing recovery continues. And the FFO multiple of less than 12 times post synergize 2022 estimated FFO are all attractive valuation metrics. I commend Susan Givens and her team for doing a tremendous job creating and realizing value for their stakeholders. We are also confident that Ventas shareholders will receive immediate and long term accretion and upside from the deal as senior housing recovers and the large middle market demographic expands significantly in the near term. As Justin will describe, the New Senior portfolio also fits in with our senior housing strategy and framework. New Senior also performed well in Q2 and into July, with occupancy increasing in the same-store portfolio for five straight months. A unique strategic advantage of the New Senior transaction is the long-standing relationship we have with the principal managers of the portfolio, Atria and Holiday, two leading operators who recently combined to form the second largest senior housing manager. As a one-third owner of Atria, we are excited about the opportunities the combination creates. we will directly benefit from growth in Atria's management platform. And we welcome the combination of Atria and Holiday's talent in Atria's advanced enterprise. Congratulations to Atria for pulling together this industry changing transaction. Switching to our attractive life science, research and innovation business. It continues to provide us with value-creating opportunities to invest capital. The Ventas life science portfolio now exceeds nine million square feet. It's located in three of the top five cluster markets, includes three ongoing development projects and is affiliated with over 16 of the nation's top research universities. We also have an incremental $1 billion in potential projects we are working on with Wexford. The first and largest new life science project in the pipeline, totaling about $0.5 billion in costs, is gaining steam. Expected to be 60% pre-leased to a major public research university that ranks in the top 5% of NIH funding, this project will be located on the West Coast and should break ground in the first half of 2022. Wexford with its exceptional reputation among universities is also exploring significant additional life science potential projects beyond those in our existing pipeline. North of the border, we continue to invest capital in high-end large-scale independent living communities with our partner, Le Groupe Maurice in Quebec. We have always tried to create value through both internal and external growth and we are pleased that we have returned to being a net acquirer in 2021. Our team is active and engaged beyond our announced deals and our pipeline of potential investments across asset classes. To fund new investments, we have access to significant liquidity and a wide array of capital sources, including the asset dispositions and receipt of loan repayments, as Bob will describe in greater detail. The demand for senior housing has been robust and sustainable, proving out the value proposition of communities and care providers offered to seniors in their families. The sharp recovery has begun and we have started capturing the significant upside embedded in our existing senior housing portfolio from both pandemic recovery and the 17.5% growth in the senior population projected over the next few years. Our diversified business model continues to provide uplift and stability to our enterprise. We are investing nearly $4 billion in announced deals and development projects and our access to and pricing of capital are positive. In closing, the U.S. is in the midst of an impressive economic recovery that, together with demographic demand for all our asset classes, will benefit our business. We embrace the opportunity to take on any near term challenges that are temporarily caused by the strength and speed of this recovery, especially because now, unlike last year and the beginning of 2021, our employees, residents, tenants and caregivers are largely safe and healthy. As a team at Ventas, we are incredibly pleased about the results we have delivered and the strength and momentum we have demonstrated. Justin, over to you.\nJustin Hutchens: Thank you Debbie. We remain excited about delivering industry-leading occupancy and NOI growth and we are encouraged about recent trends in the senior housing portfolio. Although we are still in the early stages of the recovery, we are off to a very strong start. Ventas is well-positioned to benefit from significant senior housing tailwinds, including the sector recovery upside, supportive demand fundamentals and continued improvement in leading indicators. I will review three topics today. First, our second quarter performance. Second, our perspective on the senior housing operating environment. And third, our continued execution of our senior housing strategy. I will start by covering our second quarter performance. In SHOP, leading indicators continued to trend favorably and accelerated during the quarter, as leads and move-ins each surpassed 100% of 2019 levels, while move-outs remained steady. June marked the best month for leads and move-ins since the start of the pandemic and July has sustained strong momentum. Strong sales activity has now driven five consecutive months of occupancy growth, inclusive of July. In the second quarter approximate spot occupancy from March 31 to June 30 increased 229 basis points, led by the U.S. with growth of 313 basis points and accelerating leads and move-ins. In Canada, the trends were more muted due to a slower vaccine rollout, but approximate spot occupancy still increased during the second quarter, driven by 33 basis points of growth in June. Leading indicators remained strong in our portfolio as the digital footprint of our operators have significantly expanded over the past year, casting a wider net as traditional high converting lead sources such as personal referrals, respite and professional referrals continue recovery. Turning to SHOP operating results. Same-store revenue in the second quarter increased sequentially by $3.5 million as strong occupancy growth was partially offset by the impact of a new resident move-in incentives on pricing, specifically at Atria. I will touch on that more in a minute. Operating expenses declined sequentially by $9.2 million or 2.3% excluding the impact of HHS grants received in the first quarter, driven by a better than expected reduction of COVID-19 operating costs, partially offset by a modest increase in routine operating expenses. For the sequential same-store pool, SHOP generated approximately $111 million of NOI received in the first quarter, which represents a sequential increase of $12.4 million or 12.6% when excluding the impact of HHS grants. This marks the first quarter of sequential underlying NOI growth since the onset of COVID-19 and approximates a nearly $15 million NOI improvement on an annualized basis. During the quarter, we saw solid contribution to sequential NOI growth in both revenue and operating expenses as average occupancy increased 110 basis points and COVID-19 costs declined substantially and ahead of expectations. Turning to triple-net. Sequential same-store cash NOI was largely stable in the second quarter and 98% of all contractual triple-net rent was received from the company's tenants. Our trailing 12-months cash flow coverage for senior housing, which is reported one quarter in arrears, is 1.2 times and down versus the prior quarter, reflecting the timing associated with coverage reporting which now includes effectively four full quarters of operations impacted by COVID. Moving onto the current operating environment, which is full of green shoots. Our market leading operators continued to demonstrate their strong market position through broad occupancy gains. Sunrise led the way with 627 basis points of spot occupancy growth in the low point in mid-March to the end of July, benefiting from a rejuvenated management team, significantly well-invested communities and a balanced approach demonstrating very strong occupancy gains and pricing power. We would like to congratulate Sunrise's CEO, Jack Callison, for adding experience and depth to his management team with his recently announced hires. Atria, which benefits from a higher absolute occupancy of 81.8% at July end, continues to deliver solid volume growth. Spot occupancy in July increased 529 basis points since the low point in mid-March, resulting from the combination of their industry-leading vaccine mandate and strategic price incentives to capture movements. Atria anticipates tightening incentives moving forward as pricing power recovers and occupancy stabilizes. Supporting all of this is Atria's industry-leading vaccination rates, which are impressively high at nearly a 100% of both residents and employees. Looking ahead, as Debbie mentioned, the third quarter is off to a strong start with July spot occupancy increasing 74 basis points versus June and lease continuing to stand strong at 105% of pre-pandemic levels. Our operators have been prioritizing resident safety and weathering several near term headwinds, including the Delta variant and transitory wage pressures from staffing shortages in select markets. Underpinning our leading operating partner relationships and recent sales momentum is our attractive market footprint, which positions us to benefit from the compelling supply and demand outlook in the senior housing sector. Our communities in the U.S. are poised for improving performance over time due to our strong presence in submarkets that outpace the U.S. national average in aging population growth and wealth demographics, but with significantly lower exposure to new construction starts and construction as a percentage of inventory. Approximately 30% of our SHOP portfolio on a stabilized basis is located in Canada. The senior housing sector in Canada has performed exceptionally well, with occupancy exceeding 90% every year from 2010 to 2020 and demand outpacing new supply in eight of that last 11 years. As a foundation to these attractive fundamentals, the 75-plus population in Canada is projected to grow more than 20% over the next five years, about twice the pace of the U.S. The Ventas team has been busy executing our senior housing strategy, driven by experiential operating expertise and underpinned by our analytical capabilities to further strengthen our senior housing business. The underlying goal of our strategy is simply to execute portfolio actions that ensure we are located in the right markets, with the right operator, with assets with strong local market positioning. A notable example of our strategy execution is the New Senior transaction. New Senior has a track record of strong operating performance, benefits from a geographically diverse footprint with favorable exposure to compelling market fundamentals and demographics and represents a well invested high quality portfolio catering to an attractive market segment. The acquisition also represents an excellent opportunity to further expand our relationships with two long-standing operators in Holiday Retirement and Atria Senior Living and with new relationships such as Hawthorn Senior Living. New Senior will strengthen our existing senior housing business from several strategic perspectives. Operationally, New Senior will enhance Ventas' cash flow generation profile. Its margin has remained resilient in the 35%-plus range during the COVID-19 and occupancy has weathered the pandemic headwinds of approximately 80 basis points better than the NIC industry average. Most recently, New Senior has seen strong sales trends as we progressed through the early stages of the senior housing recovery with powerful upside as the portfolio occupancy grew 100 basis points in June. Geographically, New Senior has a diverse presence across 36 states, which includes exposure to markets with high home values and high household income levels, ideal proximity to premium retail in high visibility locations and favorable supply outlooks versus industry averages. This transaction is a reflection of our focus on adding high-quality assets to our senior housing platform and maintaining balance across independent living and assisted living product types. We see New Senior's independent living assets as complementary to our existing high-end major market portfolio as it provides a lower average resident age and longer length of stay at an accessible price point, with RevPOR of approximately $2,700. The purpose-built nature of these communities, which include consistent layout with 120 units per building also will strengthen our ability to effectively and efficiently redevelop and invest in these assets over time. Moving on to new developments. We continue to drive value from our development pipeline through our relationship with Le Groupe Maurice, where we have opened three communities, with more than 1,000 units over the past year. Two of the three developments were delivered in the fourth quarter of 2020. Both projects had substantial pre-leasing activity and have already stabilized at approximately 95% occupancy. The third project, a 287-unit expansion of an existing Le Groupe Maurice community in Montreal, was delivered in June of this year. Initial leasing activity has been strong with more than half of the new units occupied as of the end of July. Our plans across our broader SHOP portfolio includes significant deployment of refresh and redevelopment capital, strengthening our market leading position, where we expect to realize occupancy growth and pricing upside over the next few years. We continue to actively manage our portfolio with the disposition of non-strategic assets and the transition of operators in select markets to position our senior housing business for long term success. In summary, our recovery is off to a strong start. We are well-positioned in markets that benefit from outsized aging and wealth demographic, with rapid portfolio [indiscernible] we are executing our senior housing strategy to help ensure success in the near and long term. I will now hand over to Pete.\nPete Bulgarelli: Thanks Justin. I will cover the office and healthcare triple-net segments. Together, these segments represent over 50% of Ventas' NOI. We continue to produce positive and reliable results. Within these segments, we are seeing a changing business climate. Health system and university business confidence is rising, leading to longer term commitments and strategic growth investments. During the pandemic, we kept our business confidence. We remain focused on growth and we continued to invest in incremental leasing resources and in creating a leasing center of excellence, led by an industry veteran. She is now two years in. We have built a technical engineering team to assist our local property teams in running our buildings more efficiently, also led by an industry veteran. He is now 18 months in. We doubled our capital invested in our MOBs to ensure their competitiveness, including major redevelopments in Phoenix, Atlanta and Austin, Texas. We expanded our tenant satisfaction programs under the leadership of our new property management leader. He is also 18 months in. Because of this focus, I am proud to say that our MOBs now rank in the top quartile of tenant overall satisfaction as surveyed by Kingsley, the national real estate survey leader. Happy tenants equals higher occupancy. Our focus on the fundamentals and growth is showing results. Let me describe them now. Office, which includes our medical office and research and innovation segments performed well, delivering 10.5% sequential same-store growth. Office quarterly same-store growth was 12.6% year-on-year. The R&I portfolio benefited from a $12 million termination fee from a large tenant in the Winston-Salem innovation center, anchored by Wake Forest. Adjusted for the termination fee, office sequential same-store growth was 90 basis points and 2.8% for year-on-year same-store quarterly growth, a strong quarter. Medical office same-store sequential growth was 80 basis points and year-on-year quarterly same-store growth was 2.4%. For the quarter, we executed 230,000 square feet in office new leasing and 460,000 square feet year-to-date, a 78% improvement from prior year. Medical office had strong same-store retention of 94% for the quarter and 85% for the trailing 12-months. The result is that total MOB occupancy increased 20 basis points sequentially. Total office leasing was 750,000 square feet for the quarter and 1.8 million square feet year-to-date. We are also pleased that our annual escalators for the new MOB leases averaged 2.9% for the quarter, which caused MOB same-store portfolio annual rent escalators to increase from 2.4% to 2.6%. Our R&I business continued to excel as it strives to provide effective facilities to support the record level of investment into life sciences research. Same-store sequential growth was 38.9%. Adjusted for the termination fee, same-store sequential growth was 1.1%. Year-on-year quarterly same-store growth was 42.6%. Adjusted for the termination fee, year-on-year quarterly same-store growth was a strong 3.9%. Quarterly same-store occupancy was now standing 94% with sequential occupancy increasing by 10 basis points. Looking forward, we have three R&I buildings comprising of 1.2 million square feet of space under construction. Collectively, they are 78% leased or committed. Of the two buildings in our uCity Complex at Philadelphia, the Drexel building is 100% leased, while one uCity Square is over 55% leased or committed. We are oversubscribed for the remaining space with 11 above pro forma proposals currently outstanding. In Pittsburgh, our new building is 70% pre-leased. University of Pittsburgh and UPMC was significant activity on the remaining space. At our recently opened project with Arizona State University in Phoenix, we are 86% leased or committed and expect to be 100% leased shortly. These performance numbers reflect the quality of our well located R&I assets. Now let's turn to healthcare triple-net. During the second quarter, our healthcare triple-net assets showed continued strength and reliability with 100% rent collections. Second quarter same-store cash NOI growth was 2.5% year-on-year. Trailing 12-month EBITDARM cash flow coverage through June 30 was strong across the portfolio. Health systems trailing 12-month coverage was an excellent 3.6 times in the first quarter, a 10 basis point sequential improvement. As Debbie mentioned, Ardent continues to perform extremely well in this dynamic market. IRF and LTAC coverage improved 20 basis points to 1.9 times in the first quarter, buoyed by strong business results. Although skilled nursing declined 10 basis points to 1.8 times as the pandemic continued to impact centers, total post-acute coverage increased sequentially by 20 basis points to 1.9 times in the first quarter of 2021. Finally, several of our partners have an approach for M&A opportunities. Kindred is expected to merge with LifePoint and Spire recently entertained multiple offers by Ramsay. It is a testament to the underlying value of our healthcare operators and the associated real estate. With that, I will turn the call over to Bob.\nBob Probst: Thanks Pete. In my remarks today, I will cover our second quarter results, our recent liquidity balance sheet and capital activities and finally, our expectations for the third quarter of 2021. Starting with our results in the second quarter. Ventas recorded strong second quarter net income of $0.23 per share and normalized funds from operations of $0.73 per share. Normalized FFO per share was $0.02 above the high end of our initial guidance range of $0.67 to $0.71 for the quarter and is consistent with our June update to be at the high end or better than that original range. The Q2 outperformance was driven by growth in office, continued stable performance from triple-net, strong results from Ardent and better than expected NOI in our SHOP portfolio. Turning to capital. We have been busy in proactively managing our capital structure, duration of debt and liquidity since our last earnings call. First, following the announcement of the New Senior agreement, we raised $300 million in equity at an average gross price of approximately $58.60 per share under our ATM program. The $300 million equity raise together with the $800 million of new equity to be issued to New Senior shareholders for the fixed exchange ratio and $1.2 billion of New Senior debt to be assumed or refinanced constitutes the overall $2.3 billion funding of the New Senior transaction. Second, through August 5, we have received $450 million of disposition proceeds in a receipt of loan receivable. Included in the $450 million received to-date is repayment of two well structured loans in July, part of redemption of $200 million of 9.75% Senior Notes due 2026 and Holiday's repayment of $66 million or 9.4% notes due 2025. Medical office buildings sold in the second quarter also resulted in proceeds of approximately $107 million. Using proceeds from this disposition, in the third quarter Ventas will improve its near term debt maturity profile further by fully repaying a total of $664 million in outstanding 3.25% Senior Notes due August 2022 and 3.13% notes due June 2023. As a result of recovery in senior housing NOI and our capital structure actions, we are seeing strengthening credit metrics. Reported Q2 net EBITDA was better than expectations improving 10 basis points sequentially to seven times. Within that 10 basis point improvement, underlying SHOP annualized EBITDA improved nearly $50 million or 25 basis points beneficial impact of the ratio in just one quarter. This organic improvement was offset by the elimination of SHOP which we experienced in Q2. This provides a proof point of the anticipated material improvement in leverage resulting from the underlying recovery in senior housing over time. Pro forma, for announced ATM issuance and capital activities, Ventas' Q2 net debt to EBITDA went lower from seven times to 6.8 times. I would highlight that the New Senior transaction is expected to be 30 basis point levering on projected New Senior 2020 NOI and is supported by the forecasted growth in cash flows from the New Senior portfolio. Ventas' has ample liquidity totaling $3.3 billion. As of August 5, the company had $2.7 billion of undrawn revolver capacity, $600 million cash and no commercial paper outstanding. Let's finish with our future guidance. Third quarter net income is estimated to range from flat to $0.05 per fully diluted share. Our guidance range for normalized FFO for Q3 is $0.70 to $0.74 per share. The Q3 FFO midpoint of $0.72 can be bridged from Q2 of $0.73 by $0.02 benefit from the Ardent loan prepayment fee in Q3, net of the Ardent HHS grants in Q2, offset by $0.02 from lost interest income on the loan repayments and the July equity raise. NOI reductions from assets intended for dispositions describe the last $0.01. In the third quarter, assumptions underlying our guidance are as follows. SHOP Q3 spot occupancy from June 30 to September 30 is forecasted to increase between 150 to 250 basis points, with the midpoint roughly continuation of occupancy growth trends there in July. Third quarter is expected to be roughly flat sequentially and move-in incentives are expected to narrow in the quarter. Sequential SHOP revenue growth is expected to be offset by increasing operating costs due to an additional day in the quarter, higher occupancy, labor and routine seasonal items including repairs and maintenance and utility costs. No HHS Grants are assumed to be received in the third quarter. Sales performance is expected in the office and triple-net segments. We continue to expect $1 billion in asset sales and loan repayments for the full year 2021 with line of sight for the remaining balance in the second half of this year. Fully diluted share count is now 383 million shares reflecting the equity raise in anticipation of New Senior. Guidance does not include any other announced capital markets activity. Our Q3 guidance excludes any impact from the pending acquisition of New Senior. The New Senior transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2021 and once closed, it is forecast to be between $0.09 to $0.11 accretive to normalized FFO per share in 2022. I would like to underscore that we are still in a highly uncertain environment. Growth trends in SHOP are positive. The pandemic's impact on our business remains very difficult to predict. Ventas is excited about our business in the future and we believe we have the well-diversified portfolio, best-in-class operators and experienced team to win the recovery that is now underway. That concludes our prepared remarks. Before we start with Q&A, we are limiting each caller to two questions to be respectful to everyone on the line. With that I will turn the call back to the operator.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions].Your first question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes.\nJonathan Hughes: Hi. Good morning. Justin, can you share some more details on your seniors housing occupancy versus rate philosophy? And why when I look at the rate, it seems that there is a little bit more discounting here than some other portfolios as you RevPOR was down about 2% year over year, some others were up low-single digits? I guess it just seems given demand is rebounding and length of stay is only a few years and affordability is probably as attractive now as it's been in perhaps ever, why wasn't RevPOR growth maybe at least flat if not positive?\nJustin Hutchens: Hi. Nice to talk to you. Let me start with the year-over-year kind of comment you made. So if you were to look at our year-over-year RevPOR and you exclude Atria, which as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, had some discounting. I will come back to that and exclude LGM which performed really well in this past year but they operate at a lower price point in an active living product in Canada. So there's a mix shift impact from LGM. So if you were to take those two out, our RevPOR would have increased 1.8%. So take LGM aside and let's get back to Atria. You might remember that Atria, starting back during the pandemic had positioned themselves to go for volume in a few different ways. Very early on, they were the first to execute testing broadly. As they moved throughout the pandemic, they saw an opportunity for volume ahead of the worst part of the pandemic, which was emerging in the fall and into the winter. So they offered price incentives. And if you were to look at Atria's occupancy growth, if you go move further back from the low point and start back for instance December 31, they have grown 372 basis points versus the rest of our SHOP in total to be like 227 basis points. And so they are an absolute bonafide leader in driving occupancy volume. They chose to stay with the discounting into recent months. We have noticed in underlying trends that they are starting to tighten. They also have a higher absolute occupancy than the rest of our portfolio and a lot of operators in the sector. So we believe that they are well-positioned to start to push pricing in the markets where they are seeing stabilization. That's their intent. They started to do it. They will continue to do it. They have a long track record of driving both occupancy and price. And we are in the very early stages of this recovery. So we are comfortable and confident that then over time they will deliver. One other point and that is that we have Sunrise Senior Living in our portfolio. Sunrise has a 9,000 RevPOR. They are sitting at 72% occupied. They have been driving a lot of occupancy growth as well. And the mix shift that I mentioned that kind of went the other way with LGM outperforming will shift the other way and Sunrise starts to grow. So I think our RevPOR outlook will be fine in the long term.\nJonathan Hughes: Okay. Yes. That's helpful. It's just tough for us to see the mix shift on our side. But the color is really helpful. I appreciate you sharing that. And then just one more for me on the life science and the R&I pipeline. Are you still planning to utilize some JV partners on some of those future potential developments to help spread out risk and lower the earnings dilution? Or given the strength of that business, is there maybe a desire now to keep those wholly-owned, let that value creation benefit drop to shareholders?\nDebra A. Cafaro: Good morning. That's a great question. We are excited about this business that is going to continue to grow and Wexford has a lot of opportunities. But I would say is, the answer will be some and some. There are some pre-identified projects that are in the pipeline that would do in joint ventures. And they are carefully selected to make sure we have a coherent strategy around the joint venture. And there are others that Wexford is working on that may go on balance sheet depending on, again, the risk-reward profile. So I think we will have a lot of benefits from this business initiative going forward, both on balance sheet and with our joint venture strategy.\nJonathan Hughes: Okay. I will jump off. Thanks for the time.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping to get more color on the underlying assumptions for the SHOP occupancy growth in third quarter. Obviously, you have already had July at about 75 basis points and recognize the recovery won't be straight line as you said. But how do you think about the near term risks from of the Delta variant and the impact on at least near term senior housing occupancy?\nPete Bulgarelli: Sure. I will start on that, Nick. So this, in terms of the numbers, the outlook is 150 to 250 spot occupancy gains. You are right to say 74 in the first month. So at the time that is above the midpoint. And you are right to say it's not a straight line. I mean clearly the pandemic backdrop is something we are thinking about, no doubt about it as you think about occupancy. And it's never month-to-month if you look at it, take one month times three. That said, the strength in leads in July is worth noting as well. In light of that, what translates into move-ins in the future. So we are still seeing very positive trend now five consecutive months of occupancy and strong leads. But with a backdrop of caution is the right way to think about it.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. Then you talked about the supply outlook on senior housing kind of being positive for the near medium term. Given the recovery that's underway, when would you expect that supply to start picking up in terms of new starts?\nJustin Hutchens: Yes. So it's Justin. There is a little bit of catch-up in terms of supply from last year that we are experiencing in the short term. It's a bump in the road but starts and deliveries are very low and so there is a window that we can look out. We think a few years of runway to really have strong absorption in the sector. Certainly, capital will follow the fundamentals. We expect to see development chase this sector. But when they do, they will be faced with the strongest aging demographic that the sector has ever faced. So we are certainly bullish and confident on the demand for senior housing.\nNick Joseph: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Yes. Hi everyone. Hope everyone is doing well. Curious on Ardent, since you got the loan repayment. Just curious, maybe if you have any interest to kind of expand further into the hospital sector? It just feel like. yes, just kind of curious there.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Well, good morning. Thanks for the question. No, Ardent has been a great investment in many different ways. Great risk adjusted return, great performance and I think even better days ahead. I would say that if we were able to find additional assets in the health system space that have the characteristics that we like about Ardent, we certainly would commit additional capital there. And those characteristics really are around growing market, position in local markets, being one of the leaders, having pricing power with commercial payers and those types of characteristics, obviously population growth and so on and good strong experienced care providers. So we continue to explore opportunities in this space and if we can find anything even close to as good as Ardent, I think we would be happy to commit additional capital there.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. And then on the disposition guidance, the $1 billion, did that originally include the Ardent repayment? And is that additional or kind of takes the place of maybe some other sales that you were going to do?\nBob Probst: Yes. Josh, that was in the initial $1 billion that the $200 million loan repayment, that was in our guidance originally. So no surprises there. And the balance being property real estate dispositions continues to be the assumption, both senior housing and MOBs. But that was in our first guidance.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. Just one real quick follow-up. If Colony was to, I think Colony could repay back their loan, that's not included? Or is that?\nDebra A. Cafaro: Correct. That is correct.\nBob Probst: Correct. That is not in $1 billion. That is not assumed.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. Got it.\nDebra A. Cafaro: You got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.\nMichael Carroll: Yes. Thanks. I wanted to stay on the RevPOR outlook real quick. And can you talk about how operators are setting rates today? Are they able to be more aggressive pushing rates, I guess in August versus February, beginning of this year? And then, if not, at what point will they be able to be more aggressive? I mean does occupancy have to hit back into the mid 80% range?\nJustin Hutchens: Yes. Hi, it's Justin. So even throughout the second quarter, we could see underlying tightening, particularly in asking rents. Operators tend to use short term incentives first and foremost. And we think those will persist as asking rents tighten. Clearly, the demand is really strong for independent assisted living. If that continues, I would expect pricing power to return and particularly as communities and markets reach pre-pandemic occupancy. So we think there is plenty of potential ahead to drive pricing. Of course, as Debbie mentioned that it may not be a straight line as we face this next phase of the recovery.\nDebra A. Cafaro: And different operators will clearly pursue different strategies. And we support and work with them on their strategies and we should see the benefit from that going forward.\nMichael Carroll: Okay. And then back in 2014 or 2015 when the SHOP portfolio had occupancy of 90%-plus. I mean at that point, how aggressive were your operator is able to push rate? I mean, could we expect RevPOR or maybe not expect to I mean could we see RevPOR get back into the mid single digits if something like that occurs?\nJustin Hutchens: Yes. So it's completely different market moving forward than it was then. That would have been really the beginning of facing new supply and there was still some pricing power persisted during that time with the outlook moving ahead given the demographic backdrop and the new supply backdrop that we are facing. It certainly supports occupancy growth and pricing power.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Yes. I mean, Michael you are reminding me of the very good times and thank you for doing that where occupancies were in the low to mid 90s and RevPOR was growing considerably. And so as Justin said, with the demographic growth and we have this window where the supply is baked over a multiyear period and that's going to be baked at low levels, that is a very constructive backdrop for getting back to very positive outcomes, RevPOR growth, occupancy growth, et cetera.\nMichael Carroll: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of --\nDebra A. Cafaro: That's why we went ahead, for sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays.\nSteven Valiquette: Great. Thanks. Hi. Good morning everybody.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Good morning.\nSteven Valiquette: So with the New Senior transaction focused mainly on the independent living market, just I am curious to hear just any updated thoughts you have around strategy and senior housing by property type? Are you just thinking about it on memory care versus AL versus IL, we have seen some operators and the large operators talk about some of the biggest gains in occupancy in memory care. I am just curious on your thoughts by property subtype in light of a transaction, how you think about those three areas on the pace of recovery? Thanks.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Great. And Justin will answer that. Thank you. I mean with the New Senior pro forma, I think we are going to be over 50%, including Canada in the IL products which we really like and it's a less labor intensive model, for example. But we do like the diversification in our enterprise and we also like it within our senior housing portfolio. So I will ask Justin really to describe this strategy and framework that we are thinking about as we build the portfolio with Justin's kind of imprint upon it.\nJustin Hutchens: Thanks. So first and foremost, we just wanted to make sure, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks and I like to say this a lot, that we are in the right markets with the right asset and the right operator managing that asset. So that might be memory care, assisted living or independent living, really all the product sites have good characteristics. The assisted living and memory care are more need-driven. You have higher price points. They also do run at tighter cost. And so depending on the RevPOR associated with the products, your margins can vary. But it's a product that does tend to recover quickly. It did after the financial crisis, doing really well after the pandemic so far. So it's great to have exposure as long as you are in the right markets with the right operator to that product. Independent living has a longer length of stay. It also has less new competition facing it. In the case of New Senior, there is extreme affordability relative to an AL product. It's about at least twice as good in terms of, if you are a resident making a choice within your local market for a New Senior independent living versus for AL. So it reaches a broader audience. It also has pricing upside through investments and faces the same strong demographic wave that are subscribing earlier. One other thing about independent living because it faces less new competition, it does have a higher ceiling. Pre-pandemic it was outpacing AL and memory care by about 400 basis points. We don't see any reason why coming out the other side that it doesn't also have higher ceiling moving forward.\nSteven Valiquette: Okay. Great. That's helpful. Just one other real quick follow-up on New Senior transaction. you have a bullet point above Ventas expecting to make revenue generating capital investments for additional value and opportunities. Just curious to hear more about that and how critical that is as part of the overall transaction?\nJustin Hutchens: Yes. So this is Justin again. This is a product type that I mentioned that has great characteristics. There are 120 units, large units. If you have been to a holiday community, you have kind of been to all of them because they are exactly the same. Big open floor plan when you walk in. Open dining. There's three stories. And so it lends itself well to redevelopment or refresh investment. And we are happy to be situated in several markets that are great locations or high traffic locations or located close to premium retail. They have strong incoming wealth and aging demographics. So a lot of cases, we think we are pushing out open the door to make additional investments. And the goal, on a targeted basis, is to make investment, support the occupancy growth but also push pricing. So we are in the process of evaluating those opportunities and we will integrate that into our plans over the next couple of few years.\nSteven Valiquette: Got it. Okay. Thanks.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital.\nJuan Sanabria: Hi. Good morning. I was just hoping to talk.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Good morning.\nJuan Sanabria: Good morning. I was just hoping to talk a little bit about big picture strategy. Just trying to gauge how much appetite you have to truly meaningfully grow the seniors housing exposure at this point in the cycle, given this nice window you have over the next few years versus kind of the long term stated desire to be diversified across asset types and different products? And so just curious how you are thinking about it given the opportunity set in seniors housing in that nice window for the next couple of years.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Yes. Well, we have definitely put our money where mouth is in terms of the New Senior investment of $2.3 billion and well invested well located senior living. We are excited about that. That will increase our percentage NOI coming from the senior living area and will enable us not only to capture embedded upside in the Ventas portfolio in senior housing but also New Senior. So that's great and we will continue to invest where we think there is good risk adjusted return and upside in the senior living business. We do believe, as you know, in a diversified model and we will continue to invest in other areas of our business that have performed exceedingly well for us and have really proven their value over the last year, because the benefit of diversification really is that, you never know really what the external market and environment are going to throw at you. And these different asset classes are unified by demographic demand that they perform differently in different environments. And we have gotten the benefit of that so much so in the medical office area, the life science area, the hospital area over the last year that we remain of a belief that that is the best profile to deliver the kind of value proposition we want to deliver to our shareholders.\nJuan Sanabria: Great. Thank you. Super helpful.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Thank you.\nJuan Sanabria: And then just on seniors housing, I guess for Justin. Just curious on the latest thoughts on the flow-through of incremental revenue to the NOI line. And if I could be sneaky just any thoughts on or latest data points on the Delta variant, if there is any implications on operators' visitation policies as a result of the uncertainty in Canada, a very fluid landscape?\nJustin Hutchens: Sure. So I will start with the flow-through and maybe just kind of refer to it as margin. One thing that's interesting, you can kind of see in the supplemental you will catch this, our operating margin, even on a much lower occupancy right now, is only like a 150 or 200 basis points off of the margin from a year ago on a much higher occupancy. And so margin is kind of hanging in there. We think if you fast forward and get the portfolio back to pre-pandemic occupancy, we think you are very, very close potentially to within 100, 200 basis points of the pre-pandemic margin plus there should be some pricing power plus there should be some more occupancy upside than we were seeing at that time. So we feel good about the flow-through and it's going to be, we are in this period where Atria has one of our best performing operators as I mentioned in terms of occupancy, but they have another 700 basis points to go to get back to where they were pre-pandemic. And during this kind of next wave of occupancy fill that we expect to see the flow-through really increase and margin grow as well. And then the second part of your question is view of the Delta.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Right. I mean, right now it's kind of business as usual. But as I mentioned in my remarks and you clearly understand, there is fluidity and the environment is very dynamic. And so we want to be prudent in our thought process about the third quarter. But right now the communities are all open for new move-ins and visitation and we hope that that continues because the communities are so highly vaccinated and protected. And that is the comfort and the happiness frankly that we have sitting here today that we feel really good about.\nJuan Sanabria: Fingers crossed. Good luck everybody.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Exactly. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lukas Hartwich with Green Street.\nLukas Hartwich: Thanks. Good morning. Can you provide any color on the in-process senior housing disposition? Just maybe level of ventures? And is there a sense of how pricing compares to pre-COVID levels?\nDebra A. Cafaro: Well, we are making good progress. We have a line of sight to, as Bob said, to the balance of the investments which are composed of medical office and senior housing. And because the outlook for senior housing is very favorable, there is significant interest in the asset class. And we think pricing will be in line with our expectations.\nLukas Hartwich: Great. And then during the quarter, it looked like a tenant exercised a purchase option. Can you provide a sense of how pervasive those types of options are in the portfolio?\nDebra A. Cafaro: They are absolutely de minimis because this is a historical one, frankly, that we got from NHP that is going back to PMB. So this is a long-standing one. We did recognize a very significant gain on the sale which was $30 million or $40 million, I can't remember, on $100 million deal. So that was good. But we have very, very limited purchase options for tenants.\nLukas Hartwich: Great. Thank you.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Thanks Lukas.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nJordan Sadler: Thanks. Good morning. I wondered, just a quick follow-up on the Colony loan investment. Any update there surrounding your expectations? Or the fact that you excluded it from the sales guide in the Q, that you still don't expect it to be repaid?\nDebra A. Cafaro: I think the latter. As you know from the Colony call they have moved that portfolio to intended for disposition of the real estate portfolio that is encumbered by our loan and the loan continues to perform well. And my guess would be that and it's only a guess, is that buyer of the real estate portfolio would likely assume the existing capital stack.\nJordan Sadler: Okay. Although I guess if it goes to somebody, I mean who looks to parcel off the portfolio or it doesn't mean to own or hold the entire portfolio, there is a possibility that they might have to repay that loan, right? Because it's supported by the entire portfolio?\nDebra A. Cafaro: Yes. It is supported by the pool portfolio, definitely. And you know it's a very well structured loan. And we always feel good when our loans get repaid even though we have to recycle the capital. But it proves the merits of the investment, if you will. So we are open-minded. I think either way could be favorable for Ventas.\nJordan Sadler: Okay. And then just as a follow-up relative to one of Pete comments in his closing to his comments he mentioned some of the partners being approached and pursued, the Kindred deal, the Spire portfolio. Any anticipated actions you guys might see within your portfolio as a result of those transactions?\nDebra A. Cafaro: Yes. I mean whenever there is activity there can be opportunity. And we look forward to exploring those kinds of things. We have had a good relationship with Kindred for 22 years and we have done lots of really constructive things together and I would hope that that will continue.\nJordan Sadler: Okay. Thank you.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Bernstein with Capital One.\nDaniel Bernstein: Hi. Good morning. Congrats on a good quarter with SHOP. So kind of a broad question here on seniors housing, I mean there has been some real success from the larger operators like Brookdale, Sunrise obviously the merger of Atria and Holiday. It's just kind of I just want to get your perspective on maybe the importance of scale in seniors housing going forward? Historically, scale has not worked out too well versus regional operators in terms of performance. But maybe that's changing. And just wanted to try to get your perspective on that? And maybe how Ventas as a REIT can participate in that?\nDebra A. Cafaro: Well, that's a great question. It's clearly from someone who has been around the industry for a long time. As we said, as a third owner of Atria, we do like the combination of the talent, the IL and the AL capabilities coming together on a very advanced platform that Atria has to become the second largest operator. So that can really yield some benefits, I would say, with the data, analytics and technology capabilities and the talent all coming together. So it's more about that than it is about the scale, I would say. There also can be benefits from smaller operators. Justin mentioned, we are going to have some, a new relationship with Hawthorne and those were, as you know, the original Holiday guys, if you will. And I think there are some strong benefits that those local operators can provide as well. So we look forward to having those relationships and building them out as appropriate.\nDaniel Bernstein: Okay. And then I guess the other question, I just wanted to go back to labor. I mean you have heard from some other REITs and operators that may be a lack of labor could slow down occupancy gains at more maybe skilled nursing seems challenging. But kind of wanted to get your thoughts whether there is any limits in terms of near term occupancy momentum that could occur because of the shortage of labor?\nDebra A. Cafaro: Right. Well, I mean again I think we, as a country and we Ventas with our strong second quarter, have a really of what I would call, my mother would call really, a high-class problem. And that is that our economy is recovering and demand is recovering in such a speedy and robust way that both the labor market and the supply chain are having trouble kind of keeping up with it. And that is an environment that we feel very comfortable kind of managing through to the other side, because when you step back, it's really all about that demand, the demographics, building that occupancy and pricing power and capturing that embedded upside in both Ventas senior housing as well as now New Senior. So we would rather have this environment than many others and I think we can successfully really manage through it because of the demand that is right in front of us.\nDaniel Bernstein: Okay. That's a helpful perspective. Thanks.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Right. And to the specific question, I mean our communities are able to take residents. There hasn't been any capacity constraint to-date on our ability to accept occupancy.\nDaniel Bernstein: All right. Thank you.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Amanda Sweitzer.\nAmanda Sweitzer: Thanks. Good morning. You touched on higher conversion lead sources continuing to recover in your prepared remarks. Can you just expand on where those higher conversion sources are trending today relative to pre-COVID levels? And how much additional upside you think you could realize through those?\nJustin Hutchens: Yes. Sure. So there's really kind of two things happening. One is the digital footprint that is expanding and then the other is the traditional leads coming back. So referral agencies and Internet-based leads are way over 100%, 150%, 160% of pre-pandemic levels. And so they have played a huge role in driving leads. That's maybe a silver lining that came from the pandemic where it forced operators to invest into that source of referrals and it's a game changer, really. And so we have seen most leads tick up. Now those do convert at a lower rate though, but the more the merrier. So in addition to that, there's three other lead sources. There is respite, professional referrals and personal referrals. Personal referrals in the second quarter for us, we are at 110% of pre-pandemic levels. So those have come roaring back. Professional still down around 74%to 75%. And respite just under that. So there is still a ways to go yet with professional and the respite of to recover which we think is encouraging because the lead levels have been quite strong.\nAmanda Sweitzer: Well, that's great and helpful. And then following up on to your expense growth guidance, particularly for the third quarter, just your expectation that increased SHOP expenses will largely offset the increased revenue growth. What did you see in terms of sequential expense growth in July? And how meaningful are the potential COVID-related expenses that you are including in guidance?\nBob Probst: Yes. I will have a go with that one for the third quarter. So you are right to say revenue growth pretty much offset by expense growth. There's a number of different buckets within the expense line, I think, worth highlighting. One is simply an extra day which is meaningful when you think sequentially third quarter versus the second quarter. That has a meaningful impact. The next is, I call it typical seasonal cost increase in the third quarter. Utilities is the easy one. Repairs and maintenance is another. But you see that every third quarter. The third bucket is really a function of occupancy growth and activity levels increasing in the communities. And then obviously you have incremental cost associated with that which is a good thing. And kind of overlaying all of that is, back to this question of short term wage pressure in light of the labor market, which is effectively embedded in the thinking. But there is a series of different buckets that altogether add up to that third quarter expense number.\nAmanda Sweitzer: That's helpful. Appreciate the time.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.\nNick Yulico: Thank you. I guess I just wanted to follow up on that expense question. Maybe if you could just give us a feel for how this is going to work in terms of, as you get increased occupancy in the portfolio, how much of an offset going forward that's going to be from same-store expense growth? Meaning that, if your occupancy instead was up 400 basis points in the third quarter and not 200 basis points, would you then have same-store NOI growth sequentially? Just trying to think about how, as occupancy is going up as well as some of your deflexing of labor that worked on the downside is now, I guess, going against you a bit on the expense side.\nBob Probst: Yes. Nick, I think it's right to say that as occupancy grows you are going to have some level. It's not a perfect linear one-for-one relationship whereby you add occupancy you add a head. It is more of a step-change type function. This always creates a beta as to what level that is. I think, qualitatively, we would tell you we are in that. We are growing labor as we are growing occupancy right now as a consequence of having come out the other side flexing labor, as you say, which should reach a level where then there is some scale advantage, if you like, that you can then hold off until you get to the next level of occupancy. I can't give you a number on that. But we are certainly in that upward trajectory right now.\nNick Yulico: Okay. Yes. I appreciate that. And I guess, just following up --\nDebra A. Cafaro: Yes. I mean, some of it is really related to this mismatch that I discussed in terms of shifting gears in the economy and that should be transitory.\nNick Yulico: Okay. Thank you. And then just following up on that. I know earlier, Justin, you were saying about the margin outlook. You thought there's a good chance to get back, I think you said within the 100, 200 basis points of pre-COVID margin as you are building the occupancy back. And I guess the way, is that the right way to think about this that in the meantime, over the next year, you are still going to be about 100, 200 basis points below on margin versus where you were? Because if I look at the third quarter guidance, it does feel like your margins are going to be about 20% in SHOP and the third quarter a year ago was almost 22%. So that kind of fits that piece of still being down a bit which is, maybe it's COVID expenses, it's also, I guess, the RevPOR being down year-over-year.\nJustin Hutchens: Yes. I would, I would kind of stretch out your timing a little further. As Bob mentioned, there is going to be kind of you will have periods we have revenue increase and a little bit of expense catch up. Debbie mentioned that the near term out as a transitory effect as well. So if you kind of push out the timetable away and we don't really have the crystal ball in terms of when we stabilize. But I was thinking more on a stabilized basis. We get there to that pre-pandemic occupancy margins should be within reach of where they were and then from there the pricing power and the occupancy upside for even higher margins over time. So that's all I was saying. And I didn't really mean to kind of pin it as kind of a near term picture, except to say that our margins in Q2 were only like 150, 200 basis points off of the year ago.\nNick Yulico: Okay. Thank you everyone.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vikram with Morgan Stanley.\nVikram Malhotra: Thanks so much. Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. So I guess, Justin, going back to sort of the occupancy increase near term but also maybe over the next 12 to 18 months. So first, I guess if I look at your slide and look at the lead volumes very recently, they are over 100% of 2019 and your move-outs are trending lower and certainly the leads are higher than the last few months or the second quarter numbers. So why would the occupancy uptick just be similar to what you saw, in your view, in the second quarter? Why wouldn't the midpoint of your guidance be the low point because your leads are just higher than what you have seen in the last, call it. four months?\nDebra A. Cafaro: Yes. Well, this is Debbie. You know again in July, well, first of all, we are really happy that leads in July are the highest they have been since beginning of the pandemic. That is a very important and meaningful statistic. And certainly portends to me, it means there's demand and it portends higher occupancy. So that is really good, as you say. In July, as we have talked about, we had spot-to-spot growth of about 75 basis points. And you know there is a lot of uncertainty in the environment. So if you just rolled that forward, that's near the midpoint of the 150 to 250. And that's how our guidance is constructed.\nVikram Malhotra: Got it. Okay. No, I mean you are right, like the July lead should translate into whatever August, September. I don't think it's more than that in terms of conversion time. But it just feels like the setup is one for, you would pretty easily get to your mid to maybe even the high end of your number of your occupancy guide. And I guess just tied to that, lot of smaller operators surveyed by Nick, do have a view that they could get back to pre-COVID occupancy next year. I wanted to just ask you from your perspective, like, do you think that's too optimistic? What's your sort of broad view on the puts and takes? I recognize the strategy that's different in terms of occupancy versus rent, et cetera, but where do you think, A, do you think those smaller operators are maybe too bullish? Or what are the puts and takes?\nDebra A. Cafaro: Yes, I mean the pace and slope of the recovery and the clinical environment broadly in the U.S. is really going to determine how quickly we get back to that pre-pandemic occupancy levels. We are on a good path. I think it's very sustainable. It has been so far. And we are very encouraged by that as well as the demographic growth that's right in front of us. I think Justin mentioned Atria had about, what, 700 basis points of occupancy to continue to get back to pre-pandemic levels. And again, it's really going to depend upon this, we were predicting the third quarter, we have visibility and line of sight to that. And thereafter I think we want to be conscious that it continues to be a pretty dynamic environment. So we are encouraged and I hope you are right about many of the things that you said, Vikram.\nVikram Malhotra: Debbie, if I can just -- sorry, go ahead.\nJustin Hutchens: I was just trying to say things to kind of support that. So right, as we currently sit, we only have just around or just about 20% of our communities that are at the pre-pandemic occupancy. Over 60% are achieving pre-pandemic move-in levels. So we have great activity. And we are really pleased with this early recovery. But we have a long way to go and so far really good support for it. But there is still a ways to go yet.\nVikram Malhotra: Okay. Great. Debbie, if I can just squeeze one bigger picture question. I am struck now by how the Big 3 Healthcare REITs are now different from maybe several years ago they were. There were lot more similarity. You have strong momentum in the life science, research segment. Obviously senior housing, there's a lot of momentum as you have just laid out on this call. I am just wondering and from a strategic and maybe a differentiation of that even value perspective, the MOB segment there seems to be a lot of demand on the private side. Cap rates are really low, pretty good. I know maybe three years ago, you set out to maybe sell, correct me if I am wrong, I think it was $600 million, $700 million of assets. Why is this not a good time to maybe exit a fair amount of MOBs and become more pure-play, I guess or focused on two segments, life science and senior housing?\nDebra A. Cafaro: Love the question. Thank you. Again we do believe that we have created a lot of value with our MOB portfolio as you point out. We have a differentiated strategy with our Lillibridge management platform that Pete runs and that's going really well. We have mentioned, that is part of the $1 billion of 2021 capital recycling that is MOBs and senior housing. So you are right on there, I do think that we have benefited from the stability of the cash flows at the MOBs with our strategy of being on campus and affiliated. And I think you are right that it has very low cap rate, but it also provides a really good differentiated and diversifying aspect to our overall cash flow stream. And so we like that. So we will trim here and there. We will recycle capital. We will take advantage of some of the value that we have created. But we really believe that owning the MOB business as we do is a benefit to our shareholders.\nVikram Malhotra: Okay. I will follow up on that offline, but thanks so much and have a great weekend.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC.\nRich Anderson: Well, I am sorry to keep you going. I logged in about two hours ago and found out it didn't take for some reason. So one question from me.\nDebra A. Cafaro: It might be you.\nRich Anderson: Yes. Fat fingers or something, I don't know.\nDebra A. Cafaro: You are welcome.\nRich Anderson: The one question I have or that I will ask in the interest of time is, concentration risk. With Atria following new Holiday and following their own merger with Holiday, gets over 20% depending on how you slice it. I am curious how much of that is an issue to you and how quickly, you would like to whittle that down through other investments outside of it? The idea of concentration in the past, at the time, sounds good and I recognize Atria is a great operator. But people have come to regret concentration risks as time has moved on. So I am curious if that's something that's sort of high on your radar screen to get back down to something in the mid teens or something like that over the next couple of years? Thanks.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Yes. Rich, thank you for asking that because that has always been something that is near and dear to my heart. And there is always this tension, as you mentioned, between really putting your assets with the right operator, the right markets and certainly the best operators. And Atria has been that. Holiday has been a leading operator. So there is a tension between that and making sure you don't put all your eggs in one basket and you manage your concentration wisely. And so we do think that the combination of Atria and Holiday provides the strategic benefits to us as an owner of Atria. And we like that. We like the growth in Atria's platform. That having been said, I think we do have a lot of flexibility in the New Senior management contracts and our own Holiday contracts that gives us the ability through both growth and the way the management contracts are structured to move in the right direction on the diversification of manager point.\nRich Anderson: Okay. Great. Thanks very much.\nDebra A. Cafaro: So we have all the tools we need to manage it in the right way.\nRich Anderson: What's your like long term, is this is much of I want to own or have a piece of my pie? Is it 10% or 15%? Is that the kind of the threshold for Ventas?\nDebra A. Cafaro: I mean, it will change over time and with specific situations. But that seems directionally you know the right kind of way to think about it.\nRich Anderson: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Thank you.\nOperator: And there are no other audio questions at this time.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Well, thank you all for sticking with us and for your interest in Ventas. We really appreciate it. We are so delighted with a great quarter of health and safety and results and we look forward to seeing you all in person soon. Thank you again.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks Pete. In my remarks today, I will cover our second quarter results, our recent liquidity balance sheet and capital activities and finally, our expectations for the third quarter of 2021. Starting with our results in the second quarter. Ventas recorded strong second quarter net income of $0.23 per share and normalized funds from operations of $0.73 per share. Normalized FFO per share was $0.02 above the high end of our initial guidance range of $0.67 to $0.71 for the quarter and is consistent with our June update to be at the high end or better than that original range. The Q2 outperformance was driven by growth in office, continued stable performance from triple-net, strong results from Ardent and better than expected NOI in our SHOP portfolio. Turning to capital. We have been busy in proactively managing our capital structure, duration of debt and liquidity since our last earnings call. First, following the announcement of the New Senior agreement, we raised $300 million in equity at an average gross price of approximately $58.60 per share under our ATM program. The $300 million equity raise together with the $800 million of new equity to be issued to New Senior shareholders for the fixed exchange ratio and $1.2 billion of New Senior debt to be assumed or refinanced constitutes the overall $2.3 billion funding of the New Senior transaction. Second, through August 5, we have received $450 million of disposition proceeds in a receipt of loan receivable. Included in the $450 million received to-date is repayment of two well structured loans in July, part of redemption of $200 million of 9.75% Senior Notes due 2026 and Holiday's repayment of $66 million or 9.4% notes due 2025. Medical office buildings sold in the second quarter also resulted in proceeds of approximately $107 million. Using proceeds from this disposition, in the third quarter Ventas will improve its near term debt maturity profile further by fully repaying a total of $664 million in outstanding 3.25% Senior Notes due August 2022 and 3.13% notes due June 2023. As a result of recovery in senior housing NOI and our capital structure actions, we are seeing strengthening credit metrics. Reported Q2 net EBITDA was better than expectations improving 10 basis points sequentially to seven times. Within that 10 basis point improvement, underlying SHOP annualized EBITDA improved nearly $50 million or 25 basis points beneficial impact of the ratio in just one quarter. This organic improvement was offset by the elimination of SHOP which we experienced in Q2. This provides a proof point of the anticipated material improvement in leverage resulting from the underlying recovery in senior housing over time. Pro forma, for announced ATM issuance and capital activities, Ventas' Q2 net debt to EBITDA went lower from seven times to 6.8 times. I would highlight that the New Senior transaction is expected to be 30 basis point levering on projected New Senior 2020 NOI and is supported by the forecasted growth in cash flows from the New Senior portfolio. Ventas' has ample liquidity totaling $3.3 billion. As of August 5, the company had $2.7 billion of undrawn revolver capacity, $600 million cash and no commercial paper outstanding. Let's finish with our future guidance. Third quarter net income is estimated to range from flat to $0.05 per fully diluted share. Our guidance range for normalized FFO for Q3 is $0.70 to $0.74 per share. The Q3 FFO midpoint of $0.72 can be bridged from Q2 of $0.73 by $0.02 benefit from the Ardent loan prepayment fee in Q3, net of the Ardent HHS grants in Q2, offset by $0.02 from lost interest income on the loan repayments and the July equity raise. NOI reductions from assets intended for dispositions describe the last $0.01. In the third quarter, assumptions underlying our guidance are as follows. SHOP Q3 spot occupancy from June 30 to September 30 is forecasted to increase between 150 to 250 basis points, with the midpoint roughly continuation of occupancy growth trends there in July. Third quarter is expected to be roughly flat sequentially and move-in incentives are expected to narrow in the quarter. Sequential SHOP revenue growth is expected to be offset by increasing operating costs due to an additional day in the quarter, higher occupancy, labor and routine seasonal items including repairs and maintenance and utility costs. No HHS Grants are assumed to be received in the third quarter. Sales performance is expected in the office and triple-net segments. We continue to expect $1 billion in asset sales and loan repayments for the full year 2021 with line of sight for the remaining balance in the second half of this year. Fully diluted share count is now 383 million shares reflecting the equity raise in anticipation of New Senior. Guidance does not include any other announced capital markets activity. Our Q3 guidance excludes any impact from the pending acquisition of New Senior. The New Senior transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2021 and once closed, it is forecast to be between $0.09 to $0.11 accretive to normalized FFO per share in 2022. I would like to underscore that we are still in a highly uncertain environment. Growth trends in SHOP are positive. The pandemic's impact on our business remains very difficult to predict. Ventas is excited about our business in the future and we believe we have the well-diversified portfolio, best-in-class operators and experienced team to win the recovery that is now underway. That concludes our prepared remarks. Before we start with Q&A, we are limiting each caller to two questions to be respectful to everyone on the line. With that I will turn the call back to the operator. Yes. Josh, that was in the initial $1 billion that the $200 million loan repayment, that was in our guidance originally. So no surprises there. And the balance being property real estate dispositions continues to be the assumption, both senior housing and MOBs. But that was in our first guidance. Correct. That is not in $1 billion. That is not assumed. Yes. I will have a go with that one for the third quarter. So you are right to say revenue growth pretty much offset by expense growth. There's a number of different buckets within the expense line, I think, worth highlighting. One is simply an extra day which is meaningful when you think sequentially third quarter versus the second quarter. That has a meaningful impact. The next is, I call it typical seasonal cost increase in the third quarter. Utilities is the easy one. Repairs and maintenance is another. But you see that every third quarter. The third bucket is really a function of occupancy growth and activity levels increasing in the communities. And then obviously you have incremental cost associated with that which is a good thing. And kind of overlaying all of that is, back to this question of short term wage pressure in light of the labor market, which is effectively embedded in the thinking. But there is a series of different buckets that altogether add up to that third quarter expense number. Yes. Nick, I think it's right to say that as occupancy grows you are going to have some level. It's not a perfect linear one-for-one relationship whereby you add occupancy you add a head. It is more of a step-change type function. This always creates a beta as to what level that is. I think, qualitatively, we would tell you we are in that. We are growing labor as we are growing occupancy right now as a consequence of having come out the other side flexing labor, as you say, which should reach a level where then there is some scale advantage, if you like, that you can then hold off until you get to the next level of occupancy. I can't give you a number on that. But we are certainly in that upward trajectory right now."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Justin Hutchens",
            "content": "Thank you Debbie. We remain excited about delivering industry-leading occupancy and NOI growth and we are encouraged about recent trends in the senior housing portfolio. Although we are still in the early stages of the recovery, we are off to a very strong start. Ventas is well-positioned to benefit from significant senior housing tailwinds, including the sector recovery upside, supportive demand fundamentals and continued improvement in leading indicators. I will review three topics today. First, our second quarter performance. Second, our perspective on the senior housing operating environment. And third, our continued execution of our senior housing strategy. I will start by covering our second quarter performance. In SHOP, leading indicators continued to trend favorably and accelerated during the quarter, as leads and move-ins each surpassed 100% of 2019 levels, while move-outs remained steady. June marked the best month for leads and move-ins since the start of the pandemic and July has sustained strong momentum. Strong sales activity has now driven five consecutive months of occupancy growth, inclusive of July. In the second quarter approximate spot occupancy from March 31 to June 30 increased 229 basis points, led by the U.S. with growth of 313 basis points and accelerating leads and move-ins. In Canada, the trends were more muted due to a slower vaccine rollout, but approximate spot occupancy still increased during the second quarter, driven by 33 basis points of growth in June. Leading indicators remained strong in our portfolio as the digital footprint of our operators have significantly expanded over the past year, casting a wider net as traditional high converting lead sources such as personal referrals, respite and professional referrals continue recovery. Turning to SHOP operating results. Same-store revenue in the second quarter increased sequentially by $3.5 million as strong occupancy growth was partially offset by the impact of a new resident move-in incentives on pricing, specifically at Atria. I will touch on that more in a minute. Operating expenses declined sequentially by $9.2 million or 2.3% excluding the impact of HHS grants received in the first quarter, driven by a better than expected reduction of COVID-19 operating costs, partially offset by a modest increase in routine operating expenses. For the sequential same-store pool, SHOP generated approximately $111 million of NOI received in the first quarter, which represents a sequential increase of $12.4 million or 12.6% when excluding the impact of HHS grants. This marks the first quarter of sequential underlying NOI growth since the onset of COVID-19 and approximates a nearly $15 million NOI improvement on an annualized basis. During the quarter, we saw solid contribution to sequential NOI growth in both revenue and operating expenses as average occupancy increased 110 basis points and COVID-19 costs declined substantially and ahead of expectations. Turning to triple-net. Sequential same-store cash NOI was largely stable in the second quarter and 98% of all contractual triple-net rent was received from the company's tenants. Our trailing 12-months cash flow coverage for senior housing, which is reported one quarter in arrears, is 1.2 times and down versus the prior quarter, reflecting the timing associated with coverage reporting which now includes effectively four full quarters of operations impacted by COVID. Moving onto the current operating environment, which is full of green shoots. Our market leading operators continued to demonstrate their strong market position through broad occupancy gains. Sunrise led the way with 627 basis points of spot occupancy growth in the low point in mid-March to the end of July, benefiting from a rejuvenated management team, significantly well-invested communities and a balanced approach demonstrating very strong occupancy gains and pricing power. We would like to congratulate Sunrise's CEO, Jack Callison, for adding experience and depth to his management team with his recently announced hires. Atria, which benefits from a higher absolute occupancy of 81.8% at July end, continues to deliver solid volume growth. Spot occupancy in July increased 529 basis points since the low point in mid-March, resulting from the combination of their industry-leading vaccine mandate and strategic price incentives to capture movements. Atria anticipates tightening incentives moving forward as pricing power recovers and occupancy stabilizes. Supporting all of this is Atria's industry-leading vaccination rates, which are impressively high at nearly a 100% of both residents and employees. Looking ahead, as Debbie mentioned, the third quarter is off to a strong start with July spot occupancy increasing 74 basis points versus June and lease continuing to stand strong at 105% of pre-pandemic levels. Our operators have been prioritizing resident safety and weathering several near term headwinds, including the Delta variant and transitory wage pressures from staffing shortages in select markets. Underpinning our leading operating partner relationships and recent sales momentum is our attractive market footprint, which positions us to benefit from the compelling supply and demand outlook in the senior housing sector. Our communities in the U.S. are poised for improving performance over time due to our strong presence in submarkets that outpace the U.S. national average in aging population growth and wealth demographics, but with significantly lower exposure to new construction starts and construction as a percentage of inventory. Approximately 30% of our SHOP portfolio on a stabilized basis is located in Canada. The senior housing sector in Canada has performed exceptionally well, with occupancy exceeding 90% every year from 2010 to 2020 and demand outpacing new supply in eight of that last 11 years. As a foundation to these attractive fundamentals, the 75-plus population in Canada is projected to grow more than 20% over the next five years, about twice the pace of the U.S. The Ventas team has been busy executing our senior housing strategy, driven by experiential operating expertise and underpinned by our analytical capabilities to further strengthen our senior housing business. The underlying goal of our strategy is simply to execute portfolio actions that ensure we are located in the right markets, with the right operator, with assets with strong local market positioning. A notable example of our strategy execution is the New Senior transaction. New Senior has a track record of strong operating performance, benefits from a geographically diverse footprint with favorable exposure to compelling market fundamentals and demographics and represents a well invested high quality portfolio catering to an attractive market segment. The acquisition also represents an excellent opportunity to further expand our relationships with two long-standing operators in Holiday Retirement and Atria Senior Living and with new relationships such as Hawthorn Senior Living. New Senior will strengthen our existing senior housing business from several strategic perspectives. Operationally, New Senior will enhance Ventas' cash flow generation profile. Its margin has remained resilient in the 35%-plus range during the COVID-19 and occupancy has weathered the pandemic headwinds of approximately 80 basis points better than the NIC industry average. Most recently, New Senior has seen strong sales trends as we progressed through the early stages of the senior housing recovery with powerful upside as the portfolio occupancy grew 100 basis points in June. Geographically, New Senior has a diverse presence across 36 states, which includes exposure to markets with high home values and high household income levels, ideal proximity to premium retail in high visibility locations and favorable supply outlooks versus industry averages. This transaction is a reflection of our focus on adding high-quality assets to our senior housing platform and maintaining balance across independent living and assisted living product types. We see New Senior's independent living assets as complementary to our existing high-end major market portfolio as it provides a lower average resident age and longer length of stay at an accessible price point, with RevPOR of approximately $2,700. The purpose-built nature of these communities, which include consistent layout with 120 units per building also will strengthen our ability to effectively and efficiently redevelop and invest in these assets over time. Moving on to new developments. We continue to drive value from our development pipeline through our relationship with Le Groupe Maurice, where we have opened three communities, with more than 1,000 units over the past year. Two of the three developments were delivered in the fourth quarter of 2020. Both projects had substantial pre-leasing activity and have already stabilized at approximately 95% occupancy. The third project, a 287-unit expansion of an existing Le Groupe Maurice community in Montreal, was delivered in June of this year. Initial leasing activity has been strong with more than half of the new units occupied as of the end of July. Our plans across our broader SHOP portfolio includes significant deployment of refresh and redevelopment capital, strengthening our market leading position, where we expect to realize occupancy growth and pricing upside over the next few years. We continue to actively manage our portfolio with the disposition of non-strategic assets and the transition of operators in select markets to position our senior housing business for long term success. In summary, our recovery is off to a strong start. We are well-positioned in markets that benefit from outsized aging and wealth demographic, with rapid portfolio [indiscernible] we are executing our senior housing strategy to help ensure success in the near and long term. I will now hand over to Pete. Hi. Nice to talk to you. Let me start with the year-over-year kind of comment you made. So if you were to look at our year-over-year RevPOR and you exclude Atria, which as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, had some discounting. I will come back to that and exclude LGM which performed really well in this past year but they operate at a lower price point in an active living product in Canada. So there's a mix shift impact from LGM. So if you were to take those two out, our RevPOR would have increased 1.8%. So take LGM aside and let's get back to Atria. You might remember that Atria, starting back during the pandemic had positioned themselves to go for volume in a few different ways. Very early on, they were the first to execute testing broadly. As they moved throughout the pandemic, they saw an opportunity for volume ahead of the worst part of the pandemic, which was emerging in the fall and into the winter. So they offered price incentives. And if you were to look at Atria's occupancy growth, if you go move further back from the low point and start back for instance December 31, they have grown 372 basis points versus the rest of our SHOP in total to be like 227 basis points. And so they are an absolute bonafide leader in driving occupancy volume. They chose to stay with the discounting into recent months. We have noticed in underlying trends that they are starting to tighten. They also have a higher absolute occupancy than the rest of our portfolio and a lot of operators in the sector. So we believe that they are well-positioned to start to push pricing in the markets where they are seeing stabilization. That's their intent. They started to do it. They will continue to do it. They have a long track record of driving both occupancy and price. And we are in the very early stages of this recovery. So we are comfortable and confident that then over time they will deliver. One other point and that is that we have Sunrise Senior Living in our portfolio. Sunrise has a 9,000 RevPOR. They are sitting at 72% occupied. They have been driving a lot of occupancy growth as well. And the mix shift that I mentioned that kind of went the other way with LGM outperforming will shift the other way and Sunrise starts to grow. So I think our RevPOR outlook will be fine in the long term. Yes. So it's Justin. There is a little bit of catch-up in terms of supply from last year that we are experiencing in the short term. It's a bump in the road but starts and deliveries are very low and so there is a window that we can look out. We think a few years of runway to really have strong absorption in the sector. Certainly, capital will follow the fundamentals. We expect to see development chase this sector. But when they do, they will be faced with the strongest aging demographic that the sector has ever faced. So we are certainly bullish and confident on the demand for senior housing. Yes. Hi, it's Justin. So even throughout the second quarter, we could see underlying tightening, particularly in asking rents. Operators tend to use short term incentives first and foremost. And we think those will persist as asking rents tighten. Clearly, the demand is really strong for independent assisted living. If that continues, I would expect pricing power to return and particularly as communities and markets reach pre-pandemic occupancy. So we think there is plenty of potential ahead to drive pricing. Of course, as Debbie mentioned that it may not be a straight line as we face this next phase of the recovery. Yes. So it's completely different market moving forward than it was then. That would have been really the beginning of facing new supply and there was still some pricing power persisted during that time with the outlook moving ahead given the demographic backdrop and the new supply backdrop that we are facing. It certainly supports occupancy growth and pricing power. Thanks. So first and foremost, we just wanted to make sure, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks and I like to say this a lot, that we are in the right markets with the right asset and the right operator managing that asset. So that might be memory care, assisted living or independent living, really all the product sites have good characteristics. The assisted living and memory care are more need-driven. You have higher price points. They also do run at tighter cost. And so depending on the RevPOR associated with the products, your margins can vary. But it's a product that does tend to recover quickly. It did after the financial crisis, doing really well after the pandemic so far. So it's great to have exposure as long as you are in the right markets with the right operator to that product. Independent living has a longer length of stay. It also has less new competition facing it. In the case of New Senior, there is extreme affordability relative to an AL product. It's about at least twice as good in terms of, if you are a resident making a choice within your local market for a New Senior independent living versus for AL. So it reaches a broader audience. It also has pricing upside through investments and faces the same strong demographic wave that are subscribing earlier. One other thing about independent living because it faces less new competition, it does have a higher ceiling. Pre-pandemic it was outpacing AL and memory care by about 400 basis points. We don't see any reason why coming out the other side that it doesn't also have higher ceiling moving forward. Yes. So this is Justin again. This is a product type that I mentioned that has great characteristics. There are 120 units, large units. If you have been to a holiday community, you have kind of been to all of them because they are exactly the same. Big open floor plan when you walk in. Open dining. There's three stories. And so it lends itself well to redevelopment or refresh investment. And we are happy to be situated in several markets that are great locations or high traffic locations or located close to premium retail. They have strong incoming wealth and aging demographics. So a lot of cases, we think we are pushing out open the door to make additional investments. And the goal, on a targeted basis, is to make investment, support the occupancy growth but also push pricing. So we are in the process of evaluating those opportunities and we will integrate that into our plans over the next couple of few years. Sure. So I will start with the flow-through and maybe just kind of refer to it as margin. One thing that's interesting, you can kind of see in the supplemental you will catch this, our operating margin, even on a much lower occupancy right now, is only like a 150 or 200 basis points off of the margin from a year ago on a much higher occupancy. And so margin is kind of hanging in there. We think if you fast forward and get the portfolio back to pre-pandemic occupancy, we think you are very, very close potentially to within 100, 200 basis points of the pre-pandemic margin plus there should be some pricing power plus there should be some more occupancy upside than we were seeing at that time. So we feel good about the flow-through and it's going to be, we are in this period where Atria has one of our best performing operators as I mentioned in terms of occupancy, but they have another 700 basis points to go to get back to where they were pre-pandemic. And during this kind of next wave of occupancy fill that we expect to see the flow-through really increase and margin grow as well. And then the second part of your question is view of the Delta. Yes. Sure. So there's really kind of two things happening. One is the digital footprint that is expanding and then the other is the traditional leads coming back. So referral agencies and Internet-based leads are way over 100%, 150%, 160% of pre-pandemic levels. And so they have played a huge role in driving leads. That's maybe a silver lining that came from the pandemic where it forced operators to invest into that source of referrals and it's a game changer, really. And so we have seen most leads tick up. Now those do convert at a lower rate though, but the more the merrier. So in addition to that, there's three other lead sources. There is respite, professional referrals and personal referrals. Personal referrals in the second quarter for us, we are at 110% of pre-pandemic levels. So those have come roaring back. Professional still down around 74%to 75%. And respite just under that. So there is still a ways to go yet with professional and the respite of to recover which we think is encouraging because the lead levels have been quite strong. Yes. I would, I would kind of stretch out your timing a little further. As Bob mentioned, there is going to be kind of you will have periods we have revenue increase and a little bit of expense catch up. Debbie mentioned that the near term out as a transitory effect as well. So if you kind of push out the timetable away and we don't really have the crystal ball in terms of when we stabilize. But I was thinking more on a stabilized basis. We get there to that pre-pandemic occupancy margins should be within reach of where they were and then from there the pricing power and the occupancy upside for even higher margins over time. So that's all I was saying. And I didn't really mean to kind of pin it as kind of a near term picture, except to say that our margins in Q2 were only like 150, 200 basis points off of the year ago. I was just trying to say things to kind of support that. So right, as we currently sit, we only have just around or just about 20% of our communities that are at the pre-pandemic occupancy. Over 60% are achieving pre-pandemic move-in levels. So we have great activity. And we are really pleased with this early recovery. But we have a long way to go and so far really good support for it. But there is still a ways to go yet."

            "content": "Thanks Justin. I will cover the office and healthcare triple-net segments. Together, these segments represent over 50% of Ventas' NOI. We continue to produce positive and reliable results. Within these segments, we are seeing a changing business climate. Health system and university business confidence is rising, leading to longer term commitments and strategic growth investments. During the pandemic, we kept our business confidence. We remain focused on growth and we continued to invest in incremental leasing resources and in creating a leasing center of excellence, led by an industry veteran. She is now two years in. We have built a technical engineering team to assist our local property teams in running our buildings more efficiently, also led by an industry veteran. He is now 18 months in. We doubled our capital invested in our MOBs to ensure their competitiveness, including major redevelopments in Phoenix, Atlanta and Austin, Texas. We expanded our tenant satisfaction programs under the leadership of our new property management leader. He is also 18 months in. Because of this focus, I am proud to say that our MOBs now rank in the top quartile of tenant overall satisfaction as surveyed by Kingsley, the national real estate survey leader. Happy tenants equals higher occupancy. Our focus on the fundamentals and growth is showing results. Let me describe them now. Office, which includes our medical office and research and innovation segments performed well, delivering 10.5% sequential same-store growth. Office quarterly same-store growth was 12.6% year-on-year. The R&I portfolio benefited from a $12 million termination fee from a large tenant in the Winston-Salem innovation center, anchored by Wake Forest. Adjusted for the termination fee, office sequential same-store growth was 90 basis points and 2.8% for year-on-year same-store quarterly growth, a strong quarter. Medical office same-store sequential growth was 80 basis points and year-on-year quarterly same-store growth was 2.4%. For the quarter, we executed 230,000 square feet in office new leasing and 460,000 square feet year-to-date, a 78% improvement from prior year. Medical office had strong same-store retention of 94% for the quarter and 85% for the trailing 12-months. The result is that total MOB occupancy increased 20 basis points sequentially. Total office leasing was 750,000 square feet for the quarter and 1.8 million square feet year-to-date. We are also pleased that our annual escalators for the new MOB leases averaged 2.9% for the quarter, which caused MOB same-store portfolio annual rent escalators to increase from 2.4% to 2.6%. Our R&I business continued to excel as it strives to provide effective facilities to support the record level of investment into life sciences research. Same-store sequential growth was 38.9%. Adjusted for the termination fee, same-store sequential growth was 1.1%. Year-on-year quarterly same-store growth was 42.6%. Adjusted for the termination fee, year-on-year quarterly same-store growth was a strong 3.9%. Quarterly same-store occupancy was now standing 94% with sequential occupancy increasing by 10 basis points. Looking forward, we have three R&I buildings comprising of 1.2 million square feet of space under construction. Collectively, they are 78% leased or committed. Of the two buildings in our uCity Complex at Philadelphia, the Drexel building is 100% leased, while one uCity Square is over 55% leased or committed. We are oversubscribed for the remaining space with 11 above pro forma proposals currently outstanding. In Pittsburgh, our new building is 70% pre-leased. University of Pittsburgh and UPMC was significant activity on the remaining space. At our recently opened project with Arizona State University in Phoenix, we are 86% leased or committed and expect to be 100% leased shortly. These performance numbers reflect the quality of our well located R&I assets. Now let's turn to healthcare triple-net. During the second quarter, our healthcare triple-net assets showed continued strength and reliability with 100% rent collections. Second quarter same-store cash NOI growth was 2.5% year-on-year. Trailing 12-month EBITDARM cash flow coverage through June 30 was strong across the portfolio. Health systems trailing 12-month coverage was an excellent 3.6 times in the first quarter, a 10 basis point sequential improvement. As Debbie mentioned, Ardent continues to perform extremely well in this dynamic market. IRF and LTAC coverage improved 20 basis points to 1.9 times in the first quarter, buoyed by strong business results. Although skilled nursing declined 10 basis points to 1.8 times as the pandemic continued to impact centers, total post-acute coverage increased sequentially by 20 basis points to 1.9 times in the first quarter of 2021. Finally, several of our partners have an approach for M&A opportunities. Kindred is expected to merge with LifePoint and Spire recently entertained multiple offers by Ramsay. It is a testament to the underlying value of our healthcare operators and the associated real estate. With that, I will turn the call over to Bob. Sure. I will start on that, Nick. So this, in terms of the numbers, the outlook is 150 to 250 spot occupancy gains. You are right to say 74 in the first month. So at the time that is above the midpoint. And you are right to say it's not a straight line. I mean clearly the pandemic backdrop is something we are thinking about, no doubt about it as you think about occupancy. And it's never month-to-month if you look at it, take one month times three. That said, the strength in leads in July is worth noting as well. In light of that, what translates into move-ins in the future. So we are still seeing very positive trend now five consecutive months of occupancy and strong leads. But with a backdrop of caution is the right way to think about it."

            "name": "Debra A. Cafaro",
            "content": "Sarah, well done. Your first public company merger. Congratulations. Well, good morning everyone. I want to welcome our shareholders and other participants to the Ventas second quarter 2021 earnings call. Ventas delivered an outstanding second quarter and we have strong momentum across the board, in health and safety, capital deployment and access, realization of the benefits of prior successful investments, financial strength and most importantly in portfolio growth led by our high quality SHOP business with significant contributions from office and stability in our triple-net lease business. We see a clear path to growth in our demographically driven diversified enterprise through capturing the embedded upside in our senior housing business, the benefit of external investments, reliable cash flow from our office and triple-net businesses and delivery and stabilization of ongoing developments, primarily in the life sciences, research and innovation and Canadian senior housing areas. Our experienced team is committed to winning the recovery for all of our stakeholders. Let me first turn to our second quarter results. We posted $0.73 of normalized FFO per share, which is above the high-end of our previously provided guidance. I am delighted that our same-store property portfolio grew 3.6% sequentially. Our outperformance was driven by SHOP, which produced a $111 million in quarterly NOI, a recovery of $50 million of annualized NOI, representing industry-leading growth in same-store cash NOI and occupancy. July continued these positive SHOP trends for the fifth consecutive month of occupancy growth. Importantly, by the end of July, lease reached their highest levels since the pandemic began. Justin will unpack these trends more fully in his remarks. As a result, we have never been more confident that the senior living business is supported by powerful demand that is growing and resilient, while supply remains constrained. If the last 18 months have taught us anything, it is that as soon as our communities and care providers are ready to welcome residents and their families, we experienced a surge of leads and move-ins almost immediately, which then build sustainably and rapidly. That said, given the macro uncertainty in the COVID-19 environment, particularly the national and regional rise in cases and the measures that have been taken or may be taken to contain COVID spread. The path to full recovery may not be a straight line, but we believe that will point inexorably upward. In our third quarter outlook, we have assumed the increase in COVID cases throughout the U.S. may have some impact on the velocity of leasing and expenses. Rounding out our portfolio performance, office grew nicely in the quarter and our triple-net portfolio continued its stability. Pete's efforts to increase leasing, keep high retention rates, improved customer relationships and grow NOI are showing results. Our on-campus and affiliated MLP strategy with leading health system continues to shine. Turning to health systems, our investment in Ardent also continues to deliver benefit. In addition to strong cash flow coverage on our $1.3 billion leasehold position, our 10% equity stake in the Ardent enterprise is benefiting from excellent Ardent results and our prior purchase of $200 million of Ardent senior notes recently paid off with a $15 million prepayment fee, providing us with a 13% unlevered return on our investment in the Ardent notes. When all is said and done, I believe and hope that our Ardent investment in real estate, equity and debt will prove to be one of our best risk adjusted return investments. Turning to other capital allocation priorities, we certainly are on our front foot regarding external investments. In total, in 2021 we have over $3.5 billion in investments completed, pending or underway with another $1 billion life science, research and innovation pipeline with our exclusive development partner Wexford, right behind that. Our team is also busy evaluating attractive deals across our asset classes. This year-to-date, we have already reviewed about as many investment opportunities as we saw in all of 2019. We will pursue those that meet our multi-factor investment philosophy, which is focused on growing reliable cash flow and favorable risk adjusted returns, taking into account factors such as cost per square foot or unit, downside protection and ultimate potential for cash flow growth and asset appreciation. Our $2.3 billion pending investment in New Senior, announced in the second quarter, is a great example. In this deal, we are acquiring over a 100 high-quality independent living communities that are well-invested and located in advantaged markets at compelling pricing. The per unit cost is estimated to be 20% to 30% below replacement cost. The 5% cash going in cap rate is expected to grow to a 6% cap rate on expected 2022 NOI with upside as the senior housing recovery continues. And the FFO multiple of less than 12 times post synergize 2022 estimated FFO are all attractive valuation metrics. I commend Susan Givens and her team for doing a tremendous job creating and realizing value for their stakeholders. We are also confident that Ventas shareholders will receive immediate and long term accretion and upside from the deal as senior housing recovers and the large middle market demographic expands significantly in the near term. As Justin will describe, the New Senior portfolio also fits in with our senior housing strategy and framework. New Senior also performed well in Q2 and into July, with occupancy increasing in the same-store portfolio for five straight months. A unique strategic advantage of the New Senior transaction is the long-standing relationship we have with the principal managers of the portfolio, Atria and Holiday, two leading operators who recently combined to form the second largest senior housing manager. As a one-third owner of Atria, we are excited about the opportunities the combination creates. we will directly benefit from growth in Atria's management platform. And we welcome the combination of Atria and Holiday's talent in Atria's advanced enterprise. Congratulations to Atria for pulling together this industry changing transaction. Switching to our attractive life science, research and innovation business. It continues to provide us with value-creating opportunities to invest capital. The Ventas life science portfolio now exceeds nine million square feet. It's located in three of the top five cluster markets, includes three ongoing development projects and is affiliated with over 16 of the nation's top research universities. We also have an incremental $1 billion in potential projects we are working on with Wexford. The first and largest new life science project in the pipeline, totaling about $0.5 billion in costs, is gaining steam. Expected to be 60% pre-leased to a major public research university that ranks in the top 5% of NIH funding, this project will be located on the West Coast and should break ground in the first half of 2022. Wexford with its exceptional reputation among universities is also exploring significant additional life science potential projects beyond those in our existing pipeline. North of the border, we continue to invest capital in high-end large-scale independent living communities with our partner, Le Groupe Maurice in Quebec. We have always tried to create value through both internal and external growth and we are pleased that we have returned to being a net acquirer in 2021. Our team is active and engaged beyond our announced deals and our pipeline of potential investments across asset classes. To fund new investments, we have access to significant liquidity and a wide array of capital sources, including the asset dispositions and receipt of loan repayments, as Bob will describe in greater detail. The demand for senior housing has been robust and sustainable, proving out the value proposition of communities and care providers offered to seniors in their families. The sharp recovery has begun and we have started capturing the significant upside embedded in our existing senior housing portfolio from both pandemic recovery and the 17.5% growth in the senior population projected over the next few years. Our diversified business model continues to provide uplift and stability to our enterprise. We are investing nearly $4 billion in announced deals and development projects and our access to and pricing of capital are positive. In closing, the U.S. is in the midst of an impressive economic recovery that, together with demographic demand for all our asset classes, will benefit our business. We embrace the opportunity to take on any near term challenges that are temporarily caused by the strength and speed of this recovery, especially because now, unlike last year and the beginning of 2021, our employees, residents, tenants and caregivers are largely safe and healthy. As a team at Ventas, we are incredibly pleased about the results we have delivered and the strength and momentum we have demonstrated. Justin, over to you. Good morning. That's a great question. We are excited about this business that is going to continue to grow and Wexford has a lot of opportunities. But I would say is, the answer will be some and some. There are some pre-identified projects that are in the pipeline that would do in joint ventures. And they are carefully selected to make sure we have a coherent strategy around the joint venture. And there are others that Wexford is working on that may go on balance sheet depending on, again, the risk-reward profile. So I think we will have a lot of benefits from this business initiative going forward, both on balance sheet and with our joint venture strategy. Thank you. Well, good morning. Thanks for the question. No, Ardent has been a great investment in many different ways. Great risk adjusted return, great performance and I think even better days ahead. I would say that if we were able to find additional assets in the health system space that have the characteristics that we like about Ardent, we certainly would commit additional capital there. And those characteristics really are around growing market, position in local markets, being one of the leaders, having pricing power with commercial payers and those types of characteristics, obviously population growth and so on and good strong experienced care providers. So we continue to explore opportunities in this space and if we can find anything even close to as good as Ardent, I think we would be happy to commit additional capital there. Correct. That is correct. You got it. Thank you. And different operators will clearly pursue different strategies. And we support and work with them on their strategies and we should see the benefit from that going forward. Yes. I mean, Michael you are reminding me of the very good times and thank you for doing that where occupancies were in the low to mid 90s and RevPOR was growing considerably. And so as Justin said, with the demographic growth and we have this window where the supply is baked over a multiyear period and that's going to be baked at low levels, that is a very constructive backdrop for getting back to very positive outcomes, RevPOR growth, occupancy growth, et cetera. That's why we went ahead, for sure. Good morning. Great. And Justin will answer that. Thank you. I mean with the New Senior pro forma, I think we are going to be over 50%, including Canada in the IL products which we really like and it's a less labor intensive model, for example. But we do like the diversification in our enterprise and we also like it within our senior housing portfolio. So I will ask Justin really to describe this strategy and framework that we are thinking about as we build the portfolio with Justin's kind of imprint upon it. Thank you. Good morning. Yes. Well, we have definitely put our money where mouth is in terms of the New Senior investment of $2.3 billion and well invested well located senior living. We are excited about that. That will increase our percentage NOI coming from the senior living area and will enable us not only to capture embedded upside in the Ventas portfolio in senior housing but also New Senior. So that's great and we will continue to invest where we think there is good risk adjusted return and upside in the senior living business. We do believe, as you know, in a diversified model and we will continue to invest in other areas of our business that have performed exceedingly well for us and have really proven their value over the last year, because the benefit of diversification really is that, you never know really what the external market and environment are going to throw at you. And these different asset classes are unified by demographic demand that they perform differently in different environments. And we have gotten the benefit of that so much so in the medical office area, the life science area, the hospital area over the last year that we remain of a belief that that is the best profile to deliver the kind of value proposition we want to deliver to our shareholders. Thank you. Right. I mean, right now it's kind of business as usual. But as I mentioned in my remarks and you clearly understand, there is fluidity and the environment is very dynamic. And so we want to be prudent in our thought process about the third quarter. But right now the communities are all open for new move-ins and visitation and we hope that that continues because the communities are so highly vaccinated and protected. And that is the comfort and the happiness frankly that we have sitting here today that we feel really good about. Exactly. Thank you. Well, we are making good progress. We have a line of sight to, as Bob said, to the balance of the investments which are composed of medical office and senior housing. And because the outlook for senior housing is very favorable, there is significant interest in the asset class. And we think pricing will be in line with our expectations. They are absolutely de minimis because this is a historical one, frankly, that we got from NHP that is going back to PMB. So this is a long-standing one. We did recognize a very significant gain on the sale which was $30 million or $40 million, I can't remember, on $100 million deal. So that was good. But we have very, very limited purchase options for tenants. Thanks Lukas. I think the latter. As you know from the Colony call they have moved that portfolio to intended for disposition of the real estate portfolio that is encumbered by our loan and the loan continues to perform well. And my guess would be that and it's only a guess, is that buyer of the real estate portfolio would likely assume the existing capital stack. Yes. It is supported by the pool portfolio, definitely. And you know it's a very well structured loan. And we always feel good when our loans get repaid even though we have to recycle the capital. But it proves the merits of the investment, if you will. So we are open-minded. I think either way could be favorable for Ventas. Yes. I mean whenever there is activity there can be opportunity. And we look forward to exploring those kinds of things. We have had a good relationship with Kindred for 22 years and we have done lots of really constructive things together and I would hope that that will continue. Thank you. Well, that's a great question. It's clearly from someone who has been around the industry for a long time. As we said, as a third owner of Atria, we do like the combination of the talent, the IL and the AL capabilities coming together on a very advanced platform that Atria has to become the second largest operator. So that can really yield some benefits, I would say, with the data, analytics and technology capabilities and the talent all coming together. So it's more about that than it is about the scale, I would say. There also can be benefits from smaller operators. Justin mentioned, we are going to have some, a new relationship with Hawthorne and those were, as you know, the original Holiday guys, if you will. And I think there are some strong benefits that those local operators can provide as well. So we look forward to having those relationships and building them out as appropriate. Right. Well, I mean again I think we, as a country and we Ventas with our strong second quarter, have a really of what I would call, my mother would call really, a high-class problem. And that is that our economy is recovering and demand is recovering in such a speedy and robust way that both the labor market and the supply chain are having trouble kind of keeping up with it. And that is an environment that we feel very comfortable kind of managing through to the other side, because when you step back, it's really all about that demand, the demographics, building that occupancy and pricing power and capturing that embedded upside in both Ventas senior housing as well as now New Senior. So we would rather have this environment than many others and I think we can successfully really manage through it because of the demand that is right in front of us. Right. And to the specific question, I mean our communities are able to take residents. There hasn't been any capacity constraint to-date on our ability to accept occupancy. Thank you. Thank you. Yes. I mean, some of it is really related to this mismatch that I discussed in terms of shifting gears in the economy and that should be transitory. Thank you. Yes. Well, this is Debbie. You know again in July, well, first of all, we are really happy that leads in July are the highest they have been since beginning of the pandemic. That is a very important and meaningful statistic. And certainly portends to me, it means there's demand and it portends higher occupancy. So that is really good, as you say. In July, as we have talked about, we had spot-to-spot growth of about 75 basis points. And you know there is a lot of uncertainty in the environment. So if you just rolled that forward, that's near the midpoint of the 150 to 250. And that's how our guidance is constructed. Yes, I mean the pace and slope of the recovery and the clinical environment broadly in the U.S. is really going to determine how quickly we get back to that pre-pandemic occupancy levels. We are on a good path. I think it's very sustainable. It has been so far. And we are very encouraged by that as well as the demographic growth that's right in front of us. I think Justin mentioned Atria had about, what, 700 basis points of occupancy to continue to get back to pre-pandemic levels. And again, it's really going to depend upon this, we were predicting the third quarter, we have visibility and line of sight to that. And thereafter I think we want to be conscious that it continues to be a pretty dynamic environment. So we are encouraged and I hope you are right about many of the things that you said, Vikram. Love the question. Thank you. Again we do believe that we have created a lot of value with our MOB portfolio as you point out. We have a differentiated strategy with our Lillibridge management platform that Pete runs and that's going really well. We have mentioned, that is part of the $1 billion of 2021 capital recycling that is MOBs and senior housing. So you are right on there, I do think that we have benefited from the stability of the cash flows at the MOBs with our strategy of being on campus and affiliated. And I think you are right that it has very low cap rate, but it also provides a really good differentiated and diversifying aspect to our overall cash flow stream. And so we like that. So we will trim here and there. We will recycle capital. We will take advantage of some of the value that we have created. But we really believe that owning the MOB business as we do is a benefit to our shareholders. Thank you. It might be you. You are welcome. Yes. Rich, thank you for asking that because that has always been something that is near and dear to my heart. And there is always this tension, as you mentioned, between really putting your assets with the right operator, the right markets and certainly the best operators. And Atria has been that. Holiday has been a leading operator. So there is a tension between that and making sure you don't put all your eggs in one basket and you manage your concentration wisely. And so we do think that the combination of Atria and Holiday provides the strategic benefits to us as an owner of Atria. And we like that. We like the growth in Atria's platform. That having been said, I think we do have a lot of flexibility in the New Senior management contracts and our own Holiday contracts that gives us the ability through both growth and the way the management contracts are structured to move in the right direction on the diversification of manager point. So we have all the tools we need to manage it in the right way. I mean, it will change over time and with specific situations. But that seems directionally you know the right kind of way to think about it. Thank you. Well, thank you all for sticking with us and for your interest in Ventas. We really appreciate it. We are so delighted with a great quarter of health and safety and results and we look forward to seeing you all in person soon. Thank you again."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Sarah Whitford, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nSarah Whitford: Good morning, and welcome to the Ventas first quarter financial results conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued our first quarter earnings release, supplemental and investor presentation. These materials are available on the Ventas website at ir.ventasreit.com. As a reminder, remarks made today may include forward-looking statements, including certain expectations related to COVID-19 and other matters. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, all of which are available on the Ventas website. Certain non-GAAP financial measures will also be discussed on this call. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to our supplemental posted on the Investor Relations section of our website. I will now turn the call over to Debra A. Cafaro, Chairman and CEO.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Thank you, Sarah. And good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants, and welcome to the Ventas first quarter 2021 earnings call. Let me start by saying that we believe the macro environment and the Ventas outlook have turned an important corner and that the worst of the pandemic is behind us. You have no idea how good it feels to say those words, even though we recognize that significant uncertainty remains. The whole Ventas team is actively engaged in taking steps to win the recovery for our stakeholders. These steps include making smart portfolio and capital allocation decisions, capturing the embedded upside in our high-quality senior housing portfolio, focusing on operational excellence and initiatives, investing in value-creating development and acquisition opportunities across our demographically-driven asset classes, attracting diverse, attractive capital, and maintaining financial strength and flexibility. I also think it\u2019s important to reiterate our gratitude and optimism. The widespread administration and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines have dramatically benefited the health and wellbeing of our senior residents and their caregivers, and also laid the foundation for sustained economic recovery. Let me first address senior housing trends and results. With respect to health and safety, I\u2019m thrilled to report that our confirmed new resident cases in SHOP have fallen to literally a single person per day out of a resident population of 40,000. And all our communities are now open to new move-ins and most have reintroduced expanded visitation and communal activities. As a result, the natural, resilient and demographically-based demand for senior living has revised, and we\u2019ve reached the cyclical pandemic occupancy bottom in our SHOP portfolio in mid-March. Since then, led by our U.S. SHOP community, which posted 280 basis points of growth, we grew SHOP spot occupancy 190 basis points through April 30th to nearly 78%. Our Canadian SHOP portfolio, which has maintained occupancy of over 91%, tempered the full SHOP occupancy growth because Canadian clinical conditions and regulatory measures are currently lagging those in the U.S. We do expect those to catch up over time. Notably, for the whole portfolio, March and April were the first two consecutive months when SHOP move-ins exceeded both, pre-pandemic move-in levels and move-outs since the start of the pandemic. In fact, move-ins during April at 1,880 totaled more move-ins in a single month than we\u2019ve experienced at any time since June 2019. While many of these positive trends began in the first quarter and therefore did not fully benefit first quarter results, we are also pleased with those results. Our first quarter normalized FFO per share and SHOP performance came in ahead of our expectations. And our SHOP occupancy gains were at or above those reported by other market participants to date. The resilient and robust demand we are seeing for senior housing once again validates the need-based nature of our communities and the crucial role care providers play in facilitating longer, healthier lives for this portion of the nation\u2019s population, which is set to grow by over 2 million individuals over just the next few years. Supply trends in senior housing are also highly favorable. This combination of growing demographic demand and constrained supply creates a favorable backdrop for senior housing recovery, which represents an incredibly significant value-creation opportunity for our shareholders. The high quality of our senior housing portfolio, as Justin will describe, makes us well-positioned to recapture NOI and realize this upside. Turning to our capital allocation approach, we are confident of our ability to recycle about $1 billion through property dispositions in the second half of this year, and those are expected to enhance our enterprise. On the investment side, our attractive life science, research and innovation business continues to provide us with value-creating opportunities to invest capital. The Ventas portfolio, which now exceeds 9 million square feet, is located in three of the top five cluster markets and is affiliated with over 15 of the nation\u2019s top research universities. We are also investing in our active and just delivered ground-up developments in life science, research and innovation, which totaled nearly $1 billion in project costs. And I\u2019m pleased to report that we also have another $1 billion in potential projects affiliated with major universities, right behind the four developments currently underway. We look forward to sharing more information on our exciting development pipeline with you, later this year. We recently expanded our life sciences business through our investment in a Class A portfolio of life science assets anchored by Johns Hopkins Medical, which we purchased at an attractive valuation of $600 per square foot. Located in the fourth largest life science cluster in the U.S., Hopkins is a global leader in research and medicine and the number one recipient of government research funding. This acquisition leverages our unique expertise at the intersection of universities, life sciences and academic medicine. In addition, we continue to invest capital in senior housing with our partner, Le Groupe Maurice in Quebec. LGM maintains a first-class brand, product and financial model for success. Our two most recently completed high-end communities with LGM opened in the fourth quarter and have already achieved 87% occupancy. We have three additional developments underway with LGM, representing nearly $300 million in aggregate project costs. Looking at the broader investment market, deal volume is again trending toward normalized levels. In a typical year, our deal team reviews over $30 billion in investment opportunities. Our pipeline of potential investments across our asset classes is active and growing, and we are on our front foot from an external growth standpoint. We have access to significant liquidity and a wide array of capital sources to fund deals. Our investment philosophy continues to be focused on growing reliable cash flow and favorable risk-adjusted return, taking into account factors such as market position and trajectory of the asset and business, cost per square footer unit, downside protection and ultimate potential for cash flow growth and asset appreciation. In closing, we believe we\u2019ve turned an important corner. And key metrics in our business are showing meaningful improvement. The positive investment thesis for all of our demographically driven asset classes and for Ventas is pointing firmly positive. As a team at Ventas, we\u2019re really happy about the strength and stability we\u2019ve shown and the recent upswing in economic, clinical and operating environment. We have an abiding commitment to win the recovery for all our stakeholders, and we are confident we\u2019re taking the right steps to do so. Thank you. Now to Justin.\nJustin Hutchens: Thank you, Debbie. I am very excited that senior housing recovery is underway. As we\u2019ve mentioned before, the lifestyle offering in our communities will be a leading indicator of performance. Now that vaccines have been executed, activities are picking up again, communal dining is coming back and all of our communities are open to visitation from relatives, the underlying demand for our services should continue to strengthen. As we have visited communities recently, the enthusiasm expressed by residents, their relatives and employees is compelling as communities are literally coming back to life again. As Debbie noted, we are pleased with the improvement in leading indicators in occupancy as our move-in and move-out performance in March and April resulted in 266 and 363 net move-ins, respectively. We expect occupancy improvements benefiting from a return to 2019 move-in levels, while at the same time, move-outs to be lower than 2019 levels due to lower current occupancy levels. If we use the move-out rate as a percentage of the resident population from 2019 and apply that percentage to the current lower resident occupancy, the outcome is lower move-outs than pre-pandemic levels. That, in combination with a 2019 move-in run rate, results in projected net positive occupancy gains. I refer to this as the \"turn the lights on\" scenario, where we simply get the structural benefit from this netting effect. Having said that, March and April, both performed well above this baseline, as we started to see a resurgence of high-converting lead sources, which include respites and personal referrals. As these lead sources and professional referrals continue to recover, we could see move-in rates grow. Moving on to macro drivers. We remain optimistic on our long-term supply and demand outlook. Construction starts continued to decelerate in the first quarter to the lowest level since the first quarter of 2011, and were down 77% from the peak in the fourth quarter of 2017. Fewer starts should translate into materially lower deliveries in 2022 and 2023. In addition, we expect strong demographic tailwinds to provide support for occupancy growth. The 80-plus population is expected to grow 17% over the next five years, more than double the rate witnessed during the five-year recovery following the financial crisis. I\u2019ll comment on our SHOP portfolio. When I joined Ventas just over a year ago, one of my first priorities was to assess the overall quality of our portfolio. Now that we are traveling again and visiting communities, I\u2019m pleased to verify we benefit from a well-invested, highly diversified portfolio of market-leading senior housing communities with service offerings that range from an active adult, independent living, social assisted living, and assisted living and memory care. We are well located in high-barrier markets that have substantial income and wealth demographics to support our offering. Our three primary operators, Le Groupe Maurice, Sunrise and Atria, are each uniquely positioned to be competitive within their respective markets. Collectively, they account for 90% of our SHOP NOI on a stabilized basis. With these attributes of a high-quality portfolio in mind, moving forward, we are actively reviewing opportunities to optimize our portfolio through pruning, strategic CapEx investment, transitioning communities, new developments and pursuing new acquisitions to maintain our strong market position in senior housing. Moving on to triple-net senior housing. Given the proactive measures taken last year where we addressed a substantial portion of our portfolio and additionally paired with government subsidies and other tenant resources, our tenants continue to pay, as expected, in the first quarter and through April. Ventas received all of its expected triple-net senior housing cash rent. Our trailing 12 cash flow coverage for senior housing, which is reported one quarter in arrears, is 1.3 times and stable versus the prior quarter. I\u2019ll summarize by expressing our enthusiasm around our strong leading indicators, high-quality portfolio of communities and operators. I have a high confidence in our ability to compete in what should be a very exciting period of recovery for the senior housing sector. With that, I\u2019ll hand the call to Pete.\nPeter Bulgarelli: Thanks, Justin. I\u2019ll cover the office and health care triple-net segments. Together, these segments represent over 50% of Ventas\u2019 NOI. They continue to produce solid and reliable results. First, I\u2019ll cover office. The core office portfolio, ex parking, performed well. Core office grew 1.7% year-on-year and 1.1% sequentially. Those results were tempered by lower parking activity, which I\u2019m pleased to say is materially increasing. All-in, the office portfolio delivered $123 million of same-store cash NOI in the first quarter. This represents an 80 basis-point reported sequential growth. In terms of rent collections, our strong record continued during the quarter and into April. This outstanding record is enabled by the mission-critical nature of our portfolio and our high-quality creditworthy tenancy. In our medical office portfolio, 88% of our NOI comes from investment-grade rated tenants and HCA. In our life sciences portfolio, 76% of our revenues come directly from investment-grade rated organizations and publicly traded companies. All of our MOB properties are in elective surgery restriction-free locations and clinical activity and building utilization is rebounding. A clinical rebound provides confidence to health care executives in making business decisions. We\u2019re certainly seeing that on the real estate side. As an example, we are finishing negotiations on a 10-year 160,000 square foot renewal with a 16,000 square foot expansion with a leading health system in the southeast. And another example. We relocated and extended several hospital offices on a Midwestern campus to accommodate the addition of a 50,000 square foot health care-focused technical college. The leases will commence in July, a win for the health system, the college and Ventas. Medical office had record level retention of 91% for the first quarter and 86% for the trailing 12 months. Driven by this retention, total office leasing was nearly 1 million square feet for the quarter. This includes 160,000 square feet of new leasing. The result is that MOB occupancy stayed essentially flat, down only 10 basis points for the quarter, both sequentially and year-on-year. Previous actions to bolster leasing are clearly showing results. In 2019, we hired a head of leasing. In 2020, we hired a digital marketing lead. In 2020, we redeployed 30% of our third-party brokers. And in 2020, we increased the number of third-party brokers by 70% to impact the local coverage. Our digital marketing program focused on local market awareness and virtual touring of vacant suites is fully in place and making a difference. Average length of term for new leases was 7.3 years, 5 months higher than the 2019 average. Renewal term length also exceeded 2019 averages. Average escalators for new leasing was 2.7%, higher than our average in-place escalator of 2.4%. All of this represents growing health care community confidence in the recovery. I\u2019d also like to highlight our pre-leasing construction initiative. This is where we take a vacant suite where it is difficult to visualize this future potential and either demolish the in-place improvements to Core and Shell or complete a hospital standard physician suite in advance of leasing. We\u2019ve invested over $2 million in a pilot across 20 suites. The results have been fantastic. These projects have driven 20 basis points of occupancy and created a nearly 20% return on investment. Because of these results, we intend to expand this program later this year. We remain enthusiastic about the office business and particularly investment opportunities in the R&I space. We continue to make progress on our recently announced $2 billion pipeline of development opportunities with Wexford. We\u2019ve publicly announced four projects in that pipeline, Arizona State University in Phoenix, which opened in the fourth quarter and is soon to be over 70% leased. Drexel University College of Nursing in Philadelphia is 100% leased. The project, in partnership with the University of Pittsburgh for immunotherapy is 70% preleased. And our new development in the thriving uCity submarket of Philadelphia between Penn and Drexel is showing strong pre-leasing activity. Since the acquisition of our South San Francisco life science trophy asset, we have renewed several tenants and have driven occupancy to 100%. In some cases, the mark-to-market has exceeded 30%. At our newest life sciences acquisition on the Johns Hopkins Campus in Baltimore, we are in lease negotiations to take the buildings from 96% to 100% occupancy. Demand far exceeds our current capacity. Now, let\u2019s turn to health care triple net. During the first quarter, our health care triple-net assets showed continued strength and reliability with 100% rent collections in April and May. Trailing 12-month EBITDARM cash flow coverage through 12/31 improved sequentially for all of our health care triple-net asset classes. Acute care hospitals\u2019 trailing 12-month coverage was a strong 3.5 times in the fourth quarter, a 20 basis-point sequential improvement. Ardent has performed extremely well in this dynamic market. IRF and LTAC coverage improved 10 basis points to 1.7 times in the first quarter, buoyed by strong business results and government funding. Census levels were high at year-end and continued into the first quarter. During this period, Kindred has been able to demonstrate their expertise in treating complex respiratory disorders to their health system partners. Regarding our loan portfolio, it is fully current. Finally, a word of thanks to our frontline workers who have kept our facilities open and safe during this last year. They are our heroes. We are relieved that now, protected by the vaccine, they can do their jobs with peace of mind and in safety. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bob.\nBob Probst: Thanks Pete. In my remarks today, I\u2019ll cover our first quarter results, our expectations for the second quarter of 2021 and our recent liquidity, balance sheet and capital activities. Let\u2019s start with our results in the first quarter. Ventas reported first quarter net income of minus $0.15 per share, driven by noncash charges in the quarter as we transferred assets to held for sale. Normalized funds from operations in the first quarter was $0.72 per share, a $0.01 beat versus the high end of our prior guidance range of $0.66 to $0.71. As previously communicated and included in our Q1 guidance range, we received $0.04 in HHS Grants in SHOP in Q1. Adjusted for these grants, Q1 FFO per share was $0.68. As expected, office and triple-net contributed stable sequential NOI performance in the first quarter. Q1 outperformance was driven by better occupancy and lower-than-expected operating expenses in SHOP. As a result, same-store SHOP NOI declined sequentially by 8% in the second quarter versus the first. Turning to our Q2 guidance. Second quarter net income is estimated to range from flat to $0.07 per fully diluted share. Our guidance range for normalized FFO for Q2 is $0.67 to $0.71 per share. The Q2 FFO midpoint of $0.69 is $0.01 higher sequentially than the first quarter results due to an improving SHOP trajectory, after adjusting for HHS Grants in both periods. Key second quarter assumptions underlying our guidance are as follows. Starting with SHOP. Q2 spot occupancy from March 31st to June 30th is forecast to increase between 150 to 250 basis points, with the midpoint assuming the occupancy improvement in March and April, continues through May and June. Sequential SHOP revenue is expected to grow modestly as a result of occupancy gains. While operating expenses, excluding HHS grants, are forecast to be flat with lower COVID costs, offsetting higher costs due to increased occupancy, higher community activity levels and an additional day in the second quarter. Finally, we\u2019ve not included the receipts of HHS Grants in SHOP in our Q2 guidance. In our Office and Triple-net segments, we expect stable NOI in Q2 relative to Q1. And finally, we continue to assume $1 billion in proceeds from property dispositions in the back half of 2021. I\u2019d like to underscore that we\u2019re still in a highly uncertain environment. Though trends in SHOP are positive, the pandemic\u2019s impact on our business remain very difficult to predict. I\u2019ll close our prepared remarks with our liquidity, balance sheet and capital activity. We continue to enjoy robust liquidity with $2.7 billion as of May 5th. Notably, in the first quarter, we renewed our revolver at better pricing and improved our near-term maturity profile by fully repaying $400 million of senior notes due 2023. In terms of capital structure, we maintained total debt to gross asset value at 37% in the first quarter. Q1 net debt-to-EBITDA was 7.1 times, as EBITDA continued to feel the impacts of COVID in the quarter. We expect net debt-to-EBITDA will reach its peak in the first half of \u201821 and then begin to improve in the second half as senior housing rebounds and we reduce debt with asset sales. On behalf of all my colleagues, Ventas is committed to continuing to take the actions to win the post-pandemic recovery, which finally is appearing in our sights. That concludes our prepared remarks. Before we start with Q&A, we\u2019re limiting each caller to two questions to be respectful to everyone on the line. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to the operator.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Amanda Sweitzer with Baird.\nAmanda Sweitzer: Thanks. Good morning. You highlighted the opportunity for further improvement in move-ins as higher conversion lead sources and respite stays return. Can you quantify that opportunity at all? Where could it take your conversion rate or index move-ins?\nDebra A. Cafaro: Amanda, this is Debbie. Good morning. I just want to welcome you. I think, this is your first time participating in our call. And we want to welcome you. But, I\u2019ll turn the hard work over to Justin to answer your question.\nJustin Hutchens: I\u2019m going to ask you to turn to page 10 of our business update, if you have it handy, where we articulate our lead in move-in and move-out and calling them this time in the prepared remarks. And what I\u2019d like to highlight is that the typical primary driver of lead conversion comes from professional and personal referrals. That\u2019s historically been a very strong driver. Throughout the pandemic, the business has been resilient. It\u2019s benefited from leads driven through company internet. It\u2019s been benefited from leads driven through referral agencies. Those referral sources should persist. But, what we\u2019re looking to see come back and what has started to come back are those other referral sources. It\u2019s personal and professional referrals, which convert at 20% to 25% each versus the overall 10% conversion rate that we experienced, plus respites. But to put all this together, respites have -- during the pandemic, ran at about a 25% of prepandemic level run rate. They\u2019re back to 50% now. Personal referrals ran at 50% to 60%. They\u2019re back to 94% now. Those will grow because that\u2019s simply residents and relatives referring their friends, which is phenomenal. And that will grow as our occupancy grows. And then, professional referrals, if you want a leading indicator for that category, look toward health care activity. As health care and skilled nursing picks up, that\u2019s a driver of professional referrals. And those are still running at only 50%. So, given that and given where our performance is and the strong net activity we have, we do feel comfortable that there\u2019s opportunity for more move-ins over time. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve highlighted that. We could see a pickup in 10%, 20% of our move-in volume over time as those leads come back. And we started to see it come back. You\u2019ll notice on the slide that we highlighted Q1, and we know that in March and April that there\u2019s -- particularly respites and the personal referrals are playing a bigger role in leads and therefore driving more move-ins.\nAmanda Sweitzer: Thanks for that detail. That\u2019s helpful. And then, following up, could you talk more about trends you\u2019re seeing within U.S. SHOP specifically across the productivity levels, either in terms of occupancy improvement or movements relative to 2019? Have you seen a return of a more lifestyle-driven customer in the U.S?\nJustin Hutchens: Yes. I can tell you that independent living performed well throughout the pandemic and continues to perform well. We have a strong concentration of independent living and social assisted living, which is otherwise known as AL Light. They have played a big role in the recovery that we mentioned in the prepared remarks. There\u2019s also a little bit of a geographic lift from the southern part of the United States, where they had 340 basis points growth relative to the 280 that Debbie reported over that time period from the -- part of March to the end of April, so. But, I think the bigger point is that across the U.S., it\u2019s really every asset class and geography is contributing to the recovery thus far.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC.\nRich Anderson: Thanks. Good morning.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Hi, Rich. This is not your first for Ventas. So, welcome, too, also.\nRich Anderson: Yes. Actually, it is my 100th earnings season, a few of us on the call.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Congratulations.\nRich Anderson: So, on the disposition side and maybe a more broad kind of discussion is on your view of senior housing. Obviously, you\u2019re getting more excited about it. But, there was a period of time where you were making it clear that your area of growth for the Company was much more aligned with life science and medical office. With what you\u2019re seeing now in terms of recovery, has that mindset sort of meaningfully changed? And when you look at dispositions, where will that come out of in terms of how the pie chart might look down the road?\nDebra A. Cafaro: Great. Well, in the dispositions, we\u2019ve commented that we expect it to be a combination of office and senior housing. And again, Justin is here to exercise his professional judgment in terms of how we can make dispositions, enhance our portfolio. And so, a year later, he\u2019s finally getting to that. But Justin, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve been doing in between now and then. But, he\u2019s finally -- so that\u2019s how we\u2019re looking at the disposition side. And then, on the investment side, I would say, clearly, our priorities have been the Le Groupe Maurice ground-up development, which is a great business model and has done consistently really well. It\u2019s been, obviously, the life science with the South San Francisco and Hopkins investments, as well as the ground-up developments that our opening kind of seriatim here with the pipeline behind that. And of course, we continue to look at other health care asset classes and senior housing. So, I think we really are on our front foot across our asset classes, Rich.\nRich Anderson: I guess, the question is, is senior housing a bigger piece of the puzzle two, three years out, now that you\u2019re seeing what you\u2019re seeing? That\u2019s the crux of the question.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Well, I believe, first of all, the most important embedded upside that we have in the Company is recapturing and exceeding prior levels of NOI. And as I mentioned, we have every opportunity to do so. And then, of course, on the investment side, you could see external growth coming from that as well.\nRich Anderson: Okay. And just a quick one. On the triple net number, down 13%, you kind of listed a few good things on the IRF and LTAC side and the hospital side. What was it? What\u2019s the noise in that number that created that 13% downward number on a same-store basis year-over-year? Since you\u2019re just collecting rent.\nBob Probst: I\u2019ll take that one, Rich. That\u2019s the Brookdale restructure we did, as you know, in the second half of last year. So, you\u2019ve seen that lap.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Right. And even though -- yes, as you recall, we essentially collected 2.5 years\u2019 worth of full rent upfront. It gets run through the financial statements differently. And just a gratuitous comment, we\u2019re very pleased to see how Brookdale\u2019s reported numbers today and glad we have the warrants.\nRich Anderson: Yes. I guess, I was asking, again, my question is, like what would that 13 be if you normalize those types of things out? That\u2019s what I\u2019m asking.\nBob Probst: Well, normalized for the big rocks that we addressed last year, you\u2019ll see escalator type growth, Rich, it\u2019s the nature of it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nJordan Sadler: My question really comes back to the move-ins. And Justin, I wanted to come back to your comments about the \"turn the lights on\" scenario. So, if you look across the portfolio, what would that scenario -- and you overlay sort of what happened in 2019, right? So, the 2019 move-ins and then 2019 move-outs as a percent of in-place occupancy. What does that suggest net absorption could look like in 2021?\nJustin Hutchens: Yes. Just basically turning the lights on, as I described it, you show up to work, based on that structural advantage, 30, 40 basis points a month. Obviously, we\u2019re performing well above that for the reasons I described earlier.\nJordan Sadler: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, maybe as a follow-up non-sequitur, on the sort of investment opportunity that you guys are seeing. Where would you say it\u2019s more heavily weighted right now? I know you guys have flagged some of the R&I opportunity. But, is there more development to come there, or is it more of an acquisition story?\nDebra A. Cafaro: It\u2019s both. I think, it will be a mixture of the ground-up development in senior housing, as we talked about, as well as life science and research and innovation. And we\u2019ve always been an effective consolidator as we\u2019ve grown, and we\u2019re starting to see that deal volume as we talked about. And so, I would expect there to be acquisitions as well, Jordan.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. Maybe following up on the expected dispositions. Where are those assets right now in terms of marketing and just being identified?\nDebra A. Cafaro: They\u2019re in the pipeline at different stages. Some are already kind of out there, others are almost out there, and others are kind of on the way. So, it\u2019s a going through the system.\nBob Probst: We\u2019re reiterating, Nick, that we expect to close, to get the proceeds in the back half of the year. So, it gives you a sense that they\u2019re well underway in many cases.\nNick Joseph: And then, maybe just on senior housing. You\u2019ve obviously talked a lot about the forward demand drivers and the demographics. Just from an industry perspective though, when would you expect starts to start to accelerate? Obviously, they\u2019re well down from their previous peak. But just given kind of the forward runway that you and the industry is looking at, when would you expect that to attract additional development starts?\nDebra A. Cafaro: Yes. I mean, we are evaluating that closely. And I would say that it is a matter of judgment and experience to make such a prediction. Here\u2019s what\u2019s interesting. Again, starts are dramatically better in the sense that, as Justin said, the first quarter was down gigantically from the peak, and then the lowest level since 2011. So that\u2019s really, really good. We know that really when you look forward in the near term that the most important thing is even if over the next couple of years things start to get on the drawing board, you\u2019re going to have this window of opportunity where you\u2019re going to have 3% to 4% CAGR on over 80 population, which ultimately spikes in 26, 27, over 6%, as you know. And you\u2019re going to have this window of time where the kind of embedded communities are going to have some really great supply-demand tailwinds in this sort of intermediate term. So, hard to say when they would pick up again. We know there are increased construction costs. We know there are supply chain issues. Those will probably delay some of the things that that would start. And we also know that rents right now may not be supportive of those higher construction costs. So, when you put all those things together, we like the forward runway as we come out of -- we really emerge post-pandemic into the recovery.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Bernstein with Capital One.\nDaniel Bernstein: I\u2019m going to stick with seniors housing here. So, I was listening to the Brookdale call this morning, they indicated that they were looking at maybe more flat margins in 2Q and then a ramp-up in the second half of the year. So, I was trying to, I guess, pick your brains and how you\u2019re thinking about the margin ramp in seniors housing might look like, given trends in occupancy?\nJustin Hutchens: Yes. Hi, it\u2019s Justin. You would definitely expect to see the NOI growth really lag the occupancy. Revenue comes first and then there\u2019s a dynamic occurring now where you have COVID expenses should come down and then some of the operating expenses will come back up. Obviously, the second quarter has an extra day in it. So, there\u2019s some little extra expense coming from that. But as you run forward, you would see margin as kind of the lagging -- the last lagging performance metric.\nDaniel Bernstein: And then, maybe a related question is, how are you thinking about pricing power in the industry? Historically, we\u2019ve had to be at 85 -- upper 80s of occupancy to see pricing matching inflation. Have the dynamics changed at all in terms of the industry\u2019s focus on acuity that might allow pricing power earlier than previous cycles?\nJustin Hutchens: Well, I would say that we get the advantage of the highly leveraged business on the way up. So, it\u2019s really a volume game right now, and operators are using discounting price incentives to try to encourage volume. And we would definitely expect that to continue for a period of time. One thing -- just two months into this recovery though that we\u2019re starting to hear is more selectivity around discounting, focusing in on certain markets and -- but until we start to see consistent recovery and occupancy get a little higher, I would expect price to be a sole operator used to go for volume.\nDebra A. Cafaro: And as you know, once we build the volume, we get the benefit of the in-place increases when you turn the page to 2022. And we have really been able to see pretty strong pricing power in that environment, even this January 1. And so that\u2019s really where you start to accrete in terms of the benefit of the volume that Justin is talking about.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital.\nJuan Sanabria: A question for Justin. You\u2019ve been in the seat about a year now. Curious if you\u2019ve changed the approach or the management of an asset management perspective of the seniors housing business, whether it\u2019s by a geography or partner or things you\u2019ve stamped on the enterprise? And then, kind of secondly or related to that, I noticed you didn\u2019t necessarily call out Eclipse at one of your top operators that constitute 90% of the SHOP that constitute 90% of the SHOP business. You\u2019ve previously talked about joint venture in that. Is that something that\u2019s still on the table, or are you thinking about that relationship?\nJustin Hutchens: Hi, Juan. I\u2019ll start with the first question. In 2020, the pandemic really drove the priorities. One thing that we did want to make sure though is that we had adequate resources and attention on the triple-net priorities, and we addressed a lot in 2020. Now, we\u2019re moving to recovery. So, we certainly have resources focused on supporting our operators through the recovery and taking some of the portfolio of actions that I described in my remarks. In regards to Eclipse, there\u2019s really the three operators I highlighted were Sunrise, Atria and Le Groupe Maurice. Together, on a stabilized basis, that\u2019s 90% of our business. Eclipse is in the 10%, along with a handful of others.\nJuan Sanabria: Okay. And I\u2019m just curious on the move-in data, what is the data analytics telling you about the acuity level of the people coming in? Are you seeing pent-up demand, presumably some level given you\u2019re over 100% of what you saw in \u201819? And what does the data history suggests in terms of what that may do to the length of stay, if in fact, you\u2019re seeing higher acuity coming in?\nJustin Hutchens: Yes. That\u2019s a great question. Throughout the past 12 months, we\u2019ve actually seen length of stay go up. And part of the driver of that was that reduced respite business that I described earlier. So, length of stay has gone up a little bit. It will come down a little bit as we bring more short-term stays back into the pipeline. In regards to pent-up demand, the -- if you look at the leads, it\u2019s page 9 of the business update, you\u2019ll notice that leads are at about 104%. When we think about pent-up demand, I think of 120%, 130%, some big number that\u2019s lined up, and we really just look at it as demand, and demand that\u2019s not even fully supported by traditional lead sources. So, not so much pent up. But certainly, we\u2019re pleased with the recovery thus far. And one other thing I\u2019d mention is that as we\u2019ve spoken with operators, they\u2019re not having leads come to the doorstep and say, I\u2019ve been waiting for the vaccine or I\u2019ve been waiting to make this decision. We actually had quite a bit of activity throughout pandemic. And if you normalize it for the communities that were closed, it was pretty consistent. So, we\u2019re just seeing the community is open again and some lead sources come back and providing demand for our service.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.\nVikram Malhotra: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. And thanks for all the data on the -- on, I think, slide 8, 9 and 10, a lot of useful information. Maybe just first one on the -- just going back to the margin and the expense side, maybe Justin, if you can walk us through how operators are prepping for this potential increase over 2Q and potentially 3Q from a labor perspective and all the other sort of bigger line items in terms of food and maybe even PPE. Just, like how have the operators already staffed up? Do we anticipate margins inflecting in near term, at least? And then, if you could just extend that to talk about labor?\nJustin Hutchens: Sure. Yes. So, in the near term, margins, we expect to be relatively flat because in total expenses, we have COVID coming down, we have other operating expenses coming up. If you look ahead at our quarter, we\u2019re projecting around $7.5 million of expense growth. Half of that\u2019s just an extra day in the quarter. The rest is a mix of just labor costs and other expenses. So it\u2019s not really a big mover in the near term. And then, after -- as we get into more occupancy recovery, of course, we would expect expenses to lift a bit, but we would expect a very high margin on that incremental revenue.\nVikram Malhotra: And then, maybe just, Debbie, bigger picture. Given this recovery and the potential now you\u2019re citing over a multiyear period, maybe give us some color on whether you\u2019re maybe rethinking the acquisition focus in terms of buckets. Is there an opportunity for Ventas to get more aggressive on senior housing in certain areas, or are you sticking sort of a more balanced approach?\nDebra A. Cafaro: Again, we do highly subscribe to the benefits of diversification, Vikram. It has served us incredibly well over the years and particularly over the last year. We have always been big believers in the senior living business. We\u2019re excited that we have this recovery upside opportunity embedded in our portfolio now, and we intend to capture that. And also, we totally do intend to invest and acquire senior housing, assuming we find assets of equality and in markets where we think it\u2019s really going to provide good risk-adjusted return. But yes, we would certainly expect to have that in our acquisition buckets.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lukas Hartwich with Green Street.\nLukas Hartwich: Thanks. So, when it comes to capital allocation, can you just provide an update on the house view on senior housing development in the U.S.? I\u2019m just curious what the opportunity set looks like in terms of size and maybe returns.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Well, we talked about it a little bit. And good morning and welcome to you also. We talked about it a little bit. Construction costs are relatively high. We do know we have the growth in the 80-plus population, which is really fueling this demographic demand that we have. And right now, I think really with the existing investment basis that we have in senior housing, again, the big opportunity is to recover that. There is an opportunity to invest in this great business model that we have in Canada with LGM. We certainly would look at senior housing ground-up development in the U.S. because we do think there\u2019s -- because of the demand. But from a cost standpoint, I think we -- as we discussed, I think you\u2019d have to be cautious to make sure that the returns penciled out commensurate with the risk.\nLukas Hartwich: That\u2019s helpful. And then, on the disposition guidance. When it comes to the SHOP, I\u2019m just curious how you\u2019re thinking about selling now versus waiting to let the story on fundamentals improve in that business?\nDebra A. Cafaro: Yes. Very important question. Justin, why don\u2019t you address that?\nJustin Hutchens: Sure. So, one of the big priorities is to make sure that we\u2019re well positioned for recovery. I mentioned some of the operators. There\u2019s certainly communities that have probably less potential to contribute to the recovery or maybe may not be a long-term fit for us or maybe a better fit in the hands of a different operator. And so, there\u2019s a lot of review underway and actions that we\u2019re considering that should net really positive in terms of the overall quality and growth of our portfolio.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays.\nSteven Valiquette: So, just using round numbers here. Well, first, my question also relates to the operating leverage within the SHOP portfolio that was touched on earlier. Just using round numbers, you lost about 1,000 bps of occupancy, close to 1,000 bps of NOI margin when we take stimulus out of the equation. That\u2019s pretty much in line with the industry averages. You did talk about the lag in the NOI margin recovery versus occupancy recovery this year in \u201821. But over the next few years, should we assume that the SHOP NOI margins ultimately get back to that 29% to 30% range that we saw in 2019 pre-pandemic? Just want to confirm the longer-term view around that dynamic. Thanks.\nJustin Hutchens: Hi. It\u2019s Justin. I\u2019ll just mention that the answer is yes. There\u2019s -- there was a question earlier on the call that talked about pricing power and pricing -- it\u2019s going to be volume first. And then, as pricing returns, that\u2019s going to help margin get all the way back to pre-pandemic levels.\nBob Probst: Together with the underlying fundamentals, we need to keep pointing to supply-demand equation. And again, as occupancy begins to rehydrate, the in-place increases, more pricing power. So, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason to believe anything other than we\u2019ll get back to normal over time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.\nNick Yulico: So, just going back to the move-in data and the topic of pent-up demand. I think you cited earlier in the call that April was the most move-ins you\u2019ve had in a single month since June of 2019. And then, you\u2019re also saying that you didn\u2019t think that there was that much pent-up demand. I\u2019m just trying to square those two comments together, because it seems like if the move-ins are high, there is some level of pent-up demand that\u2019s benefiting move-ins right now.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Yes. That\u2019s really not what we\u2019re hearing, and it very well could be just organic demand. So, there are -- go ahead, Justin.\nJustin Hutchens: Well, I was just going to say, there\u2019s one other point that I\u2019ve mentioned earlier, and that\u2019s really -- I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the move outs being lower as well. So, there\u2019s a certain amount of just kind of structural netting that\u2019s going to occur. And then, you have the resurgence of the higher conversion leads. They\u2019re not all the way back yet. That\u2019s why -- that, combined with the feedback from the operators in terms of what they\u2019re seeing at their door, just it\u2019s not something we necessarily characterize as pent up. It just -- probably one of the biggest indicators of that, I think, I mentioned earlier, is the personal referrals. These are relatives and residents referring their friends again, like as they did [Technical Difficulty] the overall demand fundamentals are recovering, not necessarily pent-up demand.\nNick Yulico: Okay. And I guess, as we think about the guidance for the second quarter, 150 to 250 basis points of spot occupancy benefit. How should we think about that as a sequential benefit in future quarters? Meaning, is this an unusually large benefit that you\u2019re expecting in the second quarter because -- and your move-outs are low and eventually move-outs will pick up. You have sort of this high level of move-in activity right now, which is a high conversion rate, but we\u2019ll see how that moves going forward. Just trying to think about, as we\u2019re thinking about the sequential occupancy build going forward here, is the second quarter number a reasonable number to think that carries through in the future, or are there some unusual benefits in the second quarter?\nBob Probst: I\u2019d highlight what Justin described as the \"turn on the light\" scenario, which is the lower occupancy means lower move-out at the same rate of move-outs. That, over time, goes away, obviously, as occupancy goes up. So, in that regard, that\u2019s temporal. The move-ins in the sort of 100% to 110%, before some of these incremental referrals would suggest there should be continued move-in opportunity over time. This isn\u2019t summed [ph] up so much as just real demand. And so, put those together and it not only benefits the second quarter, but should benefit the future.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.\nMichael Carroll: Yes. Thanks. Just off of, I guess, Nick\u2019s question on pent-up demand. And I\u2019m sorry, I think my phone break out. So, you might have answered this already, if I missed it. But, I know you haven\u2019t liked the term of pent-up demand, and I\u2019ve been hearing a few times on this call. I mean, do you expect that we\u2019ll see some level of pent-up demand that could drive leads and move-ins higher from today\u2019s level over the next few months, or how should we think about that?\nDebra A. Cafaro: I mean, our bias really, Mike, is that this is organic demand that is based upon the need-based nature of the communities and the availability of the communities, then it is strong, resilient organic demand, and that\u2019s strong. And whether it\u2019s pent-up or not, we aren\u2019t hearing from good sources that if anything other than move-ins that would have moved in now anyway. I don\u2019t know if that makes it more clear, but go ahead, Justin. Yes.\nJustin Hutchens: One other point, on page 9, if you ignore the first two months, it\u2019s April, May, the beginning of the pandemic, and you just draw a straight line across the averages. Even during the pandemic, we were running 80% leads, move-ins...\nDebra A. Cafaro: Right.\nJustin Hutchens: And we had 20% of our communities closed at any given time. And so, people continue to move in as they have the need.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Yes. I was actually looking at that on page 9 of the deck. And you can see that. There is -- and that\u2019s why I think we keep using this word, resilient, which I know we use frequently. But, it really is sustained need-based demand from a growing demographic, and that is very positive.\nMichael Carroll: Okay. Yes. I was just trying to get to this, like, do we expect pent-up demand could enter the market as these other referral sources come on, and we could see some of those leads and move-ins even move higher from this point?\nDebra A. Cafaro: Well, they could because when you think about it, if you -- maybe -- whatever you want to call it is okay with us. But, when you think about it, for example, when UnitedHealthcare reported and they said really that senior level medical procedures and surgeries and things really haven\u2019t bounced fully back, okay? And you connect that with what Justin said earlier that really a leading indicator of those kind of professional referrals would be really health care procedures. As those seniors start to have those procedures, If you look at that and then you see those professional referrals come back, you could characterize that if you want a pent-up demand as they had delayed those surgeries and so on. So, you could -- I don\u2019t want to quibble over words. I think, what\u2019s good is there\u2019s really good demand and we\u2019re seeing it come through and it\u2019s then two consecutive months, and we hope and are projecting for the second quarter that it will continue.\nMichael Carroll: Okay. And then, just one more real quick. The lead data that you have in the presentation, I guess, what\u2019s the breakout of that between U.S. and Canada? Obviously, Canada has been a little bit weaker due to the COVID outbreak. So, is leads in the U.S. higher than Canada?\nJustin Hutchens: Yes. So, the way I\u2019d characterize Canada, maybe it\u2019s not around leads, it\u2019s more around just their move-in activity. Canada, a page you might look at is page 7, where at the top, there\u2019s a purple number 4. That really just marks when Canada had 75% of the communities vaccinated. You could see that\u2019s much later than the U.S. And the good news is, we know once we got there in the U.S. that the trends have been phenomenally strong. We would expect the same thing in Canada. So, there was a little bit of underperformance. You can see that on the next page, where Canada in March was negative 20 basis points. Obviously, U.S. was up 80 basis points during that time. So they\u2019re just lagging a little bit. The vaccines came later. They\u2019ve been a good performer for us. We would expect them to come back as the vaccines are fully executed.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Mike, thanks. And again, compliments on your life science report.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.\nJoshua Dennerlein: A question on margins. Just kind of thinking about the SHOP margins kind of going forward. Is there anything structural that you\u2019re seeing that would prevent the SHOP margin from hitting their pre-pandemic levels, kind of once we return to pre-pandemic occupancy levels?\nBob Probst: Sure. Josh, I think fundamentally, structurally, as we look at it, there isn\u2019t anything structurally that would suggest that the margin structure is changing fundamentally. Timing of that to be determined, obviously. But again, the value proposition of senior housing, the demand that we\u2019ve seen through the pandemic and that we\u2019re seeing, especially now in the second quarter in pricing power, which will return over time, we believe will give some confidence in that.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. So, it does sound like once we get to like a pre-pandemic level, we should see the margins kind of hit roughly the same -- is that -- I guess, what I\u2019m asking is like, is there -- are you going to do anything differently on the operator front as far as like cleaning protocols that might be higher expenses going forward or anything like that?\nJustin Hutchens: Yes. I\u2019d say, on the margin, there might be some of that. But, it\u2019s going to be relatively limited moving forward, once we get out -- the pandemic gets further behind us. So, we\u2019re definitely comfortable that margins come back.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. And then, I think another question is kind of briefly touched on, but just wanted to ask kind of a little bit differently on new rate for move-ins. What\u2019s like the current level of discounting going on? Like, is it one month free or any kind of gauge there would be helpful.\nJustin Hutchens: There\u2019s basically -- you name it. There\u2019s one free being given or there\u2019s waive in the community fees. There\u2019s just a kind of structurally lower rent being offered. Typically, care charges are never discounted. But, rent and community fees are fair game and operators tend to give them upfront. So, we can get the impact of the discounts behind us. But, there\u2019s a wide variety of discounting right now in the market.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. Has that accelerated over the past months, or is it kind of holding just steady at this point?\nJustin Hutchens: It\u2019s been relatively steady. Yes. It found its way into the system last fall, and it\u2019s been relatively steady. And like I said earlier, operators are starting to get very focused on local markets and pulling back on the discounting where they\u2019re already seeing recovery. One stat I\u2019ll mention that kind of supports that is that 16% of our communities, at the end of April, are back to pre-pandemic occupancies. So, you would imagine that they have pricing power now moving forward again. And so, operators are identifying those communities. They\u2019re starting to tighten a little bit on the discounting. And obviously, that will be supportive of NOI growth.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sarah Tan with JP Morgan.\nSarah Tan: Hi. Good morning. I\u2019m on Sarah for Mike Mueller. This one is for Justin, regarding the senior housing operating portfolio specifically. I think you alluded to some demand differences between the southern and northern geographies. But, what are you seeing in terms of similarities or differences between more urban assets and the ones in the suburb?\nJustin Hutchens: Yes, sure. There\u2019s been a wide -- I\u2019d say the recovery has been experienced in every geography. And there\u2019s been a little bit of difference. The only real meaningful difference that we can point to is really the south and the southeast. If you dig down into local markets, New York is one that comes to the mine that we visited recently. I would say, they had a very bad early experience with the pandemic. Several of those communities have very, very high leads and move-ins. And so, you\u2019re seeing some recovery happen in the Northeast. It\u2019s going to vary by asset type and price point. And there\u2019s a lot of shaking out to do, I think, before we really start calling markets or particular asset classes. It\u2019s still really early. But, the widespread recovery is very encouraging.\nOperator: And your last question for today comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya with Mizuho.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Justin, this one is specifically to you. Again, the occupancy gains, since alluded, [ph] in the past, let\u2019s call it 60 days have been really, really strong. Your 2Q guidance, your assumptions also are really, really strong. You have a peer out there who\u2019s also seeing similar trends, but doesn\u2019t seem quite as strong as the numbers you\u2019re seeing and the numbers you\u2019re kind of forecasting. Can you talk a little bit about why that may be? Why is this kind of meaningful difference between the two, let\u2019s call it, near-term outlook?\nJustin Hutchens: Yes. I really can\u2019t comment on what the peers are seeing. But, just within our own markets and what we\u2019re seeing in terms of performance and leads and et cetera, there continues to be strong support for move-ins. And then, as I mentioned earlier, with move-outs being structurally lower, the strong support for netting. So, that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Right. And also, we had -- we also had strong outperformance in the first quarter, and that\u2019s obviously helping that momentum.\nOmotayo Okusanya: And then, from a recovery perspective, Justin, kind of thematically, is it the high end of the market that\u2019s recovering faster than the lower price points? Is it the state that kind of got hit with COVID first that have kind of now recovered faster. I\u2019m just curious if you can kind of share any kind of -- when you look at the data, things you\u2019re picking up?\nJustin Hutchens: That\u2019s a great question. And I can tell you that we\u2019re looking for those correlations, and we\u2019re not seeing them yet. What we know is that in the U.S., there\u2019s been widespread recovery. We know that Canada is lagging, but a traditionally very strong performer. And then, we\u2019ll study it closely as the trends materialize.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Well, thanks for wrapping the call up in a bow. I want to thank everyone who joined us this morning. We sincerely appreciate your participation and your interest in Ventas. And we look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thank you.\nOperator: And this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bob Probst",
            "content": "Thanks Pete. In my remarks today, I'll cover our first quarter results, our expectations for the second quarter of 2021 and our recent liquidity, balance sheet and capital activities. Let's start with our results in the first quarter. Ventas reported first quarter net income of minus $0.15 per share, driven by noncash charges in the quarter as we transferred assets to held for sale. Normalized funds from operations in the first quarter was $0.72 per share, a $0.01 beat versus the high end of our prior guidance range of $0.66 to $0.71. As previously communicated and included in our Q1 guidance range, we received $0.04 in HHS Grants in SHOP in Q1. Adjusted for these grants, Q1 FFO per share was $0.68. As expected, office and triple-net contributed stable sequential NOI performance in the first quarter. Q1 outperformance was driven by better occupancy and lower-than-expected operating expenses in SHOP. As a result, same-store SHOP NOI declined sequentially by 8% in the second quarter versus the first. Turning to our Q2 guidance. Second quarter net income is estimated to range from flat to $0.07 per fully diluted share. Our guidance range for normalized FFO for Q2 is $0.67 to $0.71 per share. The Q2 FFO midpoint of $0.69 is $0.01 higher sequentially than the first quarter results due to an improving SHOP trajectory, after adjusting for HHS Grants in both periods. Key second quarter assumptions underlying our guidance are as follows. Starting with SHOP. Q2 spot occupancy from March 31st to June 30th is forecast to increase between 150 to 250 basis points, with the midpoint assuming the occupancy improvement in March and April, continues through May and June. Sequential SHOP revenue is expected to grow modestly as a result of occupancy gains. While operating expenses, excluding HHS grants, are forecast to be flat with lower COVID costs, offsetting higher costs due to increased occupancy, higher community activity levels and an additional day in the second quarter. Finally, we've not included the receipts of HHS Grants in SHOP in our Q2 guidance. In our Office and Triple-net segments, we expect stable NOI in Q2 relative to Q1. And finally, we continue to assume $1 billion in proceeds from property dispositions in the back half of 2021. I'd like to underscore that we're still in a highly uncertain environment. Though trends in SHOP are positive, the pandemic's impact on our business remain very difficult to predict. I'll close our prepared remarks with our liquidity, balance sheet and capital activity. We continue to enjoy robust liquidity with $2.7 billion as of May 5th. Notably, in the first quarter, we renewed our revolver at better pricing and improved our near-term maturity profile by fully repaying $400 million of senior notes due 2023. In terms of capital structure, we maintained total debt to gross asset value at 37% in the first quarter. Q1 net debt-to-EBITDA was 7.1 times, as EBITDA continued to feel the impacts of COVID in the quarter. We expect net debt-to-EBITDA will reach its peak in the first half of \u201821 and then begin to improve in the second half as senior housing rebounds and we reduce debt with asset sales. On behalf of all my colleagues, Ventas is committed to continuing to take the actions to win the post-pandemic recovery, which finally is appearing in our sights. That concludes our prepared remarks. Before we start with Q&A, we're limiting each caller to two questions to be respectful to everyone on the line. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator. I'll take that one, Rich. That's the Brookdale restructure we did, as you know, in the second half of last year. So, you've seen that lap. Well, normalized for the big rocks that we addressed last year, you'll see escalator type growth, Rich, it's the nature of it. We're reiterating, Nick, that we expect to close, to get the proceeds in the back half of the year. So, it gives you a sense that they're well underway in many cases. Together with the underlying fundamentals, we need to keep pointing to supply-demand equation. And again, as occupancy begins to rehydrate, the in-place increases, more pricing power. So, I don't think there's any reason to believe anything other than we'll get back to normal over time. I'd highlight what Justin described as the \"turn on the light\" scenario, which is the lower occupancy means lower move-out at the same rate of move-outs. That, over time, goes away, obviously, as occupancy goes up. So, in that regard, that's temporal. The move-ins in the sort of 100% to 110%, before some of these incremental referrals would suggest there should be continued move-in opportunity over time. This isn't summed [ph] up so much as just real demand. And so, put those together and it not only benefits the second quarter, but should benefit the future. Sure. Josh, I think fundamentally, structurally, as we look at it, there isn't anything structurally that would suggest that the margin structure is changing fundamentally. Timing of that to be determined, obviously. But again, the value proposition of senior housing, the demand that we've seen through the pandemic and that we're seeing, especially now in the second quarter in pricing power, which will return over time, we believe will give some confidence in that."

            "content": "Thanks, Justin. I'll cover the office and health care triple-net segments. Together, these segments represent over 50% of Ventas' NOI. They continue to produce solid and reliable results. First, I'll cover office. The core office portfolio, ex parking, performed well. Core office grew 1.7% year-on-year and 1.1% sequentially. Those results were tempered by lower parking activity, which I'm pleased to say is materially increasing. All-in, the office portfolio delivered $123 million of same-store cash NOI in the first quarter. This represents an 80 basis-point reported sequential growth. In terms of rent collections, our strong record continued during the quarter and into April. This outstanding record is enabled by the mission-critical nature of our portfolio and our high-quality creditworthy tenancy. In our medical office portfolio, 88% of our NOI comes from investment-grade rated tenants and HCA. In our life sciences portfolio, 76% of our revenues come directly from investment-grade rated organizations and publicly traded companies. All of our MOB properties are in elective surgery restriction-free locations and clinical activity and building utilization is rebounding. A clinical rebound provides confidence to health care executives in making business decisions. We're certainly seeing that on the real estate side. As an example, we are finishing negotiations on a 10-year 160,000 square foot renewal with a 16,000 square foot expansion with a leading health system in the southeast. And another example. We relocated and extended several hospital offices on a Midwestern campus to accommodate the addition of a 50,000 square foot health care-focused technical college. The leases will commence in July, a win for the health system, the college and Ventas. Medical office had record level retention of 91% for the first quarter and 86% for the trailing 12 months. Driven by this retention, total office leasing was nearly 1 million square feet for the quarter. This includes 160,000 square feet of new leasing. The result is that MOB occupancy stayed essentially flat, down only 10 basis points for the quarter, both sequentially and year-on-year. Previous actions to bolster leasing are clearly showing results. In 2019, we hired a head of leasing. In 2020, we hired a digital marketing lead. In 2020, we redeployed 30% of our third-party brokers. And in 2020, we increased the number of third-party brokers by 70% to impact the local coverage. Our digital marketing program focused on local market awareness and virtual touring of vacant suites is fully in place and making a difference. Average length of term for new leases was 7.3 years, 5 months higher than the 2019 average. Renewal term length also exceeded 2019 averages. Average escalators for new leasing was 2.7%, higher than our average in-place escalator of 2.4%. All of this represents growing health care community confidence in the recovery. I'd also like to highlight our pre-leasing construction initiative. This is where we take a vacant suite where it is difficult to visualize this future potential and either demolish the in-place improvements to Core and Shell or complete a hospital standard physician suite in advance of leasing. We've invested over $2 million in a pilot across 20 suites. The results have been fantastic. These projects have driven 20 basis points of occupancy and created a nearly 20% return on investment. Because of these results, we intend to expand this program later this year. We remain enthusiastic about the office business and particularly investment opportunities in the R&I space. We continue to make progress on our recently announced $2 billion pipeline of development opportunities with Wexford. We've publicly announced four projects in that pipeline, Arizona State University in Phoenix, which opened in the fourth quarter and is soon to be over 70% leased. Drexel University College of Nursing in Philadelphia is 100% leased. The project, in partnership with the University of Pittsburgh for immunotherapy is 70% preleased. And our new development in the thriving uCity submarket of Philadelphia between Penn and Drexel is showing strong pre-leasing activity. Since the acquisition of our South San Francisco life science trophy asset, we have renewed several tenants and have driven occupancy to 100%. In some cases, the mark-to-market has exceeded 30%. At our newest life sciences acquisition on the Johns Hopkins Campus in Baltimore, we are in lease negotiations to take the buildings from 96% to 100% occupancy. Demand far exceeds our current capacity. Now, let's turn to health care triple net. During the first quarter, our health care triple-net assets showed continued strength and reliability with 100% rent collections in April and May. Trailing 12-month EBITDARM cash flow coverage through 12/31 improved sequentially for all of our health care triple-net asset classes. Acute care hospitals' trailing 12-month coverage was a strong 3.5 times in the fourth quarter, a 20 basis-point sequential improvement. Ardent has performed extremely well in this dynamic market. IRF and LTAC coverage improved 10 basis points to 1.7 times in the first quarter, buoyed by strong business results and government funding. Census levels were high at year-end and continued into the first quarter. During this period, Kindred has been able to demonstrate their expertise in treating complex respiratory disorders to their health system partners. Regarding our loan portfolio, it is fully current. Finally, a word of thanks to our frontline workers who have kept our facilities open and safe during this last year. They are our heroes. We are relieved that now, protected by the vaccine, they can do their jobs with peace of mind and in safety. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

            "name": "Justin Hutchens",
            "content": "Thank you, Debbie. I am very excited that senior housing recovery is underway. As we've mentioned before, the lifestyle offering in our communities will be a leading indicator of performance. Now that vaccines have been executed, activities are picking up again, communal dining is coming back and all of our communities are open to visitation from relatives, the underlying demand for our services should continue to strengthen. As we have visited communities recently, the enthusiasm expressed by residents, their relatives and employees is compelling as communities are literally coming back to life again. As Debbie noted, we are pleased with the improvement in leading indicators in occupancy as our move-in and move-out performance in March and April resulted in 266 and 363 net move-ins, respectively. We expect occupancy improvements benefiting from a return to 2019 move-in levels, while at the same time, move-outs to be lower than 2019 levels due to lower current occupancy levels. If we use the move-out rate as a percentage of the resident population from 2019 and apply that percentage to the current lower resident occupancy, the outcome is lower move-outs than pre-pandemic levels. That, in combination with a 2019 move-in run rate, results in projected net positive occupancy gains. I refer to this as the \"turn the lights on\" scenario, where we simply get the structural benefit from this netting effect. Having said that, March and April, both performed well above this baseline, as we started to see a resurgence of high-converting lead sources, which include respites and personal referrals. As these lead sources and professional referrals continue to recover, we could see move-in rates grow. Moving on to macro drivers. We remain optimistic on our long-term supply and demand outlook. Construction starts continued to decelerate in the first quarter to the lowest level since the first quarter of 2011, and were down 77% from the peak in the fourth quarter of 2017. Fewer starts should translate into materially lower deliveries in 2022 and 2023. In addition, we expect strong demographic tailwinds to provide support for occupancy growth. The 80-plus population is expected to grow 17% over the next five years, more than double the rate witnessed during the five-year recovery following the financial crisis. I'll comment on our SHOP portfolio. When I joined Ventas just over a year ago, one of my first priorities was to assess the overall quality of our portfolio. Now that we are traveling again and visiting communities, I'm pleased to verify we benefit from a well-invested, highly diversified portfolio of market-leading senior housing communities with service offerings that range from an active adult, independent living, social assisted living, and assisted living and memory care. We are well located in high-barrier markets that have substantial income and wealth demographics to support our offering. Our three primary operators, Le Groupe Maurice, Sunrise and Atria, are each uniquely positioned to be competitive within their respective markets. Collectively, they account for 90% of our SHOP NOI on a stabilized basis. With these attributes of a high-quality portfolio in mind, moving forward, we are actively reviewing opportunities to optimize our portfolio through pruning, strategic CapEx investment, transitioning communities, new developments and pursuing new acquisitions to maintain our strong market position in senior housing. Moving on to triple-net senior housing. Given the proactive measures taken last year where we addressed a substantial portion of our portfolio and additionally paired with government subsidies and other tenant resources, our tenants continue to pay, as expected, in the first quarter and through April. Ventas received all of its expected triple-net senior housing cash rent. Our trailing 12 cash flow coverage for senior housing, which is reported one quarter in arrears, is 1.3 times and stable versus the prior quarter. I'll summarize by expressing our enthusiasm around our strong leading indicators, high-quality portfolio of communities and operators. I have a high confidence in our ability to compete in what should be a very exciting period of recovery for the senior housing sector. With that, I'll hand the call to Pete. I'm going to ask you to turn to page 10 of our business update, if you have it handy, where we articulate our lead in move-in and move-out and calling them this time in the prepared remarks. And what I'd like to highlight is that the typical primary driver of lead conversion comes from professional and personal referrals. That's historically been a very strong driver. Throughout the pandemic, the business has been resilient. It's benefited from leads driven through company internet. It's been benefited from leads driven through referral agencies. Those referral sources should persist. But, what we're looking to see come back and what has started to come back are those other referral sources. It's personal and professional referrals, which convert at 20% to 25% each versus the overall 10% conversion rate that we experienced, plus respites. But to put all this together, respites have -- during the pandemic, ran at about a 25% of prepandemic level run rate. They're back to 50% now. Personal referrals ran at 50% to 60%. They're back to 94% now. Those will grow because that's simply residents and relatives referring their friends, which is phenomenal. And that will grow as our occupancy grows. And then, professional referrals, if you want a leading indicator for that category, look toward health care activity. As health care and skilled nursing picks up, that's a driver of professional referrals. And those are still running at only 50%. So, given that and given where our performance is and the strong net activity we have, we do feel comfortable that there's opportunity for more move-ins over time. And that's why we've highlighted that. We could see a pickup in 10%, 20% of our move-in volume over time as those leads come back. And we started to see it come back. You'll notice on the slide that we highlighted Q1, and we know that in March and April that there's -- particularly respites and the personal referrals are playing a bigger role in leads and therefore driving more move-ins. Yes. I can tell you that independent living performed well throughout the pandemic and continues to perform well. We have a strong concentration of independent living and social assisted living, which is otherwise known as AL Light. They have played a big role in the recovery that we mentioned in the prepared remarks. There's also a little bit of a geographic lift from the southern part of the United States, where they had 340 basis points growth relative to the 280 that Debbie reported over that time period from the -- part of March to the end of April, so. But, I think the bigger point is that across the U.S., it's really every asset class and geography is contributing to the recovery thus far. Yes. Just basically turning the lights on, as I described it, you show up to work, based on that structural advantage, 30, 40 basis points a month. Obviously, we're performing well above that for the reasons I described earlier. Yes. Hi, it's Justin. You would definitely expect to see the NOI growth really lag the occupancy. Revenue comes first and then there's a dynamic occurring now where you have COVID expenses should come down and then some of the operating expenses will come back up. Obviously, the second quarter has an extra day in it. So, there's some little extra expense coming from that. But as you run forward, you would see margin as kind of the lagging -- the last lagging performance metric. Well, I would say that we get the advantage of the highly leveraged business on the way up. So, it's really a volume game right now, and operators are using discounting price incentives to try to encourage volume. And we would definitely expect that to continue for a period of time. One thing -- just two months into this recovery though that we're starting to hear is more selectivity around discounting, focusing in on certain markets and -- but until we start to see consistent recovery and occupancy get a little higher, I would expect price to be a sole operator used to go for volume. Hi, Juan. I'll start with the first question. In 2020, the pandemic really drove the priorities. One thing that we did want to make sure though is that we had adequate resources and attention on the triple-net priorities, and we addressed a lot in 2020. Now, we're moving to recovery. So, we certainly have resources focused on supporting our operators through the recovery and taking some of the portfolio of actions that I described in my remarks. In regards to Eclipse, there's really the three operators I highlighted were Sunrise, Atria and Le Groupe Maurice. Together, on a stabilized basis, that's 90% of our business. Eclipse is in the 10%, along with a handful of others. Yes. That's a great question. Throughout the past 12 months, we've actually seen length of stay go up. And part of the driver of that was that reduced respite business that I described earlier. So, length of stay has gone up a little bit. It will come down a little bit as we bring more short-term stays back into the pipeline. In regards to pent-up demand, the -- if you look at the leads, it's page 9 of the business update, you'll notice that leads are at about 104%. When we think about pent-up demand, I think of 120%, 130%, some big number that's lined up, and we really just look at it as demand, and demand that's not even fully supported by traditional lead sources. So, not so much pent up. But certainly, we're pleased with the recovery thus far. And one other thing I'd mention is that as we've spoken with operators, they're not having leads come to the doorstep and say, I've been waiting for the vaccine or I've been waiting to make this decision. We actually had quite a bit of activity throughout pandemic. And if you normalize it for the communities that were closed, it was pretty consistent. So, we're just seeing the community is open again and some lead sources come back and providing demand for our service. Sure. Yes. So, in the near term, margins, we expect to be relatively flat because in total expenses, we have COVID coming down, we have other operating expenses coming up. If you look ahead at our quarter, we're projecting around $7.5 million of expense growth. Half of that's just an extra day in the quarter. The rest is a mix of just labor costs and other expenses. So it's not really a big mover in the near term. And then, after -- as we get into more occupancy recovery, of course, we would expect expenses to lift a bit, but we would expect a very high margin on that incremental revenue. Sure. So, one of the big priorities is to make sure that we're well positioned for recovery. I mentioned some of the operators. There's certainly communities that have probably less potential to contribute to the recovery or maybe may not be a long-term fit for us or maybe a better fit in the hands of a different operator. And so, there's a lot of review underway and actions that we're considering that should net really positive in terms of the overall quality and growth of our portfolio. Hi. It's Justin. I'll just mention that the answer is yes. There's -- there was a question earlier on the call that talked about pricing power and pricing -- it's going to be volume first. And then, as pricing returns, that's going to help margin get all the way back to pre-pandemic levels. Well, I was just going to say, there's one other point that I've mentioned earlier, and that's really -- I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the move outs being lower as well. So, there's a certain amount of just kind of structural netting that's going to occur. And then, you have the resurgence of the higher conversion leads. They're not all the way back yet. That's why -- that, combined with the feedback from the operators in terms of what they're seeing at their door, just it's not something we necessarily characterize as pent up. It just -- probably one of the biggest indicators of that, I think, I mentioned earlier, is the personal referrals. These are relatives and residents referring their friends again, like as they did [Technical Difficulty] the overall demand fundamentals are recovering, not necessarily pent-up demand. One other point, on page 9, if you ignore the first two months, it's April, May, the beginning of the pandemic, and you just draw a straight line across the averages. Even during the pandemic, we were running 80% leads, move-ins... And we had 20% of our communities closed at any given time. And so, people continue to move in as they have the need. Yes. So, the way I'd characterize Canada, maybe it's not around leads, it's more around just their move-in activity. Canada, a page you might look at is page 7, where at the top, there's a purple number 4. That really just marks when Canada had 75% of the communities vaccinated. You could see that's much later than the U.S. And the good news is, we know once we got there in the U.S. that the trends have been phenomenally strong. We would expect the same thing in Canada. So, there was a little bit of underperformance. You can see that on the next page, where Canada in March was negative 20 basis points. Obviously, U.S. was up 80 basis points during that time. So they're just lagging a little bit. The vaccines came later. They've been a good performer for us. We would expect them to come back as the vaccines are fully executed. Yes. I'd say, on the margin, there might be some of that. But, it's going to be relatively limited moving forward, once we get out -- the pandemic gets further behind us. So, we're definitely comfortable that margins come back. There's basically -- you name it. There's one free being given or there's waive in the community fees. There's just a kind of structurally lower rent being offered. Typically, care charges are never discounted. But, rent and community fees are fair game and operators tend to give them upfront. So, we can get the impact of the discounts behind us. But, there's a wide variety of discounting right now in the market. It's been relatively steady. Yes. It found its way into the system last fall, and it's been relatively steady. And like I said earlier, operators are starting to get very focused on local markets and pulling back on the discounting where they're already seeing recovery. One stat I'll mention that kind of supports that is that 16% of our communities, at the end of April, are back to pre-pandemic occupancies. So, you would imagine that they have pricing power now moving forward again. And so, operators are identifying those communities. They're starting to tighten a little bit on the discounting. And obviously, that will be supportive of NOI growth. Yes, sure. There's been a wide -- I'd say the recovery has been experienced in every geography. And there's been a little bit of difference. The only real meaningful difference that we can point to is really the south and the southeast. If you dig down into local markets, New York is one that comes to the mine that we visited recently. I would say, they had a very bad early experience with the pandemic. Several of those communities have very, very high leads and move-ins. And so, you're seeing some recovery happen in the Northeast. It's going to vary by asset type and price point. And there's a lot of shaking out to do, I think, before we really start calling markets or particular asset classes. It's still really early. But, the widespread recovery is very encouraging. Yes. I really can't comment on what the peers are seeing. But, just within our own markets and what we're seeing in terms of performance and leads and et cetera, there continues to be strong support for move-ins. And then, as I mentioned earlier, with move-outs being structurally lower, the strong support for netting. So, that's what we're seeing. That's a great question. And I can tell you that we're looking for those correlations, and we're not seeing them yet. What we know is that in the U.S., there's been widespread recovery. We know that Canada is lagging, but a traditionally very strong performer. And then, we'll study it closely as the trends materialize."

            "name": "Debra A. Cafaro",
            "content": "Thank you, Sarah. And good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants, and welcome to the Ventas first quarter 2021 earnings call. Let me start by saying that we believe the macro environment and the Ventas outlook have turned an important corner and that the worst of the pandemic is behind us. You have no idea how good it feels to say those words, even though we recognize that significant uncertainty remains. The whole Ventas team is actively engaged in taking steps to win the recovery for our stakeholders. These steps include making smart portfolio and capital allocation decisions, capturing the embedded upside in our high-quality senior housing portfolio, focusing on operational excellence and initiatives, investing in value-creating development and acquisition opportunities across our demographically-driven asset classes, attracting diverse, attractive capital, and maintaining financial strength and flexibility. I also think it's important to reiterate our gratitude and optimism. The widespread administration and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines have dramatically benefited the health and wellbeing of our senior residents and their caregivers, and also laid the foundation for sustained economic recovery. Let me first address senior housing trends and results. With respect to health and safety, I'm thrilled to report that our confirmed new resident cases in SHOP have fallen to literally a single person per day out of a resident population of 40,000. And all our communities are now open to new move-ins and most have reintroduced expanded visitation and communal activities. As a result, the natural, resilient and demographically-based demand for senior living has revised, and we've reached the cyclical pandemic occupancy bottom in our SHOP portfolio in mid-March. Since then, led by our U.S. SHOP community, which posted 280 basis points of growth, we grew SHOP spot occupancy 190 basis points through April 30th to nearly 78%. Our Canadian SHOP portfolio, which has maintained occupancy of over 91%, tempered the full SHOP occupancy growth because Canadian clinical conditions and regulatory measures are currently lagging those in the U.S. We do expect those to catch up over time. Notably, for the whole portfolio, March and April were the first two consecutive months when SHOP move-ins exceeded both, pre-pandemic move-in levels and move-outs since the start of the pandemic. In fact, move-ins during April at 1,880 totaled more move-ins in a single month than we've experienced at any time since June 2019. While many of these positive trends began in the first quarter and therefore did not fully benefit first quarter results, we are also pleased with those results. Our first quarter normalized FFO per share and SHOP performance came in ahead of our expectations. And our SHOP occupancy gains were at or above those reported by other market participants to date. The resilient and robust demand we are seeing for senior housing once again validates the need-based nature of our communities and the crucial role care providers play in facilitating longer, healthier lives for this portion of the nation's population, which is set to grow by over 2 million individuals over just the next few years. Supply trends in senior housing are also highly favorable. This combination of growing demographic demand and constrained supply creates a favorable backdrop for senior housing recovery, which represents an incredibly significant value-creation opportunity for our shareholders. The high quality of our senior housing portfolio, as Justin will describe, makes us well-positioned to recapture NOI and realize this upside. Turning to our capital allocation approach, we are confident of our ability to recycle about $1 billion through property dispositions in the second half of this year, and those are expected to enhance our enterprise. On the investment side, our attractive life science, research and innovation business continues to provide us with value-creating opportunities to invest capital. The Ventas portfolio, which now exceeds 9 million square feet, is located in three of the top five cluster markets and is affiliated with over 15 of the nation's top research universities. We are also investing in our active and just delivered ground-up developments in life science, research and innovation, which totaled nearly $1 billion in project costs. And I'm pleased to report that we also have another $1 billion in potential projects affiliated with major universities, right behind the four developments currently underway. We look forward to sharing more information on our exciting development pipeline with you, later this year. We recently expanded our life sciences business through our investment in a Class A portfolio of life science assets anchored by Johns Hopkins Medical, which we purchased at an attractive valuation of $600 per square foot. Located in the fourth largest life science cluster in the U.S., Hopkins is a global leader in research and medicine and the number one recipient of government research funding. This acquisition leverages our unique expertise at the intersection of universities, life sciences and academic medicine. In addition, we continue to invest capital in senior housing with our partner, Le Groupe Maurice in Quebec. LGM maintains a first-class brand, product and financial model for success. Our two most recently completed high-end communities with LGM opened in the fourth quarter and have already achieved 87% occupancy. We have three additional developments underway with LGM, representing nearly $300 million in aggregate project costs. Looking at the broader investment market, deal volume is again trending toward normalized levels. In a typical year, our deal team reviews over $30 billion in investment opportunities. Our pipeline of potential investments across our asset classes is active and growing, and we are on our front foot from an external growth standpoint. We have access to significant liquidity and a wide array of capital sources to fund deals. Our investment philosophy continues to be focused on growing reliable cash flow and favorable risk-adjusted return, taking into account factors such as market position and trajectory of the asset and business, cost per square footer unit, downside protection and ultimate potential for cash flow growth and asset appreciation. In closing, we believe we've turned an important corner. And key metrics in our business are showing meaningful improvement. The positive investment thesis for all of our demographically driven asset classes and for Ventas is pointing firmly positive. As a team at Ventas, we're really happy about the strength and stability we've shown and the recent upswing in economic, clinical and operating environment. We have an abiding commitment to win the recovery for all our stakeholders, and we are confident we're taking the right steps to do so. Thank you. Now to Justin. Amanda, this is Debbie. Good morning. I just want to welcome you. I think, this is your first time participating in our call. And we want to welcome you. But, I'll turn the hard work over to Justin to answer your question. Hi, Rich. This is not your first for Ventas. So, welcome, too, also. Congratulations. Great. Well, in the dispositions, we've commented that we expect it to be a combination of office and senior housing. And again, Justin is here to exercise his professional judgment in terms of how we can make dispositions, enhance our portfolio. And so, a year later, he's finally getting to that. But Justin, I don't know what you've been doing in between now and then. But, he's finally -- so that's how we're looking at the disposition side. And then, on the investment side, I would say, clearly, our priorities have been the Le Groupe Maurice ground-up development, which is a great business model and has done consistently really well. It's been, obviously, the life science with the South San Francisco and Hopkins investments, as well as the ground-up developments that our opening kind of seriatim here with the pipeline behind that. And of course, we continue to look at other health care asset classes and senior housing. So, I think we really are on our front foot across our asset classes, Rich. Well, I believe, first of all, the most important embedded upside that we have in the Company is recapturing and exceeding prior levels of NOI. And as I mentioned, we have every opportunity to do so. And then, of course, on the investment side, you could see external growth coming from that as well. Right. And even though -- yes, as you recall, we essentially collected 2.5 years' worth of full rent upfront. It gets run through the financial statements differently. And just a gratuitous comment, we're very pleased to see how Brookdale's reported numbers today and glad we have the warrants. It's both. I think, it will be a mixture of the ground-up development in senior housing, as we talked about, as well as life science and research and innovation. And we've always been an effective consolidator as we've grown, and we're starting to see that deal volume as we talked about. And so, I would expect there to be acquisitions as well, Jordan. They're in the pipeline at different stages. Some are already kind of out there, others are almost out there, and others are kind of on the way. So, it's a going through the system. Yes. I mean, we are evaluating that closely. And I would say that it is a matter of judgment and experience to make such a prediction. Here's what's interesting. Again, starts are dramatically better in the sense that, as Justin said, the first quarter was down gigantically from the peak, and then the lowest level since 2011. So that's really, really good. We know that really when you look forward in the near term that the most important thing is even if over the next couple of years things start to get on the drawing board, you're going to have this window of opportunity where you're going to have 3% to 4% CAGR on over 80 population, which ultimately spikes in 26, 27, over 6%, as you know. And you're going to have this window of time where the kind of embedded communities are going to have some really great supply-demand tailwinds in this sort of intermediate term. So, hard to say when they would pick up again. We know there are increased construction costs. We know there are supply chain issues. Those will probably delay some of the things that that would start. And we also know that rents right now may not be supportive of those higher construction costs. So, when you put all those things together, we like the forward runway as we come out of -- we really emerge post-pandemic into the recovery. And as you know, once we build the volume, we get the benefit of the in-place increases when you turn the page to 2022. And we have really been able to see pretty strong pricing power in that environment, even this January 1. And so that's really where you start to accrete in terms of the benefit of the volume that Justin is talking about. Again, we do highly subscribe to the benefits of diversification, Vikram. It has served us incredibly well over the years and particularly over the last year. We have always been big believers in the senior living business. We're excited that we have this recovery upside opportunity embedded in our portfolio now, and we intend to capture that. And also, we totally do intend to invest and acquire senior housing, assuming we find assets of equality and in markets where we think it's really going to provide good risk-adjusted return. But yes, we would certainly expect to have that in our acquisition buckets. Well, we talked about it a little bit. And good morning and welcome to you also. We talked about it a little bit. Construction costs are relatively high. We do know we have the growth in the 80-plus population, which is really fueling this demographic demand that we have. And right now, I think really with the existing investment basis that we have in senior housing, again, the big opportunity is to recover that. There is an opportunity to invest in this great business model that we have in Canada with LGM. We certainly would look at senior housing ground-up development in the U.S. because we do think there's -- because of the demand. But from a cost standpoint, I think we -- as we discussed, I think you'd have to be cautious to make sure that the returns penciled out commensurate with the risk. Yes. Very important question. Justin, why don't you address that? Yes. That's really not what we're hearing, and it very well could be just organic demand. So, there are -- go ahead, Justin. I mean, our bias really, Mike, is that this is organic demand that is based upon the need-based nature of the communities and the availability of the communities, then it is strong, resilient organic demand, and that's strong. And whether it's pent-up or not, we aren't hearing from good sources that if anything other than move-ins that would have moved in now anyway. I don't know if that makes it more clear, but go ahead, Justin. Yes. Right. Yes. I was actually looking at that on page 9 of the deck. And you can see that. There is -- and that's why I think we keep using this word, resilient, which I know we use frequently. But, it really is sustained need-based demand from a growing demographic, and that is very positive. Well, they could because when you think about it, if you -- maybe -- whatever you want to call it is okay with us. But, when you think about it, for example, when UnitedHealthcare reported and they said really that senior level medical procedures and surgeries and things really haven't bounced fully back, okay? And you connect that with what Justin said earlier that really a leading indicator of those kind of professional referrals would be really health care procedures. As those seniors start to have those procedures, If you look at that and then you see those professional referrals come back, you could characterize that if you want a pent-up demand as they had delayed those surgeries and so on. So, you could -- I don't want to quibble over words. I think, what's good is there's really good demand and we're seeing it come through and it's then two consecutive months, and we hope and are projecting for the second quarter that it will continue. Mike, thanks. And again, compliments on your life science report. Right. And also, we had -- we also had strong outperformance in the first quarter, and that's obviously helping that momentum. Well, thanks for wrapping the call up in a bow. I want to thank everyone who joined us this morning. We sincerely appreciate your participation and your interest in Ventas. And we look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thank you."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Ventas Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to BJ Grant, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nBJ Grant: Thanks, Regina. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Ventas fourth quarter financial results conference call. Yesterday, we issued our fourth quarter earnings release, supplemental investor package and presentation materials, which are available on the Ventas website at ir.ventasreit.com. As a reminder, remarks today may include forward-looking statements and other matters. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, all of which are available on the Ventas website. Certain non-GAAP financial measures will also be discussed on this call. And for a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to our supplemental posted on the Investor Relations website.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Debra A. Cafaro, Chairman and CEO.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Thanks, BJ, and good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants. Welcome to the Ventas fourth quarter and year-end 2022 earnings call. We are pleased to deliver a strong fourth quarter, which reflects the attractive operating and financial results of our diverse portfolio and the benefits of our key strategic initiatives. Fourth quarter normalized FFO was $0.73 per share, fueled by accelerating SHOP growth at 19%, record Medical Office Building performance and profitability from our third-party institutional capital management business, VIM. The demand fundamentals that support our business are strong and getting stronger across all Ventas asset classes, which are unified in serving the nation's large and growing aging population. After significant capital recycling and asset management actions, our diverse portfolio of high-quality senior living communities, Medical Office Buildings, R&I labs and other health care assets is well positioned to capitalize on these demand trends. In 2022, Ventas began what we believe will be a multiyear growth and recovery cycle led by SHOP and supported by favorable supply-demand fundamentals, actions we've taken in the portfolio and our post-pandemic rebound. In senior housing, there are compelling supply demand tailwinds. The over-80 population will grow at record levels in 2023. Yet, we continue to see construction as a percentage of inventory at its lowest level in five years and substantially better in Ventas markets. Over the last few years, we have taken decisive actions to position our SHOP portfolio to capitalize on this exciting demographically-led demand. We strengthened our team, enhanced our powerful analytic capabilities, rolled out the Ventas OI platform, sold, transitioned and acquired properties and invested capital in communities with strong market fundamentals, all to win the recovery. Benefiting from these trends and actions, we are well underway to recapturing the post-pandemic SHOP NOI opportunity. Our portfolio has already enjoyed significant occupancy and NOI growth from the COVID trough, and we see even more recapture potential ahead of us in the coming years as we first seek to reach 2019 performance levels and then hopefully exceed them. Bob also took significant steps to maintain our financial strength and flexibility and improve our balance sheet and liquidity. These actions garnered three positive credit rating moves in 2022 and reduced our 2023 maturities to a very manageable level. In 2022, we also continued our long history of value creation with $1.2 billion of new investments, often with key partners. These include the $425 million Atrium Health/Wake Forest University School of Medicine Development in Charlotte, North Carolina; $200 million in senior housing investments, including the acquisition of Mangrove Bay and a new development with Le Groupe Maurice, both in very attractive markets; and $300 million in MOB investments highlighted by the acquisition of an 18-property MOB portfolio leased to Ardent. Finally, we remain committed to our values, including our ESG leadership. We accelerated our progress in 2022 as we further diversified and elevated our Board and made a bold commitment to achieve net zero operational carbon emissions by 2040. These efforts will be advanced under the leadership of our General Counsel, Carey Roberts, who has the passion and experience to move us forward. Now, we enter 2023 with strong momentum. Today, we are pleased to introduce full year normalized FFO guidance representing 5% growth at the midpoint. We are projecting unprecedented organic growth in our portfolio, once again driven by SHOP, and complemented by the positive compounding contributions of our office business led by Pete. We also will continue to build out our VIM business, which already has over $5 billion in assets under management, and mine our non-property investments for value as evidenced by both the pending Ardent equity stake sale and our recently completed Atria Glennis software deal while we also seek to optimize the outcome in our Santerre loan. Finally, we will continue to invest capital wherever we find compelling opportunities to sustain and reinforce our new cycle of success. The macroeconomic assumptions underlying our forecast include some slowing of the economy, moderating inflation, softening labor conditions, and continued, albeit less aggressive Fed tightening. Against that backdrop and in many other likely scenarios, we believe our business is relatively advantaged because demographic demand for our assets is large, growing and resilient, we have demonstrated strong pricing power in SHOP and softening economic conditions should benefit our operations in multiple ways. One final note. In January, Justin assumed the additional role of Chief Investment Officer at Ventas. I know you want to join me in congratulating Justin, and I want to thank him for his continued leadership, which has been instrumental in our success and positive outlook. Working with our strong teams, Justin will use his experience and insights to create value by making good investments across our asset classes, enhancing the connection between our investment activity and business operations and deploying the powerful Ventas OI platform across our organization. And now I'm happy to turn the call over to the man himself. Justin?\nJustin Hutchens : Thank you, Debbie. I'll start by noting how excited I am about the execution in our SHOP portfolio. Over the past few years, we have taken many actions to put ourselves in a position to achieve positive performance as we aim to recapture NOI in this multiyear growth and recovery cycle. We have been successful executing portfolio actions, which include over 50 triple-net communities converted to SHOP and over 130 transition to new operators. We've acquired over 100 new communities and executed 30 dispositions and 8 new developments. Finally, we have over 100 communities that are in the process of getting refreshed and are expected to complete during the key selling season. I am really proud of our tremendous team that supports our senior housing business and has executed Ventas OI, our approach to collaborative oversight where we leverage our operating expertise and best-in-class data analytics to the benefit of our operating partners to drive positive results, which has gained tremendous momentum. Our programmatic approach addresses two priorities in parallel: first, timely market, financial and operating insights to influence near-term performance and revenue-enhancing capital expenditures; second, tackling key strategic challenges that will deepen our competitive advantage and maximize the long-term value of our portfolio. Now I'll cover the fourth quarter SHOP results in our year-over-year same-store pool of 478 communities. Our SHOP portfolio continues to perform really well. The fourth quarter was ahead of our expectations while delivering excellent year-over-year growth due to pricing power, occupancy growth and moderating expenses. NOI in our Q4 year-over-year pool grew 19.1%, which is above the midpoint of our SHOP guidance range and includes 22.2% growth in the U.S., led by Sunrise and Atria, while Canada demonstrated positive growth again with 11.7% led by Le Groupe Maurice. I would like to thank all of our operating partners for their significant achievements delivering excellent services and care and financial results. We continue to benefit from operating leverage, even at this relatively low occupancy, resulting in margin improvement from 23% in Q3 to 23.6% in Q4. Same-store average occupancy grew year-over-year by 140 basis points to 82.5%. Revenue in the quarter grew ahead of expectations, increasing 8.3% year-over-year due to continued acceleration in RevPOR growth and positive trends in occupancy. Pricing power continues to impress. At 6.5% year-over-year growth, RevPOR is the strongest we've seen in the last 10 years, primarily driven by in-house rent and care increases and improving re-leasing spreads. As expected, expenses were $4.7 million per day. As a reminder, our year-over-year expense growth peaked in Q2 2022 at 11%. It reduced to 8% in Q3 and was lower again in Q4 at 6%. Leading indicators in the U.S. remain strong as we experience leads as a percentage of 2019 at 120%, move-ins at 101% and outs at 101%. Canada continues to deliver growth and high occupancy at 95%. Demand accelerated in January with move-ins at 104% over 2019 in the U.S. and 111% in Canada. Now I will cover 2023 SHOP guidance and our expanded same-store year-over-year pool, which includes 508 communities representative of 92% of our portfolio. There are three primary drivers of our positive outlook: occupancy growth, rate growth and moderating expenses. SHOP same-store cash NOI is expected to accelerate from 13.4% growth in 2022 to growth in the range of 15% to 21% year-over-year in 2023. The low and high end of the guidance range is driven by occupancy and expense performance. We expect margin expansion of 200 basis points at our midpoint. We anticipate year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 8% at the midpoint of the same-store cash NOI guidance range driven by continued strong rate growth and occupancy growth of 130 basis points to 170 basis points. With the deployment of our Ventas OI platform and excellent execution by our operators, we are able to achieve substantial rent increases this season of approximately 10%. This in combination with improved care pricing, rising street rates, and typical resident attrition results in about 6% expected RevPOR growth in 2023. It\u2019s important to note that 80% of our revenue growth in 2023 will be driven by the RevPOR growth, much of which has already been realized as over half of our resident population have already received the rent increases.  In regards to occupancy growth, we project that more residents will move into our communities in 2023 compared to prior year. We also project our net move-ins to be higher. However, we expect to return to more normal seasonal occupancy patterns, which include typical clinical conditions and slightly elevated financial move-outs in the first quarter. We expect a significant occupancy ramp throughout the year, supported by an accelerating aging demographic and muted new supply translating to about 150 basis points of year-over-year average occupancy improvements in 2023. We also expect moderating inflationary expense impacts and lower contract labor year-over-year, with overall expense growth expected to be around 5%. Through the execution of initiatives to improve employee recruitment and retention, we have had five consecutive quarters of net hiring, which are providing the tailwinds needed to stabilize the workforce and support the moderation of expenses. Moving on to investments. I'm really excited to work with our deeply experienced investments team in my newly expanded responsibilities. I am very pleased to step into a situation where I can work to continue our strong track record and expert capital allocation. We have a wealth of existing relationships across our targeted asset classes of senior housing, life science and R&I and medical office. I look forward to contributing to the ongoing success of our investment platform by combining the advantages embedded in the enterprise with my extensive network and investment experience to drive external growth. I look forward to expanding Ventas OI across the enterprise to drive portfolio optimization, external growth and refresh redev capital across our senior housing and office portfolios. We will continue to pick our spots in investments and work with our best-in-class partners on attractive opportunities. Moving forward, I am confident in the demand drivers of the business and believe we are well positioned to continue this positive trajectory. Bob?\nBob Probst : Thanks, Justin. I'm going to share some highlights on our fourth quarter performance, touch on our balance sheet and close with our 2023 outlook.  To start, we are proud of the fourth quarter results. Throughout 2022, we were accurate in our forecasts and followed our mantra to do what we say. In the fourth quarter, normalized FFO was $0.73, at the higher end of our guidance range. Fourth quarter property growth was particularly strong, with total company and SHOP same-store cash NOI growth of 8.5% and 19.1%, respectively. I'd like to give a shout-out to Pete Bulgarelli and our Office team. Office had a great year, growing same-store cash NOI by 3.8% in fiscal year '22. And that Office result was led by our MOB business, which posted some outstanding metrics, including strong leasing performance with same-store year-end occupancy of 92%, the highest level since 2017. Tenant satisfaction measures exceeded 93% of all MOBs. Same-store operating expenses increased just 2.6% year-on-year, well below inflation. And as a result, full year '22 MOB same-store cash NOI grew 3.4%, the highest on record for the company. R&I also posted attractive organic performance, growing same-store cash NOI by 5.1% in the full year '22, led by leasing at higher rates and solid expense management. I'd highlight two other items in the fourth quarter. We earned our first promote approximating $0.02 per share as a general partner of the Ventas Fund, which was $0.01 better than our guidance. We're also eligible to earn further promotes in 2023. Second, we recognized a $20 million noncash CECL allowance on our $486 million mezzanine loan investment to Santerre Health Investors. Interest coverage on the loan has declined through year-end, but the loan remained fully current through January 2023 and full interest is expected in February. Next, a few comments on our balance sheet. Over the last two years, we enhanced our portfolio and strengthened our balance sheet through $1.3 billion in asset dispositions and loan repayments with proceeds used to reduce near-term debt. We also issued $2.7 billion of new debt in that period, extending duration at attractive pricing before the run-up in interest rates. As a result, we have just 4% of our consolidated debt or under $500 million coming due in 2023. And we've made good progress towards this refinancing, having locked in all-in cash rates of 4.2% on nearly 2/3 of this requirement. Consistent with our long-held risk management approach to maintain 10% to 20% in floating rate debt, 12% of our consolidated debt was floating in the fourth quarter. We have plans to issue $500 million in new secured fixed rate debt with proceeds designated to pay down floating rate debt in 2023, which would bring our floating rate debt to the lower end of our targeted range. We have significant liquidity of $2.4 billion at year-end 2022. And finally, our net debt to adjusted pro forma EBITDA improved by 30 basis points to 6.9x in the fourth quarter, with SHOP NOI growth steadily moving that ratio back toward our pre-pandemic target range. Last but not least, I'm extremely pleased to reintroduce full year 2023 guidance. This is tangible evidence that we are in a post-pandemic world, and our guidance demonstrates the exciting post-pandemic organic property growth opportunity for Ventas. The key components for our '23 guidance are as follows: net income attributable to common stockholders is estimated to range between $0.20 and $0.34 per fully diluted share. Normalized FFO is forecast to range from $2.90 to $3.04 per share. We expect our portfolio same-store cash NOI to grow 7.5% at the midpoint, led by SHOP same-store cash NOI growth of 18% at the midpoint. Our '23 FFO guidance at the midpoint of $2.97 represents growth year-over-year of 5% or $0.13 per share against the rebased 2022. The FFO bridge describing the $0.13 is straightforward with two main drivers: first, we expect $0.29 from outstanding year-over-year organic property growth in SHOP; and second and partially offsetting is a $0.16 reduction, principally from the impact of higher interest rates. A stronger U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar and the pound is also a contributor. Other guidance items include receipt of over $300 million in capital recycling proceeds, no additional promote revenue, G&A approximating $151 million at the midpoint and 404 million weighted average fully diluted shares. The low and high end of our FFO guidance range are largely described by changes in the macro environment, including potential changes in inflation expectations and interest rates. A few thoughts on phasing of our normalized FFO through the year. We expect FFO in the first quarter of '23 to be roughly flat to the fourth quarter of '22 of $0.71 when adjusted for the $0.02 promote received in the fourth quarter, with the first quarter of '23 is the seasonal low point for SHOP. As the key selling season in SHOP kicks in and interest rates plateau, FFO growth is expected to pick up in the balance of '23. A more fulsome discussion of our '23 guidance can be found in the earnings and outlook presentation posted to our website. To close, we entered 2023 with momentum. The entire Ventas team is fully engaged and excited to deliver on our '23 plans and to reignite a new cycle of success for the company and our shareholders.  And that concludes our prepared remarks. For Q&A, we ask each caller to stick to one question to be respectful to everyone on the line.  With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.\nJoshua Dennerlein : I just want to ask about that Santerre Health Investors loan. Could you just provide more background why the allowance? And then, Debbie, I think you mentioned you're looking to optimize the outcome. So kind of just help us think through like the outcomes that you're expecting.\nDebra A. Cafaro : Sure. The loan is part of our normal business. Over the last five years, I think we've collected about $1.7 billion in loans that we've made on health care properties or to health care operators. This particular loan took a $20 million allowance in the quarter. And we continue to be current in terms of interest, receipt of interest payments. And it's under some compression of coverage because some of the assets haven't recovered from COVID while interest rates have been increasing. And so it's really a timing issue if you want to think about it that way. And so we would expect to work through that, and we have a lot of experience and tools and rights at our disposal to do that.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho.\nVikram Malhotra : I just wanted to understand in your deck, you outlined potential CapEx investments, I guess, in SHOP and maybe triple-net to position the portfolio. I'm wondering, the CapEx was a little elevated in the fourth quarter. So I'm wondering if you can give us a sense of just like the magnitude of these investments over the next, call it, two or three years to achieve what you want with the portfolio and perhaps tie those CapEx to the bridge you've outlined in terms of the SHOP NOI growth.\nJustin Hutchens : It's Justin. I'll start, and Bob you probably want to jump in. First of all, it is a large initiative. We have 100 communities that are in the process of being refreshed. We do believe that it will be impactful. It's about $1 million of pop. It should help improve performance. Certainly, we've considered that when we gave our guidance for 2023. And there's more to do. But at this stage, we picked our highest priorities and we've been executing aggressively. So we look forward to these projects coming online during the key selling season.\nBob Probst : I'd add, the $1 million of pop, we've mentioned 100 properties, that's obviously $100 million. The timing of that clearly isn't all in one quarter. It will be spread over the course of time. But these are NOI-generating opportunities. ROI-generating opportunities are indeed embedded in the forecast we've given you in terms of the NOI growth. And I believe top use of our cash, best use of our cash is to reinvest in these assets, given the backdrop of SHOP and in senior housing.\nVikram Malhotra : And sorry, could you just clarify this $100 million, is that this year or is it spread out? I'm just trying to tie it back to ultimately the FAD growth coming through because if these are multiple years of $100 million, then maybe the FAD growth gets depressed.\nBob Probst : Well, first of all, we started this last year. So you mentioned the fourth quarter seeing some acceleration. That clearly is part of it. Second point to make is just in terms of classification of the CapEx spend. This is ROI generating a redev. So you'll see that acceleration in readout. At the same time, FAD CapEx will increase. Again, the top priority is investing behind our SHOP assets. So you'll see that increase at the same time. But it's a multiyear program.\nDebra A. Cafaro : And it's a multiyear NOI impact as well we will see going forward. We'll be investing into this multiyear recovery in senior housing and the supply-demand fundamentals in our market.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.\nRonald Kamdem : Just a quick two-parter. Thanks for the presentation. It was super helpful. Two things. The first was just the leading indicators and the lead generators being pretty strong, both in 4Q and January. Maybe just a little bit more color on what that's capturing conversion rates. Just thought that was really interesting. And then the second piece is, I think on the end of the presentation, you talked about sort of a $900 million SHOP NOI opportunity with all things said and done. If you take a step back, just curious how you guys are thinking about sort of the margin profile at that point versus pre COVID?\nDebra A. Cafaro : Well, Ronald, we're glad you like the deck. We obviously pride ourselves on our analytics, but your old colleague, BJ Grant, is helping us put it in the best format for our external constituencies. So we're glad that you like it. And I'll turn it over to Justin to start to answer your question.\nJustin Hutchens : Sure. So in regards to leading indicators, you've noted they're looking really good. We've had, we think, the highest fourth quarter lead volumes on record in terms of leads. Movements were solid. You noted the conversion rate. We had an operator that put in place a website upgrade intra month in December. It slowed down leads, a bit slowdown move-ins. Those move-ins have since recovered in January already, so no worries there. We expect to follow normal seasonal trends. And so you'll see move-outs be a little bit higher. We've had -- it's normal to have additional clinical move-outs. It's normal to have additional financial move-outs. And then so far in January, we're off to a strong start with move-ins at 104% of 2019 in the U.S., 111% in Canada. So all looking pretty good from a leading indicator standpoint. In regards to the margin question, there's 1 thing that we're all excited about. Obviously, Debbie noted it, I noted it, and that's the pricing power. That's really helped to accelerate our margin expansion. Occupancy growth does as well. So we do anticipate margins to continue to expand. And also, to Debbie's point, we're anticipating and hoping to get back to that 2019 level again. And margins will -- should settle out but also should continue to grow because of the strong demand for the senior housing sector.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.\nMichael Carroll : Just regarding to your SHOP same-store growth forecast. Is there a meaningful difference between the legacy same-store assets versus the new properties coming in, in terms of growth? I mean, I think that a lot of the new stuff being added from new seniors, so is the growth profile of the new senior assets different than the legacy same-store portfolio?\nDebra A. Cafaro : Mike, I'm glad you asked that, and I'm going to ask Bob to answer it.\nBob Probst : Yes. Mike, I'd say, first off, all the pools, all of the operators are contributing really attractive growth across the board literally as you look at it. This is broad-based growth in recovery and improvement across the portfolio. And you mentioned new senior, new senior importantly part of that contribution. And when you look at the fourth quarter of '22, you'll see almost the same asset pool, and that growth in the fourth quarter reflects that broad-based strength.\nDebra A. Cafaro : Yes. I mean, what I think you should like about it is we now have the vast majority of our SHOP business in the same-store pool. So that makes it more meaningful for investors to understand the performance of the business.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.\nSteve Sakwa : Justin, I guess I was just hoping you could speak a little bit about the occupancy growth. You picked up, I think, 300 basis points in '22. Your forecast is for 150 at the midpoint this year. So I'm trying to figure out, was the 300 maybe picking up low-hanging fruit in the early parts of the recovery and the 150 is a more normalized pace? Or do you think the 150 is a bit of a slowdown as you have maybe got a bit of a cautious view towards the economy? I'm just trying to reconcile that with the leads and the move-ins that you sort of talked about.\nJustin Hutchens : Yes, that's a great question. So let me start with describing the 300 basis points, and I want to relate it to seasonality. When we grew 300 basis points in 2022, we had two things helping that growth metric. One was that Q1 of '22 performed better than typical seasonality. So very strong start in '22. There really wasn't much clinical activity at all. And so that was helping us. It was also comparing to a prior year, Q1 of '21, that was pandemic impacted. So you have a stronger start in '22 and you have a favorable comparison. Moving ahead into '23, I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we're experiencing normal seasonality. So we have a lower starting point in Q1, so effectively Q1 has lower occupancy than Q4. It's in line with normal seasonality. Typically, you see about 100 basis points change downward from Q4 to Q1. And then what we'll see this year is an acceleration in growth. And as I said, we're expecting more move-ins. We're expecting more net move-ins. So in fact, the growth rate in '23 will be stronger. The effective growth rate is stronger, but the average overall is at the midpoint of 150 basis points of growth.\nDebra A. Cafaro : Because of timing in phasing.\nJustin Hutchens : Right, exactly. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James.\nJonathan Hughes : I appreciate the full year guidance and the confidence in the seniors housing recovery that providing that outlook conveys. But I was hoping you could give us the SHOP NOI growth guidance breakdown between the U.S. and Canada. Canada seems to have been where some of the upside versus guidance came in the fourth quarter. But I know there are price restrictions and some providence is north of the border. I'd just that breakdown between the U.S. and Canada for this year would be helpful.\nJustin Hutchens : It's Justin. Well, everything is included in the full year guidance in '23. And as Bob said, everyone is contributing. Canada is at a higher occupancy. It does tend to generate less growth overall, but it is contributing growth and we'd expect the U.S. to be on the higher end of the average of the guidance range, Canada a little bit on the lower side, but with everyone contributing to the growth.\nBob Probst : I would just -- I'd emphasize 95% occupancy in Canada and we delivered 12% growth in the fourth quarter. That business is performing well. But obviously, the U.S. is the engine driving the overall midpoint.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Michael Griffin with Citi.\nMichael Griffin : Justin, in your conversations with your operating partners, can you give us a sense what the better performing partners are doing right on the labor side of the equation? And then conversely, for those that might be underperforming, what the plan is to bring them sort of up to snuff? And ultimately, if they're not performing, could you look to transition that maybe to some of your better partners? But any expansion there would be great.\nJustin Hutchens : Sure. Well, first of all, really similar to how everyone is contributing to the NOI growth in '23, all of our operating partners are contributing to the improvement in managing the labor cost and it's done a few ways. One was to professionalize the recruitment of line staff where that had been a local priority. It's become a central priority for operators. That's done through automation. It's also done by gearing your recruitment professionals towards that person. There\u2019s more emphasis on retention as well. There was wage increases at our competitors that were put in place all the way back starting in '21 and throughout '22 to help to be more competitive. And then just extra emphasis where you have -- the leading indicator is always agency which we probably noted in our numbers that\u2019s been coming down. But the communities entering agency or markets entering agency, that\u2019s an indicator to make, put additional focus on that locality.  So really good execution. And there has been, I think, changes that have been made that will be lasting in terms of just process improvement.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO\nJuan Sanabria: Just a question on FAD CapEx, maybe to piggyback off of Vikram\u2019s question. Just curious I guess what the guide is for what we should be thinking about is in the '23 guide? And then as well as maybe little bit of color on what gets included in the ICE versus normal FAD CapEx. if I kind of add the two together and compare that to the average units for '22, it implies about $2,300, $2,400 per unit per year, which seems a little low given the inflation. So just curious on cap rate, kind of what we should be expecting for the year?\nDebra A. Cafaro : Well, I mean start out with the principle that FAD CapEx is really routine recurring non-income producing kind of steady state activity. And then Bob will go further.\nBob Probst : The second premise is, ICE is really function of either transitioned or acquired assets, bringing up to market standard. And part of what you will see in '23 versus '22 is a reduction, significant reduction in ICE because -- simply because we haven\u2019t had that activity in the last call it a year. So that flushes out of the system. Bringing you back to core CapEx in FAD, which I would expect to see some acceleration in, I mentioned that earlier. Again, our best use of cash to invest behind the properties, both front of house and back of house. So you will see an increase in that. And more meaningfully, the increase in redev, which is really these front-of-house refresh ROI projects, which we mentioned a $100 million number as a placeholder. So both will be going up. I think net-net-net, I would think about it in terms of the bottom line FAD contribution in 2023 also growing driven by the cash flows of the properties.\nJuan Sanabria: Any dollar guidance for total CapEx spend then?\nBob Probst : No, simply the change. I'll give you a redev up by $100 million as a year-on-year as a number.\nDebra A. Cafaro : You've got something out of him, Juan.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Credit Suisse.\nTayo Okusanya : A quick question on the guidance side. Again, very strong underlying fundamentals built in '23. I'm trying to understand a little bit more about some of the kind of the drags on the numbers, if I may use that word, that results in the guidance. And specifically on the interest and FX side, trying to understand the FX assumptions being made and quantitatively how much of a drag that is on earnings this year, in case FX becomes better than expected? And also trying to understand the assumptions around the $500 million of refinancing that's baked into the numbers, exactly what kind of rates are you expecting to refinance that at?\nBob Probst : Great. I'll take that. So Page 14 of the deck we posted yesterday is helpful here because it really focuses on the impact of rising interest rates. Of the $0.16 I noted in the bridge, the vast majority is interest rates. And the vast majority of that is really the curve on floating rate that we see and show in the deck. FX is a contributor but a small contributor. And in large part because we have, in Canada, Canadian debt, and that's a natural hedge to what is a stronger U.S. dollar, which is having translation impact on NOI. So that's the primary driver. In terms of the $500 million this year of refinancing, again, that's in Canada, principally. And we've been able to secure some attractive pricing on mortgages in Canada. That's going to be a key source of funds as well as some agency debt here in the U.S., which we're planning to issue, which we'll use to pay down floating rate debt. And those are really the two key drivers of the guidance in terms of refinancing.\nOtayo Okusanya : And specifically for the $500 million, could you give us a sense of what the new rate is going to be versus the old rate?\nDebra A. Cafaro : Well, I mean it depends on the 10-year.\nBob Probst : Yes, it depends on the 10-year. In the 5s would be a reasonable expectation, depending on where the 10-year is.\nOtayo Okusanya : Okay, great. Pete, you're giving me 2% to 3% MOB next year. Going down, but I still like it.\nPeter Bulgarelli : We're feeling good.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.\nNicholas Yulico : I just also in terms of the guidance, a question on the $300 million of capital recycling proceeds that you're getting. If you could just give the breakdown on the loan repayments versus property dispositions in that number. And as a second on that would just be how we should think about your using those proceeds? I mean, are you earmarking for debt paydown, acquisitions or development? Any color there would be helpful.\nDebra A. Cafaro : Nick, it's Debbie. On the $300 million, a couple of hundred million as we show in the deck, is based on office dispos, some of which are purchase option-driven. There's a -- we got full repayment on a Freddie Mac loan in January, that was $43 million, I think, at a double-digit interest rate. We got paid in full on that. And then the balance is other small items.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC.\nRichard Anderson : So I want to talk about the supply side of the house. As some people may not remember, the senior housing business was not in a great spot prior to the pandemic because of oversupply. And I know that you trended down. It's trending down substantially as shown in Page 11 of your deck. But the rule of thumb for supply is, in my mind, is if you're anywhere over 2% of existing stock, it's on the table as a possible problem. So tell me why even though it's down substantially over the past five years, that, that comp year of five years ago was not a great fundamental period for the business. So tell me why this is a good thing beyond just the optics of it being down. And also what you think the window is for you to sort of see this ramp in demand that we're all seeing and expecting. And when you think supply starts to sort of muddle in the story again because it certainly will, particularly with development costs coming down now. So if you could comment more color on that, that would be great.\nDebra A. Cafaro : Good. I mean, it all starts with the demand side, as you know, with the record 80-plus population growth in 2023. In terms of supply, I would analogize where we are to a little bit after the financial crisis because during those years, construction and development starts, obviously, were paused for a period of time because of the great financial crisis. And this is similar really to what we're seeing from kind of the pre-COVID period that you referenced but then also kind of during COVID and then continuing now because costs are still quite high, particularly capital costs. I mean, construction loans are extremely expensive now. And so the costs remain, for the time being, very high. And there's -- would tend to be because starts are really low in our markets, Justin can give you the specifics. But we believe we have a good multiyear window here where we know kind of the demand profile and can capture that while, at the same time, deliveries should remain muted, very muted because they'll be seeing the effects, again, much like we did after the financial crisis, where deliveries were low. And I think at that point, occupancies got up in and around the 92% level. And that's really where we want to be able to see if we can get back to that kind of 92% level in this nice window that we have and kind of that's the game plan.\nJustin Hutchens : Yes. I mean, I think you summed it up perfectly. I would just point out again that the 80-plus population, what's different from that period is growing at record levels and will continue to for the next several years. So that's obviously very supportive on the demand side. Supply, most are supplemental, we have starts. In our top markets, it's like -- it's in the basis points. It's like 10 basis points, exceptionally low. And that supports the window that Debbie is describing over the next few years. And this is a sector that has tremendous demand fundamentals. So the capital we'll see through those and will bring supply eventually. But we do have a window that's formed that's really exciting and supportive of the recovery that we've been talking about.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.\nMichael Mueller : I'm curious for SHOP. Should the RevPOR growth moderate a lot in '24 and '25, just given the pace of how your expense growth has been moderating?\nJustin Hutchens : So it's Justin. So I'm going to go back to what I was just talking about, which is demand. So another part of this is just affordability in our markets, which is very high and there's demand for the services. So you have the combination of people needing the service and people having the ability to pay. And with numbers that we've never seen before in terms of demand at the doorstep. So that should be supportive of pricing power moving forward. There's always some sensitivity relative to inflation and CPI. But what you're really working to do to generate earnings growth is to create a spread. And we've been effective in doing that in this cycle.\nDebra A. Cafaro : And you would think as you take capacity out of the market through higher occupancies, that you may maintain some all or more of this pricing power.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank.\nDerek Johnston : On SHOP OpEx release and specific to labor costs and agency, pre pandemic, I don't recall agency labor being material at all or even utilized outside of very special situations. So there's been improvement, no doubt. But how do you plan to get agency labor out of your centers? And can you achieve pre-pandemic levels of agency labor by year-end '23?\nJustin Hutchens : It's Justin. You're absolutely right. Agency was close to zero pre-pandemic. Obviously, there's been big shifts in the labor market since then. And we've had it enter our sector as others. We've managed to bring it down, which you've noted. In our 2023 guidance, we assume lower agency than we did in '22 year-over-year. And so that's supportive of our moderating expenses. But we are, in fact, carrying that Q4 run rate, which is like 2% of revenue forward throughout the year. There is -- I mentioned in my prepared remarks the guidance range. It assumes lower expenses and more occupancy at the top end, works the other way on the bottom. So we've incorporated that into our thinking. But we're anticipating that agency remains relatively stable.\nDebra A. Cafaro : And this is true across healthcare at large and is principally a function of the labor force participation rate and other kind of macro factors. And the key is really to take the actions at the hiring level that Justin mentioned about positive net hiring, where you're at least getting your fair share of that workforce.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays.\nSteven Valiquette : So just on the SHOP, you talked about the seasonality earlier. But on Slide 18 of the presentation, you talk about expecting normal historical seasonality in 1Q '23 versus 4Q '22. It's a little bit of a sensitive subject, but I guess to the extent that high flu prevalence historically leads to, let's call it, elevated levels of resident expirations, I thought that would have been a trend that maybe would hurt occupancy a little bit in the fourth quarter, just given the normal spike in flu happened so much earlier this season in the fourth quarter instead of 1Q. And then inversely, with flu really kind of falling off dramatically here in 1Q '23, I would have thought the historical downtick maybe would not really happen this year in 1Q. So hopefully, all that kind of makes sense. I just wanted to get your thoughts on the early flu potentially altering some of the normal seasonal trend.\nJustin Hutchens : Yes. So great points or observations. I'll start with the clinical side. The clinical side, I would just describe as kind of normal. It's certainly wasn't representative of the headlines that they were around flu. It's very normal kind of typical seasonality in both December and so far in January. We have had financial move-outs, which is also typical around this time because I mentioned over half of our residents received their in-house rent increases. And we've also mentioned they're relatively high this year as well. So that's contributing to the move-out trend and which is normal. That's kind of the point I was trying to make, and we're -- in that regard, we're kind of back to normal trends. And then from a move-in expectation standpoint and net move-in expectation standpoint, we expect those to continue to improve due to the demand at the doorstep.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Tao Qiu with Stifel.\nTao Qiu : So Justin, the SHOP guidance assumes a 6% RevPOR growth, which is kind of slowly -- slightly lower than the higher single digit and even 10% in-place rate increase that some senior housing operators have been talking about. So could you talk -- could you comment on the expectation on the moving rates in the current promotional activities? Are you still expecting the positive re-leasing spreads for 2023? And as a quick follow-up, on the Colony loan, how much of the $50 million annualized interest income did you take off the guidance?\nJustin Hutchens : How about I'll start with the pricing question? There's a page in the deck for those that have it, Page 20, that addresses this. First, the contributors to RevPOR, strong in-house rent increases running around 10%; care pricing, 11%; and then street rates have increased as well. So really, everything is going up in that regards. One thing about care, it's adjustable throughout the year, represents about 15% of our RevPOR. And then there's just normal attrition, typical attrition. And so in other words, not every resident is receiving the full benefit of these increases throughout the whole year. So that's why you're seeing a 6% RevPOR rather than around 10%, which the numbers above might indicate.\nDebra A. Cafaro : And then on Colony, I would say there's a range of outcomes basically bracketing the FFO contribution in 2022.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street.\nJohn Pawlowski : I just had a follow-up question on the mezzanine loan. Can you remind me what loan-to-value range your mezz tranche set out in the capital stack when you originated the loan? And then can you give us a sense for what magnitude of NOI increases are needed at these properties to fully service the debt? Because I believe the interest rate is LIBOR plus 640 bps and that's really, really painful for cash flows. And so just any thoughts on how you got comfortable about not taking a larger impairment would be helpful.\nDebra A. Cafaro : Sure. I mean, I think again, as we said, there's a post-COVID impact on some of the assets and rates have increased. The full loan stack is really closer to [L plus 3], 330-ish, if you will, in the senior and the junior. And so the original underwriting was very conventional, kind of 75%, 80% LTV. And so it's just a timing mismatch, if you will. And the borrower, we believe, is taking actions on the portfolio side. And the rates are the rates, and so we value the collateral in making our decision at the 12/31 balance sheet and made reasonable, consistent assumptions about valuation.\nJohn Pawlowski : On the timing mismatch. If rates stay where they are, when will NOI operating income start to fully cover the loans?\nDebra A. Cafaro : Well, it's being paid now so it's covering the loan. So interest is being paid.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Dave Rodgers with Baird.\nDavid Rodgers : Probably for you, Justin. In terms of capital deployment this year, you guys put out, I think, $1.2 billion last year. Where are you seeing kind of the best opportunities today outside of the redevelopment, which you've mentioned earlier in the call? But are you seeing more opportunities commercially to put more money to work in life science or MOB? Or do you think it will continue to be in SHOP by bringing new portfolios on? I guess, what are the biggest dislocations today in your mind? And how much are you interested in taking advantage of those?\nJustin Hutchens : Yes. So first of all, we're fortunate to have a wide variety of capital sources to further acquisitions. We'll prioritize our key asset classes, senior housing, obviously, is one of those, life science, Medical Office as well. The market itself is not normal. There's exceptions to this, but there tends to be fewer market participants right now. The deals that that we're seeing are getting repriced. Again, there's exceptions to that. Pricing could be unclear on the stabilized assets. But we remain very interested in expanding the portfolio and growing in our preferred asset classes.\nOperator: At this time, I'll turn the conference back over to management for any concluding remarks.\nDebra A. Cafaro : Thank you so much. I want to sincerely thank everyone for joining us on the call today. We really appreciate your interest in the company. We look forward to seeing you. We're all very optimistic and aligned around our 2023 momentum and opportunities and are ready to get after it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's meeting. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bob Probst",
            "content": "Thanks, Justin. I'm going to share some highlights on our fourth quarter performance, touch on our balance sheet and close with our 2023 outlook.  To start, we are proud of the fourth quarter results. Throughout 2022, we were accurate in our forecasts and followed our mantra to do what we say. In the fourth quarter, normalized FFO was $0.73, at the higher end of our guidance range. Fourth quarter property growth was particularly strong, with total company and SHOP same-store cash NOI growth of 8.5% and 19.1%, respectively. I'd like to give a shout-out to Pete Bulgarelli and our Office team. Office had a great year, growing same-store cash NOI by 3.8% in fiscal year '22. And that Office result was led by our MOB business, which posted some outstanding metrics, including strong leasing performance with same-store year-end occupancy of 92%, the highest level since 2017. Tenant satisfaction measures exceeded 93% of all MOBs. Same-store operating expenses increased just 2.6% year-on-year, well below inflation. And as a result, full year '22 MOB same-store cash NOI grew 3.4%, the highest on record for the company. R&I also posted attractive organic performance, growing same-store cash NOI by 5.1% in the full year '22, led by leasing at higher rates and solid expense management. I'd highlight two other items in the fourth quarter. We earned our first promote approximating $0.02 per share as a general partner of the Ventas Fund, which was $0.01 better than our guidance. We're also eligible to earn further promotes in 2023. Second, we recognized a $20 million noncash CECL allowance on our $486 million mezzanine loan investment to Santerre Health Investors. Interest coverage on the loan has declined through year-end, but the loan remained fully current through January 2023 and full interest is expected in February. Next, a few comments on our balance sheet. Over the last two years, we enhanced our portfolio and strengthened our balance sheet through $1.3 billion in asset dispositions and loan repayments with proceeds used to reduce near-term debt. We also issued $2.7 billion of new debt in that period, extending duration at attractive pricing before the run-up in interest rates. As a result, we have just 4% of our consolidated debt or under $500 million coming due in 2023. And we've made good progress towards this refinancing, having locked in all-in cash rates of 4.2% on nearly 2/3 of this requirement. Consistent with our long-held risk management approach to maintain 10% to 20% in floating rate debt, 12% of our consolidated debt was floating in the fourth quarter. We have plans to issue $500 million in new secured fixed rate debt with proceeds designated to pay down floating rate debt in 2023, which would bring our floating rate debt to the lower end of our targeted range. We have significant liquidity of $2.4 billion at year-end 2022. And finally, our net debt to adjusted pro forma EBITDA improved by 30 basis points to 6.9x in the fourth quarter, with SHOP NOI growth steadily moving that ratio back toward our pre-pandemic target range. Last but not least, I'm extremely pleased to reintroduce full year 2023 guidance. This is tangible evidence that we are in a post-pandemic world, and our guidance demonstrates the exciting post-pandemic organic property growth opportunity for Ventas. The key components for our '23 guidance are as follows: net income attributable to common stockholders is estimated to range between $0.20 and $0.34 per fully diluted share. Normalized FFO is forecast to range from $2.90 to $3.04 per share. We expect our portfolio same-store cash NOI to grow 7.5% at the midpoint, led by SHOP same-store cash NOI growth of 18% at the midpoint. Our '23 FFO guidance at the midpoint of $2.97 represents growth year-over-year of 5% or $0.13 per share against the rebased 2022. The FFO bridge describing the $0.13 is straightforward with two main drivers: first, we expect $0.29 from outstanding year-over-year organic property growth in SHOP; and second and partially offsetting is a $0.16 reduction, principally from the impact of higher interest rates. A stronger U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar and the pound is also a contributor. Other guidance items include receipt of over $300 million in capital recycling proceeds, no additional promote revenue, G&A approximating $151 million at the midpoint and 404 million weighted average fully diluted shares. The low and high end of our FFO guidance range are largely described by changes in the macro environment, including potential changes in inflation expectations and interest rates. A few thoughts on phasing of our normalized FFO through the year. We expect FFO in the first quarter of '23 to be roughly flat to the fourth quarter of '22 of $0.71 when adjusted for the $0.02 promote received in the fourth quarter, with the first quarter of '23 is the seasonal low point for SHOP. As the key selling season in SHOP kicks in and interest rates plateau, FFO growth is expected to pick up in the balance of '23. A more fulsome discussion of our '23 guidance can be found in the earnings and outlook presentation posted to our website. To close, we entered 2023 with momentum. The entire Ventas team is fully engaged and excited to deliver on our '23 plans and to reignite a new cycle of success for the company and our shareholders.  And that concludes our prepared remarks. For Q&A, we ask each caller to stick to one question to be respectful to everyone on the line.  With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator. I'd add, the $1 million of pop, we've mentioned 100 properties, that's obviously $100 million. The timing of that clearly isn't all in one quarter. It will be spread over the course of time. But these are NOI-generating opportunities. ROI-generating opportunities are indeed embedded in the forecast we've given you in terms of the NOI growth. And I believe top use of our cash, best use of our cash is to reinvest in these assets, given the backdrop of SHOP and in senior housing. Well, first of all, we started this last year. So you mentioned the fourth quarter seeing some acceleration. That clearly is part of it. Second point to make is just in terms of classification of the CapEx spend. This is ROI generating a redev. So you'll see that acceleration in readout. At the same time, FAD CapEx will increase. Again, the top priority is investing behind our SHOP assets. So you'll see that increase at the same time. But it's a multiyear program. Yes. Mike, I'd say, first off, all the pools, all of the operators are contributing really attractive growth across the board literally as you look at it. This is broad-based growth in recovery and improvement across the portfolio. And you mentioned new senior, new senior importantly part of that contribution. And when you look at the fourth quarter of '22, you'll see almost the same asset pool, and that growth in the fourth quarter reflects that broad-based strength. I would just -- I'd emphasize 95% occupancy in Canada and we delivered 12% growth in the fourth quarter. That business is performing well. But obviously, the U.S. is the engine driving the overall midpoint. The second premise is, ICE is really function of either transitioned or acquired assets, bringing up to market standard. And part of what you will see in '23 versus '22 is a reduction, significant reduction in ICE because -- simply because we haven't had that activity in the last call it a year. So that flushes out of the system. Bringing you back to core CapEx in FAD, which I would expect to see some acceleration in, I mentioned that earlier. Again, our best use of cash to invest behind the properties, both front of house and back of house. So you will see an increase in that. And more meaningfully, the increase in redev, which is really these front-of-house refresh ROI projects, which we mentioned a $100 million number as a placeholder. So both will be going up. I think net-net-net, I would think about it in terms of the bottom line FAD contribution in 2023 also growing driven by the cash flows of the properties. No, simply the change. I'll give you a redev up by $100 million as a year-on-year as a number. Great. I'll take that. So Page 14 of the deck we posted yesterday is helpful here because it really focuses on the impact of rising interest rates. Of the $0.16 I noted in the bridge, the vast majority is interest rates. And the vast majority of that is really the curve on floating rate that we see and show in the deck. FX is a contributor but a small contributor. And in large part because we have, in Canada, Canadian debt, and that's a natural hedge to what is a stronger U.S. dollar, which is having translation impact on NOI. So that's the primary driver. In terms of the $500 million this year of refinancing, again, that's in Canada, principally. And we've been able to secure some attractive pricing on mortgages in Canada. That's going to be a key source of funds as well as some agency debt here in the U.S., which we're planning to issue, which we'll use to pay down floating rate debt. And those are really the two key drivers of the guidance in terms of refinancing. Yes, it depends on the 10-year. In the 5s would be a reasonable expectation, depending on where the 10-year is."

            "content": "Thank you, Debbie. I'll start by noting how excited I am about the execution in our SHOP portfolio. Over the past few years, we have taken many actions to put ourselves in a position to achieve positive performance as we aim to recapture NOI in this multiyear growth and recovery cycle. We have been successful executing portfolio actions, which include over 50 triple-net communities converted to SHOP and over 130 transition to new operators. We've acquired over 100 new communities and executed 30 dispositions and 8 new developments. Finally, we have over 100 communities that are in the process of getting refreshed and are expected to complete during the key selling season. I am really proud of our tremendous team that supports our senior housing business and has executed Ventas OI, our approach to collaborative oversight where we leverage our operating expertise and best-in-class data analytics to the benefit of our operating partners to drive positive results, which has gained tremendous momentum. Our programmatic approach addresses two priorities in parallel: first, timely market, financial and operating insights to influence near-term performance and revenue-enhancing capital expenditures; second, tackling key strategic challenges that will deepen our competitive advantage and maximize the long-term value of our portfolio. Now I'll cover the fourth quarter SHOP results in our year-over-year same-store pool of 478 communities. Our SHOP portfolio continues to perform really well. The fourth quarter was ahead of our expectations while delivering excellent year-over-year growth due to pricing power, occupancy growth and moderating expenses. NOI in our Q4 year-over-year pool grew 19.1%, which is above the midpoint of our SHOP guidance range and includes 22.2% growth in the U.S., led by Sunrise and Atria, while Canada demonstrated positive growth again with 11.7% led by Le Groupe Maurice. I would like to thank all of our operating partners for their significant achievements delivering excellent services and care and financial results. We continue to benefit from operating leverage, even at this relatively low occupancy, resulting in margin improvement from 23% in Q3 to 23.6% in Q4. Same-store average occupancy grew year-over-year by 140 basis points to 82.5%. Revenue in the quarter grew ahead of expectations, increasing 8.3% year-over-year due to continued acceleration in RevPOR growth and positive trends in occupancy. Pricing power continues to impress. At 6.5% year-over-year growth, RevPOR is the strongest we've seen in the last 10 years, primarily driven by in-house rent and care increases and improving re-leasing spreads. As expected, expenses were $4.7 million per day. As a reminder, our year-over-year expense growth peaked in Q2 2022 at 11%. It reduced to 8% in Q3 and was lower again in Q4 at 6%. Leading indicators in the U.S. remain strong as we experience leads as a percentage of 2019 at 120%, move-ins at 101% and outs at 101%. Canada continues to deliver growth and high occupancy at 95%. Demand accelerated in January with move-ins at 104% over 2019 in the U.S. and 111% in Canada. Now I will cover 2023 SHOP guidance and our expanded same-store year-over-year pool, which includes 508 communities representative of 92% of our portfolio. There are three primary drivers of our positive outlook: occupancy growth, rate growth and moderating expenses. SHOP same-store cash NOI is expected to accelerate from 13.4% growth in 2022 to growth in the range of 15% to 21% year-over-year in 2023. The low and high end of the guidance range is driven by occupancy and expense performance. We expect margin expansion of 200 basis points at our midpoint. We anticipate year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 8% at the midpoint of the same-store cash NOI guidance range driven by continued strong rate growth and occupancy growth of 130 basis points to 170 basis points. With the deployment of our Ventas OI platform and excellent execution by our operators, we are able to achieve substantial rent increases this season of approximately 10%. This in combination with improved care pricing, rising street rates, and typical resident attrition results in about 6% expected RevPOR growth in 2023. It's important to note that 80% of our revenue growth in 2023 will be driven by the RevPOR growth, much of which has already been realized as over half of our resident population have already received the rent increases.  In regards to occupancy growth, we project that more residents will move into our communities in 2023 compared to prior year. We also project our net move-ins to be higher. However, we expect to return to more normal seasonal occupancy patterns, which include typical clinical conditions and slightly elevated financial move-outs in the first quarter. We expect a significant occupancy ramp throughout the year, supported by an accelerating aging demographic and muted new supply translating to about 150 basis points of year-over-year average occupancy improvements in 2023. We also expect moderating inflationary expense impacts and lower contract labor year-over-year, with overall expense growth expected to be around 5%. Through the execution of initiatives to improve employee recruitment and retention, we have had five consecutive quarters of net hiring, which are providing the tailwinds needed to stabilize the workforce and support the moderation of expenses. Moving on to investments. I'm really excited to work with our deeply experienced investments team in my newly expanded responsibilities. I am very pleased to step into a situation where I can work to continue our strong track record and expert capital allocation. We have a wealth of existing relationships across our targeted asset classes of senior housing, life science and R&I and medical office. I look forward to contributing to the ongoing success of our investment platform by combining the advantages embedded in the enterprise with my extensive network and investment experience to drive external growth. I look forward to expanding Ventas OI across the enterprise to drive portfolio optimization, external growth and refresh redev capital across our senior housing and office portfolios. We will continue to pick our spots in investments and work with our best-in-class partners on attractive opportunities. Moving forward, I am confident in the demand drivers of the business and believe we are well positioned to continue this positive trajectory. Bob? It's Justin. I'll start, and Bob you probably want to jump in. First of all, it is a large initiative. We have 100 communities that are in the process of being refreshed. We do believe that it will be impactful. It's about $1 million of pop. It should help improve performance. Certainly, we've considered that when we gave our guidance for 2023. And there's more to do. But at this stage, we picked our highest priorities and we've been executing aggressively. So we look forward to these projects coming online during the key selling season. Sure. So in regards to leading indicators, you've noted they're looking really good. We've had, we think, the highest fourth quarter lead volumes on record in terms of leads. Movements were solid. You noted the conversion rate. We had an operator that put in place a website upgrade intra month in December. It slowed down leads, a bit slowdown move-ins. Those move-ins have since recovered in January already, so no worries there. We expect to follow normal seasonal trends. And so you'll see move-outs be a little bit higher. We've had -- it's normal to have additional clinical move-outs. It's normal to have additional financial move-outs. And then so far in January, we're off to a strong start with move-ins at 104% of 2019 in the U.S., 111% in Canada. So all looking pretty good from a leading indicator standpoint. In regards to the margin question, there's 1 thing that we're all excited about. Obviously, Debbie noted it, I noted it, and that's the pricing power. That's really helped to accelerate our margin expansion. Occupancy growth does as well. So we do anticipate margins to continue to expand. And also, to Debbie's point, we're anticipating and hoping to get back to that 2019 level again. And margins will -- should settle out but also should continue to grow because of the strong demand for the senior housing sector. Yes, that's a great question. So let me start with describing the 300 basis points, and I want to relate it to seasonality. When we grew 300 basis points in 2022, we had two things helping that growth metric. One was that Q1 of '22 performed better than typical seasonality. So very strong start in '22. There really wasn't much clinical activity at all. And so that was helping us. It was also comparing to a prior year, Q1 of '21, that was pandemic impacted. So you have a stronger start in '22 and you have a favorable comparison. Moving ahead into '23, I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we're experiencing normal seasonality. So we have a lower starting point in Q1, so effectively Q1 has lower occupancy than Q4. It's in line with normal seasonality. Typically, you see about 100 basis points change downward from Q4 to Q1. And then what we'll see this year is an acceleration in growth. And as I said, we're expecting more move-ins. We're expecting more net move-ins. So in fact, the growth rate in '23 will be stronger. The effective growth rate is stronger, but the average overall is at the midpoint of 150 basis points of growth. Right, exactly. It's Justin. Well, everything is included in the full year guidance in '23. And as Bob said, everyone is contributing. Canada is at a higher occupancy. It does tend to generate less growth overall, but it is contributing growth and we'd expect the U.S. to be on the higher end of the average of the guidance range, Canada a little bit on the lower side, but with everyone contributing to the growth. Sure. Well, first of all, really similar to how everyone is contributing to the NOI growth in '23, all of our operating partners are contributing to the improvement in managing the labor cost and it's done a few ways. One was to professionalize the recruitment of line staff where that had been a local priority. It's become a central priority for operators. That's done through automation. It's also done by gearing your recruitment professionals towards that person. There's more emphasis on retention as well. There was wage increases at our competitors that were put in place all the way back starting in '21 and throughout '22 to help to be more competitive. And then just extra emphasis where you have -- the leading indicator is always agency which we probably noted in our numbers that's been coming down. But the communities entering agency or markets entering agency, that's an indicator to make, put additional focus on that locality.  So really good execution. And there has been, I think, changes that have been made that will be lasting in terms of just process improvement. Yes. I mean, I think you summed it up perfectly. I would just point out again that the 80-plus population, what's different from that period is growing at record levels and will continue to for the next several years. So that's obviously very supportive on the demand side. Supply, most are supplemental, we have starts. In our top markets, it's like -- it's in the basis points. It's like 10 basis points, exceptionally low. And that supports the window that Debbie is describing over the next few years. And this is a sector that has tremendous demand fundamentals. So the capital we'll see through those and will bring supply eventually. But we do have a window that's formed that's really exciting and supportive of the recovery that we've been talking about. So it's Justin. So I'm going to go back to what I was just talking about, which is demand. So another part of this is just affordability in our markets, which is very high and there's demand for the services. So you have the combination of people needing the service and people having the ability to pay. And with numbers that we've never seen before in terms of demand at the doorstep. So that should be supportive of pricing power moving forward. There's always some sensitivity relative to inflation and CPI. But what you're really working to do to generate earnings growth is to create a spread. And we've been effective in doing that in this cycle. It's Justin. You're absolutely right. Agency was close to zero pre-pandemic. Obviously, there's been big shifts in the labor market since then. And we've had it enter our sector as others. We've managed to bring it down, which you've noted. In our 2023 guidance, we assume lower agency than we did in '22 year-over-year. And so that's supportive of our moderating expenses. But we are, in fact, carrying that Q4 run rate, which is like 2% of revenue forward throughout the year. There is -- I mentioned in my prepared remarks the guidance range. It assumes lower expenses and more occupancy at the top end, works the other way on the bottom. So we've incorporated that into our thinking. But we're anticipating that agency remains relatively stable. Yes. So great points or observations. I'll start with the clinical side. The clinical side, I would just describe as kind of normal. It's certainly wasn't representative of the headlines that they were around flu. It's very normal kind of typical seasonality in both December and so far in January. We have had financial move-outs, which is also typical around this time because I mentioned over half of our residents received their in-house rent increases. And we've also mentioned they're relatively high this year as well. So that's contributing to the move-out trend and which is normal. That's kind of the point I was trying to make, and we're -- in that regard, we're kind of back to normal trends. And then from a move-in expectation standpoint and net move-in expectation standpoint, we expect those to continue to improve due to the demand at the doorstep. How about I'll start with the pricing question? There's a page in the deck for those that have it, Page 20, that addresses this. First, the contributors to RevPOR, strong in-house rent increases running around 10%; care pricing, 11%; and then street rates have increased as well. So really, everything is going up in that regards. One thing about care, it's adjustable throughout the year, represents about 15% of our RevPOR. And then there's just normal attrition, typical attrition. And so in other words, not every resident is receiving the full benefit of these increases throughout the whole year. So that's why you're seeing a 6% RevPOR rather than around 10%, which the numbers above might indicate. Yes. So first of all, we're fortunate to have a wide variety of capital sources to further acquisitions. We'll prioritize our key asset classes, senior housing, obviously, is one of those, life science, Medical Office as well. The market itself is not normal. There's exceptions to this, but there tends to be fewer market participants right now. The deals that that we're seeing are getting repriced. Again, there's exceptions to that. Pricing could be unclear on the stabilized assets. But we remain very interested in expanding the portfolio and growing in our preferred asset classes."

            "name": "Debra A. Cafaro",
            "content": "Thanks, BJ, and good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants. Welcome to the Ventas fourth quarter and year-end 2022 earnings call. We are pleased to deliver a strong fourth quarter, which reflects the attractive operating and financial results of our diverse portfolio and the benefits of our key strategic initiatives. Fourth quarter normalized FFO was $0.73 per share, fueled by accelerating SHOP growth at 19%, record Medical Office Building performance and profitability from our third-party institutional capital management business, VIM. The demand fundamentals that support our business are strong and getting stronger across all Ventas asset classes, which are unified in serving the nation's large and growing aging population. After significant capital recycling and asset management actions, our diverse portfolio of high-quality senior living communities, Medical Office Buildings, R&I labs and other health care assets is well positioned to capitalize on these demand trends. In 2022, Ventas began what we believe will be a multiyear growth and recovery cycle led by SHOP and supported by favorable supply-demand fundamentals, actions we've taken in the portfolio and our post-pandemic rebound. In senior housing, there are compelling supply demand tailwinds. The over-80 population will grow at record levels in 2023. Yet, we continue to see construction as a percentage of inventory at its lowest level in five years and substantially better in Ventas markets. Over the last few years, we have taken decisive actions to position our SHOP portfolio to capitalize on this exciting demographically-led demand. We strengthened our team, enhanced our powerful analytic capabilities, rolled out the Ventas OI platform, sold, transitioned and acquired properties and invested capital in communities with strong market fundamentals, all to win the recovery. Benefiting from these trends and actions, we are well underway to recapturing the post-pandemic SHOP NOI opportunity. Our portfolio has already enjoyed significant occupancy and NOI growth from the COVID trough, and we see even more recapture potential ahead of us in the coming years as we first seek to reach 2019 performance levels and then hopefully exceed them. Bob also took significant steps to maintain our financial strength and flexibility and improve our balance sheet and liquidity. These actions garnered three positive credit rating moves in 2022 and reduced our 2023 maturities to a very manageable level. In 2022, we also continued our long history of value creation with $1.2 billion of new investments, often with key partners. These include the $425 million Atrium Health/Wake Forest University School of Medicine Development in Charlotte, North Carolina; $200 million in senior housing investments, including the acquisition of Mangrove Bay and a new development with Le Groupe Maurice, both in very attractive markets; and $300 million in MOB investments highlighted by the acquisition of an 18-property MOB portfolio leased to Ardent. Finally, we remain committed to our values, including our ESG leadership. We accelerated our progress in 2022 as we further diversified and elevated our Board and made a bold commitment to achieve net zero operational carbon emissions by 2040. These efforts will be advanced under the leadership of our General Counsel, Carey Roberts, who has the passion and experience to move us forward. Now, we enter 2023 with strong momentum. Today, we are pleased to introduce full year normalized FFO guidance representing 5% growth at the midpoint. We are projecting unprecedented organic growth in our portfolio, once again driven by SHOP, and complemented by the positive compounding contributions of our office business led by Pete. We also will continue to build out our VIM business, which already has over $5 billion in assets under management, and mine our non-property investments for value as evidenced by both the pending Ardent equity stake sale and our recently completed Atria Glennis software deal while we also seek to optimize the outcome in our Santerre loan. Finally, we will continue to invest capital wherever we find compelling opportunities to sustain and reinforce our new cycle of success. The macroeconomic assumptions underlying our forecast include some slowing of the economy, moderating inflation, softening labor conditions, and continued, albeit less aggressive Fed tightening. Against that backdrop and in many other likely scenarios, we believe our business is relatively advantaged because demographic demand for our assets is large, growing and resilient, we have demonstrated strong pricing power in SHOP and softening economic conditions should benefit our operations in multiple ways. One final note. In January, Justin assumed the additional role of Chief Investment Officer at Ventas. I know you want to join me in congratulating Justin, and I want to thank him for his continued leadership, which has been instrumental in our success and positive outlook. Working with our strong teams, Justin will use his experience and insights to create value by making good investments across our asset classes, enhancing the connection between our investment activity and business operations and deploying the powerful Ventas OI platform across our organization. And now I'm happy to turn the call over to the man himself. Justin? Sure. The loan is part of our normal business. Over the last five years, I think we've collected about $1.7 billion in loans that we've made on health care properties or to health care operators. This particular loan took a $20 million allowance in the quarter. And we continue to be current in terms of interest, receipt of interest payments. And it's under some compression of coverage because some of the assets haven't recovered from COVID while interest rates have been increasing. And so it's really a timing issue if you want to think about it that way. And so we would expect to work through that, and we have a lot of experience and tools and rights at our disposal to do that. And it's a multiyear NOI impact as well we will see going forward. We'll be investing into this multiyear recovery in senior housing and the supply-demand fundamentals in our market. Well, Ronald, we're glad you like the deck. We obviously pride ourselves on our analytics, but your old colleague, BJ Grant, is helping us put it in the best format for our external constituencies. So we're glad that you like it. And I'll turn it over to Justin to start to answer your question. Mike, I'm glad you asked that, and I'm going to ask Bob to answer it. Yes. I mean, what I think you should like about it is we now have the vast majority of our SHOP business in the same-store pool. So that makes it more meaningful for investors to understand the performance of the business. Because of timing in phasing. Well, I mean start out with the principle that FAD CapEx is really routine recurring non-income producing kind of steady state activity. And then Bob will go further. You've got something out of him, Juan. Well, I mean it depends on the 10-year. Nick, it's Debbie. On the $300 million, a couple of hundred million as we show in the deck, is based on office dispos, some of which are purchase option-driven. There's a -- we got full repayment on a Freddie Mac loan in January, that was $43 million, I think, at a double-digit interest rate. We got paid in full on that. And then the balance is other small items. Good. I mean, it all starts with the demand side, as you know, with the record 80-plus population growth in 2023. In terms of supply, I would analogize where we are to a little bit after the financial crisis because during those years, construction and development starts, obviously, were paused for a period of time because of the great financial crisis. And this is similar really to what we're seeing from kind of the pre-COVID period that you referenced but then also kind of during COVID and then continuing now because costs are still quite high, particularly capital costs. I mean, construction loans are extremely expensive now. And so the costs remain, for the time being, very high. And there's -- would tend to be because starts are really low in our markets, Justin can give you the specifics. But we believe we have a good multiyear window here where we know kind of the demand profile and can capture that while, at the same time, deliveries should remain muted, very muted because they'll be seeing the effects, again, much like we did after the financial crisis, where deliveries were low. And I think at that point, occupancies got up in and around the 92% level. And that's really where we want to be able to see if we can get back to that kind of 92% level in this nice window that we have and kind of that's the game plan. And you would think as you take capacity out of the market through higher occupancies, that you may maintain some all or more of this pricing power. And this is true across healthcare at large and is principally a function of the labor force participation rate and other kind of macro factors. And the key is really to take the actions at the hiring level that Justin mentioned about positive net hiring, where you're at least getting your fair share of that workforce. And then on Colony, I would say there's a range of outcomes basically bracketing the FFO contribution in 2022. Sure. I mean, I think again, as we said, there's a post-COVID impact on some of the assets and rates have increased. The full loan stack is really closer to [L plus 3], 330-ish, if you will, in the senior and the junior. And so the original underwriting was very conventional, kind of 75%, 80% LTV. And so it's just a timing mismatch, if you will. And the borrower, we believe, is taking actions on the portfolio side. And the rates are the rates, and so we value the collateral in making our decision at the 12/31 balance sheet and made reasonable, consistent assumptions about valuation. Well, it's being paid now so it's covering the loan. So interest is being paid. Thank you so much. I want to sincerely thank everyone for joining us on the call today. We really appreciate your interest in the company. We look forward to seeing you. We're all very optimistic and aligned around our 2023 momentum and opportunities and are ready to get after it. Thank you very much."

Welcome to the Ventas third quarter 2022 earnings call. We\u2019re very pleased with our enterprise and property results this quarter, led by our SHOP growth. Let\u2019s begin with some highlights. Normalized FFO per share was $0.76, right in line with our forecast,[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:17:00 2022 ] with 13% SHOP growth led by an outstanding 9% increase in year-over-year revenue, and nearly 5% total company year-over-year same-store cash NOI growth. Our $0.71 normalized FFO ex HHS grants grew 3% from last year\u2019s comparable period.

With year-over-year SHOP growth of 9% in the second quarter, 13% this quarter and 15% to 21% projected in the fourth quarter, this is what we have been waiting for. Our strong numbers validate our long-standing commentary that we are at the start of a multiyear recovery and growth period in senior housing, driven by positive and improving supply-demand fundamentals and propelled by the actions and decisions we\u2019ve taken, Justin and the team\u2019s experience, accuracy, insights and credibility and, of course, our operators\u2019 efforts. I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank them. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter.[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:18:00 2022 ],[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:18:00 2022  ] in [Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:18:00 2022  ]I[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:18:00 2022 ]n [Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:18:00 2022 ]addition to SHOP growth, our normalized FFO guidance of $0.71 at the midpoint represents 4.5% growth versus Q4 2021,[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:18:00 2022 ] excluding material unusual items overcoming the macro, interest rate and FX headwinds that we and virtually all other real estate companies are experiencing. Turning to capital allocation. We continue to focus on our priorities of life science, research and innovation and select senior housing and working with long-time partners. We are driving and expanding our differentiated life science research and innovation investment business. We have $2.3 billion in R&I projects recently delivered and in progress. Recently, we delivered core and shell of our new state-of-the-art 400,000 square foot lab building in Philadelphia\u2019s premier life science ecosystem at One uCity Square, it is on time and on budget and currently over 90% leased or committed to leading gene and cell therapy companies and a premier research university. We are very proud of what we and our partner, Wexford, have created in service of the major universities, research companies and innovators in this growing life science market. We own significant additional land in One uCity available to meet robust demand. Recently, we also began a new 255,000 square foot lab building to be anchored by the University of Maryland, Baltimore. UMB, part of the University of Maryland system,[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:20:00 2022 ] is rated AA+ and they ranked in the top 15 of U.S. universities for R&D spend. The project enhances our existing position in a market with the nation\u2019s most favorable ratio of current life science tenant demand to under-construction lab space. The project is projected to produce a stabilized cash yield of 7.5% and open in 2024. Universities, which represent half of our consolidated R&I portfolio tenancy,[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:20:00 2022 ] continue to demonstrate significant demand for lab space, and our portfolio is well located and positioned to capture it. Before I wrap up, I\u2019d also like to highlight two strategic investments we\u2019ve made that demonstrate value creation in unique ways, connected to our core real estate investments as we\u2019ve built valuable businesses and aligned with quality partners. Notably, we\u2019ve seen the success of our Ventas Investment Management, or VIM platform, which is Ventas\u2019 third-party institutional capital management business with over $5.5 billion of AUM. VIM has proven to be an effective strategy to continue to grow in attractive asset classes and build a valuable business and create a recurring revenue stream. We expect to earn the first promote revenue from VIM approximating $0.01 per share in the fourth quarter of this year. We intend to continue growing our VIM business, which provides strategic benefits to our public shareholders and leverages our platform and industry expertise. Second, our $1.4 billion strategic investment in Ardent, a high-quality health system,[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:22:00 2022 ] has been very successful. In addition to our well-performing Ardent real estate, we have a $50 million investment in a 10% equity stake in the Ardent OpCo, alongside Sam Zell\u2019[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:23:00 2022 ]s[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:23:00 2022 ] EGI. Recently, EGI entered into an agreement to sell a minority equity investment in Ardent to new investors at a valuation representing over a four time equity return. As a 10% owner, we expect to sell a 2.5% stake. Because the transaction remains subject to regulatory review, we have not included any potential gains in our guidance. Ardent demonstrates the importance of creating valuable partnerships and carefully choosing successful operating partners. Finally, we believe we are in an advantaged position to succeed. Demographic demand fuels all our asset types and senior housing supply-demand fundamentals are highly favorable and improving. While we, like most companies across the real estate space,[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:23:00 2022 ] are affected by higher interest rates, we are happy to be in a business that has pricing power, upside from occupancy and margin expansion and has been historically resilient in a variety of economic environments. Thank you.[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:24:00 2022 ] and [Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:24:00 2022  ]A[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:24:00 2022 ]nd [Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:24:00 2022 ]I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Justin.\nJustin Hutchens: Thank you, Debbie. I\u2019ll start by covering the third quarter SHOP results in our year-over-year same-store pool. We are pleased to report another quarter that was consistent with our expectations, while delivering strong year-over-year growth. NOI grew 13% year-over-year, which is above the midpoint of our SHOP guidance range led by the U.S. at 17.4%, while Canada demonstrated positive growth again with 5.9%. Same-store average occupancy grew year-over-year by 260 basis points to 84.7%. Same-store SHOP revenue in the third quarter grew ahead of expectations, increasing nearly 9% year-over-year due to continued acceleration in RevPOR [ph] [Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:32:00 2022  ]growth and positive trends in occupancy.[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:33:00 2022 ] [Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:33:00 2022 ] Pricing power has been impressive. At 5.4% year-over-year growth, RevPOR is the strongest we\u2019ve seen in the last 10 years, primarily driven by in-house rent and care increases and re-leasing spreads that have improved to positive 1.4% in Q3 from negative double digits during the low point in the first quarter of 2021. Underpinning the re-leasing spreads are improvements in street rates, which increased 11% year-over-year in the third quarter. This pricing power is being driven in a U.S. portfolio that is only around 80% occupied, which is a real testament to the underlying demand for senior housing and bodes well for future pricing. As expected, expenses were $3.8 million per day. Operating expenses remained elevated as contemplated in the company\u2019s guidance for the third quarter. Year-over-year same-store operating expenses grew 7.6%, driven primarily by occupancy growth and continued macro inflationary impacts throughout the quarter on labor, utilities, repair and maintenance and food costs. Leading indicators in the U.S. remain very strong as we experience leads as a percent of 2019 at 109%, move-ins at 107% and out\u2019s at 98%. Canada continues to deliver growth and high occupancy at 94%. We are benefiting from positive operating leverage. SHOP NOI margin expanded 90 basis points in the third quarter due to stronger-than-expected revenue growth that outpaced continued elevated expenses. I have to say a big thank you to our operating partners, including Atria, Le Groupe Maurice, Sunrise and our regional operators who are delivering great results. Now, I will cover Q4 SHOP guidance and our expanded same-store year-over-year pool, which includes 478 communities. We are pleased that our strong year-over-year growth expectations are reflected in this much larger pool, which represents 87% of our SHOP portfolio. This larger pool includes assets that have transitioned from triple-net transition from other operators and acquisitions made in the prior year. Both the legacy same-store communities and the new entrance to the pool are expected to contribute attractive growth with the preexisting pool showing the strongest performance. SHOP same-store cash NOI is expected to accelerate from 13% growth in the third quarter in the range of 15% to 21% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. We anticipate year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 8% at the midpoint of the same-store cash NOI guidance range driven by continued strong rate growth and occupancy growth of 100 basis points to 150 basis points. Year-over-year revenue growth is expected to be partially mitigated by continued broad inflationary expenses. At the guidance midpoint, operating expenses are expected to be consistent on a per day basis with the third quarter in 2022. The bottom and top ends of the NOI range are principally driven by variability in operating expenses. Our guidance assumes attractive margin expansion. Moving on to asset management. Ventas OI, which is our approach to a collaborative oversight where we leverage our operating expertise and best-in-class data analytics to the benefit of our operating partners continues to differentiate our platform and is creating tangible value in our senior housing business. I\u2019m pleased to report that we had a very productive third quarter, engaging with our operators on the underlying fundamentals and two important deep dive topics, rate increases and recruiting. Rate increases this coming year will be our highest on record. We started our process early and collaborated with our operators to develop recommendations down to the unit and resident level. These customized rate recommendations are grounded in data, should limit controllable move-outs and will be a huge contributor to revenue growth. It\u2019s really important to note that pricing power is greatly enhanced when we are delivering care and services resulting in highly satisfied residents and families. Historically, we have seen around 5% in-house rent increases in the U.S. We saw 8% in 2022, and we expect over 10% in 2023. Certain operators, notably Sunrise have already implemented early in-place rent increases and the results are positive and a good preview of what should be successful execution in the first quarter and beyond. We continue to address labor challenges in innovative ways. Our recent focus has been on community level staff recruiting to help our operators compete for talent more effectively. In doing so, we secret shopped over 50 job titles across 15 different operators to evaluate reputation, career website, the application process and application follow-up. While I was pleased to see that our operators scored well relative to industry benchmarks, we came away with several actionable recommendations to attract fresh talent to our communities. Ventas OI also continues to be a powerful tool in the capital allocation process. Our asset management teams are leveraging access to extensive industry and market-specific data to help drive decision-making around revenue-generating CapEx projects. Portfolios are evaluated on an asset-by-asset basis with communities prioritized based on near-term occupancy and rate upside as well as long-term supply and demand outlook. A significant investment of time and capital into this process has resulted in over 100 individual renovation projects currently underway within our SHOP portfolio, with a material number of those completing in the next several months. I\u2019ll conclude by highlighting my continued confidence in the growth opportunity in our senior housing business. There are very encouraging facts that continue to support this view. The supply and demand outlook remains very strong. The growth rate of the 80-plus population will be the highest on record. As we\u2019ve noted before, 99% of Ventas senior housing markets are free from competitive new starts. We have had positive net move-ins for 18 months of the past 19 months and pricing power is consistently demonstrated through in-house rents and street rate increases, all working together to drive NOI growth. Now I\u2019ll hand the call over to Bob.\nBob Probst: Thank you, Justin. I\u2019ll start with an overview of our third quarter office and enterprise results before closing with our outlook for the fourth quarter. Starting with office, same-store cash NOI grew 3% year-over-year, which represents a beat to our third quarter guidance. MOB has led the way with growth of 3.4%, driven by 90 basis points of occupancy gain. Quarterly retention was strong at 93% in the quarter, supplemented by new leasing exceeding 200,000 square feet. Medical office same-store occupancy is now at 91.8% and has increased year-on-year for five straight quarters. MOB same-store quarterly performance has now exceeded 3% for four quarters of the last five quarters. For R&I, year-to-date, same-store cash NOI performance is a strong 4.8%, while we posted same-store growth of 1.5% for the third quarter. As we told you earlier in the year, we\u2019re in the process of converting space into labs where we have seen opportunities from tenant departures as a result of COVID. At the enterprise level, despite the market volatility, we\u2019re very pleased that we once again delivered results that were in line or better than our original guidance ranges. Our total property same-store cash NOI increased 4.8% year-over-year, at the high end of our guidance range. And that result was led by SHOP, where same-store cash NOI grew 13% year-over-year, as Justin just described. But the SHOP P&L top to bottom, where we called it a quarter ago. Q3 normalized FFO of $0.76 per share is right in line with our guidance. And as a reminder, we received $0.05 of HHS grants in the quarter, which were included in our initial guidance. From a balance sheet perspective, we saw our leverage improved to 6.9 times in the quarter. As we look ahead, we\u2019re benefiting from the proactive steps we took prior to the run-up in interest rates to reduced near-term debt and extend duration. Some Ventas stats to call out include $2.5 billion of available liquidity, 2023 consolidated debt maturities and amortization is just $500 million or less than 2% of enterprise value and 11% of our consolidated debt is at floating rates. Let\u2019s talk Q4 guidance. We expect net income to range from $0.06 to $0.12 per fully diluted share. Q4 2022 normalized FFO is expected to range from $0.68 to $0.74 per share, which represents nearly 4.5% growth at the midpoint when compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, adjusted for unusual items in the prior year. SHOP is contributing $0.06 of growth year-over-year, while interest rates and FX are a $0.04 headwind. Total company same-store NOI growth year-over-year of 6% to 9% is expected with accelerating SHOP same-store NOI midpoint growth of 18%, leading the way. Bridging FFO from Q3 to the Q4 guidance midpoint is as follows: starting with Q3 of $0.71, adjusted for the $0.05 of HHS in Q3. In the fourth quarter, we expect $0.02 of sequential growth from SHOP, materially outperforming normal seasonal trends. We also expect to earn our first promote of approximately a $0.01 from our third-party capital business. The $0.03 of sequential good guys explained by SHOP in the promote are offset principally by a $0.02 reduction in FFO and due to higher interest rates on our floating rate debt. Other notable assumptions in our fourth quarter guidance include no new or unannounced material acquisitions or capital markets activities, 404 million fully diluted shares, and finally, we do not expect to receive any HHS grants in the fourth quarter. For more information on our guidance assumptions, I would direct you to the business update deck and a supplemental posted to our website. To close, we believe we are in an advantaged position in a dynamic macroeconomic backdrop with the portfolio and the team to deliver sustained value creation. That concludes our prepared remarks. For Q&A, we ask each caller to stay to one question to be respectful to everyone on the line. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to operator.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Juan Sanabria at BMO.\nJuan Sanabria: Hi,[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:35:00 2022 ] good morning. Just hoping we could talk a little bit about rate and RevPOR specifically. You mentioned,[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:35:00 2022 ] Justin, that Sunrise has moved up seemingly some of their rate increases. So could you give us a little window into how seasonality is \u2013 or the new seasonality now as some of the rate timing has shifted away from the traditional first quarter and maybe bucketize where the rate increases are expected to happen going forward?\nJustin Hutchens: Sure. In fact, one, there\u2019s a page that deck we put out that is Page 12 that describes this a little bit. And on the bottom right, we actually estimate the percentage of units that are eligible for increases, and we mentioned that 7% were actually pulled forward. So they would have normally been a first quarter increase. They\u2019ve been pulled forward to before that. That includes Sunrise, which is mostly a fourth quarter increase. Sunrise targeted around 9%. They were really responding to the need to create value. And one thing we\u2019re very pleased with is that our revenue growth is outpacing expense growth, and Sunrise, the connection to ensure that, that continues to happen. They\u2019ve made the decision to pull early. We also have other operators, obviously, that are targeting increases that are over 10% as we\u2019re stating on this page. And those start in the first quarter, and then there\u2019s a big group or about 42% that get them in the first quarter and then throughout the rest of the year, we\u2019ll see another 39% that are eligible for anniversary rent increases. And then the remaining just moved in late in 2022, so they don\u2019t get a 2023 increase. So obviously, we\u2019re very focused on this, and we\u2019ll continue to be \u2013 and the pricing power has just been superb.\nJuan Sanabria: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll move next to Joshua Dennerlein at Bank of America.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Hey,[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:37:00 2022 ] good morning,[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:37:00 2022 ] everyone. I wanted to explore the dynamic with \u2013 it looks like REITs has fallen, but move-ins had risen during the quarter as a percent of 2019. Could you kind of explain what\u2019s going on there?\nJustin Hutchens: Him[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:37:00 2022 ].[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:37:00 2022  ] Sure[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:37:00 2022  ]s[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:37:00 2022 ]ure[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:37:00 2022 ]. This is Justin. So, I think what you\u2019re referring to is just the percentages that we\u2019re reporting as a percentage of 2019, which has been really good, because we\u2019ve been outperforming the pre-pandemic levels. And it\u2019s a good metric because, obviously, we\u2019re in a recovery mode post-pandemic, and it\u2019s been interesting to see how we perform relative to 2019. But trending is really on an absolute basis. And I think a stat that might help you is from Q2 to Q3, our leads were down 1%. Our move-ins on an absolute basis were up 4%. So, I would basically say not much to report there.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Josh, this is Debbie. And obviously, the leads are well over 100% of 2019 levels and move-ins are at 109% [ph][Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:38:00 2022  ], I believe, of 2019 levels, which is very, very strong.\nJoshua Dennerlein: I wasn\u2019t sure if you guys were getting better conversions with because...\nJustin Hutchens: Yes. So we\u2019ve had \u2013 our conversion rates have been relatively \u2013 they move around a little bit, but relatively consistent around 9% and moving activity,[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:38:00 2022 ] as I mentioned, actually it was higher in the third quarter than it was in the second on an absolute basis. So, we\u2019re very pleased with how we\u2019re positioned from a leading indicators and an actual movement standpoint and occupancy and ultimately, our pricing power as well.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Great. Thanks,[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:38:00 2022 ] guys.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Carroll at RBC Capital Markets.\nMichael Carroll: Yes. Thanks. The 10% annual rate increases is pretty encouraging. I mean, has there been any pushback from residents?[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:39:00 2022 ] I know last year when you did the 8%, there wasn\u2019t much pushback. I\u2019m just wondering if this year is any difference related to that?\nJustin Hutchens: Hi, it\u2019s Justin. So the process I described in the prepared remarks was really designed to, first of all, make sure that we\u2019re getting us right. And then we\u2019re down to the community level and looking at units and residents a number of factors to consider what is the right increase. That was most important. [Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:39:00 2022  ][Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:39:00 2022 ] [Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:39:00 2022 ] Secondly, it\u2019s \u2013 how is this being communicated and the process that our operators are using to make sure that there\u2019s a feedback loop that\u2019s really strong, well executed. We have an early look, obviously, with Sunrise pulling forward. We have rate letters going out as well for some of our operators that are giving increases in January. And so far, so good. It\u2019s been relatively quiet and which is really encouraging.\nOperator: We\u2019ll move next to Steve Sakwa at Evercore ISI.\nSteve Sakwa: Thanks.[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:40:00 2022 ],[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:40:00 2022  ] good [Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:40:00 2022  ]G[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:40:00 2022 ]ood [Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:40:00 2022 ]morning. Justin, I guess maybe just sticking on that kind of move-in and move-out. I noticed that the move-outs are at 98%, which is the highest it\u2019s been in some time. And I guess I would expect that number to continue to trend up as you get more people in the facilities, there\u2019s going to be just more move-outs. But are you surprised that it\u2019s almost back at 100% when you\u2019re maybe not back at 100% of 2019 occupancy?\nJustin Hutchens: Yes, that\u2019s a great question because it does stick out a little bit. You\u2019ll notice if you look on the trending that we\u2019ve been \u2013 I\u2019m going all the way back to the first quarter of 2021, 94%, 91%, 91%, 96%, 97%, 92% and now 98%. And I absolutely would agree that as our absolute number of residents go up through occupancy growth that we\u2019ll see higher move-ups again,[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:41:00 2022 ].[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:41:00 2022  ] There[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:41:00 2022  ]\u2019[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:41:00 2022  ]s[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:41:00 2022  ] [Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:41:00 2022  ]t[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:41:00 2022 ]here[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:41:00 2022 ]\u2019[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:41:00 2022 ]s[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:41:00 2022 ] [Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:41:00 2022 ]\u2013 I don\u2019t think this is necessarily the start of a trend. I think it was just an outcome within a quarter. And over time, they\u2019ll \u2013 eventually, they\u2019ll go back to 100%, but that would mean that our occupancy is back to where it was on a pre-pandemic basis.\nOperator: We\u2019ll move next to Michael Mueller at JPMorgan.\nMichael Mueller: Yes, hi. Just wondering, can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing or thinking about in terms of private market pricing changes for life science and MOBs?\nDebra A. Cafaro: Hi Mike, this is Debbie. And I think that we still are in a period of volatility as far as capital costs. And as you well know, and historically, when we see this type of volatility, there is a period of price discovery, which we are still in. [Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:42:00 2022  ][Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:42:00 2022 ] [Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:42:00 2022 ] I would tell you that the life science market, in particular, continues to have very tight cap rate expectations. And that\u2019s because there\u2019s really good demand continuing for certainly are types of lab buildings. And so that\u2019s showing through and is holding up, frankly, very well in the context of the volatility we\u2019ve seen on capital costs. And MOBs, I think we\u2019re still seeing in the low to mid-5s. But I will close and say there\u2019s very limited data yet, and we still are in the price discovery period. And so more to follow once we get to a point where people are transacting more frequently. We\u2019ll have more data to report on.\nMichael Mueller: Thanks.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Yes.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Vikram Malhotra at Mizuho.\nVikram Malhotra: Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to clarify the sort of move-out levels and maybe think about the trends into 2023. Is the length of stay changing in any way versus pre-COVID, you have a lot of like maybe older patients \u2013 older residents coming in that do not have maybe two to three year length of stay. Is that sort of impacting the volume of move-in? And if this trend continues, let\u2019s say, it\u2019s not a one quarter aberration. If this trend continues, does that impact the occupancy ramp into 2023?\nJustin Hutchens: Hi, it\u2019s Justin. So first of all, actually, our length of stay has been very stable. There\u2019s been \u2013 I remember we had questions last year. Is it shortening? Is there some kind of higher acuity person coming in? That never happened. And so I would \u2013 it\u2019s pretty consistent with where it was even before the pandemic, and it\u2019s been consistent. So not much to really report on from a length of stay standpoint.  One thing I\u2019ll also mention, which is indicative of the demand at the doorstep and the pricing power is that our re-leasing spreads have been so good. So as residents have been moving in, they\u2019ve been paying more than the last resident that occupied that unit. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that actually went positive in this past quarter. So pricing power has been great internally through in-house increases, but it\u2019s also been really strong from a Street rate standpoint as well.\nDebra A. Cafaro: And that\u2019s the lemonade of the move-outs really.\nVikram Malhotra: The pricing power basically, the pricing power driving some of that. Is that what you\u2019re saying?\nJustin Hutchens: No, it was just that the \u2013 when you have someone move-out and you have a new person paying more for that unit when they move-in, that\u2019s a healthy for NIM.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Yes. And as people moved in during a period of the pandemic at lower rates, obviously, that\u2019s where you start to get this positive momentum on re-leasing.\nVikram Malhotra: And then can I just follow up just to clarify the trajectory? I know you said Sunrise has \u2013 or one of the operators already has a 10% bump in place or expected to be 10%. If you see the similar level of pricing power into next year, just given where the \u2013 and expenses, let\u2019s say, remain flat, meaning your reliance on temp labor is where it is today, and you see modest growth just given inflation wise, should the gap between revenue and expense growth in another way, should the margin see material expansion next year?\nJustin Hutchens: Yes. So absolutely. There \u2013 right now, we\u2019re pricing off of the current inflationary environment. So if that changes, and certainly, that could be additive to NOI growth. But we\u2019ve been \u2013 this sector historically has had a pretty healthy spread in terms of increases over CPI, and CPI obviously is much higher these days, and we\u2019ve continued to build that spread in. Pricing power has really always been a strength, and it\u2019s magnified now because of the emphasis on the expense growth. Obviously, revenue has been outpacing expenses significantly. So we\u2019re in good shape. \nDebra A. Cafaro: And we\u2019re seeing really nice margin expansion, 90 basis points in the third quarter. The implied guidance again, obviously, with operating leverage, we\u2019re going to see more margin expansion. So despite the labor discussion and everything else, we\u2019re pricing that plus. And we know this is a high operating leverage business. So that\u2019s a good formula.\nVikram Malhotra: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll move next to Michael Griffin at Citi.\nMichael Griffin: Great, thanks. Justin, in your conversations with operators, have you noticed that there\u2019s been an improvement in the turnover of the workforce. And then I just wanted to clarify something. On the contract labor side, I noticed it moved up to about 3% of the expense deck versus 2.5% last quarter. Should we read into that, that there is more contract later utilization? Or is that just a rounding issue?\nJustin Hutchens: Well, let me start with the first part. The one thing I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we\u2019ve had 12 quarters now of positive net hiring, excuse me, 12-months, four quarters of positive net hiring. And so that\u2019s obviously a really good indicator, given the backdrop. One thing I\u2019ll mention is that contract as a percentage of total labor has actually been coming down. You\u2019ll see it on that same page you mentioned, it\u2019s Page 13 of the deck, we were as high as 8.7% in the first quarter of 2022. It\u2019s down to 5.9% in the third quarter. There\u2019s \u2013 so it\u2019s good to see that there\u2019s some relief in terms of agency. Overall, labor expense, you can see off to the right, it\u2019s indicated on these bar charts. It\u2019s been relatively stable after initial period of being elevated. And we are seeing agency reduce in certain key markets that we\u2019ve highlighted before that are big users of agency, and we\u2019re starting to see that come down. North Carolina is one that jumps out. I know we\u2019ve mentioned before, Philadelphia as well, they both had double-digit reductions in agency. The LA MSA has also had a double-digit reduction in agency. And so where we\u2019ve had heavy users, we\u2019re starting to see some softening in improving and it\u2019s been a relatively slow process so, but it\u2019s a process that\u2019s yield improved results.\nMichael Griffin: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to Steven Valiquette at Barclays.\nSteven Valiquette: Hi, thanks. So, you guys show on Page 9 in the slide deck that the same-store SHOP pool will change dramatically from 3Q to 4Q with the increase in the properties. So, I guess with the same-store cash NOI accelerating from that 13% to 15% to 21%. I\u2019m guessing that probably even the 3Q same-store pool would probably see acceleration just with the price increases you\u2019re talking about. I just want to reconcile kind of what the trend would be without the S&R and transition assets as far as an acceleration, how much is that impact acceleration?\nDebra A. Cafaro: Yes. Yes. Thank you for asking that because Justin addressed it, and we want to be crystal clear on it. We are seeing that or projecting that accelerated SHOP year-over-year growth in the fourth. And what we\u2019re really happy about is this is representing now the lion share of our senior housing business. And that\u2019s really good for investors. It creates a lot of transparency and gives a really good insight into how the business is performing. And Justin can answer that your specific question on what\u2019s carrying the day here.\nJustin Hutchens: Yes. So the third quarter pool, so what we kind of referred to as the existing pool that was the year-over-year pool in the third quarter continues to be in the fourth quarter, which is now expanded. That pool is the strongest performer in this fourth quarter projection. So everyone is contributing in a very positive way. You mentioned new senior, we have a number of transition communities and some acquisitions that are in there as well. They\u2019re all contributing in the greater pools financial growth, but particularly the third quarter pool that was existing is driving most of the growth. \nSteven Valiquette: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: We\u2019ll move next to Rich Anderson at SMBC.\nRich Anderson: Thanks. Good morning. Can you hear me okay?\nDebra A. Cafaro: Yes, Rich.\nRich Anderson: Okay, great. Thanks. So, I guess I want to ask about the asset class that hasn\u2019t been mentioned much in this call, which is medical office. Your priorities are senior housing and life science. You\u2019ve been even mentioned senior care as a possible area to look at, but not medical office so much? And I\u2019m curious; you mentioned your price discovery commentary. Could we see some change there of substance for Ventas, maybe MOB conversions to life science, maybe MOB to the VIM fund, maybe MOB sales? I\u2019m certain you have an audience for that portfolio that\u2019s 20% of your business. Can you comment at all on where things might go with MOBs for Ventas in the next year or two or three? Thanks.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Well, my colleague, Pete is here, and he\u2019s done a great job on running that business and it\u2019s producing good results. And we\u2019ve always liked the business, but we really like the portfolio that we have. It\u2019s really high quality, mostly on the campuses of successful hospital systems, large creditworthy systems that are in a position to grow. And that\u2019s the main criterion for a successful medical office building. So, we really like the business. It has good metrics. It\u2019s performing well. And if we\u2019re happy with the business that we have. And for the current time, intend to keep it and grow it. As Pete has been bringing home over 3% growth here on same-store.\nRich Anderson: Okay, sounds good to me.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll move next to Jonathan Hughes at Raymond James.\nJonathan Hughes: Hey, good morning. Justin, I was hoping you could talk about the SHOP occupancy guidance. Is there any impact in there for potential increasing COVID and/or flu cases weighing on occupancy meaning that without that potential for a spike in case counts like we\u2019ve seen in the past two winters and the spike we\u2019re currently seeing in Europe, that guidance might have been higher? Or is there a little impact in that guidance since residents today are mostly vaccinated, pandemic is more endemic and move-in restrictions seem unlikely?\nJustin Hutchens: Sure. So the fourth quarter expectation, it has around \u2013 we mentioned the year-over-year growth range of 100 basis points to 150 basis points. The sequential growth is around 30 basis points. That\u2019s sort of consistent with what we would have seen pre-pandemic. It\u2019s a little higher. It\u2019s a little bit more growth. And \u2013 but it\u2019s relatively flat. So, if you look at history, you mentioned flu and impacts such as that, normally, that\u2019s more of a first quarter event if it does affect have an impact. So, I think the fourth quarter kind of expectation took into account, I think what we know on the ground today and a little bit just what we\u2019ve seen historically from a seasonal point.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Yes. I mean basically, the portfolio isn\u2019t showing signs of clinical conditions. And we\u2019ve assumed that, that status quo continues in the fourth.\nJonathan Hughes: Okay. And forgive me, but I\u2019m going to try to sneak in one more here related to Steve\u2019s question on move-outs. If the volume of move-out today is the same as 2019, but occupancy is lower, doesn\u2019t that mean we\u2019re seeing more move-outs on an occupancy adjusted basis that\u2019s preventing a faster rebound? Is there some kind of change in resident behavior here that is ongoing? Just trying to understand those comments you made earlier. Thanks.\nJustin Hutchens: Yes, sure. So first of all, it\u2019s not there yet. It\u2019s at 98%. So, I would say that, I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m not reacting to one quarter of results and to be indicative of a trend or something that we should consider to be forward-looking. It\u2019s move-outs. So, they\u2019ve never really ins or outs have never really moved on a perfect straight trend. So it\u2019s a little bit elevated in the third quarter. And eventually, as occupancy gets higher, we\u2019ll see move-outs go up as well as we said. One thing I want to clear up to you because I made it \u2013 I mentioned a number earlier, I talked about conversion rates. And on the slide on Page 10, bottom left to see conversion rates, these conversion rates refer to the U.S. I mentioned a different number. This number is 8% in the third quarter. Obviously, that was higher than where it was in the second quarter. So that kind of brings home the whole point of \u2013 we had a little slightly less leads, but higher move-ins and now is due to conversion rates. I just wanted to clear that up.\nDebra A. Cafaro: And the move-out resident behavior is stable and consistent with historical patterns. \nJonathan Hughes: Thank you.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Ronald Kamdem at Morgan Stanley.\nRonald Kamdem: Hey just going back to the same-store NOI guide for SHOP. And I appreciate that the pool changed a little bit slightly. But I guess the first question is just when I think about the acceleration from 3Q to 4Q, how do we break that out between sort of the occupancy versus the pricing? What\u2019s driving most of that? And then as we look into 2023, not really asking for guidance there, but how do we think about the comp for this year and potentially into next year? Thanks.\nBob Probst: Sure. Let me break down the price volume question, I think, inherent in the fourth quarter guidance. We\u2019ve got occupancy growing 100 basis points to 150 basis points revenue growing 8% [ph], implied in that is something like 6% [ph] revenue, i.e., RevPOR growth. So rate growth is really a strong contributor to the revenue growth. That\u2019s flowing through not only offsetting inflationary pressure, but driving margin expansion. And that\u2019s pretty much the playbook for the fourth quarter, led by the legacy pool, as Justin was describing. But the new entrants contributing as well. So that\u2019s the way it plays out. Clearly, what we\u2019ve seen this year from a baseline, if you\u2019re thinking about year-over-year is significant HHS grants I\u2019d start there; we got $54 million of HHS in the current year, notably in the first and third quarter. Nothing in the fourth, no expectation of any more HHS. But more importantly, we\u2019ve seen this nice trend of occupancy, very nice pricing power and this expense dynamic that is a macro dynamic. And that\u2019s been what we\u2019ve seen really for the last few quarters.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. Thanks.\nBob Probst: You bet.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll take Nick Yulico at Scotiabank. \nNick Yulico: Hi, good morning everyone. So, I just wanted to go back to the pricing in senior housing. I appreciate all the detail on Page 12 there is helpful. I guess if we put together all these numbers, it suggests, I think, that RevPOR growth should be stronger next year. But oftentimes, it\u2019s a little bit confusing to build up how RevPOR growth works in senior housing. And I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re \u2013 at some point, you face difficult comps next year? Do you also \u2013 is it harder to put a 10% rent increase out to residents if labor inflation comes down, right? Because I think that was a lot of justification for very high renewal rates. Was that labor costs were going up? So just trying to understand putting all this together, how we should think about potential RevPOR growth next year?\nDebra A. Cafaro: Nick, this is Debbie. We tried to put the funnel in there for you that Justin described on pricing and how it affects the installed base. Obviously, street rates and care also affect kind of your RevPOR, those are the components of it. And in terms of really I want to turn it over to Bob, his pricing is his favorite his absolute most favorite topic. I would just point out that seniors are seeing social security and COVID increases that were nearly 9% this year, and that\u2019s really supportive of the continued pricing. And most importantly, you would expect regardless of conditions as we take capacity out of the system as supply is low, demand is high. We increased from the 80%-ish occupancy level where we are today that pricing should get stronger, even irrespective almost of economic conditions. And so that is where you really could see some additionally positive momentum if you\u2019re able to price higher, but there\u2019s a softening of operating expenses and labor. That is the \u2013 that would be a very favorable backdrop. Bob, do you want to talk about pricing?\nBob Probst: I would just add that the move-in versus move-out rate is fundamental. And you mentioned this earlier, but as we are increasing in-place rates at 10% plus, all else equal, the street rate needs to rise consistent with that to keep you neutral on the re-leasing spread on RevPOR, right? And so the encouraging support to that is, as Debbie describes occupancy going up means scarcity of rooms that gives you pricing power. But that\u2019s the dynamic that needs to hold true. You then get into subtleties in RevPOR, things like change in acuity, for example, the in-place increase does not equate to RevPOR growth there\u2019s both the street rate versus move-out rate. There\u2019s the acuity mix. There\u2019s geographic mix. Those tend to tick down the headline RevPOR number. But we have not seen RevPOR growth like this in a decade. So, we are in somewhat uncharted territory, but those are all considerations to take into account.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Tayo Okusanya at Credit Suisse.\nTayo Okusanya: Yes. Good morning everyone. My question is kind of a long the line of Nick\u2019s question, and it\u2019s just about operational insights in particular. So Justin, again, curious a little bit what you\u2019re seeing with all the data you guys are analyzing about trend? And specifically, I\u2019m curious about \u2013 you had kind of discussed dynamic pricing at one point and maybe that could be another driver for increased pricing on the SHOP side and also kind of what you\u2019re seeing just around home price appreciation as that\u2019s decelerating whether that\u2019s having any real impact on demand in any of your markets?\nJustin Hutchens: Hi. Yes, good questions. That we are piloting dynamic pricing in several communities and so far, so good. It\u2019s a predictive model and it\u2019s early stages. So it needs to evolve over time before it has a really big impact. But we\u2019re using a number of sources to evaluate pricing power, where to set street rates, where to set in-house rate increases. We have a really close partnership with our operators as they\u2019re ultimately making these determinations. You asked about what was the second \u2013 the second question?\nTayo Okusanya: Home price appreciation, like in market where HPA is slowing, is that changing demand at all?\nJustin Hutchens: So, we\u2019ve been tracking the housing market. And one thing that I think is a really good indicator of where the market stands is days on market, obviously, I think most people know that during the summer months that houses were not sitting. They were moving really quickly. The normal days on market back in like pre-pandemic eras is like 60 days. We were seeing low double-digit days on market for houses within our markets. Now that\u2019s closer to around 30 days or so. I think it\u2019s just above 30%. It\u2019s been going up. And obviously, you would expect that it would. But I think what\u2019s important is that there\u2019s an enormous home equity. There\u2019s also other sources of income that our seniors are pulling from the affordability in our markets is like four times over our average length of stay. So, we feel really comfortable that our residents have the ability to pay for our services and our care. And the indication on the ground is that, that\u2019s continuing. And one of the good indicators is really the lead number, which is running way ahead of pre-pandemic levels. And in the third quarter, we have it on here, it was 109%.\nTayo Okusanya: Great. That\u2019s helpful. Also shout out to Pete on the MOB results.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Oh, he\u2019s smiling, Tayo.\nJustin Hutchens: Thanks, Tayo.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Austin Wurschmidt at KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Great. Thanks everybody. I wanted to hit on how the 10% in-place rent increase breaks out between the U.S. and Canada. And I\u2019m just curious, within that breakdown you provided in the business update. How does the 50% or so of early in-place increases in the 1Q increases break out between those two regions?\nJustin Hutchens: Sure. So Canada, I don\u2019t think it made the deck, but I\u2019m happy to share with you that last year, we were 8% in the U.S., we were 4% in Canada, and those were both relatively high increases, some of the highest that we\u2019ve put forward. This year in Canada, we\u2019re expecting around 7%. So pretty big increase, and it varies by region because there are certain limitations that we have to consider. But it\u2019ll have healthy growth as well.\nBob Probst: For to note that the U.S. is the 10%, right. In Canada, as described a 7%.\nAustin Wurschmidt: And what is the timing of increases in Canada throughout the year versus the U.S.?\nDebra A. Cafaro: Yes. A lot of Canada is anniversary.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll move to John Pawlowski at Green Street.\nJohn Pawlowski: Good morning. Justin, curious for your views whether labor \u2013 broader labor availability in the senior housing industry has improved enough, where you can get back to pre-COVID occupancy without needing to incur another big step change in labor costs from here?\nJustin Hutchens: That\u2019s a great question. And it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been very interested in because, obviously, you\u2019re in a situation where we\u2019re growing occupancy and on a year-over-year basis, on a full year-over-year basis. I want to say we\u2019ve added \u2013 another way to put it is since we\u2019re like halfway back to our pre-pandemic level. So, we\u2019ve added like 400 basis points, 500 basis points of occupancy, and we continue to have the ability to care for people safely. One thing that definitely works in our favor is that operating leverage that we mentioned earlier, Bob highlighted it, I think, nicely in the Q&A. And that is important because most of our operating expenses now are built in. You get it in over 80% occupied labor; all the other expenses tend to start growing at a much slower rate. And you have more flow-through that\u2019s the operating leverage working for you. So as we move into this next phase of growing from 80% occupancy up to wherever we land, you\u2019ll see it less expenses needed to support those new residents. And that\u2019s one of the big benefits of the operating models, the operating leverage.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. But as of now, are you seeing any kind of issues that could prevent that 88% to 90% occupancy? Or would that type of occupancy change need to coincide with reliance on agency labor or just increased staffing needs?\nDebra A. Cafaro: I mean it will depend on market conditions at that time and what the labor participation rate is and overall unemployment trends. And so that\u2019s a key factor. And what we\u2019re doing and what Justin is working with the operators on as he described, is making sure that our operators get at least, if not more than their fair share of the available labor pool to put our communities in the best possible position to win.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay, thank you for the time.\nDebra A. Cafaro: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll take a follow-up question from Juan Sanabria at BMO.\nJuan Sanabria: Hi, thank you. Just two quick follow-ups, given we\u2019re at the end of the call. First, could you comment on any expectations for Colony. I believe that loan could be paid next year. And so just thinking about the modeling and the implications of that? And then secondly, maybe more broadly, any thoughts on Brookdale, obviously, a large triple-net tenant reports on the press and your appetite to have greater exposure there or not, so just any thoughts around Brookdale would be appreciated?\nDebra A. Cafaro: Thanks, Juan. In terms of the Colony loan, it\u2019s performing. It matures in 2023. It has \u2013 the borrower has a one year extension, subject to certain conditions, and it\u2019s freely prepayable and well structured in terms of the way it could be prepaid. And so that\u2019s the update on Colony. And Brookdale, I think I\u2019d refer any questions on that to Brookdale.\nJuan Sanabria: I try it. Thank you.\nDebra A. Cafaro: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our final question from Vikram Malhotra at Mizuho.\nVikram Malhotra: Thanks. Just taking the follow-up. I know we\u2019re a ways from you giving sort of first quarter guidance. But I\u2019m wondering some things one, would you consider now giving full year guidance? And number two, just for the first quarter, can you just maybe highlight any bigger picture ins and outs that sort of maybe more obvious at this, whether it\u2019s rates or what you may be making or thinking about FX, just so that as we think about the trajectory, which historically numbers have been pressured versus 4Q? Is there any big blocks we can think about?\nDebra A. Cafaro: Well, thank you for the question, Vikram. We are very focused on delivering a strong end to the year of 2022, in line with our FFO growth and our SHOP growth projections. We\u2019re very excited about that and very focused on once again delivering those results in accordance with our projections. I would say that we embrace the opportunity to give full year guidance as and when it\u2019s appropriate for 2023 and as we sit here today, that\u2019s our expectation.  The reason we embrace that opportunity, it will mean that we really are back to a normalized environment, and there\u2019s nobody around who welcome that as much as we do. So thank you for the question. And with that, I\u2019d like to really end and close the call and thank everyone very sincerely both my colleagues as well as our participants here. We\u2019ve been waiting a long time, as I said, to be looking at such good results, good projections. I\u2019m very proud of the team, and we very much appreciate our relationship and dialogue with you. Look forward to seeing you soon. Thank you.\nOperator: And that concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Bob Probst",
            "content": "Thank you, Justin. I'll start with an overview of our third quarter office and enterprise results before closing with our outlook for the fourth quarter. Starting with office, same-store cash NOI grew 3% year-over-year, which represents a beat to our third quarter guidance. MOB has led the way with growth of 3.4%, driven by 90 basis points of occupancy gain. Quarterly retention was strong at 93% in the quarter, supplemented by new leasing exceeding 200,000 square feet. Medical office same-store occupancy is now at 91.8% and has increased year-on-year for five straight quarters. MOB same-store quarterly performance has now exceeded 3% for four quarters of the last five quarters. For R&I, year-to-date, same-store cash NOI performance is a strong 4.8%, while we posted same-store growth of 1.5% for the third quarter. As we told you earlier in the year, we're in the process of converting space into labs where we have seen opportunities from tenant departures as a result of COVID. At the enterprise level, despite the market volatility, we're very pleased that we once again delivered results that were in line or better than our original guidance ranges. Our total property same-store cash NOI increased 4.8% year-over-year, at the high end of our guidance range. And that result was led by SHOP, where same-store cash NOI grew 13% year-over-year, as Justin just described. But the SHOP P&L top to bottom, where we called it a quarter ago. Q3 normalized FFO of $0.76 per share is right in line with our guidance. And as a reminder, we received $0.05 of HHS grants in the quarter, which were included in our initial guidance. From a balance sheet perspective, we saw our leverage improved to 6.9 times in the quarter. As we look ahead, we're benefiting from the proactive steps we took prior to the run-up in interest rates to reduced near-term debt and extend duration. Some Ventas stats to call out include $2.5 billion of available liquidity, 2023 consolidated debt maturities and amortization is just $500 million or less than 2% of enterprise value and 11% of our consolidated debt is at floating rates. Let's talk Q4 guidance. We expect net income to range from $0.06 to $0.12 per fully diluted share. Q4 2022 normalized FFO is expected to range from $0.68 to $0.74 per share, which represents nearly 4.5% growth at the midpoint when compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, adjusted for unusual items in the prior year. SHOP is contributing $0.06 of growth year-over-year, while interest rates and FX are a $0.04 headwind. Total company same-store NOI growth year-over-year of 6% to 9% is expected with accelerating SHOP same-store NOI midpoint growth of 18%, leading the way. Bridging FFO from Q3 to the Q4 guidance midpoint is as follows: starting with Q3 of $0.71, adjusted for the $0.05 of HHS in Q3. In the fourth quarter, we expect $0.02 of sequential growth from SHOP, materially outperforming normal seasonal trends. We also expect to earn our first promote of approximately a $0.01 from our third-party capital business. The $0.03 of sequential good guys explained by SHOP in the promote are offset principally by a $0.02 reduction in FFO and due to higher interest rates on our floating rate debt. Other notable assumptions in our fourth quarter guidance include no new or unannounced material acquisitions or capital markets activities, 404 million fully diluted shares, and finally, we do not expect to receive any HHS grants in the fourth quarter. For more information on our guidance assumptions, I would direct you to the business update deck and a supplemental posted to our website. To close, we believe we are in an advantaged position in a dynamic macroeconomic backdrop with the portfolio and the team to deliver sustained value creation. That concludes our prepared remarks. For Q&A, we ask each caller to stay to one question to be respectful to everyone on the line. With that, I'll turn the call back to operator. Sure. Let me break down the price volume question, I think, inherent in the fourth quarter guidance. We've got occupancy growing 100 basis points to 150 basis points revenue growing 8% [ph], implied in that is something like 6% [ph] revenue, i.e., RevPOR growth. So rate growth is really a strong contributor to the revenue growth. That's flowing through not only offsetting inflationary pressure, but driving margin expansion. And that's pretty much the playbook for the fourth quarter, led by the legacy pool, as Justin was describing. But the new entrants contributing as well. So that's the way it plays out. Clearly, what we've seen this year from a baseline, if you're thinking about year-over-year is significant HHS grants I'd start there; we got $54 million of HHS in the current year, notably in the first and third quarter. Nothing in the fourth, no expectation of any more HHS. But more importantly, we've seen this nice trend of occupancy, very nice pricing power and this expense dynamic that is a macro dynamic. And that's been what we've seen really for the last few quarters. You bet. I would just add that the move-in versus move-out rate is fundamental. And you mentioned this earlier, but as we are increasing in-place rates at 10% plus, all else equal, the street rate needs to rise consistent with that to keep you neutral on the re-leasing spread on RevPOR, right? And so the encouraging support to that is, as Debbie describes occupancy going up means scarcity of rooms that gives you pricing power. But that's the dynamic that needs to hold true.

There's the acuity mix. There's geographic mix. Those tend to tick down the headline RevPOR number. But we have not seen RevPOR growth like this in a decade. So, we are in somewhat uncharted territory, but those are all considerations to take into account. For to note that the U.S. is the 10%, right. In Canada, as described a 7%."

            "name": "Justin Hutchens",
            "content": "Thank you, Debbie. I'll start by covering the third quarter SHOP results in our year-over-year same-store pool. We are pleased to report another quarter that was consistent with our expectations, while delivering strong year-over-year growth. NOI grew 13% year-over-year, which is above the midpoint of our SHOP guidance range led by the U.S. at 17.4%, while Canada demonstrated positive growth again with 5.9%. Same-store average occupancy grew year-over-year by 260 basis points to 84.7%. Same-store SHOP revenue in the third quarter grew ahead of expectations, increasing nearly 9% year-over-year due to continued acceleration in RevPOR [ph] [Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:32:00 2022  ]growth and positive trends in occupancy.[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:33:00 2022 ] [Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:33:00 2022 ] Pricing power has been impressive. At 5.4% year-over-year growth, RevPOR is the strongest we've seen in the last 10 years, primarily driven by in-house rent and care increases and re-leasing spreads that have improved to positive 1.4% in Q3 from negative double digits during the low point in the first quarter of 2021. Underpinning the re-leasing spreads are improvements in street rates, which increased 11% year-over-year in the third quarter. This pricing power is being driven in a U.S. portfolio that is only around 80% occupied, which is a real testament to the underlying demand for senior housing and bodes well for future pricing. As expected, expenses were $3.8 million per day. Operating expenses remained elevated as contemplated in the company's guidance for the third quarter. Year-over-year same-store operating expenses grew 7.6%, driven primarily by occupancy growth and continued macro inflationary impacts throughout the quarter on labor, utilities, repair and maintenance and food costs. Leading indicators in the U.S. remain very strong as we experience leads as a percent of 2019 at 109%, move-ins at 107% and out's at 98%. Canada continues to deliver growth and high occupancy at 94%. We are benefiting from positive operating leverage. SHOP NOI margin expanded 90 basis points in the third quarter due to stronger-than-expected revenue growth that outpaced continued elevated expenses. I have to say a big thank you to our operating partners, including Atria, Le Groupe Maurice, Sunrise and our regional operators who are delivering great results. Now, I will cover Q4 SHOP guidance and our expanded same-store year-over-year pool, which includes 478 communities. We are pleased that our strong year-over-year growth expectations are reflected in this much larger pool, which represents 87% of our SHOP portfolio. This larger pool includes assets that have transitioned from triple-net transition from other operators and acquisitions made in the prior year. Both the legacy same-store communities and the new entrance to the pool are expected to contribute attractive growth with the preexisting pool showing the strongest performance. SHOP same-store cash NOI is expected to accelerate from 13% growth in the third quarter in the range of 15% to 21% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. We anticipate year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 8% at the midpoint of the same-store cash NOI guidance range driven by continued strong rate growth and occupancy growth of 100 basis points to 150 basis points. Year-over-year revenue growth is expected to be partially mitigated by continued broad inflationary expenses. At the guidance midpoint, operating expenses are expected to be consistent on a per day basis with the third quarter in 2022. The bottom and top ends of the NOI range are principally driven by variability in operating expenses. Our guidance assumes attractive margin expansion. Moving on to asset management. Ventas OI, which is our approach to a collaborative oversight where we leverage our operating expertise and best-in-class data analytics to the benefit of our operating partners continues to differentiate our platform and is creating tangible value in our senior housing business. I'm pleased to report that we had a very productive third quarter, engaging with our operators on the underlying fundamentals and two important deep dive topics, rate increases and recruiting. Rate increases this coming year will be our highest on record. We started our process early and collaborated with our operators to develop recommendations down to the unit and resident level. These customized rate recommendations are grounded in data, should limit controllable move-outs and will be a huge contributor to revenue growth. It's really important to note that pricing power is greatly enhanced when we are delivering care and services resulting in highly satisfied residents and families. Historically, we have seen around 5% in-house rent increases in the U.S. We saw 8% in 2022, and we expect over 10% in 2023. Certain operators, notably Sunrise have already implemented early in-place rent increases and the results are positive and a good preview of what should be successful execution in the first quarter and beyond. We continue to address labor challenges in innovative ways. Our recent focus has been on community level staff recruiting to help our operators compete for talent more effectively. In doing so, we secret shopped over 50 job titles across 15 different operators to evaluate reputation, career website, the application process and application follow-up. While I was pleased to see that our operators scored well relative to industry benchmarks, we came away with several actionable recommendations to attract fresh talent to our communities. Ventas OI also continues to be a powerful tool in the capital allocation process. Our asset management teams are leveraging access to extensive industry and market-specific data to help drive decision-making around revenue-generating CapEx projects. Portfolios are evaluated on an asset-by-asset basis with communities prioritized based on near-term occupancy and rate upside as well as long-term supply and demand outlook. A significant investment of time and capital into this process has resulted in over 100 individual renovation projects currently underway within our SHOP portfolio, with a material number of those completing in the next several months. I'll conclude by highlighting my continued confidence in the growth opportunity in our senior housing business. There are very encouraging facts that continue to support this view. The supply and demand outlook remains very strong. The growth rate of the 80-plus population will be the highest on record. As we've noted before, 99% of Ventas senior housing markets are free from competitive new starts. We have had positive net move-ins for 18 months of the past 19 months and pricing power is consistently demonstrated through in-house rents and street rate increases, all working together to drive NOI growth. Now I'll hand the call over to Bob. Sure. In fact, one, there's a page that deck we put out that is Page 12 that describes this a little bit. And on the bottom right, we actually estimate the percentage of units that are eligible for increases, and we mentioned that 7% were actually pulled forward. So they would have normally been a first quarter increase. They've been pulled forward to before that. That includes Sunrise, which is mostly a fourth quarter increase. Sunrise targeted around 9%. They were really responding to the need to create value. And one thing we're very pleased with is that our revenue growth is outpacing expense growth, and Sunrise, the connection to ensure that, that continues to happen. They've made the decision to pull early. We also have other operators, obviously, that are targeting increases that are over 10% as we're stating on this page. And those start in the first quarter, and then there's a big group or about 42% that get them in the first quarter and then throughout the rest of the year, we'll see another 39% that are eligible for anniversary rent increases. And then the remaining just moved in late in 2022, so they don't get a 2023 increase. So obviously, we're very focused on this, and we'll continue to be \u2013 and the pricing power has just been superb. Him[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:37:00 2022 ].[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:37:00 2022  ] Sure[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:37:00 2022  ]s[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:37:00 2022 ]ure[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:37:00 2022 ]. This is Justin. So, I think what you're referring to is just the percentages that we're reporting as a percentage of 2019, which has been really good, because we've been outperforming the pre-pandemic levels. And it's a good metric because, obviously, we're in a recovery mode post-pandemic, and it's been interesting to see how we perform relative to 2019. But trending is really on an absolute basis. And I think a stat that might help you is from Q2 to Q3, our leads were down 1%. Our move-ins on an absolute basis were up 4%. So, I would basically say not much to report there. Yes. So we've had \u2013 our conversion rates have been relatively \u2013 they move around a little bit, but relatively consistent around 9% and moving activity,[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:38:00 2022 ] as I mentioned, actually it was higher in the third quarter than it was in the second on an absolute basis. So, we're very pleased with how we're positioned from a leading indicators and an actual movement standpoint and occupancy and ultimately, our pricing power as well. Hi, it's Justin. So the process I described in the prepared remarks was really designed to, first of all, make sure that we're getting us right. And then we're down to the community level and looking at units and residents a number of factors to consider what is the right increase. That was most important. [Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:39:00 2022  ][Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:39:00 2022 ] [Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:39:00 2022 ] Secondly, it's \u2013 how is this being communicated and the process that our operators are using to make sure that there's a feedback loop that's really strong, well executed. We have an early look, obviously, with Sunrise pulling forward. We have rate letters going out as well for some of our operators that are giving increases in January. And so far, so good. It's been relatively quiet and which is really encouraging. Yes, that's a great question because it does stick out a little bit. You'll notice if you look on the trending that we've been \u2013 I'm going all the way back to the first quarter of 2021, 94%, 91%, 91%, 96%, 97%, 92% and now 98%. And I absolutely would agree that as our absolute number of residents go up through occupancy growth that we'll see higher move-ups again,[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:41:00 2022 ].[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:41:00 2022  ] There[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:41:00 2022  ]'[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:41:00 2022  ]s[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:41:00 2022  ] [Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:41:00 2022  ]t[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:41:00 2022 ]here[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:41:00 2022 ]'[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:41:00 2022 ]s[Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:41:00 2022 ] [Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:41:00 2022 ]\u2013 I don't think this is necessarily the start of a trend. I think it was just an outcome within a quarter. And over time, they'll \u2013 eventually, they'll go back to 100%, but that would mean that our occupancy is back to where it was on a pre-pandemic basis. Hi, it's Justin. So first of all, actually, our length of stay has been very stable. There's been \u2013 I remember we had questions last year. Is it shortening? Is there some kind of higher acuity person coming in? That never happened. And so I would \u2013 it's pretty consistent with where it was even before the pandemic, and it's been consistent. So not much to really report on from a length of stay standpoint.  One thing I'll also mention, which is indicative of the demand at the doorstep and the pricing power is that our re-leasing spreads have been so good. So as residents have been moving in, they've been paying more than the last resident that occupied that unit. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that actually went positive in this past quarter. So pricing power has been great internally through in-house increases, but it's also been really strong from a Street rate standpoint as well. No, it was just that the \u2013 when you have someone move-out and you have a new person paying more for that unit when they move-in, that's a healthy for NIM. Yes. So absolutely. There \u2013 right now, we're pricing off of the current inflationary environment. So if that changes, and certainly, that could be additive to NOI growth. But we've been \u2013 this sector historically has had a pretty healthy spread in terms of increases over CPI, and CPI obviously is much higher these days, and we've continued to build that spread in. Pricing power has really always been a strength, and it's magnified now because of the emphasis on the expense growth. Obviously, revenue has been outpacing expenses significantly. So we're in good shape. Well, let me start with the first part. The one thing I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we've had 12 quarters now of positive net hiring, excuse me, 12-months, four quarters of positive net hiring. And so that's obviously a really good indicator, given the backdrop. One thing I'll mention is that contract as a percentage of total labor has actually been coming down. You'll see it on that same page you mentioned, it's Page 13 of the deck, we were as high as 8.7% in the first quarter of 2022. It's down to 5.9% in the third quarter. There's \u2013 so it's good to see that there's some relief in terms of agency. Overall, labor expense, you can see off to the right, it's indicated on these bar charts. It's been relatively stable after initial period of being elevated. And we are seeing agency reduce in certain key markets that we've highlighted before that are big users of agency, and we're starting to see that come down. North Carolina is one that jumps out. I know we've mentioned before, Philadelphia as well, they both had double-digit reductions in agency. The LA MSA has also had a double-digit reduction in agency. And so where we've had heavy users, we're starting to see some softening in improving and it's been a relatively slow process so, but it's a process that's yield improved results. Yes. So the third quarter pool, so what we kind of referred to as the existing pool that was the year-over-year pool in the third quarter continues to be in the fourth quarter, which is now expanded. That pool is the strongest performer in this fourth quarter projection. So everyone is contributing in a very positive way. You mentioned new senior, we have a number of transition communities and some acquisitions that are in there as well. They're all contributing in the greater pools financial growth, but particularly the third quarter pool that was existing is driving most of the growth. Sure. So the fourth quarter expectation, it has around \u2013 we mentioned the year-over-year growth range of 100 basis points to 150 basis points. The sequential growth is around 30 basis points. That's sort of consistent with what we would have seen pre-pandemic. It's a little higher. It's a little bit more growth. And \u2013 but it's relatively flat. So, if you look at history, you mentioned flu and impacts such as that, normally, that's more of a first quarter event if it does affect have an impact. So, I think the fourth quarter kind of expectation took into account, I think what we know on the ground today and a little bit just what we've seen historically from a seasonal point. Yes, sure. So first of all, it's not there yet. It's at 98%. So, I would say that, I wouldn't \u2013 I'm not reacting to one quarter of results and to be indicative of a trend or something that we should consider to be forward-looking. It's move-outs. So, they've never really ins or outs have never really moved on a perfect straight trend. So it's a little bit elevated in the third quarter. And eventually, as occupancy gets higher, we'll see move-outs go up as well as we said. One thing I want to clear up to you because I made it \u2013 I mentioned a number earlier, I talked about conversion rates. And on the slide on Page 10, bottom left to see conversion rates, these conversion rates refer to the U.S. I mentioned a different number. This number is 8% in the third quarter. Obviously, that was higher than where it was in the second quarter. So that kind of brings home the whole point of \u2013 we had a little slightly less leads, but higher move-ins and now is due to conversion rates. I just wanted to clear that up. Hi. Yes, good questions. That we are piloting dynamic pricing in several communities and so far, so good. It's a predictive model and it's early stages. So it needs to evolve over time before it has a really big impact. But we're using a number of sources to evaluate pricing power, where to set street rates, where to set in-house rate increases. We have a really close partnership with our operators as they're ultimately making these determinations. You asked about what was the second \u2013 the second question? So, we've been tracking the housing market. And one thing that I think is a really good indicator of where the market stands is days on market, obviously, I think most people know that during the summer months that houses were not sitting. They were moving really quickly. The normal days on market back in like pre-pandemic eras is like 60 days. We were seeing low double-digit days on market for houses within our markets. Now that's closer to around 30 days or so. I think it's just above 30%. It's been going up. And obviously, you would expect that it would. But I think what's important is that there's an enormous home equity. There's also other sources of income that our seniors are pulling from the affordability in our markets is like four times over our average length of stay. So, we feel really comfortable that our residents have the ability to pay for our services and our care. And the indication on the ground is that, that's continuing. And one of the good indicators is really the lead number, which is running way ahead of pre-pandemic levels. And in the third quarter, we have it on here, it was 109%. Thanks, Tayo. Sure. So Canada, I don't think it made the deck, but I'm happy to share with you that last year, we were 8% in the U.S., we were 4% in Canada, and those were both relatively high increases, some of the highest that we've put forward. This year in Canada, we're expecting around 7%. So pretty big increase, and it varies by region because there are certain limitations that we have to consider. But it'll have healthy growth as well. That's a great question. And it's something that we've been very interested in because, obviously, you're in a situation where we're growing occupancy and on a year-over-year basis, on a full year-over-year basis. I want to say we've added \u2013 another way to put it is since we're like halfway back to our pre-pandemic level. So, we've added like 400 basis points, 500 basis points of occupancy, and we continue to have the ability to care for people safely. One thing that definitely works in our favor is that operating leverage that we mentioned earlier, Bob highlighted it, I think, nicely in the Q&A. And that is important because most of our operating expenses now are built in. You get it in over 80% occupied labor; all the other expenses tend to start growing at a much slower rate. And you have more flow-through that's the operating leverage working for you. So as we move into this next phase of growing from 80% occupancy up to wherever we land, you'll see it less expenses needed to support those new residents. And that's one of the big benefits of the operating models, the operating leverage."

And obviously, the leads are well over 100% of 2019 levels and move-ins are at 109% [ph][Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:38:00 2022  ], I believe, of 2019 levels, which is very, very strong. Thank you. Hi Mike, this is Debbie. And I think that we still are in a period of volatility as far as capital costs. And as you well know, and historically, when we see this type of volatility, there is a period of price discovery, which we are still in. [Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:42:00 2022  ][Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:42:00 2022 ] [Author ID1: at Mon Nov 7 22:42:00 2022 ] I would tell you that the life science market, in particular, continues to have very tight cap rate expectations. And that's because there's really good demand continuing for certainly are types of lab buildings. And so that's showing through and is holding up, frankly, very well in the context of the volatility we've seen on capital costs. And MOBs, I think we're still seeing in the low to mid-5s. But I will close and say there's very limited data yet, and we still are in the price discovery period. And so more to follow once we get to a point where people are transacting more frequently. We'll have more data to report on. Yes. And that's the lemonade of the move-outs really. Yes. And as people moved in during a period of the pandemic at lower rates, obviously, that's where you start to get this positive momentum on re-leasing. And we're seeing really nice margin expansion, 90 basis points in the third quarter. The implied guidance again, obviously, with operating leverage, we're going to see more margin expansion. So despite the labor discussion and everything else, we're pricing that plus. And we know this is a high operating leverage business. So that's a good formula. Yes. Yes. Thank you for asking that because Justin addressed it, and we want to be crystal clear on it. We are seeing that or projecting that accelerated SHOP year-over-year growth in the fourth. And what we're really happy about is this is representing now the lion share of our senior housing business. And that's really good for investors. It creates a lot of transparency and gives a really good insight into how the business is performing. And Justin can answer that your specific question on what's carrying the day here. Yes, Rich. Well, my colleague, Pete is here, and he's done a great job on running that business and it's producing good results. And we've always liked the business, but we really like the portfolio that we have. It's really high quality, mostly on the campuses of successful hospital systems, large creditworthy systems that are in a position to grow. And that's the main criterion for a successful medical office building. So, we really like the business. It has good metrics. It's performing well. And if we're happy with the business that we have. And for the current time, intend to keep it and grow it. As Pete has been bringing home over 3% growth here on same-store. Thank you. Yes. I mean basically, the portfolio isn't showing signs of clinical conditions. And we've assumed that, that status quo continues in the fourth. And the move-out resident behavior is stable and consistent with historical patterns. Thank you. Nick, this is Debbie. We tried to put the funnel in there for you that Justin described on pricing and how it affects the installed base. Obviously, street rates and care also affect kind of your RevPOR, those are the components of it. And in terms of really I want to turn it over to Bob, his pricing is his favorite his absolute most favorite topic. I would just point out that seniors are seeing social security and COVID increases that were nearly 9% this year, and that's really supportive of the continued pricing. And most importantly, you would expect regardless of conditions as we take capacity out of the system as supply is low, demand is high. We increased from the 80%-ish occupancy level where we are today that pricing should get stronger, even irrespective almost of economic conditions. And so that is where you really could see some additionally positive momentum if you're able to price higher, but there's a softening of operating expenses and labor. That is the \u2013 that would be a very favorable backdrop. Bob, do you want to talk about pricing? Oh, he's smiling, Tayo. Yes. A lot of Canada is anniversary. I mean it will depend on market conditions at that time and what the labor participation rate is and overall unemployment trends. And so that's a key factor. And what we're doing and what Justin is working with the operators on as he described, is making sure that our operators get at least, if not more than their fair share of the available labor pool to put our communities in the best possible position to win. Thank you. Thanks, Juan. In terms of the Colony loan, it's performing. It matures in 2023. It has \u2013 the borrower has a one year extension, subject to certain conditions, and it's freely prepayable and well structured in terms of the way it could be prepaid. And so that's the update on Colony. And Brookdale, I think I'd refer any questions on that to Brookdale. You're welcome. Well, thank you for the question, Vikram. We are very focused on delivering a strong end to the year of 2022, in line with our FFO growth and our SHOP growth projections. We're very excited about that and very focused on once again delivering those results in accordance with our projections. I would say that we embrace the opportunity to give full year guidance as and when it's appropriate for 2023 and as we sit here today, that's our expectation.  The reason we embrace that opportunity, it will mean that we really are back to a normalized environment, and there's nobody around who welcome that as much as we do. So thank you for the question. And with that, I'd like to really end and close the call and thank everyone very sincerely both my colleagues as well as our participants here. We've been waiting a long time, as I said, to be looking at such good results, good projections. I'm very proud of the team, and we very much appreciate our relationship and dialogue with you. Look forward to seeing you soon. Thank you."

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Debra A. Cafaro, Chairman and CEO.\nDebra Cafaro: Thanks, BJ, and good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants. I want to welcome you to the Ventas second quarter earnings call. I'm delighted to be joined by my colleagues, including our newest addition, BJ Grant, who has already made many contributions to Ventas in a short tenure. Today, I'll recap our strong second quarter results, highlight the momentum in our life science, research and innovation business and address the macro trends in the economy and labor markets. We believe that Ventas is in an advantaged position to deliver value in this dynamic business environment because of our high-quality diversified portfolio and our team's industry insights and deep experience. Let's start with results. Ventas delivered a very positive second quarter with $0.72 of normalized FFO at the higher end of our guidance range. Property performance was at or above our expectations led by 9% year-over-year SHOP same-store net operating income growth. I'm excited to showcase our differentiated life science, research and innovation business, which now spans 11 million square feet and accounts for 10% of our property portfolio. This portfolio has significant momentum in deliveries, leasing and investment activity. With our strategic partner, Wexford, Ventas enjoys the nation's leading track record and reputation at the large and growing intersection of research, medicine and universities. Importantly, 77% of our rent is from high credit tenancy with 50% from universities with a weighted average credit rating of AA and the balance from investment-grade or $1 billion market cap companies. I'm really proud of what we've accomplished since 2016 when we began to invest in this business and how we've grown it since then. Here are some examples of our strong R&I momentum. Starting with deliveries, we recently delivered the 100% leased Drexel University Health Science Building on budget and ahead of schedule. This $280 million-plus project located in the thriving uCity Innovation District in Philadelphia was developed by our strategic R&I partner, Wexford. Drexel's Health Science Building is ready to welcome Drexel School of Nursing and Health Professions, its School of Medicine and its graduate programs for biomedicine, when school opens this fall. The project is expected to provide a 7% cash and 10% GAAP yield. We also intend to deliver One uCity Square by year-end. This 400,000 square foot multi-tenant lab and research building continues to expand our presence in the uCity Innovation District in Philadelphia, adjacent to University of Pennsylvania, and it is already 80% leased. We expect the building to exceed 90% leasing with highly-regarded life science and institutional research tenants in early 2023. The lease-up pace and rental rates are both substantially ahead of our pro forma, and the project is now expected to deliver over a 7% stabilized cash yield on cost of nearly $300 million. We also see terrific leasing momentum across other portions of our life science R&I portfolio. Our portfolio caters to the top 5% of research universities in the nation, and these institutions are aggressively expanding their research functions, creating incremental demand for lab space. We are currently in discussions with a handful of universities about taking significant amounts of additional lab space. In addition, we are leasing space quickly, and demand is high from commercial tenants who are attracted to university innovation centers. For example, at Pitts Phase II scheduled to open shortly, we recently signed a lease for 66% of the building with a premier global technology company. In Miami, we've already leased or committed 80,000 square feet that expired mid-2022 to new tenants at higher rates. Finally, we have momentum in R&I investment opportunities that will create value and deliver future growth. Today, we announced two exciting new developments that are great examples. With these two projects, we currently have $1.6 billion of total R&I development in progress, all leverage our significant competitive advantage with Wexford at the intersection of research, medicine and universities. The first new project is the Pearl located in fast-growing Charlotte, North Carolina. Sponsored by Atrium Health, a top 10 health system, the Pearl project will house research, lab, medical and academic uses, including the Wake Forest University School of Medicine. Atrium Health, which is rated Aa3 is leasing 70% of the project and will be our 37% partner. The Pearl will also serve as the exclusive North American headquarters for IRCAD, the French Training Institute in advanced surgical techniques and robotics for world-class surgeons. We expect delivery of the Pearl in 2025. On the West Coast, Wexford and Ventas have been selected by the University of Washington to develop a 300,000-plus square foot project anchored by the university for its research programming in clean energy, medicine and life science. UDub, rated Aaa by Moody's, is a world-class research university that receives more federal research funding than any other U.S. public university. Seattle is the #6 life science market in the U.S., and this project will expand our R&I footprint to six of the top 7 life science markets. We look forward to sharing more details with you as this exciting project progresses. Behind these new projects, our R&I development pipeline contains an additional $1 billion of potential development opportunities. I hope that gives you a picture of the momentum we see in our attractive life science R&I business. It is a great example of our ability to enter a new space thoughtfully, expand and grow it successfully through different market conditions and align with excellent partners. Regarding our capital allocation approach and activities, we've shown $1.3 billion of investment activity year-to-date, consistent with our stated priorities and balanced approach. We've also announced additional investments in the senior housing space at an attractive yield with future growth potential and a fully-leased medical office building, utilizing capital from our fund to acquire this stable MOB. As we look forward in the third quarter of 2022, we are again projecting that our earnings will benefit from outstanding year-over-year growth in our SHOP segment, which is expected to increase NOI 12% at the midpoint, higher than second quarter's 9% year-over-year SHOP NOI growth rate. We do expect expenses and wages in Q3 to remain elevated, reinforced by today's jobs report. We will also recognize the benefit of $20 million of HHS grants in the third quarter, which we received to reimburse us for a portion of the expenses we incurred to keep residents and workers safe during the pandemic, although that benefit will be muted by a $0.02 impact we expect from higher interest rates as a consequence of the Fed tightening. The demographic backdrop is supportive of our business, and we believe we are well positioned to succeed. First, supply and demand conditions are favorable with acceleration in the growth of the 80-plus population. Our senior housing product is highly affordable and need-based, and the senior market we serve has significant resources. With senior housing starts and inventory under construction well below cyclical highs particularly in independent living, our senior housing business is set up for continued net absorption and pricing power. With this favorable supply-demand backdrop in senior housing, we will use the power of our high-quality diversified portfolio and our team's commitment, experience and insights to continue to create value for stakeholders. Thanks for your time, and I'll turn it over to Justin.\nJustin Hutchens : Thank you, Debbie. I'll start by highlighting how well positioned our senior housing portfolio is within this sector, which is benefiting from very strong demand drivers. We are the second largest owner of senior housing in the world with communities located in 47 states, seven Canadian provinces and UK managed by 37 distinct market-leading operators. As Debbie mentioned, the supply-demand fundamentals in senior housing are compelling. We have experienced an acceleration in the 80-plus population growth over the past two years, and 2023 will represent the highest increase in 80-plus population on record. We also have outsized affordability in our respective markets where our target customer net worth is 4x the average cost of a stay in our setting. The senior population has significant savings and home equity that are utilized to pay for our services if the need arises. On the supply side, according to the National Investment Center for Senior Housing, units on our construction as a percentage of inventory of 4.8% has not been this low since the first quarter of 2015, and deliveries of 4,600 units is down 49% from the second quarter of 2017 peak. And aside from the second quarter of 2020 has not been this low since 2016. 99% of Ventas senior housing markets are not exposed to new starts as we face an aging demographic, which is the strongest we have seen. These facts point to considerable upside in our well-positioned senior housing portfolio. We are seeing early evidence of the benefits of our strong market position. For instance, year-to-date through July, net move-in activity continues to grow. And we have had positive net move-ins for 16 of the past 17 months, and NOI has been solid as our year-over-year same-store SHOP portfolio grew 14.2% in the first quarter and 8.7% in the second. Turning to the second quarter SHOP results and our year-over-year same-store pool. We are pleased to report another quarter that was consistent with our expectations while delivering solid year-over-year and sequential NOI growth. Pricing power has been impressive. At 5% year-over-year growth, RevPOR is the strongest we've seen in the last 10 years, primarily driven by in-house rent increases, which are running approximately 8% in the U.S. and 4% in Canada, care rate increases at 10% and re-leasing spreads that have improved from negative 14.7% since the low point in the first quarter of 2021 to nearly flat in June. Same-store average occupancy grew year-over-year by 390 basis points to 83.7%, which was in line with our guidance. Leads, move-ins continued to perform above pre-pandemic levels. The key selling season of May to September is off to a strong start. We have netted 470 move-ins through July, which is 307 higher than the same period in 2019. July average occupancy grew 30 basis points over June. These positive results in occupancy and rate drove same-store revenue to increase by over 10% versus the prior year. Turning to expenses. As we anticipated, expenses were $3.8 million per day. Same-store operating expenses grew 6.1% on a per occupied unit day basis and 11.3% overall year-over-year driven by higher occupancy and continued macro inflationary impacts on labor and other operating expenses. Labor expenses remained elevated as expected as we navigated the inflationary wage pressure and macro staff shortages. I am encouraged that our managers have successfully implemented a number of labor initiatives that we identified last fall. These initiatives include centralized line staff recruiting, applicant tracking technology enhancements and application process improvements. The result is an advancement in net hiring and the stabilization of our workforce. We have had 11 months in a row of positive net hiring, and we experienced a double-digit reduction in contract labor costs in the second quarter. Net hiring is critical to our ability to stabilize the workforce and reduce reliance on more costly and less reliable contract labor. NOI grew 8.7% year-over-year, near the high end of our SHOP guidance range led by the U.S. at 14%, while Canada demonstrated positive growth again with 1%. The incremental margin from Q1 to Q2 was 80%, while overall margin expanded 60 basis points from 23.8% to 24.4%. NOI grew 6.1% in the sequential same-store pool. Bob will cover our Q3 SHOP guidance shortly. COVID conditions have remained relatively consistent the last few months. We still have new cases occurring for staff and residents causing marginal impacts on move-ins and staffing most notably in Canada, where the regulatory environment is more stringent. Before I wrap up, I'll give a quick update on Ventas OI. We continue to utilize Ventas operational insights to engage with our operating partners more closely using our operational and analytical expertise. This quarter, we addressed digital marketing capabilities in three modules: technical website audits; UX audits, which are user experience evaluations; and hyper local SEO. This initiative is meant to optimize our digital lead bank, which is the fastest growing of all our lead sources and now represents over 3/4 of all lead volume. I am pleased with how well received Ventas OI has been among our operating partners since we introduced it at the beginning of this year, and we continue to develop it to be a model for mutually-beneficial capital partner and operator relationships. I'll summarize by saying that we have made significant progress to our post-COVID NOI recovery opportunity with a lot of upside remaining. The occupancy low point was 78% in March of 2021. We've already grown significantly since then to 84%. And given our strong market position and supportive macro backdrop, we are excited about the continued organic growth opportunity in our senior housing portfolio. Bob?\nRobert Probst: Thanks, Justin. I'll start with an overview of our second quarter office and enterprise results before closing with our outlook for the third quarter. Our office segment, which includes our medical office and research and innovation businesses, performed well in Q2, delivering 3.2% year-on-year same-store growth. Medical office year-on-year quarterly same-store growth was 2.8% led by contractual escalators, strong retention, new leasing and favorable expense controls. MOB occupancy rose 50 basis points from prior year and 10 basis points sequentially. R&I increased quarterly same-store 4.6%, also benefiting from escalators, leasing and higher parking. Same-store occupancy in R&I is a strong 93.2%. We were very pleased with our overall enterprise performance in the second quarter with results top to bottom at the higher end or better of our guidance range. Notably, we delivered FFO of $0.72 per share, which is at the higher end of our guidance range of $0.69 to $0.73. And that result was led by SHOP, where cash NOI grew nearly 9% year-over-year, as Justin described, with occupancy revenue and NOI where we called it a quarter ago despite a challenging backdrop. When combined with strong performance in office and triple net, total property same-store NOI increased 3.5% year-over-year, above the high end of our guidance range. Our performance trajectory and proactive steps to deliver results are being recognized. For example, all three rating agencies have made positive ratings moves in the last month to BBB+ stable, and 20 of our lending relationships provided a $500 million five-year term loan refinancing and upsizing the prior term loan at better pricing. We're very pleased that we took smart steps to enhance our portfolio quality and to reduce near-term debt, extend maturities prior to the run-up in rates and now have 89% fixed rate debt. Debt duration exceeds six years. Our average cost of debt is 3.5%. We have limited near-term maturities and robust liquidity of $2.5 billion.  In terms of Q3 guidance, we expect net income to range from $0.04 to $0.09 per fully diluted share. Q3 normalized FFO is expected to range from $0.73 to $0.78 per share. The bridge from Q2 FFO per share of $0.72 to $0.76 at our Q3 midpoint is as follows: a net increase of $0.03 from $0.05 of HHS grants received in July, less $0.02 from higher interest rates on our floating rate debt and a stronger U.S. dollar; plus $0.01 of property growth led by the opening of the Drexel R&I development Debbie described earlier. A note: to enhance comparability, we now present SHOP same-store and cash NOI results excluding the benefit of HHS grants received in all periods. Let's drill into the SHOP assumptions for Q3. We expect SHOP cash NOI to grow in the range of 9% to 15% year-over-year or 12% at the midpoint, which represents an acceleration from the 9% year-over-year NOI growth posted in the second quarter. Revenue is forecast to grow 8% at the midpoint led by occupancy increasing 250 basis points to 300 basis points as well as through improving rates. Despite continuing broad inflationary expense pressure, our NOI guidance growth of 12% at the midpoint implies margin expansion. Our SHOP Q3 revenue is expected to grow sequentially led by average occupancy, which is forecast to increase 100 basis points versus the Q2 average and incorporates a continuation of positive occupancy growth trends observed in July. This revenue growth is effectively offset by sequential operating expense increases in Q3, notably including broad inflationary pressure and an extra day in the quarter. Therefore, SHOP cash NOI, though ahead of seasonal patterns, is effectively flat. Final Q3 guidance assumptions include no new unannounced material acquisitions or capital markets activities and 404 million fully diluted shares. For more information on our guidance assumptions, I would direct you to the business update deck posted to our website. To echo Debbie's comments, I'm excited to have BJ Grant on the Ventas team. BJ has hit the ground running, and the improved and streamlined supplemental package posted as part of Q2 earnings is the latest evidence of the IR enhancements that are underway at Ventas. To close, we believe we are in an advantaged position in the dynamic macroeconomic backdrop with the portfolio and the team to deliver sustained value creation. That concludes our prepared remarks. Before we start with Q&A, we ask each caller to state one question to be respectful to everyone on the line. With that, I will turn the call back to the operator.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI.\nSteve Sakwa : I guess maybe for Justin. You laid out a lot of positives, whether it's the re-leasing trends getting better, the care pricing, the move-in, the in-place rate increases. Everything seems great. And I guess I'm just wondering why your occupancy gain is less in Q3 than it was in Q2. What's sort of holding that back? Is that conservatism? Is there something that you sort of see about the occupancy gains? .\nJustin Hutchens : Sure. So I'll just reinforce a few of those positives first. So the one thing I mentioned is that 16 of the last 17 months we've had positive net move-ins. Our year-over-year comparison has been really strong. In fact, in the U.S., in the second quarter, it was 470 basis points year-over-year. We're expecting that to be 320 year-over-year in the third quarter. Canada, by the way, was 250 year-over-year in the second. We're expecting that to be 200 year-over-year in the third. One thing I'll mention is that the sequential growth is expected to be 100 basis points. We were 70 basis points in the last quarter, so we do have some sequential occupancy growth as well. But everything has been pointing up, and we're certainly benefiting from that, and we have a lot of upside ahead of us over time.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.\nJoshua Dennerlein : A question on Canada. I guess it lagged in 2Q. What's the underlying assumptions for 3Q? And maybe just a little bit more color on kind of what was driving that underperformance?\nJustin Hutchens : It's Justin. So yes, Canada, first of all, it's 94% occupied. It's a very stable, strong, consistent performer for us. It did have growth in the second quarter. Just to break down the guidance that Bob gave, Canada in the third quarter is expected to have cash NOI growth of between 2% and 5%. And that includes revenue year-over-year 6%, and I mentioned already 200 basis points of occupancy on a year-over-year basis. And so we're anticipating growth in Canada. They've had -- we've had not a lot of activity that was COVID-related in the second quarter. But where we did have it, some restrictions on move-ins, it was disproportionately affecting Canada. And then meanwhile, the U.S. is really the growth engine, where our cash NOI is expected to grow between 13% and 21% in the third quarter, revenue 9% year-over-year and 320 basis points of occupancy. So really strong, stable performer in Canada, growth engine in the U.S.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Mike Griffin from Citigroup.\nMichael Griffin : I just wanted to go on to the disposition guidance. I noticed that it declined $100 million quarter-over-quarter. Just curious if you can expand on that a bit, maybe assets you're targeting for sale and then what you might be seeing in the transaction market more broadly.\nRobert Probst : Yes. I'll hit on the guidance. I can pass it to John on the second question. But we went from $200 million to $100 million in the back half. That's really a timing question as much as anything, frankly, in terms of expectations of when asset sales will close with various portfolios on the market. But the theme of looking for opportunities to upgrade the portfolio using those disposition proceeds to reinvest. We'll continue in the back half and into next year. Do you want to touch on transactions? \nJohn Cobb: Sure. I mean, I think we had a good start in 2022. We've done roughly about $1.3 billion of new investments. I think we're seeing a fair amount of deal volume still out there. I think we're being careful in what we choose, but we are seeing -- still seeing a fair amount of volume of transactions that we do like.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Markets. .\nMichael Carroll : I wanted to touch on the RevPOR growth expectations within your SHOP portfolio. I think we all understand the real estate part. But on the care part, with pricing up 10% in the second quarter, is that fully keeping up with inflation? And how often or can your operators pass those increases to residents given how quickly the inflation expectations are changing?\nJustin Hutchens : So as it pertains to care, we are seeing the actual care rate that's charged has been raised 10%, and that is a huge step in the direction of keeping up with inflation. The other thing that occurs is I'm sure you know is that as resident at on place and their needs grow, we'll have we'll have care charges increase in conjunction with resident needs, which helps to pay for the labor required to take care of residents. And so this is the -- it's really the highest we've seen in terms of care charge increases. That can happen more than one time a year. They tend to only happen one time a year, but there's -- it was encouraging to see the execution on care prices on top of the strong in-house rent increases, plus The Street rates are growing as well.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC.\nRichard Anderson : So I want to talk about the sequential again and specifically looking at same-store versus total. So you did 70 basis points on the same-store pool. I think I had that right. And -- but when you look at the total portfolio, which is substantially more assets, the increase was -- I'm looking at the sequential rate, excuse me, the increase was somewhat less. So what is the -- maybe Justin, can you bucket the 546 assets that are total versus the 321 that are same-store and whether or not the difference is an incremental upside to Ventas beyond the same-store picture? Or is there something about new senior and some of the new acquisitions and transitions that are going to take more time for you to see the occupancy build that we're all anticipating? .\nJustin Hutchens : Yes. That's -- it's a good observation, Rich. There's a couple of hundred communities that are in that kind of non-same-store category. They have some unique characteristics. One is that they're lower occupied. So they run below the rest of the pool, kind of mid-70-ish. They have more upside therefore. They also have been growing faster. They had double-digit sequential growth Q1 to Q2. So the performance is good, and we do expect that pool to grow and be a big contributor to that U.S. growth engine that I mentioned.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital. .\nJuan Sanabria : I just wanted to change tack a little bit notwithstanding the credit affirmation by the rating agencies. I just wanted to get a sense of the plan for the balance sheet with the leverage kind of ticking up at 7.3x. What the plan is? And when do you expect to be kind of back to within your target range, which is definitely lower than that? So just curious on visibility there and timing.\nRobert Probst : Yes, I'll take that one, Juan. First off, we were really pleased to see all three agencies take that positive rating action to BBB+. And really, the predicate of that across the board was the trends we're seeing in senior housing. And you'll know the fact that we've been above the range due to COVID. It's the impact on SHOP NOI and the recovery, therefore, of the NOI has been -- continues to be the key to get back in the range. In the meantime, we've been doing smart things along the way. I mentioned asset dispositions to upgrade the portfolio, reducing near-term debt as an example. We continue to do those types of things depending on market conditions. But fundamentally, the predicate of getting back into that range is SHOP NOI growth. \nDebra Cafaro : Right, right. The net debt to EBITDA, the EBITDA growth is an important component of getting back in the range.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Mizuho.\nVikram Malhotra : So I guess I just want to step back and think about maybe a little bigger picture trend that you can maybe help us walk through or tell me where I'm wrong. You just laid out O&I really strong. You're producing 4-plus percent NOI growth. MOB is steady. You just -- and Justin, you laid out why the senior housing portfolio is very well set up into '23. So given all of this, if I want to boil it down to underlying earnings growth of FAD growth over a multiyear period, and I'm not asking for '23 numbers, what I'm trying to understand is, where would I be wrong if I take all of that and say over a three-year period, you can average 5% plus FAD growth. But ultimately, the underlying question is, does all of this translate into cash earnings?\nRobert Probst : Well, the short answer is, yes, we do feel across the portfolio with different drivers, non-correlated drivers of demand and growth that we will see portfolio, cash flow growth and NOI growth, FFO and FAD to your point. Not giving you a forecast, of course, on timing and slope. But absolutely, that is the portfolio view. The organic growth opportunity is better than I've seen in my eight years at Ventas, and I think some time before that, and so growing reliable cash flows certainly is the projection.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Steve Valiquette with Barclays.\nSteven Valiquette : Just on Slide 6 in the presentation where you show the $3.8 million per day of SHOP operating expenses in 2Q. That should be the same number in 3Q. I guess I just wanted to unpack that a little bit further when there could be more favorable operating leverage if that does come down. And I guess, at the end of the day, the question is, on an absolute basis, will that $3.8 million number actually come down? Or does it just stay flat to up, hopefully just grow at a slower pace maybe as you exit '22 and move into 2023?\nDebra Cafaro : I mean that's really a macro question. And obviously, we're in a very dynamic macro environment changing by the minute, as we saw with today's jobs trends. I think looking into the third, we do continue to see those inflationary pressures. I think we need to incorporate in policymakers' minds a longer-term view now with the new news today of where we expect to see CPI and wage expectations over the next year. But that is -- the $3.8 million is really a function of the macro. We are doing everything we can. Our operators are doing everything they can to manage that growth, including the net hiring that Justin talked about, which is pretty fundamental.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Kramer : Just wanted to maybe kind of drill in on Slide 9, and I appreciate kind of the disclosure there around pricing in RevPOR. Looking at kind of the releasing spread trends, really kind of positive trends here in the last year plus. I guess kind of the question is, where can we go from here? And again, not asking you to kind of drill down on the specific timing for when this may turn positive. But how kind of how much can you kind of push re-leasing spreads? And where can we kind of take that from here? And then on the care side, 10% is a really strong number. How high can you kind of push that number as well?\nJustin Hutchens : So this is Justin. So first of all, yes, the trend has been great, particularly the re-leasing spread trend. You might remember that even before the pandemic, that was typically a negative number around kind of mid-single digit negative. We're doing much better than that now. That really helps demonstrate the demand at the doorstep and the pricing power and see that number actually -- we're showing the second quarter on the slide you mentioned, but it was almost flat in June. It was -- that's really encouraging. We do have groups of communities that are positive already from a re-leasing spread standpoint. And that's certainly possible, but there's always going to be a consideration around price and volume that will come over time. So this doesn't necessarily -- it's not necessarily going to look like walking up a set of stairs. There could be some movement in the trend. And then on care, that's really -- it's just another form of pricing. The in-house rent increases really gave confidence around the pricing power. The re-leasing spread helped as well, and care is an important component in the assisted living business. So that\u2019s an area that gets focused as well in terms of pricing. And the -- really the goal and opportunity is really just to keep a differential eventually between that revenue increase and that expense increase and drive the NOI growth and doing that in a way that's taking the best possible care of people.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.\nNick Yulico : So I want to turn to the development program. I know you announced a new start with Le Groupe Maurice. You also have a new R&I development. Can you just remind us from a size standpoint, how we should think about incremental starts going forward? I think when you did Le Groupe Maurice originally, you talked about two to three development starts per year. And then R&I I know is sort of lumpier. You got a big one this quarter. And then I guess, just reminding us as well, just from a funding standpoint, how we should think about this? Is this all -- are there already construction loans set up within the joint ventures to fund most of this?\nDebra Cafaro : Well, thanks. Good to talk to you. I would say, yes, you're correct about Le Groupe Maurice. This has been a great investment for us both in terms of the as the existing operating assets that we acquired and then the development pipeline. And you're right, we have grown that at about two to three a year and did announce a new deal. These are really outstanding assets. And one thing we really like about the developments there is that when they open they're already significantly pre-leased, and that's a unique model that's been really effective. In terms of the R&I business, these two new projects are super exciting. We'll continue to fund those. Optimally, I would say, in general, we do get construction financing for 50 to -- 50% to 2/3 of the building. And some of them we do on balance sheet and some of them we do under our Ventas Investment Management platform. And with these new developments, we would expect to optimize that capital structure for the best way we can for Ventas.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.\nMike Mueller : Curious, for the two new development announcements, how long ago did you start discussions for those? And did your expected returns -- I guess your return expectations evolve over the past few months?\nDebra Cafaro : These discussions with these major research universities are long processes. The good news is, again, this demand from universities for state-of-the-art lab space is just voracious, and we're able to continue with Wexford to target really this top 5% of research universities. The yields continue to be, I think, very attractive on a risk-adjusted return basis. And we've been successful in delivering projects on time, on budget. And so we have a very good track record there and an ability to modify yield based upon ultimate costs working with those universities. So it's a very good model with significant pre-leasing. And the risk/reward is quite good, which is why we keep doing it. We're lucky that we have this competitive advantage in this business.\nOperator: The next caller -- will come from John Pawlowski with Green Street.\nJohn Pawlowski : I want to go back to Steve and Rich's question about the trajectory of SHOP occupancy. So 100 bps sequential improvements very good in a normal year, but we're still coming out of the basement. So I guess we're all wondering what's holding back specifically in the U.S., the trajectory of occupancy given we should have a lot of pent-up demand? And why aren't we seeing 150 bps, 200 bps, 250 bps type of trajectory of occupancy given the jump-off point we're coming from?\nJustin Hutchens : Well, I guess the way I would frame it is it's a function of supply and demand. We've had -- it's not just kind of a recent phenomenon that we've been experiencing these new movements. It's been happening for last 16 or 17 months. If there was some pent-up demand, I think I would point to the early part of '21 where we had a pop when vaccines were executed and April stands out, for instance. But I think what we're seeing overall is just really strong demand fundamentals. And like I mentioned, it's growing, and we have even more growth ahead of us in next year and beyond. So we're well positioned. We're playing into it. Our portfolio has been significantly outperforming the overall NIC data, the sector data that the NIC industry puts out. So we're growing and we're growing at a pace we haven't seen before.\nDebra Cafaro : And the sequential occupancy projected growth is higher than the second quarter sequential occupancy growth. So we're pleased by that and good year-over-year growth projected in the third.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Dave Rodgers with Baird.\nDavid Rodgers : I wanted to drill down a little bit on commercial and leasing spreads a little bit for R&I and medical office. Can you kind of give us a sense for where those leasing spreads are coming in today? And I guess for MOB in particular, would be interested if you're seeing an increased level of spreads and those conversations and being able to push through additional escalators in the leases. So any additional color there would be helpful.\nDebra Cafaro : Pete is very happy for the question. So Pete.\nPeter Bulgarelli : Yes. I got a question.\nDebra Cafaro : Yes, exactly.\nPeter Bulgarelli : Yes, terrific. Well, we've been having a high degree of success in MOBs in particular and really all across office in growing occupancy. For MOBs, we were one of the few that had occupancy growth last year, also in the first quarter and then again in the second quarter. So we're very pleased with our leasing success. We have much less space to lease just based on the lease expirations in this quarter, but we're leasing quite a bit more space than we did last year at this time. So it's a great dynamic. Leasing spreads and escalators are both increasing significantly. For the entire portfolio, the leasing -- lease escalator has gone up by 10 basis points just in this quarter. And we don't disclose the re-leasing spreads because I still haven't been able to make heads and tails of how it really works with some of our competitors, but it's positive.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Credit Suisse.\nOmotayo Okusanya: So a quick question about the triple net portfolio. And I guess the occupancy on the senior housing side, it's so well below your occupancy side. So kind of curious why that continues to lag as much as it does and if there's kind of any additional risk of having to address rents for some of the tenants that still have to kind of meet the weak rent coverage.\nDebra Cafaro : Justin is going to take that, Tayo.\nJustin Hutchens : Yes. So the occupancy is really just a function of the going in occupancy. So when I say that, I mean leading heading into the pandemic period, it was running lower already. We have higher absolute occupancy in our SHOP portfolio. The triple net portfolio is obviously a little lower occupied. It's carried a little bit more expense as well. But the kind of the credit situation and the stability of the cash flows have improved dramatically. We've put a lot of effort in over the last 1.5 years to improve our position with those leases. And we mentioned last quarter some COVID cleanup, that's occurred now. So if the trajectory of the sector continues in a positive way, we expect the triple-net portfolio to continue to improve and perform well.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Daniel Bernstein with Capital One.\nDaniel Bernstein: So I actually want to go back to seniors housing and the projections for 3Q. When you look at the percentage of move-ins versus 2019, they've kind of been coming down over the last few quarters. Have you seen any -- and historically, we've seen some impacts from when move-ins right, when stock market goes down when home sales velocity kind of slows. Have you seen any evidence of that kind of deer-in-headlight effects in the last quarter or two and into 3Q? And does that play into your projections for 3Q?\nJustin Hutchens : Yes. So I mean one thing we do watch is consumer sentiment. It's something we keep an eye on because although it's not usually strongly correlated to senior housing because senior housing is more needs-driven, it's something that maybe could have impact on the fringes. The growth we've experienced has been pretty consistent. We've had very consistent lead and move-in activity. We've also been relatively low, which is obviously helpful and supportive of net move-ins. So right now, I mean we just gave guidance on the third quarter. We're expecting growth, and there's good support for that. And we're always watching all the macro market kind of key indicators. Debbie mentioned a lot of them, and there's others as well. So we'll be mindful of the macro environment.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Mike Griffin with Citigroup. \nMike Griffin : Just a quick question on spot occupancy growth. I noticed the occupancy build is kind of late in the second quarter. Maybe that explains the higher average expected in the third quarter, but kind of curious about your thoughts there and maybe any expectations around that.\nRobert Probst : Yes, Michael, I'd say the spot in the average are pretty close to each other. So yes, we had a nice end of the second, but hope for the same in the third. So average is a good proxy.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line Juan Sanabria of BMO Capital.\nJuan Sanabria : Just a question maybe for Justin. If I look at Page 17 of the investor deck focusing on affordability, it looks like you have significant headroom to potentially push pricing. Is that something that the operators are receptive to? Or just curious if that is a push for the OI platform and an opportunity in your mind.\nJustin Hutchens : Those are so much of my favorite topics, Juan. I would say the first\u2026\nJuan Sanabria : I had to go\u2026. \nJustin Hutchens : I know you did. I don't even think we have time to go through at all. I would say on the first part on affordability, I know you know this, but the big opportunity in the sector is price transparency, which we really don't have today. So you'll hear language like price discovery, where we're pushing pricing in markets and just testing for resistance. And obviously, this year, there hasn't been much because we're pushing on all fronts. And the affordability really points to that as well. And our operating partners have been just magnificent, I think, in playing into that opportunity and having the confidence to push, and it's an area that we're definitely improving in. And then from an OI standpoint, we definitely do focus on pricing. It's a huge part of the focus even before we called it OI officially. Last fall, we were highly engaged with our operators to plan for the pricing execution that we've seen this year. So it's always a hot topic, and it's a big opportunity for the sector over time as well because it -- we deliver a tremendous service to our residents. It's comprehensive, and it's very valuable. And...\nDebra Cafaro: They can afford it. \nJustin Hutchens : And they can afford it, bottom line, yes.\nDebra Cafaro : So that's the definition of a good situation. All right. Thanks, Justin. I think we do have a couple more follow-ons and we can take those before we close.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Credit Suisse.\nOmotayo Okusanya : Okay. Great. So thanks for taking the follow on. No one ever really seems to ask about post-acute but just kind of curious what's happening over there, a slight decline in coverage for you guys, a lot of kind of news in general on the hospital side in the kind of first half of 2022 industry-wise. So just curious, again, it's a small part of your portfolio, but curious what you're seeing on that side.\nDebra Cafaro : Well, you've seen from the public hospital operators, all the providers are in a transition period now, I think they are coming out of kind of a COVID period and going into a more normal kind of census and census environment and acuity environment. So as wage pressures abate, I think you'll see improvement there and volumes continue to increase. Certainly, higher employment there is beneficial to the acute care business. So that's positive. They just got a rate increase, obviously, that will take effect October 1. And then in post-acute, I think you're also sort of starting to see some normalization in both the volumes and the beginning of some normalization in wages, but a long way to go there. And that's going to take more time, I would say, than in the hospital business, which is always at the top of the food chain.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of John Pawlowski from Green Street.\nJohn Pawlowski : Pete, I'm hoping you can expand on the line in the press release talking about frictional vacancy coming into life science. Could you help quantify that and what caused the move-out?\nPeter Bulgarelli : Yes. Thanks for the question, John. So we have really good occupancy, 93% in our same-store pool for R&I, But COVID -- we also have -- we have some tenants that are pure office tenants and innovation space, and we disclosed this last quarter that we had a couple of move-outs in that area where people have just reconsidered the space they need and the type of space they need. It's actually caused -- created an opportunity for us to convert some of that space into the high-demand lab space. And so we have over the next quarter or two some transitions. We'll be converting to lab space and repopulating some of those tenants -- tenant vacancies. But we are bullish about the full year. We're bullish about '23 and beyond.\nDebra Cafaro : And as I mentioned, for example, in Miami, we've already backfilled [80,000] feet immediately at higher rates. So Pete's done a great job on that, and thanks for the question.  Is that it? All right. Well, I want to thank everyone for your time and attention for your interest in the company. We're all here and ready and committed to continue delivering value. We know it's a dynamic environment, but we're excited about the future. So thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Peter Bulgarelli",
            "content": "Yes. I got a question. Yes, terrific. Well, we've been having a high degree of success in MOBs in particular and really all across office in growing occupancy. For MOBs, we were one of the few that had occupancy growth last year, also in the first quarter and then again in the second quarter. So we're very pleased with our leasing success. We have much less space to lease just based on the lease expirations in this quarter, but we're leasing quite a bit more space than we did last year at this time. So it's a great dynamic. Leasing spreads and escalators are both increasing significantly. For the entire portfolio, the leasing -- lease escalator has gone up by 10 basis points just in this quarter. And we don't disclose the re-leasing spreads because I still haven't been able to make heads and tails of how it really works with some of our competitors, but it's positive. Yes. Thanks for the question, John. So we have really good occupancy, 93% in our same-store pool for R&I, But COVID -- we also have -- we have some tenants that are pure office tenants and innovation space, and we disclosed this last quarter that we had a couple of move-outs in that area where people have just reconsidered the space they need and the type of space they need. It's actually caused -- created an opportunity for us to convert some of that space into the high-demand lab space. And so we have over the next quarter or two some transitions. We'll be converting to lab space and repopulating some of those tenants -- tenant vacancies. But we are bullish about the full year. We're bullish about '23 and beyond."

            "content": "Thank you, Debbie. I'll start by highlighting how well positioned our senior housing portfolio is within this sector, which is benefiting from very strong demand drivers. We are the second largest owner of senior housing in the world with communities located in 47 states, seven Canadian provinces and UK managed by 37 distinct market-leading operators. As Debbie mentioned, the supply-demand fundamentals in senior housing are compelling. We have experienced an acceleration in the 80-plus population growth over the past two years, and 2023 will represent the highest increase in 80-plus population on record. We also have outsized affordability in our respective markets where our target customer net worth is 4x the average cost of a stay in our setting. The senior population has significant savings and home equity that are utilized to pay for our services if the need arises. On the supply side, according to the National Investment Center for Senior Housing, units on our construction as a percentage of inventory of 4.8% has not been this low since the first quarter of 2015, and deliveries of 4,600 units is down 49% from the second quarter of 2017 peak. And aside from the second quarter of 2020 has not been this low since 2016. 99% of Ventas senior housing markets are not exposed to new starts as we face an aging demographic, which is the strongest we have seen. These facts point to considerable upside in our well-positioned senior housing portfolio. We are seeing early evidence of the benefits of our strong market position. For instance, year-to-date through July, net move-in activity continues to grow. And we have had positive net move-ins for 16 of the past 17 months, and NOI has been solid as our year-over-year same-store SHOP portfolio grew 14.2% in the first quarter and 8.7% in the second. Turning to the second quarter SHOP results and our year-over-year same-store pool. We are pleased to report another quarter that was consistent with our expectations while delivering solid year-over-year and sequential NOI growth. Pricing power has been impressive. At 5% year-over-year growth, RevPOR is the strongest we've seen in the last 10 years, primarily driven by in-house rent increases, which are running approximately 8% in the U.S. and 4% in Canada, care rate increases at 10% and re-leasing spreads that have improved from negative 14.7% since the low point in the first quarter of 2021 to nearly flat in June. Same-store average occupancy grew year-over-year by 390 basis points to 83.7%, which was in line with our guidance. Leads, move-ins continued to perform above pre-pandemic levels. The key selling season of May to September is off to a strong start. We have netted 470 move-ins through July, which is 307 higher than the same period in 2019. July average occupancy grew 30 basis points over June. These positive results in occupancy and rate drove same-store revenue to increase by over 10% versus the prior year. Turning to expenses. As we anticipated, expenses were $3.8 million per day. Same-store operating expenses grew 6.1% on a per occupied unit day basis and 11.3% overall year-over-year driven by higher occupancy and continued macro inflationary impacts on labor and other operating expenses. Labor expenses remained elevated as expected as we navigated the inflationary wage pressure and macro staff shortages. I am encouraged that our managers have successfully implemented a number of labor initiatives that we identified last fall. These initiatives include centralized line staff recruiting, applicant tracking technology enhancements and application process improvements. The result is an advancement in net hiring and the stabilization of our workforce. We have had 11 months in a row of positive net hiring, and we experienced a double-digit reduction in contract labor costs in the second quarter. Net hiring is critical to our ability to stabilize the workforce and reduce reliance on more costly and less reliable contract labor. NOI grew 8.7% year-over-year, near the high end of our SHOP guidance range led by the U.S. at 14%, while Canada demonstrated positive growth again with 1%. The incremental margin from Q1 to Q2 was 80%, while overall margin expanded 60 basis points from 23.8% to 24.4%. NOI grew 6.1% in the sequential same-store pool. Bob will cover our Q3 SHOP guidance shortly. COVID conditions have remained relatively consistent the last few months. We still have new cases occurring for staff and residents causing marginal impacts on move-ins and staffing most notably in Canada, where the regulatory environment is more stringent. Before I wrap up, I'll give a quick update on Ventas OI. We continue to utilize Ventas operational insights to engage with our operating partners more closely using our operational and analytical expertise. This quarter, we addressed digital marketing capabilities in three modules: technical website audits; UX audits, which are user experience evaluations; and hyper local SEO. This initiative is meant to optimize our digital lead bank, which is the fastest growing of all our lead sources and now represents over 3/4 of all lead volume. I am pleased with how well received Ventas OI has been among our operating partners since we introduced it at the beginning of this year, and we continue to develop it to be a model for mutually-beneficial capital partner and operator relationships. I'll summarize by saying that we have made significant progress to our post-COVID NOI recovery opportunity with a lot of upside remaining. The occupancy low point was 78% in March of 2021. We've already grown significantly since then to 84%. And given our strong market position and supportive macro backdrop, we are excited about the continued organic growth opportunity in our senior housing portfolio. Bob? Sure. So I'll just reinforce a few of those positives first. So the one thing I mentioned is that 16 of the last 17 months we've had positive net move-ins. Our year-over-year comparison has been really strong. In fact, in the U.S., in the second quarter, it was 470 basis points year-over-year. We're expecting that to be 320 year-over-year in the third quarter. Canada, by the way, was 250 year-over-year in the second. We're expecting that to be 200 year-over-year in the third. One thing I'll mention is that the sequential growth is expected to be 100 basis points. We were 70 basis points in the last quarter, so we do have some sequential occupancy growth as well. But everything has been pointing up, and we're certainly benefiting from that, and we have a lot of upside ahead of us over time. It's Justin. So yes, Canada, first of all, it's 94% occupied. It's a very stable, strong, consistent performer for us. It did have growth in the second quarter. Just to break down the guidance that Bob gave, Canada in the third quarter is expected to have cash NOI growth of between 2% and 5%. And that includes revenue year-over-year 6%, and I mentioned already 200 basis points of occupancy on a year-over-year basis. And so we're anticipating growth in Canada. They've had -- we've had not a lot of activity that was COVID-related in the second quarter. But where we did have it, some restrictions on move-ins, it was disproportionately affecting Canada. And then meanwhile, the U.S. is really the growth engine, where our cash NOI is expected to grow between 13% and 21% in the third quarter, revenue 9% year-over-year and 320 basis points of occupancy. So really strong, stable performer in Canada, growth engine in the U.S. So as it pertains to care, we are seeing the actual care rate that's charged has been raised 10%, and that is a huge step in the direction of keeping up with inflation. The other thing that occurs is I'm sure you know is that as resident at on place and their needs grow, we'll have we'll have care charges increase in conjunction with resident needs, which helps to pay for the labor required to take care of residents. And so this is the -- it's really the highest we've seen in terms of care charge increases. That can happen more than one time a year. They tend to only happen one time a year, but there's -- it was encouraging to see the execution on care prices on top of the strong in-house rent increases, plus The Street rates are growing as well. Yes. That's -- it's a good observation, Rich. There's a couple of hundred communities that are in that kind of non-same-store category. They have some unique characteristics. One is that they're lower occupied. So they run below the rest of the pool, kind of mid-70-ish. They have more upside therefore. They also have been growing faster. They had double-digit sequential growth Q1 to Q2. So the performance is good, and we do expect that pool to grow and be a big contributor to that U.S. growth engine that I mentioned. So this is Justin. So first of all, yes, the trend has been great, particularly the re-leasing spread trend. You might remember that even before the pandemic, that was typically a negative number around kind of mid-single digit negative. We're doing much better than that now. That really helps demonstrate the demand at the doorstep and the pricing power and see that number actually -- we're showing the second quarter on the slide you mentioned, but it was almost flat in June. It was -- that's really encouraging. We do have groups of communities that are positive already from a re-leasing spread standpoint. And that's certainly possible, but there's always going to be a consideration around price and volume that will come over time. So this doesn't necessarily -- it's not necessarily going to look like walking up a set of stairs. There could be some movement in the trend. And then on care, that's really -- it's just another form of pricing. The in-house rent increases really gave confidence around the pricing power. The re-leasing spread helped as well, and care is an important component in the assisted living business. So that's an area that gets focused as well in terms of pricing. And the -- really the goal and opportunity is really just to keep a differential eventually between that revenue increase and that expense increase and drive the NOI growth and doing that in a way that's taking the best possible care of people. Well, I guess the way I would frame it is it's a function of supply and demand. We've had -- it's not just kind of a recent phenomenon that we've been experiencing these new movements. It's been happening for last 16 or 17 months. If there was some pent-up demand, I think I would point to the early part of '21 where we had a pop when vaccines were executed and April stands out, for instance. But I think what we're seeing overall is just really strong demand fundamentals. And like I mentioned, it's growing, and we have even more growth ahead of us in next year and beyond. So we're well positioned. We're playing into it. Our portfolio has been significantly outperforming the overall NIC data, the sector data that the NIC industry puts out. So we're growing and we're growing at a pace we haven't seen before. Yes. So the occupancy is really just a function of the going in occupancy. So when I say that, I mean leading heading into the pandemic period, it was running lower already. We have higher absolute occupancy in our SHOP portfolio. The triple net portfolio is obviously a little lower occupied. It's carried a little bit more expense as well. But the kind of the credit situation and the stability of the cash flows have improved dramatically. We've put a lot of effort in over the last 1.5 years to improve our position with those leases. And we mentioned last quarter some COVID cleanup, that's occurred now. So if the trajectory of the sector continues in a positive way, we expect the triple-net portfolio to continue to improve and perform well. Yes. So I mean one thing we do watch is consumer sentiment. It's something we keep an eye on because although it's not usually strongly correlated to senior housing because senior housing is more needs-driven, it's something that maybe could have impact on the fringes. The growth we've experienced has been pretty consistent. We've had very consistent lead and move-in activity. We've also been relatively low, which is obviously helpful and supportive of net move-ins. So right now, I mean we just gave guidance on the third quarter. We're expecting growth, and there's good support for that. And we're always watching all the macro market kind of key indicators. Debbie mentioned a lot of them, and there's others as well. So we'll be mindful of the macro environment. Those are so much of my favorite topics, Juan. I would say the first... I know you did. I don't even think we have time to go through at all. I would say on the first part on affordability, I know you know this, but the big opportunity in the sector is price transparency, which we really don't have today. So you'll hear language like price discovery, where we're pushing pricing in markets and just testing for resistance. And obviously, this year, there hasn't been much because we're pushing on all fronts. And the affordability really points to that as well. And our operating partners have been just magnificent, I think, in playing into that opportunity and having the confidence to push, and it's an area that we're definitely improving in. And then from an OI standpoint, we definitely do focus on pricing. It's a huge part of the focus even before we called it OI officially. Last fall, we were highly engaged with our operators to plan for the pricing execution that we've seen this year. So it's always a hot topic, and it's a big opportunity for the sector over time as well because it -- we deliver a tremendous service to our residents. It's comprehensive, and it's very valuable. And... And they can afford it, bottom line, yes."

            "name": "Debra Cafaro",
            "content": "Thanks, BJ, and good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants. I want to welcome you to the Ventas second quarter earnings call. I'm delighted to be joined by my colleagues, including our newest addition, BJ Grant, who has already made many contributions to Ventas in a short tenure. Today, I'll recap our strong second quarter results, highlight the momentum in our life science, research and innovation business and address the macro trends in the economy and labor markets. We believe that Ventas is in an advantaged position to deliver value in this dynamic business environment because of our high-quality diversified portfolio and our team's industry insights and deep experience. Let's start with results. Ventas delivered a very positive second quarter with $0.72 of normalized FFO at the higher end of our guidance range. Property performance was at or above our expectations led by 9% year-over-year SHOP same-store net operating income growth. I'm excited to showcase our differentiated life science, research and innovation business, which now spans 11 million square feet and accounts for 10% of our property portfolio. This portfolio has significant momentum in deliveries, leasing and investment activity. With our strategic partner, Wexford, Ventas enjoys the nation's leading track record and reputation at the large and growing intersection of research, medicine and universities. Importantly, 77% of our rent is from high credit tenancy with 50% from universities with a weighted average credit rating of AA and the balance from investment-grade or $1 billion market cap companies. I'm really proud of what we've accomplished since 2016 when we began to invest in this business and how we've grown it since then. Here are some examples of our strong R&I momentum. Starting with deliveries, we recently delivered the 100% leased Drexel University Health Science Building on budget and ahead of schedule. This $280 million-plus project located in the thriving uCity Innovation District in Philadelphia was developed by our strategic R&I partner, Wexford. Drexel's Health Science Building is ready to welcome Drexel School of Nursing and Health Professions, its School of Medicine and its graduate programs for biomedicine, when school opens this fall. The project is expected to provide a 7% cash and 10% GAAP yield. We also intend to deliver One uCity Square by year-end. This 400,000 square foot multi-tenant lab and research building continues to expand our presence in the uCity Innovation District in Philadelphia, adjacent to University of Pennsylvania, and it is already 80% leased. We expect the building to exceed 90% leasing with highly-regarded life science and institutional research tenants in early 2023. The lease-up pace and rental rates are both substantially ahead of our pro forma, and the project is now expected to deliver over a 7% stabilized cash yield on cost of nearly $300 million. We also see terrific leasing momentum across other portions of our life science R&I portfolio. Our portfolio caters to the top 5% of research universities in the nation, and these institutions are aggressively expanding their research functions, creating incremental demand for lab space. We are currently in discussions with a handful of universities about taking significant amounts of additional lab space. In addition, we are leasing space quickly, and demand is high from commercial tenants who are attracted to university innovation centers. For example, at Pitts Phase II scheduled to open shortly, we recently signed a lease for 66% of the building with a premier global technology company. In Miami, we've already leased or committed 80,000 square feet that expired mid-2022 to new tenants at higher rates. Finally, we have momentum in R&I investment opportunities that will create value and deliver future growth. Today, we announced two exciting new developments that are great examples. With these two projects, we currently have $1.6 billion of total R&I development in progress, all leverage our significant competitive advantage with Wexford at the intersection of research, medicine and universities. The first new project is the Pearl located in fast-growing Charlotte, North Carolina. Sponsored by Atrium Health, a top 10 health system, the Pearl project will house research, lab, medical and academic uses, including the Wake Forest University School of Medicine. Atrium Health, which is rated Aa3 is leasing 70% of the project and will be our 37% partner. The Pearl will also serve as the exclusive North American headquarters for IRCAD, the French Training Institute in advanced surgical techniques and robotics for world-class surgeons. We expect delivery of the Pearl in 2025. On the West Coast, Wexford and Ventas have been selected by the University of Washington to develop a 300,000-plus square foot project anchored by the university for its research programming in clean energy, medicine and life science. UDub, rated Aaa by Moody's, is a world-class research university that receives more federal research funding than any other U.S. public university. Seattle is the #6 life science market in the U.S., and this project will expand our R&I footprint to six of the top 7 life science markets. We look forward to sharing more details with you as this exciting project progresses. Behind these new projects, our R&I development pipeline contains an additional $1 billion of potential development opportunities. I hope that gives you a picture of the momentum we see in our attractive life science R&I business. It is a great example of our ability to enter a new space thoughtfully, expand and grow it successfully through different market conditions and align with excellent partners. Regarding our capital allocation approach and activities, we've shown $1.3 billion of investment activity year-to-date, consistent with our stated priorities and balanced approach. We've also announced additional investments in the senior housing space at an attractive yield with future growth potential and a fully-leased medical office building, utilizing capital from our fund to acquire this stable MOB. As we look forward in the third quarter of 2022, we are again projecting that our earnings will benefit from outstanding year-over-year growth in our SHOP segment, which is expected to increase NOI 12% at the midpoint, higher than second quarter's 9% year-over-year SHOP NOI growth rate. We do expect expenses and wages in Q3 to remain elevated, reinforced by today's jobs report. We will also recognize the benefit of $20 million of HHS grants in the third quarter, which we received to reimburse us for a portion of the expenses we incurred to keep residents and workers safe during the pandemic, although that benefit will be muted by a $0.02 impact we expect from higher interest rates as a consequence of the Fed tightening. The demographic backdrop is supportive of our business, and we believe we are well positioned to succeed. First, supply and demand conditions are favorable with acceleration in the growth of the 80-plus population. Our senior housing product is highly affordable and need-based, and the senior market we serve has significant resources. With senior housing starts and inventory under construction well below cyclical highs particularly in independent living, our senior housing business is set up for continued net absorption and pricing power. With this favorable supply-demand backdrop in senior housing, we will use the power of our high-quality diversified portfolio and our team's commitment, experience and insights to continue to create value for stakeholders. Thanks for your time, and I'll turn it over to Justin. Right, right. The net debt to EBITDA, the EBITDA growth is an important component of getting back in the range. I mean that's really a macro question. And obviously, we're in a very dynamic macro environment changing by the minute, as we saw with today's jobs trends. I think looking into the third, we do continue to see those inflationary pressures. I think we need to incorporate in policymakers' minds a longer-term view now with the new news today of where we expect to see CPI and wage expectations over the next year. But that is -- the $3.8 million is really a function of the macro. We are doing everything we can. Our operators are doing everything they can to manage that growth, including the net hiring that Justin talked about, which is pretty fundamental. Well, thanks. Good to talk to you. I would say, yes, you're correct about Le Groupe Maurice. This has been a great investment for us both in terms of the as the existing operating assets that we acquired and then the development pipeline. And you're right, we have grown that at about two to three a year and did announce a new deal. These are really outstanding assets. And one thing we really like about the developments there is that when they open they're already significantly pre-leased, and that's a unique model that's been really effective. In terms of the R&I business, these two new projects are super exciting. We'll continue to fund those. Optimally, I would say, in general, we do get construction financing for 50 to -- 50% to 2/3 of the building. And some of them we do on balance sheet and some of them we do under our Ventas Investment Management platform. And with these new developments, we would expect to optimize that capital structure for the best way we can for Ventas. These discussions with these major research universities are long processes. The good news is, again, this demand from universities for state-of-the-art lab space is just voracious, and we're able to continue with Wexford to target really this top 5% of research universities. The yields continue to be, I think, very attractive on a risk-adjusted return basis. And we've been successful in delivering projects on time, on budget. And so we have a very good track record there and an ability to modify yield based upon ultimate costs working with those universities. So it's a very good model with significant pre-leasing. And the risk/reward is quite good, which is why we keep doing it. We're lucky that we have this competitive advantage in this business. And the sequential occupancy projected growth is higher than the second quarter sequential occupancy growth. So we're pleased by that and good year-over-year growth projected in the third. Pete is very happy for the question. So Pete. Yes, exactly. Justin is going to take that, Tayo. They can afford it. So that's the definition of a good situation. All right. Thanks, Justin. I think we do have a couple more follow-ons and we can take those before we close. Well, you've seen from the public hospital operators, all the providers are in a transition period now, I think they are coming out of kind of a COVID period and going into a more normal kind of census and census environment and acuity environment. So as wage pressures abate, I think you'll see improvement there and volumes continue to increase. Certainly, higher employment there is beneficial to the acute care business. So that's positive. They just got a rate increase, obviously, that will take effect October 1. And then in post-acute, I think you're also sort of starting to see some normalization in both the volumes and the beginning of some normalization in wages, but a long way to go there. And that's going to take more time, I would say, than in the hospital business, which is always at the top of the food chain. And as I mentioned, for example, in Miami, we've already backfilled [80,000] feet immediately at higher rates. So Pete's done a great job on that, and thanks for the question.  Is that it? All right. Well, I want to thank everyone for your time and attention for your interest in the company. We're all here and ready and committed to continue delivering value. We know it's a dynamic environment, but we're excited about the future. So thank you very much."

            "name": "Robert Probst",
            "content": "Thanks, Justin. I'll start with an overview of our second quarter office and enterprise results before closing with our outlook for the third quarter. Our office segment, which includes our medical office and research and innovation businesses, performed well in Q2, delivering 3.2% year-on-year same-store growth. Medical office year-on-year quarterly same-store growth was 2.8% led by contractual escalators, strong retention, new leasing and favorable expense controls. MOB occupancy rose 50 basis points from prior year and 10 basis points sequentially. R&I increased quarterly same-store 4.6%, also benefiting from escalators, leasing and higher parking. Same-store occupancy in R&I is a strong 93.2%. We were very pleased with our overall enterprise performance in the second quarter with results top to bottom at the higher end or better of our guidance range. Notably, we delivered FFO of $0.72 per share, which is at the higher end of our guidance range of $0.69 to $0.73. And that result was led by SHOP, where cash NOI grew nearly 9% year-over-year, as Justin described, with occupancy revenue and NOI where we called it a quarter ago despite a challenging backdrop. When combined with strong performance in office and triple net, total property same-store NOI increased 3.5% year-over-year, above the high end of our guidance range. Our performance trajectory and proactive steps to deliver results are being recognized. For example, all three rating agencies have made positive ratings moves in the last month to BBB+ stable, and 20 of our lending relationships provided a $500 million five-year term loan refinancing and upsizing the prior term loan at better pricing. We're very pleased that we took smart steps to enhance our portfolio quality and to reduce near-term debt, extend maturities prior to the run-up in rates and now have 89% fixed rate debt. Debt duration exceeds six years. Our average cost of debt is 3.5%. We have limited near-term maturities and robust liquidity of $2.5 billion.  In terms of Q3 guidance, we expect net income to range from $0.04 to $0.09 per fully diluted share. Q3 normalized FFO is expected to range from $0.73 to $0.78 per share. The bridge from Q2 FFO per share of $0.72 to $0.76 at our Q3 midpoint is as follows: a net increase of $0.03 from $0.05 of HHS grants received in July, less $0.02 from higher interest rates on our floating rate debt and a stronger U.S. dollar; plus $0.01 of property growth led by the opening of the Drexel R&I development Debbie described earlier. A note: to enhance comparability, we now present SHOP same-store and cash NOI results excluding the benefit of HHS grants received in all periods. Let's drill into the SHOP assumptions for Q3. We expect SHOP cash NOI to grow in the range of 9% to 15% year-over-year or 12% at the midpoint, which represents an acceleration from the 9% year-over-year NOI growth posted in the second quarter. Revenue is forecast to grow 8% at the midpoint led by occupancy increasing 250 basis points to 300 basis points as well as through improving rates. Despite continuing broad inflationary expense pressure, our NOI guidance growth of 12% at the midpoint implies margin expansion. Our SHOP Q3 revenue is expected to grow sequentially led by average occupancy, which is forecast to increase 100 basis points versus the Q2 average and incorporates a continuation of positive occupancy growth trends observed in July. This revenue growth is effectively offset by sequential operating expense increases in Q3, notably including broad inflationary pressure and an extra day in the quarter. Therefore, SHOP cash NOI, though ahead of seasonal patterns, is effectively flat. Final Q3 guidance assumptions include no new unannounced material acquisitions or capital markets activities and 404 million fully diluted shares. For more information on our guidance assumptions, I would direct you to the business update deck posted to our website. To echo Debbie's comments, I'm excited to have BJ Grant on the Ventas team. BJ has hit the ground running, and the improved and streamlined supplemental package posted as part of Q2 earnings is the latest evidence of the IR enhancements that are underway at Ventas. To close, we believe we are in an advantaged position in the dynamic macroeconomic backdrop with the portfolio and the team to deliver sustained value creation. That concludes our prepared remarks. Before we start with Q&A, we ask each caller to state one question to be respectful to everyone on the line. With that, I will turn the call back to the operator. Yes. I'll hit on the guidance. I can pass it to John on the second question. But we went from $200 million to $100 million in the back half. That's really a timing question as much as anything, frankly, in terms of expectations of when asset sales will close with various portfolios on the market. But the theme of looking for opportunities to upgrade the portfolio using those disposition proceeds to reinvest. We'll continue in the back half and into next year. Do you want to touch on transactions? Yes, I'll take that one, Juan. First off, we were really pleased to see all three agencies take that positive rating action to BBB+. And really, the predicate of that across the board was the trends we're seeing in senior housing. And you'll know the fact that we've been above the range due to COVID. It's the impact on SHOP NOI and the recovery, therefore, of the NOI has been -- continues to be the key to get back in the range. In the meantime, we've been doing smart things along the way. I mentioned asset dispositions to upgrade the portfolio, reducing near-term debt as an example. We continue to do those types of things depending on market conditions. But fundamentally, the predicate of getting back into that range is SHOP NOI growth. Well, the short answer is, yes, we do feel across the portfolio with different drivers, non-correlated drivers of demand and growth that we will see portfolio, cash flow growth and NOI growth, FFO and FAD to your point. Not giving you a forecast, of course, on timing and slope. But absolutely, that is the portfolio view. The organic growth opportunity is better than I've seen in my eight years at Ventas, and I think some time before that, and so growing reliable cash flows certainly is the projection. Yes, Michael, I'd say the spot in the average are pretty close to each other. So yes, we had a nice end of the second, but hope for the same in the third. So average is a good proxy."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Ventas First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sarah Whitford. Ms. Whitford, you may begin your conference.\nSarah Whitford: Thank you, Abby. Good morning and welcome to the Ventas first quarter financial results conference call. Yesterday, we issued our first quarter earnings release, supplemental and investor presentation. These materials are available on the Ventas website at ir.ventasreit.com. As a reminder, remarks made today may include forward-looking statements, including certain expectations related to COVID-19 and other matters. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, all of which are available on the Ventas website. Certain non-GAAP financial measures will also be discussed on this call. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to our supplemental posted on the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to Debra A. Cafaro, Chairman and CEO.\nDebra Cafaro: Thank you, Sarah. Good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants. I want to welcome you to the Ventas first quarter earnings call. I am delighted to be joined by my Ventas colleagues who have worked so hard for shareholders, each other, our partners and our other stakeholders over the past 2 plus years. We are off to a strong start in 2022. We are delighted to deliver on our commitment to grow normalized FFO and same-store shop NOI year-over-year for the first time since the pandemic began. It is certainly worth pausing to appreciate a quarter that returns us to growth and underscores our positive momentum and the senior housing recovery that is underway. In the quarter, we continued to benefit from stability and growth in our office and healthcare triple-net lease businesses. And in SHOP, we saw outstanding year-over-year NOI revenue and occupancy growth that overcame meaningful impacts of COVID-19 and inflationary pressures during the quarter. Looking forward, the power of our well-positioned communities, strong demand evidenced by leads that consistently exceed pre-pandemic levels into April, pricing power and advantaged markets should translate into sustained NOI growth through the balance of the year. These trends should be further enhanced by favorable supply demand fundamentals, supporting net absorption in our markets. Specifically, Q1 2022 starts are down two-thirds from the peak just as the over-80 population is set to grow over 20% during the next several years. But we are not just relying on demographics to win the recovery. Justin and his senior housing team continue to take decisive actions following the right asset, right market, right operator approach to best position our senior housing portfolio to capture the upside ahead. We have already started to see the benefit of these actions with a strong first quarter and our SHOP portfolio has outperformed industry benchmarks for comparable senior housing communities over the last year. Today, we have announced another important step in this progress. We have revised our agreement with Sunrise to align our interest toward profitable growth and value creation. We have been working together with Sunrise since 2007 and are delighted to reset the relationship with the current management team at this point in the cycle. In addition to organic growth, we also benefited from the investments we have made under our consistent long-term capital allocation philosophy and priorities. On the investment front, we have posted about $4 billion of investment activity since the beginning of 2021. With our first quarter 2022 capital allocation priorities continuing to be the acquisition and development of senior housing, life science and select medical office buildings. I want to highlight two of our first quarter investments and show how they demonstrate our investment approach. The two investments have reliable going in cash yields, limited downside and room for growth. And both came from trusted relationships built over long periods of time through repeated and mutual success. Mangrove Bay is an irreplaceable senior housing community located on the waterfront in the high wealth submarket of Jupiter, Florida. Acquired for $107 million, Mangrove has large units, high REVPOR and a strong, consistent operating history. Since the acquisition, performance has been strong and our investment yield has grown to 6%. Our recent value-add investment in the U City Philadelphia submarket represents an opportunity to add another component our incredibly well-performing research and innovation portfolio located between Penn and Drexel. We intend to convert a portion of the building to high-demand lab space and achieve a 7% stabilized yield on our aggregate investment costs. The Penn-Drexel market has been very successful for us, with our two ongoing developments now 90% leased or committed and rents up 40% since we put a shovel in the ground. I\u2019d like to touch on three more points before closing, our continued focus on driving total shareholder return, ESG leadership and the macro environment. First, as a continuation of our commitment to driving TSR performance, I welcome BJ Grant to the VTR team. He is a highly regarded long-time REIT investor, who has a distinct appreciation for healthcare and senior housing real estate. BJ is going to work with the Ventas team and externally with the investment community to reinforce the Ventas value proposition. Second, I\u2019d like to highlight our sustainability leadership, which continues with our announced commitment to achieve net zero carbon emissions over the next two decades and our recent recognition as the number one medical office building owner/operator for ENERGY STAR certifications. Finally, let\u2019s discuss the all-important macro economy, particularly current inflationary pressures and the tightest labor market we have seen in 50 years. It is encouraging that today\u2019s Jobs Report evidenced some emerging indications of stability. Emanating from a confluence of factors, annual inflation is expected to continue to run high, perhaps exceeding 8% through the second quarter and then moderate by a couple of percentage points in the back half of the year and moderate again by another couple of percentage points by mid-2023. While significant uncertainty remains, this improvement in expectations is the result of various policy actions, including Fed tightening, tempering demand, greater balance in workforce supply and demand from expansion of the labor force participation rate and a slower pace of job creation and some supply chain normalization. Whether these forces result in a soft landing or trigger a recession, Ventas is relatively well positioned. Our demand is robust, it is need based and it is growing. Pricing power is strong and has the potential to strengthen further as occupancies continue to recover. Softening the rate of growth in labor and other expenses should improve our margin, particularly as revenue and occupancy increase. But regardless of the macro environment and uncertainty, at Ventas, we will remain agile, execution-focused and performance-driven. With an attractive valuation and high-quality portfolio, growth potential, a well covered advantaged dividend, 90% fixed rate debt and the opportunity to drive external growth, we are very well positioned. In closing, I want you to know that all of us at Ventas are committed to using every tool at our disposal to XL and creates sustained value for our shareholders and other stakeholders. Thank you. Justin?\nJustin Hutchens: Thank you, Debbie. I will start by noting that we are very pleased with the NOI growth in the quarter and the start of what should be sustained improvement in our SHOP portfolio throughout the year. The revenue performance is very strong driven by volume and pricing in spite of the COVID activity in the first quarter leading to our best year-over-year and sequential revenue performance we have ever seen in our portfolio. Now, I will speak to the first quarters our performance excluding HHS grants, second quarter guidance, comments and update on our key initiative. In the first quarter same-store revenue increased by nearly 10% versus the prior year due to the positive trends in occupancy and rates, same-store average occupancy grew year-over-year by 420 basis points to 83%, which was ahead of the guidance midpoint of 410 basis points. Although the first quarter was slowed by impacts of COVID, demand remained resilient. Year-to-date through April, lead and move-in activity continue to outperform pre-pandemic levels, led principally by our U.S. AL business. REVPOR increased by 4.2% versus the prior year, benefiting from strong in-place resident rate increases approximating 8% and improving re-leasing spreads. Not only did we execute very strong in-house rent increases during the quarter, we have also witnessed strong sequential growth in street rates over the past several months, as move-in rates have improved 5% sequentially. The result of these favorable pricing trends has helped to translate into narrowing re-leasing spreads, which is now a low single-digit reduction and more favorable than pre-pandemic levels, this demonstrated pricing power is occurring a 83% occupancy, therefore we believe we have significant occupancy rate and ultimately revenue growth potential in front of us.  Turning to expenses. Same-store operating expenses grew 8% year-over-year excluding HHS driven by higher occupancy and macro inflationary impacts throughout the quarter and labor utilities and other operating expenses. Labor expenses remain elevated as we navigate the macro staff shortages with enhance hiring practices and target wage increases. Net hiring has improved 7 months in a row. And although we are pleased to see the progress on hiring, we have yet to see it impact the P&L. Although inflation is elevated and labor expenses remain high, the incremental margin growth is strong. One of the best aspects of the senior housing operating business at this point in the cycle is the high operating leverage. We are starting to benefit from this operating leverage as the incremental margin was 56%, which helped the overall margin improved at 24%.  It is important to note that even though we were pleased with the quarter's performance, the impacts from COVID drove uneven geographic results, with the U.S. significantly outperforming Canada on the bottom line. NOI in the U.S. grew 26% year-over-year versus Canada, which was down 2%. We expect conditions to improve over the balance of the year as Canada's move-in restrictions were the primary driver of its performance compared to the U.S. Our independent living business was also impacted by COVID in the quarter, but I am encouraged to see reacceleration of move-ins in that portfolio in both March and April. We continue to believe in the independent living thesis over time, we should benefit from our independent living through the overall higher stability with higher margin, lower labor, higher occupancy and a longer length of stay. Our independent living communities in the U.S. and Canada are located in markets that support strong net absorption over time. Moving on to significant updates in the senior housing portfolio, our transition 90 portfolio of mid-market, assisted living communities located in markets with favorable demand characteristics, which was fully transitioned as of January 1 of this year to new regional operators is showing early signs of improvement as occupancy and NOI are both string to improve. Our leading Senior Living portfolio services over 75,000 residents across 46 U.S. states, seven Canadian provinces and the UK, and it's comprised of 38 operators. We remain fully engaged in developing deeper and mutually beneficial relationships, especially with our SHOP operating partners through Ventas OI. Our goal with this platform is to use our operating experience and deep analytical capabilities to improve all aspects of operations, from digital marketing strategy to CapEx optimization to recruitment and retention. We have developed a differentiated support structure to help our operators succeed. We continue to identify opportunities to improve our portfolio through selective pruning, as we are targeting roughly $200 million of senior housing dispositions this year. We are also pleased, as announced today, that we refreshed our relationship with Sunrise Senior Living, who operates 92 of our high-end assisted living communities. This relationship has been reframed with better alignment, which adds flexibility and rewards NOI performance which now contributes to the management fee and incentives based on outsized NOI growth. Given the emphasis on NOI at this point in the cycle we think this alignment is perfectly it's perfectly timed. I'll close by reiterating our expectation for sustained improved SHOP performance throughout the year driven by revenue through occupancy growth and improved pricing. I would also like to acknowledge our operating partners, who have been successfully navigating an evolving macroenvironment and ultimately, creating a valuable living experience for our residents and value creation for our shareholders. Now I'll hand the call to Bob.\nRobert Probst: Thanks, Justin. I'm going to share a few thoughts on our first quarter office and enterprise results and finish up with our second quarter outlook before turning the call to Q&A. Our Office segment, which includes our medical office and research and innovation businesses, performed well in Q1, delivering 4.6% year-on-year same-store growth. Medical office year-on-year quarterly same-store growth was 3.5%, led by strong retention, contractual escalators and parking recovery. R&I increased 7.9%, which also benefited from escalators and leasing, as well as from $1 million in holdover rent from an exiting tenant. Adjusting for this holdover rent, R&I growth was 4.6% in the quarter and Office same-store NOI growth was 3.8%. In terms of overall enterprise performance, we were very pleased to have posted growth in the first quarter for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. We delivered FFO of $0.79 per share and organic SHOP revenue and NOI same-store growth of 10% and 14%, respectively. Meanwhile, total property same-store NOI increased 5.8%, excluding HHS grants. And this growth was achieved while Omicron raged for the majority of the quarter. These results speak to the quality of the Ventas portfolio and the commitment and skill of the Ventas operators and team. Leverage improved sequentially by 30 basis points to 6.9x in Q1 as a result of senior housing NOI growth and HHS proceeds, partially offset by acquisitions closed in the first quarter that have been pre-funded in 2021. In this rising interest rate environment, 90% of our debt is fixed rate with the duration exceeding 6 years and an average cost of debt of 3.4%. We are pleased that we extended debt maturities in 2021, having paid down over $1 billion of near-term debt while raising over $1 billion of new debt with a weighted coupon of 2.65%. And our liquidity remains robust, with $2.2 billion available at the close of the first quarter. In terms of Q2 guidance, we expect net income to range from minus $0.03 to plus $0.01 per fully diluted share. Q2 normalized FFO is expected to range from $0.69 to $0.73 per share. When excluding HHS grants, our Q2 guidance midpoint of $0.71 compares to Q1 FFO of $0.71. We expect SHOP to grow approximately $0.02 sequentially. This is largely offset by two items previously communicated, a $0.01 sequential reduction from the move out of two life science tenants, which will enable redevelopment into high-demand lab space, and $0.01 from lease resolutions with a handful of smaller operators in the senior housing triple-net business, with future upside participation in the cash flows at the assets. Further impacting the SHOP Q2 year-over-year same-store guidance, we expect revenue to grow approximately 10% at the midpoint, led by occupancy increasing by 400 basis points, as well as improved rates. We expect to grow shop NOI in the range of 2% to 10%. At the guidance midpoint, Ventas expects operating expenses per day in Q2 to remain consistent with Q1. Flat operating expenses per day sequentially in Q2 is higher than normal seasonal trends as a result of incorporated continued inflationary pressures, notably on labor, utilities and resident services. Looking sequentially, overall SHOP segment NOI is expected to grow approximately 4% from Q1 to Q2. Looking beyond Q2 for SHOP, based on the favorable supply/demand backdrop, the strength of the revenue engine and the expectation of some moderation in inflationary pressure in the back half, we continue to expect sustained improvement in SHOP same-store cash NOI through 2022. Final Q2 guidance assumptions include no new unannounced material acquisitions or capital markets activities and 403 million fully diluted shares. For more information on our guidance assumptions, I would direct you to the business update deck posted to our website. I would also point you to Pages 29 and 31 of our supplemental, which provide insights and disclosure including segment NOI guidance and an NOI to FFO trending schedule to allow for easier insight into unique items in our results. To echo Debbie\u2019s comments, I\u2019m excited to have BJ Grant join Ventas as our leader of IR. BJ is an accomplished REIT investor, has deep knowledge of healthcare and Ventas and will be a great fit with our team. To close, we believe the senior housing recovery that is now underway, the actions we have taken and our continued focus on execution position us for sustained value creation. That concludes our prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will turn the call back to the operator.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nSteve Sakwa: Thanks. Bob, I just wanted to maybe drill in a little bit on what you were talking about on expenses and just to make sure I understand, contract labor I know was kind of a big headwind in the first quarter. I\u2019m just trying to understand what are your expectations for that in Q2? And just maybe labor overall in Q2 versus kind of labor in Q1?\nRobert Probst: Sure. Thanks, Steve. And there is a really helpful page in the business update on Page 12, which speaks to expenses. And just to frame this, I know you\u2019re asking about labor, but again, I want to put labor in the context of the overall expense base, because we are seeing inflationary pressure not only in labor but in other areas such as food and utilities and so on, and that\u2019s embedded in the forecast. But specific to labor, contract labor within that, which is, call it, 5% of labor with 95% being in-house labor. We did see some modest improvement in contract labor towards the end of the first, and we expect that to continue modestly improving into the second, as we continue to get some success in hiring, as Justin articulated. Importantly, the overall labor, we are assuming continued inflationary impacts in targeted ways in order to enable that recruiting. If you step back from it all, we are holding our cost per day flat sequentially Q2 to Q1 in a quarter which is seasonally lower, typically to reflect that inflation. And hopefully, that helps frame the answer.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Nick Joseph with Citi. Your line is open.\nMichael Griffin: Hey, you\u2019ve got Michael Griffin here on for Nick. Just curious, on future senior housing investments, is there more of a preference for the U.S. or Canada?\nDebra Cafaro: I\u2019ll take that and then turn it over to Justin, but we\u2019ve been very successful in both markets over time. Canada has really outperformed during the pandemic. Occupancies remain very high and the market has been favorable over long periods of time. And of course, the U.S. is the engine of growth in this quarter with 26% year-over-year. So we like the growth potential there as well. Justin, do you want to...\nJustin Hutchens: Yes. And I\u2019d just say that as we\u2019re underwriting deals, we always drill home to the local market, and we\u2019re following the philosophy of right asset, right market, right operator. Certainly, the broader Canadian market tends to have a better supply demand dynamic over time. They have been 90% occupied for the last 10 years. So it\u2019s been supportive of a very stable and growing investment in Canada. And then the U.S., looking ahead, with supply being so low and starts being so low over the next few years, we like our opportunity to grow organically, but also to make investments in the U.S. as well.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nVikram Malhotra: Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe just a bigger broader one, Debbie and Justin, you\u2019ve treated now at between 4 and call it, 7 turns multiple spread to your largest peer. I\u2019m just wondering like, I know you\u2019re going to be executing over the next few quarters, but are there other changes or strategies or the things you can do that you think will \u2013 investors will allow that gap to close?\nDebra Cafaro: Well, thank you for the question. As I mentioned, we are and have been taking a lot of decisive action on the portfolio with the team and just in general, to execute, to make sure people understand the Ventas story and the opportunities. And really, we have a consistent strategy that over time has delivered superior performance, and we look forward to the opportunities ahead. And again, look forward to driving TSR, as I mentioned.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Great. Thank you. So I was curious, based on the positive trends you\u2019re seeing in street rate growth for senior housing and the improvement in re-leasing spreads to the low single-digit decreases, do you expect re-leasing spreads to turn positive into the stronger leasing season? And what that could imply for future pricing? Thanks.\nJustin Hutchens: Hi, it\u2019s Justin. Yes. So we are very encouraged by the trends, and we certainly have demonstrated pricing power, as we mentioned, and to do so at 83% occupancy is just a real good indicator of the demand for senior housing, which has been strong and growing and performing above pre-pandemic levels. So we would expect pricing power to persist. We demonstrated first with rent \u2013 in-house rent increases that around 8%, which was solid. The next lever we can pull is street rates and narrowing the re-leasing spread, which is happening already. We would expect it to continue. There is aspects \u2013 there is parts of our portfolio that are already positive in terms of re-leasing spreads. So we certainly think that can be achieved and should be. And I\u2019d just say that we\u2019re encouraged by the trends and expect the environment to support more improvement in that area.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJuan Sanabria: Hi, good morning.\nDebra Cafaro: Good morning.\nJuan Sanabria: Just the two parts \u2013 good morning, just a two-parter. I guess, one would be any April occupancy update you can provide? And part two would be a follow-up to Austin\u2019s question. Typically, we see REVPOR year-over-year growth peak in the first quarter and then kind of moderate, as you see some churn in the portfolio. But wondering if you can give any commentary on expectations beyond the second quarter, in the context of your comment in the investor \u2013 or the quarterly deck about the percentage of the portfolio having the 1-year anniversary between the second and the fourth quarter as well as the leasing spreads and how we should think about year-over-year REVPOR growth for the balance of the year?\nRobert Probst: I\u2019ll take the second one first and let Justin talk about April 1. So you\u2019re right, REVPOR traditionally, at least over the last 5 years or so, if you look sequentially at the growth rate year-over-year, we tend to drift down over the quarters, with the first quarter being supported by the in-house rate increase and then the re-leasing spread dragging that down over the balance of the year. The dynamic \u2013 and that was in the supply backdrop really. That was typically the case. What\u2019s really encouraging here is the firming street rate or new resident pricing would suggest that, that drift should improve, i.e., ultimately, a positive re-leasing spread over time as discussed. So we should have a better profile over time, notwithstanding the fact that the re-leasing spread is still lower. But over \u2013 as a trend, I would expect that would be better than the supply area, particularly given the backdrop of the fundamentals. You want to talk about...\nDebra Cafaro: Juan, Page 11, of course, has April leads and move-ins which are, as Justin mentioned, ahead of pre-pandemic levels, leads were very strong. And do you want to talk about sort of entering \u2013 and we\u2019re entering the key selling season, obviously.\nJustin Hutchens: Yes. One thing about the key selling season, which is really May through September, we would expect that literally 99% of our net move-ins occurred during this period. So this is the red hot part of the selling season for this sector. We\u2019re around 83.3% occupied in April, off to a good start in the quarter. And as Debbie mentioned, the underlying demand has just been really solid.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Your line is open.\nRich Anderson: Hi, thanks. Good morning. And drafting off that occupancy, monthly occupancy number, you mentioned in your deck, 500 basis points to return you to pre-pandemic occupancy. I think the market is probably \u2013 it has an appetite for what the sequential occupancy numbers look like in your guidance for the second quarter. So maybe you could give some cadence to the April, May, June expectation? And also what the timeline is in your mind to capture that 500 basis points and get us back to square one pre-pandemic occupancy? Thanks.\nRobert Probst: Hi, Rich, so sequentially, we would expect 80 basis points of sequential average occupancy growth. The start to the quarter in April is 20 basis points, suggesting it to go, if you like, in the 50 on average per month for the balance of the quarter. Remember, back to the key selling season, that begins to accelerate here in the coming months. If you looked at last year, how we trended, that looks as if last year are also favorable. So that would suggest a good setup for the guidance number.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nMichael Carroll: Yes. I just wanted to stick on the seniors housing demand trends. Obviously, the leads and move-ins are strong and have been strong. But how could a potential economic slowdown or even a downdraft in the housing market impact those trends? And obviously, the leads as a percent of 2019, kind of started to dip in the first quarter into April. I mean I\u2019m not sure if there is anything to read into that? Or is that just something unique with the 2019 versus the 2022 trends?\nJustin Hutchens: Hi, it\u2019s Justin. So the first part of your question really refers to the macro backdrop, and we\u2019ve obviously been through other cycles, including one that had a housing demand and price decline. There is \u2013 there can be \u2013 if it\u2019s dramatic like it was during the Great Recession, there can be an initial shock to the system. But what we saw during \u2013 post kind of the initial period of the Great Recession is that senior housing performed really well. It performed well and had a backdrop for a few years of limited new competition, more so than what we\u2019re seeing now. We have a real opportunity with the starts being so low and the deliveries being so low relative to that period. So the other thing, too, is that house wealth and income demographics in our markets are very supportive. The affordability for our product is very, very strong. So we think we\u2019re well positioned in that regard.\nDebra Cafaro: Right. And I would say, even potentially within real estate, relatively advantaged, because that would result in some more slack in the labor market as well. So, it would change the expense equation here, while the demand and supply are favorable. So, that\u2019s I think an important point to understand. And then in terms of April, I think we are actually doing well compared to prior April.\nJustin Hutchens: Yes. We are way ahead of April of last year in terms of absolute leads, and we are still well ahead of 2019. So, we are not \u2013 we are more encouraged than anything.\nDebra Cafaro: Because those quarters embed this key selling season of May and June the prior period presentation.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Yes. Good morning everyone.\nDebra Cafaro: Good morning.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Just curious what spurred the initial conversation with Sunrise on switching the management contract over to more NOI base? Kind of how did that come about? And then is there any ability to do this with other operators?\nDebra Cafaro: Well, this was all part of Justin\u2019s mandate, as these \u2013 we keep talking about these decisive actions, operationally focused, positioning the portfolio to capture the upside. And obviously, when he first came in March of 2020, there was a lot of focus on sort of the COVID reaction and stabilization. And so now where we have been taking these steps and the Sunrise is another good example of what we are trying to do to position the portfolio, Justin, you can comment, in particular, about how you have done this.\nJustin Hutchens: Sure. I mean one thing I will just mention is that Jack Callison and the team at Sunrise have just been performing really well, and we are just \u2013 couldn\u2019t be happier about having a partnership with them. And what we like about this new arrangement is it\u2019s pretty simple. If they deliver higher NOI to us, then they will get a higher management fee. If it\u2019s lower, it\u2019s lower. So, we love the alignment. They are fired up about creating value over time, and we will both benefit from this. And we definitely anticipate more of our portfolio to have this type of contract. We have several already, but we will continue to put this type of arrangement in place.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Your line is open.\nSteven Valiquette: Great. Thanks. Good morning.\nDebra Cafaro: Good morning.\nSteven Valiquette: Hi. Good morning. You guys touched on the \u2013 obviously, the pricing RevPOR environment. There is a bit of a growing vibe among some investors and conjecture from a few other senior housing companies about the potential for a multiyear cycle of annual resident rate increases trending well above historical averages in the current inflationary environment. I know it\u2019s hard to predict any sort of multiyear trend. But I am wondering, at least for 2023, do you have any preliminary view on whether your rate growth in \u201823 can mimic your 8% average trend in \u201822, or is there already a bias that maybe \u201822 is a unique year and \u201823 increases go back to historical averages?\nDebra Cafaro: We have taken a view generally that there is \u2013 this is really sustainable demand. And again, the fundamental backdrop in our markets is favorable because of the incredible drop in starts, so supply is low and it\u2019s going to stay low. We have this window of opportunity, where the senior population is starting to grow. And then we have an attractive kind of compelling portfolio. And so that is a backdrop, Justin always says that the table is set. That certainly is a good backdrop for a window of opportunity over time. And our view is, and I think Justin mentioned it, too, is if you can drive rate, in-place rate in the U.S. went up 8% in January at this low occupancy level in the low-80s, as those occupancies increase and these demographic supply-demand fundamentals improve, that should further support those \u2013 that kind of pricing power. So, a lot has to go right. There is a lot of uncertainty. It may not be a straight line. I need to caution all those things, but certainly, there is a case to be made.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRich Hill: Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. I want to come back to maybe some comments in the prepared remarks. And I think specifically, you said, first quarter 2022 capital allocation priorities continue to be acquisition and development of senior housing, life sciences and select medical office buildings. And at the risk of reading into it too much, including it the select, does that mean you are maybe de-prioritizing mobs a little bit more in favor of senior housing and life sciences, or have I read into that too much?\nDebra Cafaro: Well, when we look at 2021, the $3.7 billion that we had, it was really I think 70% senior housing, 20% life science and 10% MOBs. I mean we have been fortunate to have had an early thesis on MOBs and grown that business, and Pete\u2019s done a great job running it. And we have done these bolt-on type of acquisitions, like the one we did this quarter with our hospital partner Ardent, which was a relationship-driven opportunity. So, that\u2019s what I would say about our capital allocation priorities, and we have been very consistent in that regard.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Omotayo Okusanya with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Yes. Good morning everyone. Debbie, congrats on the order of merit in Illinois and also BJ, welcome aboard. Question is on senior housing. On the triple-net portfolio, in particular, again, realizing you guys had made a bunch of adjustments already to some of the struggling tenants. But you still have kind of a rent coverage that\u2019s still probably somewhat weak relative to historical levels. About 10% of your NOI is still tied to triple-net senior housing tenants, where rent coverage is below one. How comfortable do you kind of feel like you have made all the adjustments restructurings you need to do for those tenants, or is there kind of a risk that you may have to expand that scope going forward?\nDebra Cafaro: I think at this point, Tayo, because of the pandemic, we have probably touched on the vast majority of these triple-net tenants. And that\u2019s a lot of what we were doing during the pandemic and working with them. And as Bob said, what we have tried to do is really get to a sustainable rent level and then participate in the upside as the industry recovers. And that\u2019s what we have done generally. So, Justin, do you want to\u2026?\nJustin Hutchens: Yes. I would just say that there has been a lot of action taken. And we certainly believe that the vast majority of that\u2019s way behind us. So, we will look to see the operations improve as the rest of the sector recovers.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from John Pawlowski with Green Street. Your line is open.\nJohn Pawlowski: Thanks. Justin, could you spend a minute just talking about specifically in Canada, what\u2019s really holding back that market from a SHOP fundamental perspective, occupancy remains high, but NOI, cash NOI down 2% year-over-year. Feels like Canada has been lagging for a while. So, just a bit more specifics of what\u2019s happening on the ground there?\nJustin Hutchens: Yes. Sure. So, the main thing that really happened was the Omicron variant. And in Canada, our communities had restrictions. They have always been much quicker to kind of shutdown when there is a little bit of an outbreak or a threat of an outbreak. And so that slowed the move-ins down. Canada is 93% occupied, it\u2019s going to have kind of structurally higher move-outs because it doesn\u2019t have the benefit of this U.S. portfolio that drops so much, because it\u2019s just been such a strong stable performer. So, January and February had soft move-ins, March and April, off to a good start. So, we do think there is potential to recover. We are looking forward to Canada getting back on track. But I would just really point to COVID, really to the driving part.\nDebra Cafaro: Yes. And some of those restrictions really are continuing. They have been, from a healthcare standpoint, a much more rigorous kind of government controls on activities. And so it will take a little while for this to kind of run off, but it is a great portfolio and a really high performer, and we are very confident in the future performance.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nMike Mueller: Yes. Hi. Curious, what are your in-place escalators today for the MOB and life science portfolio? And as you are looking at signing new leases today, are the new escalators something considerably higher?\nPeter Bulgarelli: Yes. Thanks Mike. This is Pete. Thanks for the question. Yes, our escalators are about 2.5% right now, in-place escalators for MOB and they are about the same for R&I. And we are certainly pushing limits on that. We are starting pushing to 3% and in some cases, higher. And another related comment would be we are trying to push more CPI-related escalators as we deal with this inflationary environment. And we are \u2013 in some places, we are finding success and others, we are just \u2013 we are settling for higher escalators in the 3%, 3%-plus ranges.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nNick Yulico: Thanks. Good morning everyone. So, I know you haven\u2019t given third quarter guidance, but just trying to put together various numbers here to try and think about what the third quarter sequential occupancy growth could look like for the SHOP portfolio. I mean last year, third quarter grew sequentially 230 basis points. I think you said, Bob, in the guidance for the second quarter that May and June, we are assuming about 50 a month. So, should we use that 50 a month kind of assume that pace could continue in the third quarter, so you get to around 150 basis points for the quarter, you are close to 200 if you look at the numbers from last year? Just trying to kind of frame out a possible occupancy growth scenario for the third quarter. Thanks.\nDebra Cafaro: Great try. Let\u2019s focus on \u2013 we are very focused on executing and delivering in the second. And you are right about the expectations for the second. And we have said we expect sustained NOI improvement through the year.\nRobert Probst: I would just add, sequentially, which, to your point, three versus two, this key selling season in occupancy manifests itself.\nDebra Cafaro: And will be crucial to determining the answer to your question.\nRobert Probst: So fundamental, but seasonal patterns would suggest Q3 occ is sequentially favorable.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nVikram Malhotra: Thanks so much for taking the follow-up. Just sort of in this market, with all the volatility, I am just wondering your views on two things. One, just using the fund more actively that you have created? And two, maybe given the medical office environment, using that as a source of capital for other growth, just all tying that all into the balance sheet and where you see leverage or how you see leverage trending over the next 12 months?\nDebra Cafaro: Well, thanks. Yes, the fund is a great competitive advantage that we have. We started in March of 2020, and our overall third-party investment management business is up to about $5 billion of assets under management. It generally is focused on kind of lower cap rate core type assets. And so to the extent there was an opportunity there that made sense, that is an attractive asset that we have. Bob, do you want to talk about the balance sheet?\nRobert Probst: Sure. In terms of leverage, it\u2019s a little bit of a broken record, but the recovery of the $300 million of NOI we lost in SHOP in the pandemic is really the key to unlock the leverage ratio back into 5x to 6x. We are trending in that direction, which is encouraging. In the meantime, we have been doing other things such as upgrading the portfolio through asset sales, for example, last year, reducing near-term debt, extending duration, things like that, to make sure that we are in a good spot, which we are.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Yes. Hey guys. I wanted to ask about the $0.01 drag from the life science redevelopment. It seems like two tenants moved out. Did you disclose who those tenants were?\nRobert Probst: No, but we disclosed the locations, which maybe, Pete, you can give a little color.\nPeter Bulgarelli: Sure. Yes. This is Pete. So yes, we \u2013 with \u2013 just as a reminder, life sciences is one of our high capital priorities over the last couple of years, the research innovation portfolio has performed very well. And what we found consistently is when we have ready lab space, that the space lease is up very quickly and at very good rates. It\u2019s a unique space in the marketplace. And there is a shortage of it across the country. So, one of our vacant \u2013 upcoming vacancy is in Raleigh, very near Research Triangle Park. And as a straight office tenant that is departing. And it\u2019s \u2013 this building is within \u2013 is associated with Wake Forest University, is in the innovation center, is adjacent to the medical school that they have. And so we think that there is a good probability that we would redevelop that space into lab space and be very successful in re-leasing it. The other is in \u2013 is associated with our Keystone properties and \u2013 sorry, I missed two of them up, I\u2019m sorry. There is one in Raleigh\u2026\nDebra Cafaro: There is two, one is in RTP and one in the Wake Innovation Center, and they both could be very in demand for kind of lab space. So, that\u2019s what we are undertaking.\nPeter Bulgarelli: That\u2019s right.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to Ms. Debra Cafaro for closing remarks.\nDebra Cafaro: Yes. Okay. Well, thank you, Abby, and thank you to everyone who joined us today. We really appreciate your support and participation and are excited about the quarter, excited about the senior housing recovery that\u2019s underway and look forward to seeing you soon.\nOperator: And this concludes today\u2019s conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Robert Probst",
            "content": "Thanks, Justin. I'm going to share a few thoughts on our first quarter office and enterprise results and finish up with our second quarter outlook before turning the call to Q&A. Our Office segment, which includes our medical office and research and innovation businesses, performed well in Q1, delivering 4.6% year-on-year same-store growth. Medical office year-on-year quarterly same-store growth was 3.5%, led by strong retention, contractual escalators and parking recovery. R&I increased 7.9%, which also benefited from escalators and leasing, as well as from $1 million in holdover rent from an exiting tenant. Adjusting for this holdover rent, R&I growth was 4.6% in the quarter and Office same-store NOI growth was 3.8%. In terms of overall enterprise performance, we were very pleased to have posted growth in the first quarter for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. We delivered FFO of $0.79 per share and organic SHOP revenue and NOI same-store growth of 10% and 14%, respectively. Meanwhile, total property same-store NOI increased 5.8%, excluding HHS grants. And this growth was achieved while Omicron raged for the majority of the quarter. These results speak to the quality of the Ventas portfolio and the commitment and skill of the Ventas operators and team. Leverage improved sequentially by 30 basis points to 6.9x in Q1 as a result of senior housing NOI growth and HHS proceeds, partially offset by acquisitions closed in the first quarter that have been pre-funded in 2021. In this rising interest rate environment, 90% of our debt is fixed rate with the duration exceeding 6 years and an average cost of debt of 3.4%. We are pleased that we extended debt maturities in 2021, having paid down over $1 billion of near-term debt while raising over $1 billion of new debt with a weighted coupon of 2.65%. And our liquidity remains robust, with $2.2 billion available at the close of the first quarter. In terms of Q2 guidance, we expect net income to range from minus $0.03 to plus $0.01 per fully diluted share. Q2 normalized FFO is expected to range from $0.69 to $0.73 per share. When excluding HHS grants, our Q2 guidance midpoint of $0.71 compares to Q1 FFO of $0.71. We expect SHOP to grow approximately $0.02 sequentially. This is largely offset by two items previously communicated, a $0.01 sequential reduction from the move out of two life science tenants, which will enable redevelopment into high-demand lab space, and $0.01 from lease resolutions with a handful of smaller operators in the senior housing triple-net business, with future upside participation in the cash flows at the assets. Further impacting the SHOP Q2 year-over-year same-store guidance, we expect revenue to grow approximately 10% at the midpoint, led by occupancy increasing by 400 basis points, as well as improved rates. We expect to grow shop NOI in the range of 2% to 10%. At the guidance midpoint, Ventas expects operating expenses per day in Q2 to remain consistent with Q1. Flat operating expenses per day sequentially in Q2 is higher than normal seasonal trends as a result of incorporated continued inflationary pressures, notably on labor, utilities and resident services. Looking sequentially, overall SHOP segment NOI is expected to grow approximately 4% from Q1 to Q2. Looking beyond Q2 for SHOP, based on the favorable supply/demand backdrop, the strength of the revenue engine and the expectation of some moderation in inflationary pressure in the back half, we continue to expect sustained improvement in SHOP same-store cash NOI through 2022. Final Q2 guidance assumptions include no new unannounced material acquisitions or capital markets activities and 403 million fully diluted shares. For more information on our guidance assumptions, I would direct you to the business update deck posted to our website. I would also point you to Pages 29 and 31 of our supplemental, which provide insights and disclosure including segment NOI guidance and an NOI to FFO trending schedule to allow for easier insight into unique items in our results. To echo Debbie's comments, I'm excited to have BJ Grant join Ventas as our leader of IR. BJ is an accomplished REIT investor, has deep knowledge of healthcare and Ventas and will be a great fit with our team. To close, we believe the senior housing recovery that is now underway, the actions we have taken and our continued focus on execution position us for sustained value creation. That concludes our prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will turn the call back to the operator. Sure. Thanks, Steve. And there is a really helpful page in the business update on Page 12, which speaks to expenses. And just to frame this, I know you're asking about labor, but again, I want to put labor in the context of the overall expense base, because we are seeing inflationary pressure not only in labor but in other areas such as food and utilities and so on, and that's embedded in the forecast. But specific to labor, contract labor within that, which is, call it, 5% of labor with 95% being in-house labor. We did see some modest improvement in contract labor towards the end of the first, and we expect that to continue modestly improving into the second, as we continue to get some success in hiring, as Justin articulated. Importantly, the overall labor, we are assuming continued inflationary impacts in targeted ways in order to enable that recruiting. If you step back from it all, we are holding our cost per day flat sequentially Q2 to Q1 in a quarter which is seasonally lower, typically to reflect that inflation. And hopefully, that helps frame the answer. I'll take the second one first and let Justin talk about April 1. So you're right, REVPOR traditionally, at least over the last 5 years or so, if you look sequentially at the growth rate year-over-year, we tend to drift down over the quarters, with the first quarter being supported by the in-house rate increase and then the re-leasing spread dragging that down over the balance of the year. The dynamic \u2013 and that was in the supply backdrop really. That was typically the case. What's really encouraging here is the firming street rate or new resident pricing would suggest that, that drift should improve, i.e., ultimately, a positive re-leasing spread over time as discussed. So we should have a better profile over time, notwithstanding the fact that the re-leasing spread is still lower. But over \u2013 as a trend, I would expect that would be better than the supply area, particularly given the backdrop of the fundamentals. You want to talk about... Hi, Rich, so sequentially, we would expect 80 basis points of sequential average occupancy growth. The start to the quarter in April is 20 basis points, suggesting it to go, if you like, in the 50 on average per month for the balance of the quarter. Remember, back to the key selling season, that begins to accelerate here in the coming months. If you looked at last year, how we trended, that looks as if last year are also favorable. So that would suggest a good setup for the guidance number. I would just add, sequentially, which, to your point, three versus two, this key selling season in occupancy manifests itself. So fundamental, but seasonal patterns would suggest Q3 occ is sequentially favorable. Sure. In terms of leverage, it's a little bit of a broken record, but the recovery of the $300 million of NOI we lost in SHOP in the pandemic is really the key to unlock the leverage ratio back into 5x to 6x. We are trending in that direction, which is encouraging. In the meantime, we have been doing other things such as upgrading the portfolio through asset sales, for example, last year, reducing near-term debt, extending duration, things like that, to make sure that we are in a good spot, which we are. No, but we disclosed the locations, which maybe, Pete, you can give a little color."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Justin Hutchens",
            "content": "Thank you, Debbie. I will start by noting that we are very pleased with the NOI growth in the quarter and the start of what should be sustained improvement in our SHOP portfolio throughout the year. The revenue performance is very strong driven by volume and pricing in spite of the COVID activity in the first quarter leading to our best year-over-year and sequential revenue performance we have ever seen in our portfolio. Now, I will speak to the first quarters our performance excluding HHS grants, second quarter guidance, comments and update on our key initiative. In the first quarter same-store revenue increased by nearly 10% versus the prior year due to the positive trends in occupancy and rates, same-store average occupancy grew year-over-year by 420 basis points to 83%, which was ahead of the guidance midpoint of 410 basis points. Although the first quarter was slowed by impacts of COVID, demand remained resilient. Year-to-date through April, lead and move-in activity continue to outperform pre-pandemic levels, led principally by our U.S. AL business. REVPOR increased by 4.2% versus the prior year, benefiting from strong in-place resident rate increases approximating 8% and improving re-leasing spreads. Not only did we execute very strong in-house rent increases during the quarter, we have also witnessed strong sequential growth in street rates over the past several months, as move-in rates have improved 5% sequentially. The result of these favorable pricing trends has helped to translate into narrowing re-leasing spreads, which is now a low single-digit reduction and more favorable than pre-pandemic levels, this demonstrated pricing power is occurring a 83% occupancy, therefore we believe we have significant occupancy rate and ultimately revenue growth potential in front of us.  Turning to expenses. Same-store operating expenses grew 8% year-over-year excluding HHS driven by higher occupancy and macro inflationary impacts throughout the quarter and labor utilities and other operating expenses. Labor expenses remain elevated as we navigate the macro staff shortages with enhance hiring practices and target wage increases. Net hiring has improved 7 months in a row. And although we are pleased to see the progress on hiring, we have yet to see it impact the P&L. Although inflation is elevated and labor expenses remain high, the incremental margin growth is strong. One of the best aspects of the senior housing operating business at this point in the cycle is the high operating leverage. We are starting to benefit from this operating leverage as the incremental margin was 56%, which helped the overall margin improved at 24%.  It is important to note that even though we were pleased with the quarter's performance, the impacts from COVID drove uneven geographic results, with the U.S. significantly outperforming Canada on the bottom line. NOI in the U.S. grew 26% year-over-year versus Canada, which was down 2%. We expect conditions to improve over the balance of the year as Canada's move-in restrictions were the primary driver of its performance compared to the U.S. Our independent living business was also impacted by COVID in the quarter, but I am encouraged to see reacceleration of move-ins in that portfolio in both March and April. We continue to believe in the independent living thesis over time, we should benefit from our independent living through the overall higher stability with higher margin, lower labor, higher occupancy and a longer length of stay. Our independent living communities in the U.S. and Canada are located in markets that support strong net absorption over time. Moving on to significant updates in the senior housing portfolio, our transition 90 portfolio of mid-market, assisted living communities located in markets with favorable demand characteristics, which was fully transitioned as of January 1 of this year to new regional operators is showing early signs of improvement as occupancy and NOI are both string to improve. Our leading Senior Living portfolio services over 75,000 residents across 46 U.S. states, seven Canadian provinces and the UK, and it's comprised of 38 operators. We remain fully engaged in developing deeper and mutually beneficial relationships, especially with our SHOP operating partners through Ventas OI. Our goal with this platform is to use our operating experience and deep analytical capabilities to improve all aspects of operations, from digital marketing strategy to CapEx optimization to recruitment and retention. We have developed a differentiated support structure to help our operators succeed. We continue to identify opportunities to improve our portfolio through selective pruning, as we are targeting roughly $200 million of senior housing dispositions this year. We are also pleased, as announced today, that we refreshed our relationship with Sunrise Senior Living, who operates 92 of our high-end assisted living communities. This relationship has been reframed with better alignment, which adds flexibility and rewards NOI performance which now contributes to the management fee and incentives based on outsized NOI growth. Given the emphasis on NOI at this point in the cycle we think this alignment is perfectly it's perfectly timed. I'll close by reiterating our expectation for sustained improved SHOP performance throughout the year driven by revenue through occupancy growth and improved pricing. I would also like to acknowledge our operating partners, who have been successfully navigating an evolving macroenvironment and ultimately, creating a valuable living experience for our residents and value creation for our shareholders. Now I'll hand the call to Bob. Yes. And I'd just say that as we're underwriting deals, we always drill home to the local market, and we're following the philosophy of right asset, right market, right operator. Certainly, the broader Canadian market tends to have a better supply demand dynamic over time. They have been 90% occupied for the last 10 years. So it's been supportive of a very stable and growing investment in Canada. And then the U.S., looking ahead, with supply being so low and starts being so low over the next few years, we like our opportunity to grow organically, but also to make investments in the U.S. as well. Hi, it's Justin. Yes. So we are very encouraged by the trends, and we certainly have demonstrated pricing power, as we mentioned, and to do so at 83% occupancy is just a real good indicator of the demand for senior housing, which has been strong and growing and performing above pre-pandemic levels. So we would expect pricing power to persist. We demonstrated first with rent \u2013 in-house rent increases that around 8%, which was solid. The next lever we can pull is street rates and narrowing the re-leasing spread, which is happening already. We would expect it to continue. There is aspects \u2013 there is parts of our portfolio that are already positive in terms of re-leasing spreads. So we certainly think that can be achieved and should be. And I'd just say that we're encouraged by the trends and expect the environment to support more improvement in that area. Yes. One thing about the key selling season, which is really May through September, we would expect that literally 99% of our net move-ins occurred during this period. So this is the red hot part of the selling season for this sector. We're around 83.3% occupied in April, off to a good start in the quarter. And as Debbie mentioned, the underlying demand has just been really solid. Hi, it's Justin. So the first part of your question really refers to the macro backdrop, and we've obviously been through other cycles, including one that had a housing demand and price decline. There is \u2013 there can be \u2013 if it's dramatic like it was during the Great Recession, there can be an initial shock to the system. But what we saw during \u2013 post kind of the initial period of the Great Recession is that senior housing performed really well. It performed well and had a backdrop for a few years of limited new competition, more so than what we're seeing now. We have a real opportunity with the starts being so low and the deliveries being so low relative to that period. So the other thing, too, is that house wealth and income demographics in our markets are very supportive. The affordability for our product is very, very strong. So we think we're well positioned in that regard. Yes. We are way ahead of April of last year in terms of absolute leads, and we are still well ahead of 2019. So, we are not \u2013 we are more encouraged than anything. Sure. I mean one thing I will just mention is that Jack Callison and the team at Sunrise have just been performing really well, and we are just \u2013 couldn't be happier about having a partnership with them. And what we like about this new arrangement is it's pretty simple. If they deliver higher NOI to us, then they will get a higher management fee. If it's lower, it's lower. So, we love the alignment. They are fired up about creating value over time, and we will both benefit from this. And we definitely anticipate more of our portfolio to have this type of contract. We have several already, but we will continue to put this type of arrangement in place. Yes. I would just say that there has been a lot of action taken. And we certainly believe that the vast majority of that's way behind us. So, we will look to see the operations improve as the rest of the sector recovers. Yes. Sure. So, the main thing that really happened was the Omicron variant. And in Canada, our communities had restrictions. They have always been much quicker to kind of shutdown when there is a little bit of an outbreak or a threat of an outbreak. And so that slowed the move-ins down. Canada is 93% occupied, it's going to have kind of structurally higher move-outs because it doesn't have the benefit of this U.S. portfolio that drops so much, because it's just been such a strong stable performer. So, January and February had soft move-ins, March and April, off to a good start. So, we do think there is potential to recover. We are looking forward to Canada getting back on track. But I would just really point to COVID, really to the driving part."

            "name": "Debra Cafaro",
            "content": "Thank you, Sarah. Good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants. I want to welcome you to the Ventas first quarter earnings call. I am delighted to be joined by my Ventas colleagues who have worked so hard for shareholders, each other, our partners and our other stakeholders over the past 2 plus years. We are off to a strong start in 2022. We are delighted to deliver on our commitment to grow normalized FFO and same-store shop NOI year-over-year for the first time since the pandemic began. It is certainly worth pausing to appreciate a quarter that returns us to growth and underscores our positive momentum and the senior housing recovery that is underway. In the quarter, we continued to benefit from stability and growth in our office and healthcare triple-net lease businesses. And in SHOP, we saw outstanding year-over-year NOI revenue and occupancy growth that overcame meaningful impacts of COVID-19 and inflationary pressures during the quarter. Looking forward, the power of our well-positioned communities, strong demand evidenced by leads that consistently exceed pre-pandemic levels into April, pricing power and advantaged markets should translate into sustained NOI growth through the balance of the year. These trends should be further enhanced by favorable supply demand fundamentals, supporting net absorption in our markets. Specifically, Q1 2022 starts are down two-thirds from the peak just as the over-80 population is set to grow over 20% during the next several years. But we are not just relying on demographics to win the recovery. Justin and his senior housing team continue to take decisive actions following the right asset, right market, right operator approach to best position our senior housing portfolio to capture the upside ahead. We have already started to see the benefit of these actions with a strong first quarter and our SHOP portfolio has outperformed industry benchmarks for comparable senior housing communities over the last year. Today, we have announced another important step in this progress. We have revised our agreement with Sunrise to align our interest toward profitable growth and value creation. We have been working together with Sunrise since 2007 and are delighted to reset the relationship with the current management team at this point in the cycle. In addition to organic growth, we also benefited from the investments we have made under our consistent long-term capital allocation philosophy and priorities. On the investment front, we have posted about $4 billion of investment activity since the beginning of 2021. With our first quarter 2022 capital allocation priorities continuing to be the acquisition and development of senior housing, life science and select medical office buildings. I want to highlight two of our first quarter investments and show how they demonstrate our investment approach. The two investments have reliable going in cash yields, limited downside and room for growth. And both came from trusted relationships built over long periods of time through repeated and mutual success. Mangrove Bay is an irreplaceable senior housing community located on the waterfront in the high wealth submarket of Jupiter, Florida. Acquired for $107 million, Mangrove has large units, high REVPOR and a strong, consistent operating history. Since the acquisition, performance has been strong and our investment yield has grown to 6%. Our recent value-add investment in the U City Philadelphia submarket represents an opportunity to add another component our incredibly well-performing research and innovation portfolio located between Penn and Drexel. We intend to convert a portion of the building to high-demand lab space and achieve a 7% stabilized yield on our aggregate investment costs. The Penn-Drexel market has been very successful for us, with our two ongoing developments now 90% leased or committed and rents up 40% since we put a shovel in the ground. I'd like to touch on three more points before closing, our continued focus on driving total shareholder return, ESG leadership and the macro environment. First, as a continuation of our commitment to driving TSR performance, I welcome BJ Grant to the VTR team. He is a highly regarded long-time REIT investor, who has a distinct appreciation for healthcare and senior housing real estate. BJ is going to work with the Ventas team and externally with the investment community to reinforce the Ventas value proposition. Second, I'd like to highlight our sustainability leadership, which continues with our announced commitment to achieve net zero carbon emissions over the next two decades and our recent recognition as the number one medical office building owner/operator for ENERGY STAR certifications. Finally, let's discuss the all-important macro economy, particularly current inflationary pressures and the tightest labor market we have seen in 50 years. It is encouraging that today's Jobs Report evidenced some emerging indications of stability. Emanating from a confluence of factors, annual inflation is expected to continue to run high, perhaps exceeding 8% through the second quarter and then moderate by a couple of percentage points in the back half of the year and moderate again by another couple of percentage points by mid-2023. While significant uncertainty remains, this improvement in expectations is the result of various policy actions, including Fed tightening, tempering demand, greater balance in workforce supply and demand from expansion of the labor force participation rate and a slower pace of job creation and some supply chain normalization. Whether these forces result in a soft landing or trigger a recession, Ventas is relatively well positioned. Our demand is robust, it is need based and it is growing. Pricing power is strong and has the potential to strengthen further as occupancies continue to recover. Softening the rate of growth in labor and other expenses should improve our margin, particularly as revenue and occupancy increase. But regardless of the macro environment and uncertainty, at Ventas, we will remain agile, execution-focused and performance-driven. With an attractive valuation and high-quality portfolio, growth potential, a well covered advantaged dividend, 90% fixed rate debt and the opportunity to drive external growth, we are very well positioned. In closing, I want you to know that all of us at Ventas are committed to using every tool at our disposal to XL and creates sustained value for our shareholders and other stakeholders. Thank you. Justin? I'll take that and then turn it over to Justin, but we've been very successful in both markets over time. Canada has really outperformed during the pandemic. Occupancies remain very high and the market has been favorable over long periods of time. And of course, the U.S. is the engine of growth in this quarter with 26% year-over-year. So we like the growth potential there as well. Justin, do you want to... Well, thank you for the question. As I mentioned, we are and have been taking a lot of decisive action on the portfolio with the team and just in general, to execute, to make sure people understand the Ventas story and the opportunities. And really, we have a consistent strategy that over time has delivered superior performance, and we look forward to the opportunities ahead. And again, look forward to driving TSR, as I mentioned. Good morning. Juan, Page 11, of course, has April leads and move-ins which are, as Justin mentioned, ahead of pre-pandemic levels, leads were very strong. And do you want to talk about sort of entering \u2013 and we're entering the key selling season, obviously. Right. And I would say, even potentially within real estate, relatively advantaged, because that would result in some more slack in the labor market as well. So, it would change the expense equation here, while the demand and supply are favorable. So, that's I think an important point to understand. And then in terms of April, I think we are actually doing well compared to prior April. Because those quarters embed this key selling season of May and June the prior period presentation. Good morning. Well, this was all part of Justin's mandate, as these \u2013 we keep talking about these decisive actions, operationally focused, positioning the portfolio to capture the upside. And obviously, when he first came in March of 2020, there was a lot of focus on sort of the COVID reaction and stabilization. And so now where we have been taking these steps and the Sunrise is another good example of what we are trying to do to position the portfolio, Justin, you can comment, in particular, about how you have done this. Good morning. We have taken a view generally that there is \u2013 this is really sustainable demand. And again, the fundamental backdrop in our markets is favorable because of the incredible drop in starts, so supply is low and it's going to stay low. We have this window of opportunity, where the senior population is starting to grow. And then we have an attractive kind of compelling portfolio. And so that is a backdrop, Justin always says that the table is set. That certainly is a good backdrop for a window of opportunity over time. And our view is, and I think Justin mentioned it, too, is if you can drive rate, in-place rate in the U.S. went up 8% in January at this low occupancy level in the low-80s, as those occupancies increase and these demographic supply-demand fundamentals improve, that should further support those \u2013 that kind of pricing power. So, a lot has to go right. There is a lot of uncertainty. It may not be a straight line. I need to caution all those things, but certainly, there is a case to be made. Well, when we look at 2021, the $3.7 billion that we had, it was really I think 70% senior housing, 20% life science and 10% MOBs. I mean we have been fortunate to have had an early thesis on MOBs and grown that business, and Pete's done a great job running it. And we have done these bolt-on type of acquisitions, like the one we did this quarter with our hospital partner Ardent, which was a relationship-driven opportunity. So, that's what I would say about our capital allocation priorities, and we have been very consistent in that regard. I think at this point, Tayo, because of the pandemic, we have probably touched on the vast majority of these triple-net tenants. And that's a lot of what we were doing during the pandemic and working with them. And as Bob said, what we have tried to do is really get to a sustainable rent level and then participate in the upside as the industry recovers. And that's what we have done generally. So, Justin, do you want to...? Yes. And some of those restrictions really are continuing. They have been, from a healthcare standpoint, a much more rigorous kind of government controls on activities. And so it will take a little while for this to kind of run off, but it is a great portfolio and a really high performer, and we are very confident in the future performance. Great try. Let's focus on \u2013 we are very focused on executing and delivering in the second. And you are right about the expectations for the second. And we have said we expect sustained NOI improvement through the year. And will be crucial to determining the answer to your question. Well, thanks. Yes, the fund is a great competitive advantage that we have. We started in March of 2020, and our overall third-party investment management business is up to about $5 billion of assets under management. It generally is focused on kind of lower cap rate core type assets. And so to the extent there was an opportunity there that made sense, that is an attractive asset that we have. Bob, do you want to talk about the balance sheet? There is two, one is in RTP and one in the Wake Innovation Center, and they both could be very in demand for kind of lab space. So, that's what we are undertaking. Yes. Okay. Well, thank you, Abby, and thank you to everyone who joined us today. We really appreciate your support and participation and are excited about the quarter, excited about the senior housing recovery that's underway and look forward to seeing you soon."

I would now like to welcome BJ Grant, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, to begin the call. BJ, over to you.\nBill Grant: Thank you, Mandeep, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Ventas Full Year 2023 Results Conference Call. Yesterday, we issued our full year 2023 earnings release, presentation materials and supplemental investor package, which are available on the Ventas website at ir.ventasreit.com. As a reminder, remarks today may include forward-looking statements and other matters. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and a variety of topics may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, all of which are available on the Ventas website. Certain non-GAAP financial measures will also be discussed on this call, and for a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to our supplemental investor package posted on the Investor Relations website. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Debra Cafaro, Chairman and CEO of Ventas.\nDebra Cafaro: Thank you, BJ. I want to welcome all of our shareholders and other participants to the Ventas Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Call. I'm pleased to share our strong results for 2023, discuss our advantaged position across commercial real estate, driven by large and growing demographic demand and introduce full year 2024 guidance as the senior housing multiyear growth opportunity continues to power our expectations. Let's start with results. We reported favorable results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. We produced full year normalized FFO of $2.99 per share, representing over 5% year-over-year growth, above the midpoint of the guidance range we initiated in February. As anticipated, our results were fueled by unprecedented organic property growth in our SHOP portfolio, which grew same-store cash NOI over 18% last year. Enterprise same-store cash NOI growth was supported by compounding contributions from our outpatient medical and research and triple net lease portfolios. We finished the year on a high note in the fourth quarter, delivering $0.76 of normalized FFO, representing 7% year-over-year growth and reporting accelerating same-store SHOP occupancy. During 2023, the Ventas team accomplished a great deal together. We raised over $4 billion in attractively priced capital, took effective portfolio actions, invested CapEx in our assets to position our portfolio to capture demand in strong markets, made meaningful progress toward our ambitious ESG goals, successfully integrated a $1.6 billion portfolio and expanded our VIM business. As a result, we delivered over 15% 1-year total return to shareholders, posted 2 years in a row of TSR outperformance versus the health care REIT and broader REIT indices and achieved upper quartile performance for the last 3 years among health care REITs. We still have more work to do. We are focused on driving total returns for our shareholders. As durable demand fuels the multiyear growth opportunity in senior housing, we believe Ventas offers an attractive combination of growth and value. Let me provide a few reasons we believe we are uniquely positioned to create value. We entered 2024 with momentum. Because our asset classes are benefiting from demographic demand that is strong and getting stronger, we are pleased to project another consecutive year of normalized FFO growth in the mid-single digits and the third consecutive year of same-store SHOP cash NOI growth in the double digits. Notably, our projected 2024 normalized FFO growth of 5% per share puts us in the top 20% of all REITs that have issued guidance to date. In 2024, we expect to benefit from steady growth from our outpatient medical research and triple net lease portfolios. As we look into 2025, we have 2 large lease renewals, one with Brookdale in senior housing and another with Kindred for a portion of our LTACs. In Brookdale's case, our communities are enjoying positive operating trends, and they have significant net absorption potential. In Kindred's situation, rent coverage remains challenged, and it's too early to say what the ultimate outcome in 2025 will be. Kindred remains focused on performance improvements that could benefit 2024 and 2025 financial results. In all cases, we are fully prepared to maximize NOI over time. In SHOP, January is already starting positively, with 200 basis points in year-over-year same-store occupancy growth. In 2024, we expect year-over-year normalized FFO and SHOP same-store cash NOI growth to accelerate in the second half, with a SHOP NOI exit run rate that should support continued SHOP growth in 2025 and beyond. This highly positive context is supportive of growing our senior housing presence through both organic and inorganic growth. In pursuit of delivering consistent superior performance, our strategy is to, one, continue to deliver compelling profitable organic growth in senior housing; two, capture value-creating external growth focused on senior housing; and three, drive strong execution and cash flow generation throughout our high-quality portfolio that serves a large and growing aging demographic. Our optimism for a long, durable growth opportunity in SHOP is founded on compelling supply/demand dynamics, led by a step function in growth of the over-80 population in 2024 and yet again in 2027, the lowest construction starts in senior housing since 2009 and our advantaged platform that has the team, tools, financial strength, data and operators to drive organic performance. The Ventas platform should also enable us to invest successfully. As we discussed in November, we intend to build on our compelling organic growth opportunity by layering on value-creating external investments focused on senior housing. There is a confluence of market factors giving us confidence that 2024 and 2025 should be rich with investment opportunities. We're already seeing our pipeline expand as high-quality senior housing communities in good markets with embedded growth come to market, and we have a line of sight to complete over $300 million of investments in the first half of this year. Our criteria for investments include attractive going-in yields priced at below replacement costs with projected low to mid-teens unlevered IRRs that meet our right market, right asset, right operator framework. Our broader objectives are to drive enterprise NOI and normalized FFO per share growth, increase the scale of our SHOP business, deliver strong returns on capital, support stable and growing dividend capacity and maximize value for shareholders. In sum, we delivered on our commitments in 2023, and we expect another year of normalized FFO per share and property performance growth in 2024. Our 5% projected normalized FFO growth favorably distinguishes Ventas across the REIT universe. With an attractive valuation and the growth engine of senior housing, we are focused on enabling exceptional environments for a large and growing aging population and creating value for our shareholders. Now I'm happy to turn the call over to Justin.\nJustin Hutchens: Thank you, Debbie. I'm pleased to say our SHOP portfolio delivered double-digit same-store cash NOI growth for the sixth quarter in a row. The same-store NOI growth for the year was led by our U.S. communities with 24.5% growth complemented by our high-quality Canadian portfolio, which is over 95% occupied and continues to deliver a valuable and stable cash flow. Total SHOP same-store cash NOI growth was 18.3%, which was above same-store guidance midpoint expectations. We are happy with this attractive growth and strong finish to the year. Double clicking on the year, the results were good. Our same-store SHOP communities outperformed our expectations across all key metrics, including occupancy, REVPOR, OpEx and margin expansion. Full year same-store SHOP occupancy grew by 120 basis points. The U.S. saw 140 basis points of occupancy gains, and Canada, although already highly occupied, grew by 90 basis points. Demand strength across geographies and asset types led to accelerating occupancy growth this quarter, with 170 basis points of year-over-year growth. Furthermore, we saw 110 basis points of average sequential occupancy growth from the third quarter to the fourth. U.S. SHOP occupancy growth was supported primarily by strong demand, with move-ins that were 109% of prior year levels in the fourth quarter. REVPOR grew over 6% for the year. contributing to revenue growth of almost 8%. As a reminder, REVPOR would have been 40 basis points higher in 2023 and 130 basis points on the fourth quarter if adjusted for the Sunrise special assessment that occurred in 2022. OpExPOR performed well and was led by the U.S. with 2% growth year-over-year and 2.6% overall. Looking forward to 2024, we are excited to continue on our multiyear growth trajectory as we are expecting our third consecutive year of double-digit NOI growth in our same-store SHOP portfolio. Momentum ramped at the end of 2023, with fourth quarter occupancy accelerating, while strong pricing and higher move-ins fuel better than typical seasonal results and help 2024 to get off to a strong start. Once again, we are expecting the U.S. to be the growth engine with continued accelerating occupancy performance, with over 300 basis points growth, and expected to drive NOI growth in the mid- to high teens year-over-year. The overall SHOP portfolio is expected to grow NOI 10%, 15%.  The growing demand at our doorstep continues to support strong price and volume growth and serves a testament to the high quality and care and services and value proposition our communities provide to seniors and their families. The key assumptions that drive the midpoint of our range are average occupancy growth of about 250 basis points, REVPOR growth of about 5%, which puts the total revenue growth around 8%. January occupancy is already off to a strong start, delivering 200 basis points of occupancy growth year-over-year. This performance demonstrates solid execution by our operators and continued demand. We expect the performance throughout the year to be bolstered by newly renovated properties and Ventas OI initiatives to drive a strong key selling season. 2024 OpExPOR is expected to grow in line with normal inflation. We structured our business around rate growth and occupancy growth. We are entering the sweet spot where price and occupancy are moving together to drive revenue. Margin expansion will follow as higher occupancy creates operating leverage. We have struck a balance where they are moving together, and we anticipate further margin expansion over time as higher occupancy creates operating leverage. We are capitalizing our active asset management playbook and our operators' execution, which delivered strong momentum to finish 2023 and will propel us into 2024. We expect this to build sequentially throughout the year, which means we are poised for strong year-end NOI that should propel us even further in 2025 and beyond. We are delivering on the organic senior housing growth, which is the part 1 of our strategy and my #1 priority. Part 2 is expanding our footprint. In addition to the success we are having in our existing portfolio, we look forward to capturing value-creating external growth focused on senior housing. A key tenet of our investment strategy is our right market, right asset, right operator approach. We're bringing OI tools to investment activities to help the selection process. Our top investment priorities continue to be NOI-generating CapEx in our existing real estate and senior housing acquisitions. Sellers are motivated to transact, creating numerous actionable deals. We are targeting opportunities with low to mid-teen unlevered IRRs. We seek senior housing communities that are located in submarkets with compelling supply-demand profile, strong affordability and meaningful expected net absorption projections. We are primarily expanding with existing partners with proven performance for Ventas, and plan to increase our footprint in the fast-growing IL, AL memory care combination communities. Our pipeline is growing, as we have several interesting potential investments in our sites. Our team is actively working on transactions exceeding 300 million that meet our criteria, and I look forward to adding to that as the year progresses. In summary, demand is at our doorstep. We are pleased to see the SHOP growth engine continue to be led by the U.S. and complemented by the low beta, high quality and highly valuable Canada portfolio with compounding growth. 2024 is rich with opportunities through organic growth and external acquisitions. The growth on both fronts throughout the year should support value creation in 2025 and beyond. I'm looking forward to the exciting year ahead. Bob?\nRobert Probst: Thank you, Justin. I'm going to share some highlights on our '23 performance, touch on our balance sheet and close with our 2024 outlook. I'll start by saying we are pleased with all we accomplished in 2023. We finished the year strong, with reported normalized FFO per share of $0.76 in the fourth quarter, a 7% increase versus the prior year, adjusting for the promote received in Q4 of '22. For the fiscal year '23, we delivered normalized FFO of $2.99 per share or over 5% growth year-over-year when adjusting the prior year for unusual items. The multiyear senior housing growth trajectory was in full display in '23, with SHOP total NOI increasing year-over-year by approximately $100 million. We also reported total company same-store cash NOI growth of over 8% year-over-year, which is one of the fastest organic growth rates in our company's history. Our 2023 normalized FFO of $2.99 per share was at the high end of our previous $2.96 to $2.99 guidance range, and included $0.01 per share cybersecurity revenue impact in the fourth quarter in our Ardent OpCo investment that was not contemplated in prior guidance. Pete Bulgarelli and our outpatient medical and research team delivered another year of continuous compounding growth, with same-store cash NOI increasing nearly 3% in 2023, at the high end of our guidance range. Continued strong retention and leasing activity in outpatient medical led the way. A key driver of that result is the remarkable record of tenant satisfaction in Ventas' Lillibridge property management business, which notched its fourth consecutive year of top quartile tenant satisfaction. In 2023, Lillibridge reached the 97th percentile for overall tenant satisfaction, placing it among the top 5 property managers. I'd also like to share a few comments on our balance sheet. Throughout 2023, we used our scale and access to diverse sources of capital, raised over $4 million of attractively-priced capital across multiple markets and geographies. This capital raising in 2023 in part refunded 2024 maturing debt at attractive rates. As a result, we had a robust year-end 2023 liquidity position of $3.2 billion and have relatively modest 2024 maturing debt of $800 million net of cash on hand. The attractive NOI and EBITDA growth in our SHOP business also improved Ventas' net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 6.9x in the fourth quarter, a trend we expect to continue in 2024 and beyond led by the multiyear SHOP NOI growth opportunity. Let's conclude with our full year 2024 outlook. Because our asset classes are benefiting from powerful demographic demand, we are pleased to project another consecutive year of normalized FFO growth in the mid-single digits, and the third consecutive year of same-store SHOP cash NOI growth in the double digits. For 2024, we expect net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.06 per share at the midpoint. Our 2024 normalized FFO guidance range is $3.07 to $3.18 or $3.13 per share at the midpoint, which represents 5% year-over-year growth. The $0.14 FFO per share increase year-over-year can be bridged by 3 items. We expect a $0.28 per share contribution from outstanding year-over-year property growth led again by SHOP, which is expected to grow NOI by over $100 million for the second consecutive year. This property growth is partially offset by an $0.11 per share increase in higher interest expense and the $0.03 impact of 2023 capital recycling. In terms of same-store, we expect our total company same-store cash NOI to grow between 5% and 7.5% in 2024 led by SHOP same-store cash NOI growth of 10% to 15%. Our guidance also includes new senior housing investments of 350 million, which Justin mentioned in his remarks. The low and high end of our FFO guidance range are largely described by our property NOI expectations and potential changes in interest rates. A final note on phasing. We expect same-store cash NOI and normalized FFO year-over-year growth to ramp through the year, driven by higher interest expense in the first half of '24 versus '23, and the occupancy acceleration in the key selling season in SHOP, resulting in an exit run rate that should enable attractive SHOP growth '25 and beyond. A more fulsome discussion of our '24 guidance assumptions can be found in the earnings and outlook presentation posted to our website. To close, the entire Ventas team is ready to win together with all of our stakeholders. And that concludes our prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions]. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.\nMichael Carroll: Debbie, can you provide some additional color on your Kindred lease? I know in the business update Ventas has highlighted, Kindred has implemented some improvement -- or performance improvement initiatives, and you also highlighted that Select Medical had some really strong EBITDAR growth in 2Q and 3Q of '23. I mean are you implying that Kindred can grow into this coverage ratio? Or is that just kind of data points highlighting that there is some improvement in that coverage that could occur over the next handful of quarters?\nDebra Cafaro: Right. Mike, I would tell you that obviously, the most important thing we think about in the renewal in 2025 is about what the earnings capacity of those assets is at that time and beyond. And the -- Kindred has communicated to us that they have significant initiatives underway on those revenue and expense to improve operating performance incentives. Some of those, we can see are starting to take hold. We give Select as an example because it's a public company in the same business, and it shows that significant improvements are possible. And it's really too early to say, whether and to the extent Kindred's initiatives will, in fact, take hold to improve EBITDAR in 2024 and 2025. But they are surely working on it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.\nNicholas Yulico: Maybe just a question on the guidance for Bob. In terms of the interest expense going up this year, is there anything you can just sort of give us there in terms of some of the assumptions on refinancing? I wasn't also sure if you're assuming any change in leverage in terms of debt reduction, but perhaps you could just unpack that a little bit more.\nRobert Probst: Sure, Nick. Yes. So I mentioned the $0.11 year-over-year. A big piece of that is refinancing our debt into a higher rate environment. We have $1.2 billion of debt coming due this year, and you call it in the mid-3s kind of range from having issued that debt quite -- years ago. So refinancing that in the current environment is dilutive. The volume of debt also, we have a year-over-year impact of the ELP transaction midyear last year, so we have effectively, the first half of that, that we're lapping in '24. So together, those 2 things describe the increase year-on-year on interest expense. I'd note we've included interest expense guidance, which is new to us, in order to try to help analysts' model that because I know it can be tricky, but those are the drivers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with Wedbush.\nRichard Anderson: Speaking of Kindred, but also Brookdale and Santerre process, if I can call it that. What are the chances that there could be some activity in 2024 to sort of reset the situation in that -- those portfolios, such that maybe there will be a temporary drag to deal with this year, so that when 2025 does come around, you've kind of addressed that and you won't have sort of this other issue to deal with in 2025, sort of make next year more of a cleaner picture. Are you thinking that you could do some -- have some activity this year preemptively on any one of those 3 buckets?\nJustin Hutchens: Rich, it's Justin. Let me start with Brookdale. So Brookdale has the opportunity to extend the lease at the end of this year, to let us know, and then the lease will run through the end of '25, and we have a new lease starting in '26. That portfolio is performing well. As I said, continued improvement, has good coverage, is growing coverage and resides in markets that we think have around 1,000 basis points of upside over the next few years. So we're in a strong position there. We'll see how that plays out, but it's a good situation.\nRichard Anderson: The Santerre situation, understanding you're kind of working through, but maybe there's some incremental work that has yet to be done. There's asset sales, there's things that you don't want long term. I'm just curious if there could be some preemptive work there as well?\nDebra Cafaro: Yes. I mean, as you know, kind of Santerre's gotten off to a favorable start, and we are -- we've already sold some assets at favorable pricing. I think we'll continue to pick our spots and be opportunistic on that. And then in terms of Kindred, I think we'd be able to certainly say that we'll have more visibility this year, whether or not the financial impact of this year or next year. Right now, we're thinking about next year. But that -- it's too early to say, really, what form that would take, but we have the benefit of a lease that runs into May of 2025, and that's a valuable asset.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jim Kammert with Evercore ISI.\nJames Kammert: Kind of just building actually on Rich's question. In a hypothetical, if Kindred were to not extend come this May, what would the process be and how much has Ventas investigated sort of alternative operators? And what maybe cost might be associated with that, or any transitional worries that might arise as you kind of shift the portfolio again? Hypothetical, just trying to better understand.\nDebra Cafaro: Jim, yes, it's kind of funny to be talking about this 25 years after I started, because this is what I was doing 25 years ago. But look, we are really well prepared. We're experienced on this. We have lots of plans and subplans, I would say. It's only really 23 assets in total, so I think that, that makes it kind of manageable. And of course, we will try to optimize the NOI of the assets. And it's a puzzle, and we have lots of tools that we've used before, and that's really what we're focused on. And I can assure you there are -- will always be kind of alternatives that we have and are ready to execute in this scenario.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Griffin with Citigroup.\nNicholas Joseph: It's Nick Joseph here with Michael. Just on the acquisition opportunities that you're seeing, you mentioned mid-teens IRRs, but just curious what the going-in yields are. I'm sure it's a range, but just kind of what you're thinking there? What the discount to replacement costs you're seeing on opportunities is? And then just what the funding plans would be for any external growth in 2024?\nJustin Hutchens: It's Justin. I'll start with the first part. We are seeing good opportunities in senior housing. We do target opportunities that have a discount to replacement costs. We're seeing around 20% to 30% discounts in the pipeline. In terms of return expectations, you mentioned the low to mid-teens in unlevered IRRs. We also -- obviously, there is -- the cap rate is a component of that. We tend to see around 7% right now, and there's a little bit of movement up and down, depending on the growth of the asset. So the goal is to be neutral or accretive year 1 and then have growth in the asset, which is supported by this strong and growing demand in the senior housing sector.\nRobert Probst: And maybe I'll touch on the funding question. Given those returns, Nick, we think that can be an attractive proposition for shareholders. And indeed, we've built into our guidance about $350 million of investments and on balance sheet financing in order to do that. And we think we can achieve both attractive investment alternatives and delevering in the process with those types of investments.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.\nJuan Sanabria: Just a question on, I guess, the other line items below kind of interest expense. Anything unusual between '23 or '24 or any changes, I should say, that we should be thinking about? I think about some of the Brookdale noncash amortization that's running through the numbers that presumably goes away on that lease, the initial lease, matures, correct me if I'm wrong. But just trying to see if there's any kind of unusual items from the fourth quarter of '23 that maybe you're skewing results relative to expectations from the Street. And if you wouldn't mind commenting on expectations on FAD. You gave normalized FFO, but any piece parts on the FAD would be great as well.\nRobert Probst: Sure. So in terms of, as you say, below the line items, first thing to say is the guidance doesn't assume any changes in the '25 lease situation. And so it's business as usual in '24 in our guidance assumptions. You're correct to say there is Brookdale amortization from the consideration we received in that restructure a number of years ago being amortized. If and to the extent we have a restructured deal there, that would be affected, but ultimately, it could be an outcome that depends on the deal itself. In terms of FAD, I would say FAD growth -- this is operating FAD, I would expect to grow in line with FFO year-over-year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.\nJoshua Dennerlein: I was just looking at the presentation you put out, and I saw on Slide 40, it looks like there's a footnote related to class action litigation in your SHOP segment. Can you go over just what that's related to?\nDebra Cafaro: Josh, sure.\nJustin Hutchens: Yes, it's Justin. So -- the -- it's an issue in California, and the adjustment relates primarily to the class action suit, involves some of our SHOP properties. We don't really view suits like this to be as ordinary course in our business. They do come up from time to time, especially in California. Because they don't relate to the core business performance, we think adjustment to the FFO is appropriate.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.\nMichael Mueller: Looking at the SHOP occupancy guide for this year. Can you just talk a little bit about the, I guess, the cadence of occupancy? Does it assume more of a normal year for sort of seasonality? Or how does it compare to what you experienced in '23?\nJustin Hutchens: It's Justin. So great question. I appreciate it. There's a Page 8 in the deck for anyone that has that in front of them. It helps to articulate this. So we had 120 basis points of occupancy growth year-over-year in 2023. We had acceleration of move-ins and occupancy in the third quarter, which led to solid growth in the fourth quarter, which was at 170 basis points year-over-year in January. We're already starting at 200 basis points of occupancy year-over-year, and we are seeing better than typical seasonal results ending the fourth quarter and starting the year so far, which is really encouraging and supportive of the 250 basis points at the midpoint that we included in our SHOP guidance. So we have a good run of occupancy growth, and also, move-ins have been really strong as well. I mentioned that they're around 110% versus prior year in the fourth quarter. We've continued to see a strong move-ins at the beginning of the year as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Stroyeck with Green Street.\nMichael Stroyeck: So going back to Kindred, and I'll try to ask this in a slightly different way. I know it's too early to say what the ultimate outcome will be, but hypothetically, if you did go down this path, as of today, what magnitude of rent reductions do you believe will be required in the near future in order to return those rents to a sustainable level, either for Kindred or the next operator assuming operations on those properties?\nDebra Cafaro: Michael, remember, we own the assets and we own the EBITDAR in those assets. And that's an important -- that's very important. And again, it's too early to say. We have favorable trends in the Brookdale situation, and in Kindred, we hope to have favorable trends as you look out to 2025. So there's a lot more that goes into it when you think about what the outcome is going to be, and we'll be happy to share more with you as the facts develop.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Connor Siversky with Wells Fargo.\nConnor Siversky: I want to jump back to a conversation on the Q2 '23 earnings call in regard to the equitized loan portfolio, specifically the outpatient medical assets. You outlined that you were going to put in place a capital improvement plan to bring occupancy back into those assets. So I'm wondering, at this time, if you could quantify what that capital improvement plan looks like, what occupancy expectations are for those outpatient medical assets, and then what a return profile could look like for that capital improvement plan?\nDebra Cafaro: I mean I think the key point, the topic sentence, and we'll get to the answer is, those assets overlap with our own portfolio in many respects. Our portfolio is over 90% occupied and managed by Pete and the team very effectively. This was under 80%. So there was -- there is and was significant occupancy upside as we get in there and self-manage those assets. And now I'll turn it over to the team to take your questions.\nPeter Bulgarelli: Yes. Thanks, Connor. This is Pete. Yes, we're excited for the ELP portfolio. It gives us, I think, over the long haul, upside. We've been extremely active in absorbing that portfolio and renewing that portfolio. We've transitioned 44 of our locations to Lillibridge management using the Lillibridge playbook. We've surveyed all the tenants. We have specific asset plans for each of the buildings. And we're really happy with the results so far. We have increased occupancy by about 1%, and we're also well above plan in our underwriting. So as it relates to how we look forward on this portfolio, we expect in '24 to have about a 3% increase in occupancy. And so we're very happy about that. And I wouldn't -- we will do some upgrades in the common areas and so forth. And you've seen some of the ICE capital in the supplemental here. We'll do a bit more of that. And we'll have kind of normal as-you-go tenant improvements and commissions. So I don't expect anything extraordinary out of the capital being used for that -- for the ELP portfolio.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho.\nVikram Malhotra: Just two quick, I guess, senior housing questions, if you can indulge me. First, just the comments about exit into '24 looking better, or I guess, acceleration. I'm wondering kind of what gives you that confidence, because I may be wrong, but I think the occupancy comp will get harder and the expense comp also gets harder. So I'm just wondering what gives you the confidence of acceleration, number one. And just number two, on senior housing. You guys had a great investment in Canada a while ago through the Maurice investment. I'm just wondering, though, the portfolio is now generating like 4% same-store arguably into next year. Is there an opportunity in your minds to recycle that into, say, maybe a U.S. asset where you could get higher growth?\nJustin Hutchens: It's Justin. So let me start with the jumping off point at the end of the year. So what's happening this year is we have significant occupancy growth in our plan. Occupancy, as you know, a lot of it comes from the key selling season. We're off to a pretty good start because we're already outperforming just typical seasonality. But what's most important is what's coming next, which is that kind of May to September period, which provides occupancy growth. Typically, we see the numbers that the demand is there, we see in the underlying performance that we're executing on the demand. So that gives us the confidence that we'll be able to grow occupancy. And then when you have the build during the year, clearly, that you end up ending the year at a higher NOI. And that NOI, the point we're making is it's a good launching pad for 2025 growth when you run that through and then you start adding more occupancy on top of that. The other thing that happens is margin expansion. We're in a place right now, we're in the -- you mentioned Canada. It's 95% occupied. U.S. is around 80%, 81%. Well a lot -- most of our occupancy growth is in the U.S. And when you -- we're just at the early stage of that occupancy band where margin starts to grow, and we're at an inflection point, and so we're also looking forward to next year as well as we -- as occupancy grows, the operating leverage goes up, margin expansion could or should be more in '25. So we think there's good support for this growth, and we're executing, and it's not -- it should help the '25 number, and then the demand is such that the runway should be even longer. So we like what we're seeing there. In terms of Canada, we do have a really, really good portfolio there. And I'm really glad you asked about it because it is a core light asset, very high quality physically. It's very high quality in terms of execution, in occupancy and margin. It's been a consistent performer for us. There's good demand in these markets. It's a great operator. Primarily most of the NOI is Le Groupe Maurice in Canada. And we look forward to continuing with that, and with that relationship and the compounding growth that it can offer and also opportunities to expand that footprint over time.\nDebra Cafaro: And also, as we do new investments, obviously, the percentage that, that represents of the overall SHOP portfolio and Ventas will shrink because the denominator will be growing and emphasized on U.S. senior housing. So that will change the impact as well.\nJustin Hutchens: Yes. And actually, I'll take this opportunity to make one of my other favorite points. And that is that the U.S., okay, that grew 24.5% in -- for us last year in our same-store pool, and we're expecting mid- to high teens NOI growth in '24. That's the growth engine. And that's comparable to the other portfolio. They have similar upside and less stability, where Canada is what it is. It's high quality and stable. But when you blend the 2, obviously, it hampers our growth a little bit, and it's being hampered by a very high-quality, high-performing portfolio, and the U.S. is growing as well as anyone.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Great. It sounds like Kindred's a no-go here, but at least after all these years, I guess it's only 5% of NOI for this master lease and not 50% plus. So, Debbie...\nDebra Cafaro: '99.\nAustin Wurschmidt: That's even before my time. But you did highlight -- I want to hit on the acquisition piece a little bit. And you highlighted $300 million of investments you have confidence in completing in the first half of this year. And there's a chance it sounds like maybe that could increase, given the target-rich environment that you kind of laid out. I guess can you or Bob discuss about the funding plans for those assets and maybe where equity fits into the plan? And I'm just curious, given that line of sight, why not issue under the ATM late last year given kind of the favorable move in the stock and more attractive cost of capital you had?\nDebra Cafaro: Well stated. I think, Bob, Bob, do you want to talk about funding?\nRobert Probst: Yes. As I mentioned earlier, look, the returns on these investments that we're seeing make this attractive from day 1 to our shareholders in our view, even at the current cost of capital when you look at the numbers. And we started this discussion with investors really late last year at NAREIT where cap rates have changed. And I think the consensus view at that point continues to be that's a good investment. And so effectively, we've built that into our guidance in this $350 million. And I mentioned the opportunity of over-equitizing alongside that, that is also assumed. That being said, in a very disciplined way. And I think that's the important part of the narrative. And so there is some -- there are assumptions around that, but we will be very prudent in all, always, a function of the market.\nDebra Cafaro: And I'm glad you asked it, too, because I think with Ventas really giving FFO guidance into '24, that really is in the top 10 of all REITs, that we are aiming to have an improved multiple that benefits and reward shareholders, and it represents a cost of capital that could be very effective as we build on the organic growth story and layer on attractive investments focused on senior housing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.\nRonald Kamdem: Just a two-parter for me. Just was looking through the deck. One, I realize that the slide on the NOI recovery opportunity, it looks like you guys removed it, which was a pretty helpful slide. So I guess the question #1 would be that conviction of getting back to $1 billion. Presumably the occupancy still feels pretty good with the guidance, but has anything changed about either the views on the margins or the occupancy and the recovery story to sort of pull that slide? And then question #2, sort of part 2, is really, it's a sources and uses question because I don't see the redevelopment CapEx or the asset dispositions guidance that you guys provided last time. So could you be a little bit more specific? We know you're going to do $300 million plus or minus of acquisitions, but maybe a little bit more specificity about how you're thinking about redevelopment CapEx, dispositions and even an equity issuance.\nDebra Cafaro: I liked that Slide, too, but I'll give it to Justin to answer.\nJustin Hutchens: Yes. I like it. But what really dawned on us, quite frankly, is it's not high enough. It really is -- we're focused on 80% occupancy and getting back to prepandemic cash flows, and we're kind of moving beyond that because we see the ceiling can be a lot higher and the demand backdrop supports that. So we don't want to put a ceiling on the opportunity. We think it's more over time. We've got a good run rate established. We're putting up $100 million -- around $100 million a little bit more per year in the SHOP portfolio. So we decided to move on, try to focus on looking forward. One of the things that, before I'll hand over to Bob, I just want to mention on the -- you mentioned CapEx projects. I just want to throw in something on the senior housing. We did complete 167 projects by the end of '23, and that those started in October of '22. And so we had a really strong run of getting our portfolio refreshed. We think there's about another 70 that completes by this May for the key selling season and then another group of 82 or so, hopefully, by the beginning of next year's key selling season. So we're well past halfway done and like the opportunity to do more and increase our opportunity to be competitive.\nRobert Probst: That's a good segue to some of the assumptions you asked about in our guidance, especially redev. Let's start there. So we said our #1 use of cash is investing behind senior housing redevs. You're seeing the growth that's coming from that in the attractive returns. So last year was $210 million round numbers of redev. Because the projects are starting to come down, and I'd mentioned in previous calls we're going to normalize over time, we would expect some reduction in that redev spend this year. I'll call it $175 million in 2024. And again, that should normalize over time as these projects complete. Other assumptions, capital recycling, we are assuming, after $450 million of dispositions last year, our current guidance is $100 million. So a significant reduction, and those are very focused on some senior housing noncore assets in that $100 million. And then finally, on the equity assumption. To just underscore what I mentioned earlier, we do have, in our assumption, both investments and the funding of that. The share count is listed in the assumptions that comes out of that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with Wedbush.\nRichard Anderson: Sorry to keep things going, but what the heck. I want to ask perhaps an unanswerable question. So you guys lead the league in kind of normalization between NAREIT FFO and normalized FFO. There's a lot in there. You have $0.13 of normalizing factors in your guidance. To what degree can we -- does that offer an opportunity for -- I don't know, if something were to materialize during the year, it sort of allows you to maintain your guidance? I'm -- there's a lot of movement in your presentation that's really difficult to model, let's put it that way. Is there a way to either tighten it up, or does it offer opportunity to say, well, we can do something with Kindred this year, and we're not going to have to change our guidance in the process. I know, unanswerable, but I do feel like it's way more complicated than perhaps it needs to be, is the main point.\nDebra Cafaro: I mean one part I would comment on is that we are very disciplined about it and don't lead the league in any -- and this is an area we don't want to lead the league in, and we can talk about that further. It's a very defined category, and we use it as such. So, Bob...\nRobert Probst: [Indiscernible] measuring between NAREIT FFO and normalized FFO across peers, I would suggest to you that they're very similar in terms of our numbers. And by benchmark, well, I would [indiscernible]...\nDebra Cafaro: You would say benchmark [indiscernible].\nRichard Anderson: How often do you hit that number? How confident you are to hit that $0.13 number, I guess, is the question. How predictable is that to you?\nRobert Probst: Which $0.13 number, Rich?\nRichard Anderson: The [indiscernible] between NAREIT and normalized FFO.\nRobert Probst: I see. Some of those are market-based, importantly. I'll just highlight one, which is Brookdale warrants. We have $16 million of Brookdale warrants, and that is mark-to-market every quarter, and there's a lot of volatility in that. And that flows through between NAREIT and FFO normalized [indiscernible] adjustment, and that's impossible to predict. But we think in terms of portraying the underlying performance of the business is absolutely the right adjustment to make it normalized. So that's a good example.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho.\nVikram Malhotra: I just wanted to clarify the legal costs that were normalized. Is that -- are those just legal fees, but there's -- is there like an associated potential fine that Ventas may be liable for, and is this hard to know? Or is that just a one-off and we won't hear more about it from here on? Number one. And number two, if you could just clarify the $300 million acquisition, how should we think about accretion going forward in terms of like potential cap rates and how you see that flowing to the bottom line?\nDebra Cafaro: Okay. It's a typical litigation reserve and it affects us and other REITs. And in terms of the acquisition investment opportunities, I think, again, looking at the pipeline that we have, I think Justin talked about 7% plus or minus going in cap rates, which is affected by the growth rate, leading to low to mid-teens IRRs, which, depending on how we fund, will be -- that's how the accretion, obviously, in year 1 will be determined. We're not counting on a lot of accretion into year 1, but rather enhancing our growth rate over time. And we think that those IRRs are attractive, and we want to expand our presence in U.S. senior housing.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.\nJuan Sanabria: Just a quick follow-up for me, focused around dispositions again. I was curious if you have a bit of a background on the 2 R&I assets disposed of in the fourth quarter as to why you chose to sell those. The cap rates looked a little elevated from the outsider's perspective. And then just curious if -- what your latest thoughts on the Santerre SNF business is? Are you kind of happy to hold what's remaining there, which is still fairly substantial, I guess, and comfortable with that SNF exposure? Or how are you thinking about that?\nDebra Cafaro: Yes. So on the latter part, as I mentioned, I think we'll be -- we'll pick our spots on disposing of certain of the Santerre assets over time. Including the SNF. We've been -- we've sold some at very attractive per bed valuations, and we're happy with that. And on the -- what was the -- the others were embedded purchase options that we got in the acquired portfolio with universities who have a better cost of capital than God. So they chose to exercise them. So that's all that was.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the call over to Debra Cafaro, Chairman and CEO, for closing remarks.\nDebra Cafaro: All right. Mandeep, thank you very much, and I want to thank everyone for joining us today. It's a pleasure to speak with you and have a chance to answer your questions. We really appreciate your interest in Ventas, your support of Ventas, and we look forward to seeing you again soon.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Robert Probst",
            "content": "Thank you, Justin. I'm going to share some highlights on our '23 performance, touch on our balance sheet and close with our 2024 outlook. I'll start by saying we are pleased with all we accomplished in 2023. We finished the year strong, with reported normalized FFO per share of $0.76 in the fourth quarter, a 7% increase versus the prior year, adjusting for the promote received in Q4 of '22. For the fiscal year '23, we delivered normalized FFO of $2.99 per share or over 5% growth year-over-year when adjusting the prior year for unusual items. The multiyear senior housing growth trajectory was in full display in '23, with SHOP total NOI increasing year-over-year by approximately $100 million. We also reported total company same-store cash NOI growth of over 8% year-over-year, which is one of the fastest organic growth rates in our company's history. Our 2023 normalized FFO of $2.99 per share was at the high end of our previous $2.96 to $2.99 guidance range, and included $0.01 per share cybersecurity revenue impact in the fourth quarter in our Ardent OpCo investment that was not contemplated in prior guidance. Pete Bulgarelli and our outpatient medical and research team delivered another year of continuous compounding growth, with same-store cash NOI increasing nearly 3% in 2023, at the high end of our guidance range. Continued strong retention and leasing activity in outpatient medical led the way. A key driver of that result is the remarkable record of tenant satisfaction in Ventas' Lillibridge property management business, which notched its fourth consecutive year of top quartile tenant satisfaction. In 2023, Lillibridge reached the 97th percentile for overall tenant satisfaction, placing it among the top 5 property managers. I'd also like to share a few comments on our balance sheet. Throughout 2023, we used our scale and access to diverse sources of capital, raised over $4 million of attractively-priced capital across multiple markets and geographies. This capital raising in 2023 in part refunded 2024 maturing debt at attractive rates. As a result, we had a robust year-end 2023 liquidity position of $3.2 billion and have relatively modest 2024 maturing debt of $800 million net of cash on hand. The attractive NOI and EBITDA growth in our SHOP business also improved Ventas' net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 6.9x in the fourth quarter, a trend we expect to continue in 2024 and beyond led by the multiyear SHOP NOI growth opportunity. Let's conclude with our full year 2024 outlook. Because our asset classes are benefiting from powerful demographic demand, we are pleased to project another consecutive year of normalized FFO growth in the mid-single digits, and the third consecutive year of same-store SHOP cash NOI growth in the double digits. For 2024, we expect net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.06 per share at the midpoint. Our 2024 normalized FFO guidance range is $3.07 to $3.18 or $3.13 per share at the midpoint, which represents 5% year-over-year growth. The $0.14 FFO per share increase year-over-year can be bridged by 3 items. We expect a $0.28 per share contribution from outstanding year-over-year property growth led again by SHOP, which is expected to grow NOI by over $100 million for the second consecutive year. This property growth is partially offset by an $0.11 per share increase in higher interest expense and the $0.03 impact of 2023 capital recycling. In terms of same-store, we expect our total company same-store cash NOI to grow between 5% and 7.5% in 2024 led by SHOP same-store cash NOI growth of 10% to 15%. Our guidance also includes new senior housing investments of 350 million, which Justin mentioned in his remarks. The low and high end of our FFO guidance range are largely described by our property NOI expectations and potential changes in interest rates. A final note on phasing. We expect same-store cash NOI and normalized FFO year-over-year growth to ramp through the year, driven by higher interest expense in the first half of '24 versus '23, and the occupancy acceleration in the key selling season in SHOP, resulting in an exit run rate that should enable attractive SHOP growth '25 and beyond. A more fulsome discussion of our '24 guidance assumptions can be found in the earnings and outlook presentation posted to our website. To close, the entire Ventas team is ready to win together with all of our stakeholders. And that concludes our prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions]. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator. Sure, Nick. Yes. So I mentioned the $0.11 year-over-year. A big piece of that is refinancing our debt into a higher rate environment. We have $1.2 billion of debt coming due this year, and you call it in the mid-3s kind of range from having issued that debt quite -- years ago. So refinancing that in the current environment is dilutive. The volume of debt also, we have a year-over-year impact of the ELP transaction midyear last year, so we have effectively, the first half of that, that we're lapping in '24. So together, those 2 things describe the increase year-on-year on interest expense. I'd note we've included interest expense guidance, which is new to us, in order to try to help analysts' model that because I know it can be tricky, but those are the drivers. And maybe I'll touch on the funding question. Given those returns, Nick, we think that can be an attractive proposition for shareholders. And indeed, we've built into our guidance about $350 million of investments and on balance sheet financing in order to do that. And we think we can achieve both attractive investment alternatives and delevering in the process with those types of investments. Sure. So in terms of, as you say, below the line items, first thing to say is the guidance doesn't assume any changes in the '25 lease situation. And so it's business as usual in '24 in our guidance assumptions. You're correct to say there is Brookdale amortization from the consideration we received in that restructure a number of years ago being amortized. If and to the extent we have a restructured deal there, that would be affected, but ultimately, it could be an outcome that depends on the deal itself. In terms of FAD, I would say FAD growth -- this is operating FAD, I would expect to grow in line with FFO year-over-year. Yes. As I mentioned earlier, look, the returns on these investments that we're seeing make this attractive from day 1 to our shareholders in our view, even at the current cost of capital when you look at the numbers. And we started this discussion with investors really late last year at NAREIT where cap rates have changed. And I think the consensus view at that point continues to be that's a good investment. And so effectively, we've built that into our guidance in this $350 million. And I mentioned the opportunity of over-equitizing alongside that, that is also assumed. That being said, in a very disciplined way. And I think that's the important part of the narrative. And so there is some -- there are assumptions around that, but we will be very prudent in all, always, a function of the market. That's a good segue to some of the assumptions you asked about in our guidance, especially redev. Let's start there. So we said our #1 use of cash is investing behind senior housing redevs. You're seeing the growth that's coming from that in the attractive returns. So last year was $210 million round numbers of redev. Because the projects are starting to come down, and I'd mentioned in previous calls we're going to normalize over time, we would expect some reduction in that redev spend this year. I'll call it $175 million in 2024. And again, that should normalize over time as these projects complete. Other assumptions, capital recycling, we are assuming, after $450 million of dispositions last year, our current guidance is $100 million. So a significant reduction, and those are very focused on some senior housing noncore assets in that $100 million. And then finally, on the equity assumption. To just underscore what I mentioned earlier, we do have, in our assumption, both investments and the funding of that. The share count is listed in the assumptions that comes out of that. [Indiscernible] measuring between NAREIT FFO and normalized FFO across peers, I would suggest to you that they're very similar in terms of our numbers. And by benchmark, well, I would [indiscernible]... Which $0.13 number, Rich? I see. Some of those are market-based, importantly. I'll just highlight one, which is Brookdale warrants. We have $16 million of Brookdale warrants, and that is mark-to-market every quarter, and there's a lot of volatility in that. And that flows through between NAREIT and FFO normalized [indiscernible] adjustment, and that's impossible to predict. But we think in terms of portraying the underlying performance of the business is absolutely the right adjustment to make it normalized. So that's a good example."

            "name": "Justin Hutchens",
            "content": "Thank you, Debbie. I'm pleased to say our SHOP portfolio delivered double-digit same-store cash NOI growth for the sixth quarter in a row. The same-store NOI growth for the year was led by our U.S. communities with 24.5% growth complemented by our high-quality Canadian portfolio, which is over 95% occupied and continues to deliver a valuable and stable cash flow. Total SHOP same-store cash NOI growth was 18.3%, which was above same-store guidance midpoint expectations. We are happy with this attractive growth and strong finish to the year. Double clicking on the year, the results were good. Our same-store SHOP communities outperformed our expectations across all key metrics, including occupancy, REVPOR, OpEx and margin expansion. Full year same-store SHOP occupancy grew by 120 basis points. The U.S. saw 140 basis points of occupancy gains, and Canada, although already highly occupied, grew by 90 basis points. Demand strength across geographies and asset types led to accelerating occupancy growth this quarter, with 170 basis points of year-over-year growth. Furthermore, we saw 110 basis points of average sequential occupancy growth from the third quarter to the fourth. U.S. SHOP occupancy growth was supported primarily by strong demand, with move-ins that were 109% of prior year levels in the fourth quarter. REVPOR grew over 6% for the year. contributing to revenue growth of almost 8%. As a reminder, REVPOR would have been 40 basis points higher in 2023 and 130 basis points on the fourth quarter if adjusted for the Sunrise special assessment that occurred in 2022. OpExPOR performed well and was led by the U.S. with 2% growth year-over-year and 2.6% overall. Looking forward to 2024, we are excited to continue on our multiyear growth trajectory as we are expecting our third consecutive year of double-digit NOI growth in our same-store SHOP portfolio. Momentum ramped at the end of 2023, with fourth quarter occupancy accelerating, while strong pricing and higher move-ins fuel better than typical seasonal results and help 2024 to get off to a strong start. Once again, we are expecting the U.S. to be the growth engine with continued accelerating occupancy performance, with over 300 basis points growth, and expected to drive NOI growth in the mid- to high teens year-over-year. The overall SHOP portfolio is expected to grow NOI 10%, 15%.  The growing demand at our doorstep continues to support strong price and volume growth and serves a testament to the high quality and care and services and value proposition our communities provide to seniors and their families. The key assumptions that drive the midpoint of our range are average occupancy growth of about 250 basis points, REVPOR growth of about 5%, which puts the total revenue growth around 8%. January occupancy is already off to a strong start, delivering 200 basis points of occupancy growth year-over-year. This performance demonstrates solid execution by our operators and continued demand. We expect the performance throughout the year to be bolstered by newly renovated properties and Ventas OI initiatives to drive a strong key selling season. 2024 OpExPOR is expected to grow in line with normal inflation. We structured our business around rate growth and occupancy growth. We are entering the sweet spot where price and occupancy are moving together to drive revenue. Margin expansion will follow as higher occupancy creates operating leverage. We have struck a balance where they are moving together, and we anticipate further margin expansion over time as higher occupancy creates operating leverage. We are capitalizing our active asset management playbook and our operators' execution, which delivered strong momentum to finish 2023 and will propel us into 2024. We expect this to build sequentially throughout the year, which means we are poised for strong year-end NOI that should propel us even further in 2025 and beyond. We are delivering on the organic senior housing growth, which is the part 1 of our strategy and my #1 priority. Part 2 is expanding our footprint. In addition to the success we are having in our existing portfolio, we look forward to capturing value-creating external growth focused on senior housing. A key tenet of our investment strategy is our right market, right asset, right operator approach. We're bringing OI tools to investment activities to help the selection process. Our top investment priorities continue to be NOI-generating CapEx in our existing real estate and senior housing acquisitions. Sellers are motivated to transact, creating numerous actionable deals. We are targeting opportunities with low to mid-teen unlevered IRRs. We seek senior housing communities that are located in submarkets with compelling supply-demand profile, strong affordability and meaningful expected net absorption projections. We are primarily expanding with existing partners with proven performance for Ventas, and plan to increase our footprint in the fast-growing IL, AL memory care combination communities. Our pipeline is growing, as we have several interesting potential investments in our sites. Our team is actively working on transactions exceeding 300 million that meet our criteria, and I look forward to adding to that as the year progresses. In summary, demand is at our doorstep. We are pleased to see the SHOP growth engine continue to be led by the U.S. and complemented by the low beta, high quality and highly valuable Canada portfolio with compounding growth. 2024 is rich with opportunities through organic growth and external acquisitions. The growth on both fronts throughout the year should support value creation in 2025 and beyond. I'm looking forward to the exciting year ahead. Bob? Rich, it's Justin. Let me start with Brookdale. So Brookdale has the opportunity to extend the lease at the end of this year, to let us know, and then the lease will run through the end of '25, and we have a new lease starting in '26. That portfolio is performing well. As I said, continued improvement, has good coverage, is growing coverage and resides in markets that we think have around 1,000 basis points of upside over the next few years. So we're in a strong position there. We'll see how that plays out, but it's a good situation. It's Justin. I'll start with the first part. We are seeing good opportunities in senior housing. We do target opportunities that have a discount to replacement costs. We're seeing around 20% to 30% discounts in the pipeline. In terms of return expectations, you mentioned the low to mid-teens in unlevered IRRs. We also -- obviously, there is -- the cap rate is a component of that. We tend to see around 7% right now, and there's a little bit of movement up and down, depending on the growth of the asset. So the goal is to be neutral or accretive year 1 and then have growth in the asset, which is supported by this strong and growing demand in the senior housing sector. Yes, it's Justin. So -- the -- it's an issue in California, and the adjustment relates primarily to the class action suit, involves some of our SHOP properties. We don't really view suits like this to be as ordinary course in our business. They do come up from time to time, especially in California. Because they don't relate to the core business performance, we think adjustment to the FFO is appropriate. It's Justin. So great question. I appreciate it. There's a Page 8 in the deck for anyone that has that in front of them. It helps to articulate this. So we had 120 basis points of occupancy growth year-over-year in 2023. We had acceleration of move-ins and occupancy in the third quarter, which led to solid growth in the fourth quarter, which was at 170 basis points year-over-year in January. We're already starting at 200 basis points of occupancy year-over-year, and we are seeing better than typical seasonal results ending the fourth quarter and starting the year so far, which is really encouraging and supportive of the 250 basis points at the midpoint that we included in our SHOP guidance. So we have a good run of occupancy growth, and also, move-ins have been really strong as well. I mentioned that they're around 110% versus prior year in the fourth quarter. We've continued to see a strong move-ins at the beginning of the year as well. It's Justin. So let me start with the jumping off point at the end of the year. So what's happening this year is we have significant occupancy growth in our plan. Occupancy, as you know, a lot of it comes from the key selling season. We're off to a pretty good start because we're already outperforming just typical seasonality. But what's most important is what's coming next, which is that kind of May to September period, which provides occupancy growth. Typically, we see the numbers that the demand is there, we see in the underlying performance that we're executing on the demand. So that gives us the confidence that we'll be able to grow occupancy. And then when you have the build during the year, clearly, that you end up ending the year at a higher NOI. And that NOI, the point we're making is it's a good launching pad for 2025 growth when you run that through and then you start adding more occupancy on top of that. The other thing that happens is margin expansion. We're in a place right now, we're in the -- you mentioned Canada. It's 95% occupied. U.S. is around 80%, 81%. Well a lot -- most of our occupancy growth is in the U.S. And when you -- we're just at the early stage of that occupancy band where margin starts to grow, and we're at an inflection point, and so we're also looking forward to next year as well as we -- as occupancy grows, the operating leverage goes up, margin expansion could or should be more in '25. So we think there's good support for this growth, and we're executing, and it's not -- it should help the '25 number, and then the demand is such that the runway should be even longer. So we like what we're seeing there. In terms of Canada, we do have a really, really good portfolio there. And I'm really glad you asked about it because it is a core light asset, very high quality physically. It's very high quality in terms of execution, in occupancy and margin. It's been a consistent performer for us. There's good demand in these markets. It's a great operator. Primarily most of the NOI is Le Groupe Maurice in Canada. And we look forward to continuing with that, and with that relationship and the compounding growth that it can offer and also opportunities to expand that footprint over time. Yes. And actually, I'll take this opportunity to make one of my other favorite points. And that is that the U.S., okay, that grew 24.5% in -- for us last year in our same-store pool, and we're expecting mid- to high teens NOI growth in '24. That's the growth engine. And that's comparable to the other portfolio. They have similar upside and less stability, where Canada is what it is. It's high quality and stable. But when you blend the 2, obviously, it hampers our growth a little bit, and it's being hampered by a very high-quality, high-performing portfolio, and the U.S. is growing as well as anyone. Yes. I like it. But what really dawned on us, quite frankly, is it's not high enough. It really is -- we're focused on 80% occupancy and getting back to prepandemic cash flows, and we're kind of moving beyond that because we see the ceiling can be a lot higher and the demand backdrop supports that. So we don't want to put a ceiling on the opportunity. We think it's more over time. We've got a good run rate established. We're putting up $100 million -- around $100 million a little bit more per year in the SHOP portfolio. So we decided to move on, try to focus on looking forward. One of the things that, before I'll hand over to Bob, I just want to mention on the -- you mentioned CapEx projects. I just want to throw in something on the senior housing. We did complete 167 projects by the end of '23, and that those started in October of '22. And so we had a really strong run of getting our portfolio refreshed. We think there's about another 70 that completes by this May for the key selling season and then another group of 82 or so, hopefully, by the beginning of next year's key selling season. So we're well past halfway done and like the opportunity to do more and increase our opportunity to be competitive."

            "content": "Thank you, BJ. I want to welcome all of our shareholders and other participants to the Ventas Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Call. I'm pleased to share our strong results for 2023, discuss our advantaged position across commercial real estate, driven by large and growing demographic demand and introduce full year 2024 guidance as the senior housing multiyear growth opportunity continues to power our expectations. Let's start with results. We reported favorable results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. We produced full year normalized FFO of $2.99 per share, representing over 5% year-over-year growth, above the midpoint of the guidance range we initiated in February. As anticipated, our results were fueled by unprecedented organic property growth in our SHOP portfolio, which grew same-store cash NOI over 18% last year. Enterprise same-store cash NOI growth was supported by compounding contributions from our outpatient medical and research and triple net lease portfolios. We finished the year on a high note in the fourth quarter, delivering $0.76 of normalized FFO, representing 7% year-over-year growth and reporting accelerating same-store SHOP occupancy. During 2023, the Ventas team accomplished a great deal together. We raised over $4 billion in attractively priced capital, took effective portfolio actions, invested CapEx in our assets to position our portfolio to capture demand in strong markets, made meaningful progress toward our ambitious ESG goals, successfully integrated a $1.6 billion portfolio and expanded our VIM business. As a result, we delivered over 15% 1-year total return to shareholders, posted 2 years in a row of TSR outperformance versus the health care REIT and broader REIT indices and achieved upper quartile performance for the last 3 years among health care REITs. We still have more work to do. We are focused on driving total returns for our shareholders. As durable demand fuels the multiyear growth opportunity in senior housing, we believe Ventas offers an attractive combination of growth and value. Let me provide a few reasons we believe we are uniquely positioned to create value. We entered 2024 with momentum. Because our asset classes are benefiting from demographic demand that is strong and getting stronger, we are pleased to project another consecutive year of normalized FFO growth in the mid-single digits and the third consecutive year of same-store SHOP cash NOI growth in the double digits. Notably, our projected 2024 normalized FFO growth of 5% per share puts us in the top 20% of all REITs that have issued guidance to date. In 2024, we expect to benefit from steady growth from our outpatient medical research and triple net lease portfolios. As we look into 2025, we have 2 large lease renewals, one with Brookdale in senior housing and another with Kindred for a portion of our LTACs. In Brookdale's case, our communities are enjoying positive operating trends, and they have significant net absorption potential. In Kindred's situation, rent coverage remains challenged, and it's too early to say what the ultimate outcome in 2025 will be. Kindred remains focused on performance improvements that could benefit 2024 and 2025 financial results. In all cases, we are fully prepared to maximize NOI over time. In SHOP, January is already starting positively, with 200 basis points in year-over-year same-store occupancy growth. In 2024, we expect year-over-year normalized FFO and SHOP same-store cash NOI growth to accelerate in the second half, with a SHOP NOI exit run rate that should support continued SHOP growth in 2025 and beyond. This highly positive context is supportive of growing our senior housing presence through both organic and inorganic growth. In pursuit of delivering consistent superior performance, our strategy is to, one, continue to deliver compelling profitable organic growth in senior housing; two, capture value-creating external growth focused on senior housing; and three, drive strong execution and cash flow generation throughout our high-quality portfolio that serves a large and growing aging demographic. Our optimism for a long, durable growth opportunity in SHOP is founded on compelling supply/demand dynamics, led by a step function in growth of the over-80 population in 2024 and yet again in 2027, the lowest construction starts in senior housing since 2009 and our advantaged platform that has the team, tools, financial strength, data and operators to drive organic performance. The Ventas platform should also enable us to invest successfully. As we discussed in November, we intend to build on our compelling organic growth opportunity by layering on value-creating external investments focused on senior housing. There is a confluence of market factors giving us confidence that 2024 and 2025 should be rich with investment opportunities. We're already seeing our pipeline expand as high-quality senior housing communities in good markets with embedded growth come to market, and we have a line of sight to complete over $300 million of investments in the first half of this year. Our criteria for investments include attractive going-in yields priced at below replacement costs with projected low to mid-teens unlevered IRRs that meet our right market, right asset, right operator framework. Our broader objectives are to drive enterprise NOI and normalized FFO per share growth, increase the scale of our SHOP business, deliver strong returns on capital, support stable and growing dividend capacity and maximize value for shareholders. In sum, we delivered on our commitments in 2023, and we expect another year of normalized FFO per share and property performance growth in 2024. Our 5% projected normalized FFO growth favorably distinguishes Ventas across the REIT universe. With an attractive valuation and the growth engine of senior housing, we are focused on enabling exceptional environments for a large and growing aging population and creating value for our shareholders. Now I'm happy to turn the call over to Justin. Right. Mike, I would tell you that obviously, the most important thing we think about in the renewal in 2025 is about what the earnings capacity of those assets is at that time and beyond. And the -- Kindred has communicated to us that they have significant initiatives underway on those revenue and expense to improve operating performance incentives. Some of those, we can see are starting to take hold. We give Select as an example because it's a public company in the same business, and it shows that significant improvements are possible. And it's really too early to say, whether and to the extent Kindred's initiatives will, in fact, take hold to improve EBITDAR in 2024 and 2025. But they are surely working on it. Yes. I mean, as you know, kind of Santerre's gotten off to a favorable start, and we are -- we've already sold some assets at favorable pricing. I think we'll continue to pick our spots and be opportunistic on that. And then in terms of Kindred, I think we'd be able to certainly say that we'll have more visibility this year, whether or not the financial impact of this year or next year. Right now, we're thinking about next year. But that -- it's too early to say, really, what form that would take, but we have the benefit of a lease that runs into May of 2025, and that's a valuable asset. Jim, yes, it's kind of funny to be talking about this 25 years after I started, because this is what I was doing 25 years ago. But look, we are really well prepared. We're experienced on this. We have lots of plans and subplans, I would say. It's only really 23 assets in total, so I think that, that makes it kind of manageable. And of course, we will try to optimize the NOI of the assets. And it's a puzzle, and we have lots of tools that we've used before, and that's really what we're focused on. And I can assure you there are -- will always be kind of alternatives that we have and are ready to execute in this scenario. Josh, sure. Michael, remember, we own the assets and we own the EBITDAR in those assets. And that's an important -- that's very important. And again, it's too early to say. We have favorable trends in the Brookdale situation, and in Kindred, we hope to have favorable trends as you look out to 2025. So there's a lot more that goes into it when you think about what the outcome is going to be, and we'll be happy to share more with you as the facts develop. I mean I think the key point, the topic sentence, and we'll get to the answer is, those assets overlap with our own portfolio in many respects. Our portfolio is over 90% occupied and managed by Pete and the team very effectively. This was under 80%. So there was -- there is and was significant occupancy upside as we get in there and self-manage those assets. And now I'll turn it over to the team to take your questions. And also, as we do new investments, obviously, the percentage that, that represents of the overall SHOP portfolio and Ventas will shrink because the denominator will be growing and emphasized on U.S. senior housing. So that will change the impact as well. '99. Well stated. I think, Bob, Bob, do you want to talk about funding? And I'm glad you asked it, too, because I think with Ventas really giving FFO guidance into '24, that really is in the top 10 of all REITs, that we are aiming to have an improved multiple that benefits and reward shareholders, and it represents a cost of capital that could be very effective as we build on the organic growth story and layer on attractive investments focused on senior housing. I liked that Slide, too, but I'll give it to Justin to answer. I mean one part I would comment on is that we are very disciplined about it and don't lead the league in any -- and this is an area we don't want to lead the league in, and we can talk about that further. It's a very defined category, and we use it as such. So, Bob... You would say benchmark [indiscernible]. Okay. It's a typical litigation reserve and it affects us and other REITs. And in terms of the acquisition investment opportunities, I think, again, looking at the pipeline that we have, I think Justin talked about 7% plus or minus going in cap rates, which is affected by the growth rate, leading to low to mid-teens IRRs, which, depending on how we fund, will be -- that's how the accretion, obviously, in year 1 will be determined. We're not counting on a lot of accretion into year 1, but rather enhancing our growth rate over time. And we think that those IRRs are attractive, and we want to expand our presence in U.S. senior housing. Yes. So on the latter part, as I mentioned, I think we'll be -- we'll pick our spots on disposing of certain of the Santerre assets over time. Including the SNF. We've been -- we've sold some at very attractive per bed valuations, and we're happy with that. And on the -- what was the -- the others were embedded purchase options that we got in the acquired portfolio with universities who have a better cost of capital than God. So they chose to exercise them. So that's all that was. All right. Mandeep, thank you very much, and I want to thank everyone for joining us today. It's a pleasure to speak with you and have a chance to answer your questions. We really appreciate your interest in Ventas, your support of Ventas, and we look forward to seeing you again soon."

I would now like to welcome BJ Grant, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations to begin the call. BJ, over to you.\nBJ Grant: Thank you, Manny. Good morning everyone and welcome to the Ventas third quarter financial results conference call. Yesterday, we issued our third quarter earnings release, supplemental investor package, and presentation materials, which are available on the Ventas website at ir.ventasreit.com. As a reminder, remarks today may include forward-looking statements and other matters. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and a variety of topics may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, all of which are available on the Ventas website. Certain non-GAAP financial measures will also be discussed on this call, and for a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to our supplemental investor package posted on the Investor Relations website. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Debra A. Cafaro, Chairman and CEO of Ventas.\nDebra Cafaro: Thank you, BJ. Good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants. I'm happy to welcome you to the Ventas third quarter 2023 earnings call. We're pleased to deliver a strong quarter of normalized FFO of $0.75 per share, representing 6% year-over-year growth and total company same-store cash NOI growth of nearly 8%. Our results reflect both the actions we have taken to drive performance and the powerful demand across our diversified portfolio. that is unified in serving the needs of a large and growing aging population. We are also pleased to raise our full year 2023 normalized FFO guidance midpoint to $2.98 per share. Our senior housing operating portfolio fueled our performance, proving the significant benefits that our communities and operators provide to residents and their family. Same-store year-over-year cash NOI growth exceeded 18%, driven by Ventas' operational insights platform in collaboration with our operators. Our Canadian SHOP communities ended the quarter at nearly 96% occupancy and delivered 6% year-over-year NOI growth. Across the SHOP business, move-in significantly exceeded 2019 levels and the portfolio experienced broad-based occupancy gains in both assisted and independent living. Spot occupancy accelerated in the third, gaining 180 basis points from the beginning to the end of the quarter. The multiyear growth in recovery cycle in senior housing is in full swing. In addition, our outpatient medical and research portfolio continued to distinguish itself by delivering solid compounding consistent growth in the third quarter. As we step back and look across commercial real estate, we continue to believe that Ventas occupies an advantaged physicians. Here are five key reasons why. First, because our portfolio is unified in serving the needs of the nation's large and growing aging population, demand is strong and getting stronger. By 2030, 20% of the US population more than 70 million individuals will be 65 or older. The over 80 population alone is expected to grow 24% in the next five years. All of our asset classes benefit from these demographic demand trends and provide powerful tailwinds to our enterprise in a variety of economic scenarios. In senior housing, we're facing the most favorable supply-demand fundamentals the industry has ever experienced. Senior housing starts are at cyclical lows and likely to go lower due to tightening credit conditions. In our SHOP markets, we have virtually no new starts. This favorable supply-demand relationship creates a compelling backdrop for multiyear growth ahead in senior housing, occupancy and rate, particularly in light of the affordability of senior housing and the value proposition it provides. Second, investment opportunities continue to grow in the senior housing space, and we are well-positioned to capitalize on these opportunities. There is a huge pool of quality senior living communities with attractive return profiles that are coming to market as a result of debt maturities and higher debt service costs. These communities tend to have meaningful runway for occupancy and NOI growth in the hands of well-capitalized experienced and knowledgeable owners like Ventas. This trend should accelerate in 2024 and 2025. We have the scale, team, relationships, capital access, analytical and operational insights and experience to expand our senior housing portfolio and create NOI growth. Third, we've continued to build out our Ventas Investment Management, or VIM platform. VIM provides Ventas another way to expand the opportunity set that benefits our institutional investors and public shareholders alike. This quarter, we invested over $200 million through our open-end fund. Fourth, Ventas has assembled the nation's leading business at the intersection of medicine, research and universities. Our high-quality outpatient medical portfolio is well occupied and affiliated with leading health care systems across the country. Our research business represents a differentiated credit-driven model centered on serving the nation's top universities and our excellent internal property management and leasing function enables us to deliver an outstanding experience to our tenants and drive leasing activity. We continue to see meaningful institutional demand in our university-based research portfolio. And I'd like to give you just a few recent examples. Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist recently announced its intention to create a new 160,000 square-foot Eye Institute at our redevelopment site in the innovation quarter at Wake Forest. At Arizona State University, the National Institutes of Health or NIH, recently leased space for medical research, demonstrating the desirability of our site and creating a magnet for other researchers. In addition, Siemens Medical Solutions recently leased space at our $0.5 billion Charlotte, North Carolina project, which is already 80% pre-leased. And last, we are pleased to welcome Dr. Drew Weisman, recent Nobel Laureate to our Penn site at One U [ph] City later this year. We are proud to serve these world-class medical and scientific leaders as they pursue life-changing discoveries. Fifth and finally, we continue to demonstrate access to multiple capital markets at attractive pricing to maintain financial strength and flexibility. We have raised nearly $3 billion year-to-date in various capital markets ahead of the recent rise in interest rates. These actions enhance our liquidity and underscore the competitive advantages Ventas has because of our size, scale and diversified enterprise. Across Ventas, we are laser-focused on maximizing fundamental performance and generating superior total return for shareholders by enabling exceptional environments that meet the needs of individuals, families and communities. In closing, we are pleased to improve our 2023 outlook and to see that while we certainly have more work to do. Our total returns to shareholders over the last one and three-year periods and since the beginning of 2022, have outperformed both the health care REIT and the REIT indices. The whole Ventas team remains intent on delivering outsized value to its shareholders and other stakeholders. Now, I'm happy to turn the call over to Justin.\nJustin Hutchens: Thank you, Debbie. I will start by reporting our third quarter SHOP results, which were very good. Broad-based demand combined with the implementation of the Ventas OI active asset management playbook in collaboration with our operators delivered healthy top and bottom line growth in SHOP during the quarter. Our SHOP portfolio continues to deliver double-digit same-store cash NOI growth for the fifth quarter in a row. The NOI growth of 18.2% was led by the US with 24% growth and our 95% occupied Canadian portfolio contributed 6%. Occupancy accelerated throughout the quarter. with 180 basis points of spot occupancy from June to September, led by the US with 210 basis points. US SHOP occupancy growth was supported primarily by strong demand with move-ins that were 120% at 2019 levels. Furthermore, we saw 130 basis points of average sequential occupancy growth from the second quarter to the third. Revenue growth was 7.6% year-over-year, driven by the occupancy growth as well as RevPOR growth of 6.2%, which was led by the US with 6.4% as we continue to focus on optimizing price and volume to maximize NOI. RevPOR would have been 20 basis points higher if adjusted for the Sunrise Special Assessment that occurred in the quarter last year. OpEx performed well with 4% growth and margin expanded 230 basis points year-over-year. Now, I'll give an update on the holiday independent-living communities. We are pleased with the performance across this portfolio. The 75 holiday by Atria US IL communities are benefiting from the broad-based demand and saw spot occupancy increase by 190 basis points from July to September. We continue to see good performance in this more streamlined portfolio which allows for enhanced focus and with a renewed sense of urgency to execute. We will continue to closely monitor the performance. The 26 IL communities that moved to proven operators grew spot occupancy by 140 basis points from July to September. These three operators are making early improvements to service delivery and performance. Our expert approach of move-in communities to new operators ensures that lead banks are transferred immediately, websites are integrated and management, including the CEOs, have access to the communities well ahead of the transition date to enable quick execution and results. We continue to advance the OI platform and its impact on the portfolio. I'm pleased to see outsized performance in our Sunrise portfolio, where our move-in volume is exceptionally high, our transition communities are experiencing remarkable occupancy and RevPOR growth and our NOI generating CapEx program, which is delivering initial returns of about 20%. As we look to finish the year, we are expecting attractive top and bottom line SHOP same-store cash NOI growth of 17% to 19% for the full year. The key assumptions that drive the midpoint of our range are average occupancy growth of about 110 basis points and RevPOR growth of about 6%, which was total revenue growth to at least 7.5%. We expect operating expenses at around 4.5% growth due to increased occupancy. This, of course, implies continued margin expansion. Embedded in this guidance is the impact of the Sunrise Special Assessment that occurred in the third and fourth quarters of last year. Had Sunrise repeated the special assessment in 2023, our SHOP full year NOI guidance midpoint would have been 200 basis points higher, this impact reverses out in Q1 2024 as Sunrise intends to return to the normal first quarter cadence during this rate increase cycle. We expect the fourth quarter to exhibit normal seasonal patterns and are projecting sequential and year-over-year average occupancy growth. The strong demand supporting our portfolio growth is indicative of the macro backdrop that Debbie described and most importantly, a testament to the high-quality care and services that we are offering our residents and their families. Our operating partners are focused on delivering a valuable living experience for our residents, a meaningful work experience for our employees and a value proposition that is attractive to our residents and their families as they choose to live in our communities. Moving onto investments. We made two investments in the quarter through our VIM platform's open-ended fund. We acquired a trophy portfolio consisting of two outpatient medical facilities, totaling 281,000 square feet located in Tucson, Arizona, fully leased to AA- rated Banner Health. The purchase price was $134 million. These buildings are crucial and Banner's delivery of care and services, providing multi-specialty clinical care. We also acquired two Class A private-pay senior housing assets with 181 units in Connecticut, Massachusetts. The purchase price was $79.5 million, the assets were developed and sold by Benchmark senior living and two private equity firms. Benchmark is a strong regional operator with a long-standing reputation as a market leader in the Northeast. Our top investment priorities continue to be NOI generating CapEx in our existing real estate and senior housing acquisitions. Now, I'll hand over to Bob.\nBob Probst: Thank you, Justin. I'll share some highlights of the Q3 performance in our outpatient medical and research and equitized loan portfolios, turn to the enterprise results for the quarter, discuss our balance sheet, and close with our updated and improved 2023 guidance. Starting with some highlights from our outpatient medical business. Outpatient Medical continued its string of 3% or greater same-store cash NOI growth in the quarter. Benefiting from operational excellence as evidenced by tenant satisfaction scores, which outperformed 97% of our peers as surveyed by Kingsley. Meanwhile, our university-based R&I same-store cash NOI increased 3.3%, with occupancy growing year-over-year on the back of strong demand for space from our university tenants. This demand is evidenced by our recently completed developments at Penn and Pitt, which combined are already nearly 90% leased or committed. Ventas has experienced asset management teams continue to drive performance and value across all asset classes in the recently equitized loan portfolio or ELP. Underlying NOI performance in the ELP outpatient medical, triple-net and SHOP portfolios is trending well and our timing of taking the portfolio over is proving to be prescient. Our 2023 ELP NOI expectation remains in line with last quarter. We also pruned the ELP portfolio through the sale of 6 skilled nursing assets for a gain in the quarter at an attractive price of $60 million or $135,000 per bed. Our overall enterprise reported strong third quarter normalized FFO per share of $0.75. And representing an increase of nearly 6% year-over-year, adjusting for lapping $0.05 in prior year HHS proceeds. Total company same-store cash NOI increased 7.9% year-over-year, powered by our SHOP portfolio growth of over 18% in the quarter. In terms of the balance sheet, our liquidity is significant. We have $3.1 billion of available liquidity and which covers our 2024 maturities by over three times with our revolver undrawn and $400 million of available cash on hand. And I'm really pleased with how we realize that liquidity, namely through proactive capital raising well ahead of our 2024 maturing debt and prior to the run up in base rates. We first took action in Canada in April, then raised over $1.8 billion in attractive convertible, secured and bank debt in the summer and early fall. As a result, we've now raised $2.8 billion of capital year-to-date at an average cash interest rate below 5%. We've used these proceeds to reduce our 2024 maturities, less available cash to just $800 million. We extended our debt duration. We entered pay fixed hedges at low points in base rates, and we reduced Ventas' floating rate to just 8% from 18% earlier this year. These are strong proof points of our advantaged access to attractive capital and our skill in using that access to the benefit of our shareholders. I'll conclude with our updated and improved outlook for fiscal 2023. After another solid quarter, we are improving our full year normalized FFO guidance to now range from $2.96 per share to $2.99 per share. This guidance midpoint represents a $0.01 increase versus prior guidance and 5% growth year-over-year ex-HHS, led by broad-based property strength. As we raise our normalized FFO per share midpoint for the year, we note that 2023 is unfolding directionally as we stated at the beginning of the year, marked by significant year-over-year property NOI growth partially offset by the macro impact of higher interest rates and FX. At the full year guidance midpoint, the implied fourth quarter normalized FFO of $0.75 per share is consistent with the third quarter, with sequential property growth led by SHOP, offset by higher interest rates, FX and back-half dispositions. Total company full year same-store cash NOI year-over-year growth is maintained at 8% at the midpoint. Please see our investor presentation and supplemental disclosure posted to our website for further guidance assumptions. To close, we are pleased with the strong quarter, improved full year guidance and the commitment and skill of the Ventas team. For Q&A, we ask each caller to state one question to be respectful to everyone on the line. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Yes, thanks. Good morning everybody. Justin, you highlighted the impact that the later timing on the renewal increases or the special assessments that you send Alpha Sunrise last year is having in the portfolio. I'm curious, is there anywhere else that you dialed back either the timing or magnitude of rate increases in order to drive occupancy here recently.\nJustin Hutchens: So, first of all, price volume optimization is an ongoing focus for us. You can see in our numbers the RevPOR growth year-over-year has been solid. Obviously, there was an impact from Sunrise. So, the $6.2 million would have been $6.4 million, had not been for that bad year-over-year comp. So, strong pricing power, really strong volume in the third quarter. So, we're really putting together, I think, the right balance of price and volume to drive growth.\nDebra Cafaro: I think it's important to know Austin, also that last year was an extraordinary measure that had never been taken and so we -- this is just returning to normalcy with the January 1 increases.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nSteve Sakwa: Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Debbie or maybe Justin, you talked about kind of growing acquisition opportunities. I'm just wondering if you could kind of frame what kind of returns you might be seeing either with going in yields or unlevered IRRs. I guess to marry that, how do you sort of think about the funding of those? Is that going to be part of them? Or is that going to be done on balance sheet with a combination of equity and debt? Thank you.\nDebra Cafaro: Great. Question. We'll tag team that. First of all, we do see our cost of capital and the yield of senior housing investments, which were most attracted to coming into line. You noted a number of advantages that we have in terms of funding. We have liquidity. We have the VIM platform and of course, we do see these -- the volume of senior housing coming to market and yields increasing so that we feel optimistic about the cost of capital and the yields coming into an attractive focus. And I'll just turn it over to Justin to talk about what kinds of opportunities are building in the pipeline.\nJustin Hutchens: So, we're seeing a number of opportunities that are really building and particularly in recent months and weeks, include the number of seller institutional -- sellers that are dealing with debt maturities or fund maturities. And we're starting to see the returns become more interesting to us. We're seeing call it, 6% to 8% in place, and it really depends on the type of asset you're buying. If it's something that has more growth, it might be low to mid-6s that can grow to an 8% or better, and then a stabilized senior housing asset in the mid-7s, and we target low double digit and in some cases, even mid-double-digit unlevered IRRs.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. Maybe just following up on the acquisitions. We obviously saw a medical office M&A deal announced this week. So, curious your interest in growing on the medical office side and how you're thinking about current pricing within that space relative to the IRRs you can get in other asset types?\nDebra Cafaro: We really intend to lean into senior housing, where we have significant expertise and really ought to be a great owner of senior housing with our platform and our relationships. And as Justin said, double-digit low to mid double-digit IRR. So, we're very interested in that area. First and foremost, you saw that we did close in the VIM platform a medical office building, which has advantages for the VIM stakeholders, in particular, in terms of being reliable, compounding cash flow.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJuan Sanabria: Good morning. Hoping you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing with Kindred given the lease expiration coming up there? And as part of that, if you could talk a little bit about how deep the operator pool is if, in fact, there is a transition that has to happen at some point? And how we should think about the delta between EBITDARM and EBITDAR coverage? Thank you.\nDebra Cafaro: That was a multipart question Juan. Good morning. So, the -- a portion of the Kindred lease for 23 LTACs is up for renewal in 2025. We've talked about EBITDARM coverage being about 0.9 and what's most important, obviously, is what the earnings capacity of these assets is likely to be post 2025 in terms of thinking about the outcomes. Right now, you can see that Kindred has adopted some initiatives for improving the operating performance, which we know are focused really on cost savings, in particular, labor and contract labor. And we're seeing that even in the quarter to date, those are beginning to show early signs of improvement. And so that's how we're really thinking about the 2025 renewal/maturity. LTAC certainly have a pool of qualified operators across the country from publicly traded select to a variety of regional operators, and we're familiar with all of those.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nMike Mueller: Hi. I was wondering, can you talk a little bit about the pace of development leasing in the R&I portfolio that you're seeing? And has there been any material change in the past three to six months in terms of the pace?\nDebra Cafaro: Yes, I mean one of the things I talked about is at our largest project, which is in Charlotte, North Carolina, which is really at this intersection of universities and medicine and research. It's our largest project. It's one of the fastest-growing cities, and it is already 80% pre-leased. We just had Siemens sign a large lease there. And we're really at kind of the mid construction phase. And so that's the most significant, but we are seeing other leasing activity. We only have a couple of other developments underway and we are seeing leasing activity there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRonald Kamdem: Hey. Just -- so last quarter, you had the operator transition and looks like that's progressing pretty well. So, the question really is have you guys sort of changed sort of the way you think about the relationship with operators and evaluating it? And how do you sort of get comfortable that in 2024, there isn't sort of another surprise on the transitions or that you feel pretty good about what's coming down? Thanks.\nJustin Hutchens: Hi, it's Justin. So first of all, just backing up a little bit, where we always start is evaluating are we in the right markets. And so we've done a lot of work over the past years to make sure that we're well-positioned to benefit from the recovery. If we're in markets that we didn't think we're going to provide attractive growth for our respective assets, we've had dispositions. And we've used that part of the toolbox in terms of making sure that the assets are well-positioned, we've obviously made investments into our communities. And then -- we then have the operator selection and operator selection has been just a regular part of our toolbox. Certainly, shouldn't be deemed as a surprise that we're tweaking and trying to make sure we have the right fit, the best operator really to create value in those respective markets and assets. And to your point, we are pleased with the results we're getting. We had a recent transition. We had a number of things that we worked on to make sure that we could get quick results and that was getting boots on the ground. We have the management teams and the CEOs of the companies in the communities right away. We secured the lead bank so we can start executing on leads right away. We transfer the website. And the early results are good, and we're going to stay close to it and we're really pleased with the execution thus far.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Hey everyone. Good morning. I'm just kind of thinking about the SHOP business as we go forward. How are you guys thinking about pricing power? I understand the dynamic that's going on with the Sunrise timing, but just kind of thinking about just pricing power broadly.\nJustin Hutchens: Hi, it's Justin. So, the pricing power over the past few years has really been very, very good. We have at a relatively low occupancy, this broad-based demand is allowing for appropriate pricing really to ensure that we can cover all the costs associated with delivering care and services and to deliver growth for the business, and we remain very focused on that, both from an internal pricing standpoint and external. And if we can get it right. We tend to look for RevPOR export spread usually around 2% to 3%. And that's where we're focused. And the price volume optimization is working because we're really getting growth in RevPOR, and we're seeing the occupancy growth as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with Wedbush. Please go ahead.\nRich Anderson: Thanks. Good morning. So, I want to talk about capital. Justin, you said top priorities are senior housing investing. We went through that. And then CapEx spending. Can you talk about the cadence of how that might transpire from 2023 to 2024 in terms of the types of dollars or thinking about spending and how much more could come in 2024? Just trying to get a sort of a range to quantify that a bit? And also if you comment on the SHOP guidance of 18% at the midpoint same-store NOI guidance, how much of that is juiced by the deployment of CapEx, so you get the revenue benefit and the occupancy benefit, but you don't get the cost hit at least out of the gate. So, I'm just curious if you can comment on that. Thanks.\nJustin Hutchens: Why don't I start with the second part of the question and then Bob will jump in with the first part. So, we have a number of projects that are underway. We have 170 projects that should complete by the end of this year. We started on this endeavor in October of 2022. So, relatively quick execution on a number of improvements across our communities, mostly mid-market focused and also unit upgrades. We do have, obviously, the ability to measure the results. And what we do is we just simply take light communities and compare the results in those that have CapEx versus those that didn't. And where we're seeing outperformance in our communities that have benefited from the CapEx, the early results are showing a 20% plus ROI, but we're also seeing growth across the broader portfolio. So, we're benefiting from the broad-based demand across the portfolio. We're leaning into markets and assets where we want to improve our market position through investment, and it's all really coming together and working for us.\nDebra Cafaro: And it's a multiyear return as well that builds on itself.\nBob Probst: In a multiyear investment, to answer that part of the question. And Page 20 of the investor deck, I think, is a good reference here, Rich, because we really started this investment in 2022 last -- really about a year ago. And are looking at completing about 170 projects by the end of this year, and you see the increased redevelopment CapEx spend of $230 million this year as a consequence. We expect that to remain at a higher level next year as we finish out the suite of opportunities. And with the returns just in quoted, we want to continue to invest there. But that will be finite and then over time, come back down to normal. So that's the flow.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Connor Siversky with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey good morning. Jesus on for Connor this morning. Thanks for having me on the call today. So, just on the equitized loan portfolio, how should we be thinking about the rest of the assets in the mix here? So, how far along is Ventas been identifying and processing the CapEx needs of the outpatient medical assets? A couple of quarters back, you were talking about using a playbook from a previous portfolio. So, I'm just wondering if you can quantify the amount and timing of these investments? And how are these leasing conversations progressing for the portfolio? And just a quick follow-up. Looks like the SNFs, you guys had some pretty favorable cash yields in the assets sold. Any color on the coverage level or remaining lease term on these assets? Thanks guys.\nDebra Cafaro: Good morning Jesus. I'm going to ask Pete to talk about the opportunity in the medical office building portfolio outpatient medical that he's taken over and is deploying the Lillibridge playbook. There's a lot of opportunity, and we're obviously off to a good start there. And Pete, I'll turn that over to you and--\nPete Bulgarelli: Thanks. So, we're really excited about the portfolio. So far, we have transitioned 32 buildings onto our Lillibridge platform, out of 88. So we've made great progress in the first quarter. As it relates to leasing, we have replaced about half our leasing agents. We've replaced 12 out of 23 leasing agents for people that we think are really going to run with this portfolio. We started this portfolio at 77% occupancy. We just completed our first quarter of running this portfolio. We had an 85% retention rate and we've got 200,000 square feet worth of new leasing in our pipeline. So we're very optimistic. And I'll give you -- just -- to me, it's a fun anecdote. We had this building that we inherited called Eagle's Landing in suburban Atlanta. It's a 45,000 square foot building, it was empty, 0% occupancy when we picked it up. And it's now 30% leased, and we just signed an LOI on another 20,000 square feet in the building yesterday. So, we're going to be at 75% occupancy, very shortly in that one building. So, we're optimistic about the portfolio. As it relates to capital, we are investing some capital to improve some of the infrastructure of these buildings, and we're well underway on those as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Stroyeck with Green Street. Please go ahead.\nMichael Stroyeck: Good morning. Can you just provide some additional color surrounding the decline in occupancy within the MOB portfolio, the info on the type of tenant -- assets seen the decline and just what drove that would be helpful? Thanks.\nPete Bulgarelli: Sure. So, look, our occupancy is at 91.7%. And we've had some really nice gains over the last couple of quarters in occupancy. We're really happy with our retention. Retention is 82%, TTM and 88% for the quarter. We got a very strong new leasing pipeline of 600,000 square feet for the OM portfolio. And we have two off-campus, non-strategic 30,000 square things that we're considering selling. And if those were not in the portfolio, occupancy be essentially flat.\nDebra Cafaro: Thanks Pete.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nVikram Malhotra: Thanks for taking the question. Just considering the success you've had with the transitions at holiday. I'm wondering, is there a plan to maybe take another bucket and transition them? Or are there any signs that there's maybe incrementally group that ABC sort of BP -- performance, given how successful the transitions have been -- and just related to that transition, can you also just address where you stand on the Brookdale lease, which I think is due in a couple of years?\nJustin Hutchens: Okay. Hi, it's Justin. Let me start with the first question. So, we do have -- we have 75 communities in our same store that are operated by Holiday by Atria. Those communities were performing relatively better, and they continue to do that. I can tell you that they're now managing a more streamlined and focused portfolio with a high sense of urgency. They want to do well. I mean this is a company that's very focused on this. They've been extremely focused on sales execution and getting tour conversions up and they've had good results in the third quarter, and we're going to stay very close to this and monitor it closely, and expect to see good results. And then in terms of Brookdale, we are really happy to see improved performance across our portfolio, and it's been consistently improving. And has coverage, good coverage, and we'll look for more progress in that portfolio moving forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nNick Yulico: Thanks. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about pricing trends and how to think about going forward, particularly in the IL segment. I mean, if we're just seeing kind of broader multifamily, broader housing prices come down from an inflationary standpoint. Is there a dynamic there on pricing for independent-living that may be different versus assisted-living going forward? Any thoughts on that?\nJustin Hutchens: And we certainly track the resolver markets and particularly as it pertains to independent living. But quite frankly, this price volume optimization I've been speaking to has been working for us, and we've seen really both move together price and volume moving together. And so I'd say the pricing power remains significant, and we're pleased to see the pickup in occupancy as well.\nDebra Cafaro: Thanks Nick.\nOperator: And our next question does come from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMichael Carroll: Thanks. I just want to circle back on the investments. I know that Ventas has been kind of highlighting that there's more investment opportunities. But how active can the company be, I guess, over the next year or so? I mean are there larger portfolios out there that you're interested in or tracking? Or can you actually start pursuing some smaller deals and maybe kind of lump them in with some of your current operators that might want additional scale in their specific markets.\nJustin Hutchens: Yes, sure. So, we are looking at smaller opportunities to really continue to expand our existing relationships and add new relationships and using a variety of different sources of capital to do that. I mentioned benchmark. That's an exciting new relationship for us. And certainly, we have the capability to do larger transactions as well. So, we see most of what's on the market and a lot of what's not on the market, and we're very interested in expanding in senior housing.\nOperator: We do have another question from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to circle back on the public M&A deal this week. I know you've said now a couple of times you want to lean into senior housing. But just curious, I mean, are you underwriting that transaction? And is it something that you'd be interested in pursuing at this point?\nDebra Cafaro: We'd love to help you out, but we have a firm policy on not commenting on other transactions, and we have a great outpatient medical and research business, as I described, and we're really interested in investing in senior housing. And so I think you should defer those questions to the companies themselves.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the call over to Ventas' management team for closing remarks.\nDebra Cafaro: Thanks so much. We're very pleased to deliver a strong quarter for our shareholders and improve our outlook. And all of us at Ventas really appreciate your attention, your interest in our company and we look forward to seeing you in Los Angeles. Thanks.\nOperator: I'd like to thank our speakers for today's presentation and thank you all for joining us. This now concludes today's call, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Justin Hutchens",
            "content": "Thank you, Debbie. I will start by reporting our third quarter SHOP results, which were very good. Broad-based demand combined with the implementation of the Ventas OI active asset management playbook in collaboration with our operators delivered healthy top and bottom line growth in SHOP during the quarter. Our SHOP portfolio continues to deliver double-digit same-store cash NOI growth for the fifth quarter in a row. The NOI growth of 18.2% was led by the US with 24% growth and our 95% occupied Canadian portfolio contributed 6%. Occupancy accelerated throughout the quarter. with 180 basis points of spot occupancy from June to September, led by the US with 210 basis points. US SHOP occupancy growth was supported primarily by strong demand with move-ins that were 120% at 2019 levels. Furthermore, we saw 130 basis points of average sequential occupancy growth from the second quarter to the third. Revenue growth was 7.6% year-over-year, driven by the occupancy growth as well as RevPOR growth of 6.2%, which was led by the US with 6.4% as we continue to focus on optimizing price and volume to maximize NOI. RevPOR would have been 20 basis points higher if adjusted for the Sunrise Special Assessment that occurred in the quarter last year. OpEx performed well with 4% growth and margin expanded 230 basis points year-over-year. Now, I'll give an update on the holiday independent-living communities. We are pleased with the performance across this portfolio. The 75 holiday by Atria US IL communities are benefiting from the broad-based demand and saw spot occupancy increase by 190 basis points from July to September. We continue to see good performance in this more streamlined portfolio which allows for enhanced focus and with a renewed sense of urgency to execute. We will continue to closely monitor the performance. The 26 IL communities that moved to proven operators grew spot occupancy by 140 basis points from July to September. These three operators are making early improvements to service delivery and performance. Our expert approach of move-in communities to new operators ensures that lead banks are transferred immediately, websites are integrated and management, including the CEOs, have access to the communities well ahead of the transition date to enable quick execution and results. We continue to advance the OI platform and its impact on the portfolio. I'm pleased to see outsized performance in our Sunrise portfolio, where our move-in volume is exceptionally high, our transition communities are experiencing remarkable occupancy and RevPOR growth and our NOI generating CapEx program, which is delivering initial returns of about 20%. As we look to finish the year, we are expecting attractive top and bottom line SHOP same-store cash NOI growth of 17% to 19% for the full year. The key assumptions that drive the midpoint of our range are average occupancy growth of about 110 basis points and RevPOR growth of about 6%, which was total revenue growth to at least 7.5%. We expect operating expenses at around 4.5% growth due to increased occupancy. This, of course, implies continued margin expansion. Embedded in this guidance is the impact of the Sunrise Special Assessment that occurred in the third and fourth quarters of last year. Had Sunrise repeated the special assessment in 2023, our SHOP full year NOI guidance midpoint would have been 200 basis points higher, this impact reverses out in Q1 2024 as Sunrise intends to return to the normal first quarter cadence during this rate increase cycle. We expect the fourth quarter to exhibit normal seasonal patterns and are projecting sequential and year-over-year average occupancy growth. The strong demand supporting our portfolio growth is indicative of the macro backdrop that Debbie described and most importantly, a testament to the high-quality care and services that we are offering our residents and their families. Our operating partners are focused on delivering a valuable living experience for our residents, a meaningful work experience for our employees and a value proposition that is attractive to our residents and their families as they choose to live in our communities. Moving onto investments. We made two investments in the quarter through our VIM platform's open-ended fund. We acquired a trophy portfolio consisting of two outpatient medical facilities, totaling 281,000 square feet located in Tucson, Arizona, fully leased to AA- rated Banner Health. The purchase price was $134 million. These buildings are crucial and Banner's delivery of care and services, providing multi-specialty clinical care. We also acquired two Class A private-pay senior housing assets with 181 units in Connecticut, Massachusetts. The purchase price was $79.5 million, the assets were developed and sold by Benchmark senior living and two private equity firms. Benchmark is a strong regional operator with a long-standing reputation as a market leader in the Northeast. Our top investment priorities continue to be NOI generating CapEx in our existing real estate and senior housing acquisitions. Now, I'll hand over to Bob. So, first of all, price volume optimization is an ongoing focus for us. You can see in our numbers the RevPOR growth year-over-year has been solid. Obviously, there was an impact from Sunrise. So, the $6.2 million would have been $6.4 million, had not been for that bad year-over-year comp. So, strong pricing power, really strong volume in the third quarter. So, we're really putting together, I think, the right balance of price and volume to drive growth. So, we're seeing a number of opportunities that are really building and particularly in recent months and weeks, include the number of seller institutional -- sellers that are dealing with debt maturities or fund maturities. And we're starting to see the returns become more interesting to us. We're seeing call it, 6% to 8% in place, and it really depends on the type of asset you're buying. If it's something that has more growth, it might be low to mid-6s that can grow to an 8% or better, and then a stabilized senior housing asset in the mid-7s, and we target low double digit and in some cases, even mid-double-digit unlevered IRRs. Hi, it's Justin. So first of all, just backing up a little bit, where we always start is evaluating are we in the right markets. And so we've done a lot of work over the past years to make sure that we're well-positioned to benefit from the recovery. If we're in markets that we didn't think we're going to provide attractive growth for our respective assets, we've had dispositions. And we've used that part of the toolbox in terms of making sure that the assets are well-positioned, we've obviously made investments into our communities. And then -- we then have the operator selection and operator selection has been just a regular part of our toolbox. Certainly, shouldn't be deemed as a surprise that we're tweaking and trying to make sure we have the right fit, the best operator really to create value in those respective markets and assets. And to your point, we are pleased with the results we're getting. We had a recent transition. We had a number of things that we worked on to make sure that we could get quick results and that was getting boots on the ground. We have the management teams and the CEOs of the companies in the communities right away. We secured the lead bank so we can start executing on leads right away. We transfer the website. And the early results are good, and we're going to stay close to it and we're really pleased with the execution thus far. Hi, it's Justin. So, the pricing power over the past few years has really been very, very good. We have at a relatively low occupancy, this broad-based demand is allowing for appropriate pricing really to ensure that we can cover all the costs associated with delivering care and services and to deliver growth for the business, and we remain very focused on that, both from an internal pricing standpoint and external. And if we can get it right. We tend to look for RevPOR export spread usually around 2% to 3%. And that's where we're focused. And the price volume optimization is working because we're really getting growth in RevPOR, and we're seeing the occupancy growth as well. Why don't I start with the second part of the question and then Bob will jump in with the first part. So, we have a number of projects that are underway. We have 170 projects that should complete by the end of this year. We started on this endeavor in October of 2022. So, relatively quick execution on a number of improvements across our communities, mostly mid-market focused and also unit upgrades. We do have, obviously, the ability to measure the results. And what we do is we just simply take light communities and compare the results in those that have CapEx versus those that didn't. And where we're seeing outperformance in our communities that have benefited from the CapEx, the early results are showing a 20% plus ROI, but we're also seeing growth across the broader portfolio. So, we're benefiting from the broad-based demand across the portfolio. We're leaning into markets and assets where we want to improve our market position through investment, and it's all really coming together and working for us. Okay. Hi, it's Justin. Let me start with the first question. So, we do have -- we have 75 communities in our same store that are operated by Holiday by Atria. Those communities were performing relatively better, and they continue to do that. I can tell you that they're now managing a more streamlined and focused portfolio with a high sense of urgency. They want to do well. I mean this is a company that's very focused on this. They've been extremely focused on sales execution and getting tour conversions up and they've had good results in the third quarter, and we're going to stay very close to this and monitor it closely, and expect to see good results. And then in terms of Brookdale, we are really happy to see improved performance across our portfolio, and it's been consistently improving. And has coverage, good coverage, and we'll look for more progress in that portfolio moving forward. And we certainly track the resolver markets and particularly as it pertains to independent living. But quite frankly, this price volume optimization I've been speaking to has been working for us, and we've seen really both move together price and volume moving together. And so I'd say the pricing power remains significant, and we're pleased to see the pickup in occupancy as well. Yes, sure. So, we are looking at smaller opportunities to really continue to expand our existing relationships and add new relationships and using a variety of different sources of capital to do that. I mentioned benchmark. That's an exciting new relationship for us. And certainly, we have the capability to do larger transactions as well. So, we see most of what's on the market and a lot of what's not on the market, and we're very interested in expanding in senior housing."

            "name": "Pete Bulgarelli",
            "content": "Thanks. So, we're really excited about the portfolio. So far, we have transitioned 32 buildings onto our Lillibridge platform, out of 88. So we've made great progress in the first quarter. As it relates to leasing, we have replaced about half our leasing agents. We've replaced 12 out of 23 leasing agents for people that we think are really going to run with this portfolio. We started this portfolio at 77% occupancy. We just completed our first quarter of running this portfolio. We had an 85% retention rate and we've got 200,000 square feet worth of new leasing in our pipeline. So we're very optimistic. And I'll give you -- just -- to me, it's a fun anecdote. We had this building that we inherited called Eagle's Landing in suburban Atlanta. It's a 45,000 square foot building, it was empty, 0% occupancy when we picked it up. And it's now 30% leased, and we just signed an LOI on another 20,000 square feet in the building yesterday. So, we're going to be at 75% occupancy, very shortly in that one building. So, we're optimistic about the portfolio. As it relates to capital, we are investing some capital to improve some of the infrastructure of these buildings, and we're well underway on those as well. Sure. So, look, our occupancy is at 91.7%. And we've had some really nice gains over the last couple of quarters in occupancy. We're really happy with our retention. Retention is 82%, TTM and 88% for the quarter. We got a very strong new leasing pipeline of 600,000 square feet for the OM portfolio. And we have two off-campus, non-strategic 30,000 square things that we're considering selling. And if those were not in the portfolio, occupancy be essentially flat."

            "name": "Debra Cafaro",
            "content": "Thank you, BJ. Good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants. I'm happy to welcome you to the Ventas third quarter 2023 earnings call. We're pleased to deliver a strong quarter of normalized FFO of $0.75 per share, representing 6% year-over-year growth and total company same-store cash NOI growth of nearly 8%. Our results reflect both the actions we have taken to drive performance and the powerful demand across our diversified portfolio. that is unified in serving the needs of a large and growing aging population. We are also pleased to raise our full year 2023 normalized FFO guidance midpoint to $2.98 per share. Our senior housing operating portfolio fueled our performance, proving the significant benefits that our communities and operators provide to residents and their family. Same-store year-over-year cash NOI growth exceeded 18%, driven by Ventas' operational insights platform in collaboration with our operators. Our Canadian SHOP communities ended the quarter at nearly 96% occupancy and delivered 6% year-over-year NOI growth. Across the SHOP business, move-in significantly exceeded 2019 levels and the portfolio experienced broad-based occupancy gains in both assisted and independent living. Spot occupancy accelerated in the third, gaining 180 basis points from the beginning to the end of the quarter. The multiyear growth in recovery cycle in senior housing is in full swing. In addition, our outpatient medical and research portfolio continued to distinguish itself by delivering solid compounding consistent growth in the third quarter. As we step back and look across commercial real estate, we continue to believe that Ventas occupies an advantaged physicians. Here are five key reasons why. First, because our portfolio is unified in serving the needs of the nation's large and growing aging population, demand is strong and getting stronger. By 2030, 20% of the US population more than 70 million individuals will be 65 or older. The over 80 population alone is expected to grow 24% in the next five years. All of our asset classes benefit from these demographic demand trends and provide powerful tailwinds to our enterprise in a variety of economic scenarios. In senior housing, we're facing the most favorable supply-demand fundamentals the industry has ever experienced. Senior housing starts are at cyclical lows and likely to go lower due to tightening credit conditions. In our SHOP markets, we have virtually no new starts. This favorable supply-demand relationship creates a compelling backdrop for multiyear growth ahead in senior housing, occupancy and rate, particularly in light of the affordability of senior housing and the value proposition it provides. Second, investment opportunities continue to grow in the senior housing space, and we are well-positioned to capitalize on these opportunities. There is a huge pool of quality senior living communities with attractive return profiles that are coming to market as a result of debt maturities and higher debt service costs. These communities tend to have meaningful runway for occupancy and NOI growth in the hands of well-capitalized experienced and knowledgeable owners like Ventas. This trend should accelerate in 2024 and 2025. We have the scale, team, relationships, capital access, analytical and operational insights and experience to expand our senior housing portfolio and create NOI growth. Third, we've continued to build out our Ventas Investment Management, or VIM platform. VIM provides Ventas another way to expand the opportunity set that benefits our institutional investors and public shareholders alike. This quarter, we invested over $200 million through our open-end fund. Fourth, Ventas has assembled the nation's leading business at the intersection of medicine, research and universities. Our high-quality outpatient medical portfolio is well occupied and affiliated with leading health care systems across the country. Our research business represents a differentiated credit-driven model centered on serving the nation's top universities and our excellent internal property management and leasing function enables us to deliver an outstanding experience to our tenants and drive leasing activity. We continue to see meaningful institutional demand in our university-based research portfolio. And I'd like to give you just a few recent examples. Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist recently announced its intention to create a new 160,000 square-foot Eye Institute at our redevelopment site in the innovation quarter at Wake Forest. At Arizona State University, the National Institutes of Health or NIH, recently leased space for medical research, demonstrating the desirability of our site and creating a magnet for other researchers. In addition, Siemens Medical Solutions recently leased space at our $0.5 billion Charlotte, North Carolina project, which is already 80% pre-leased. And last, we are pleased to welcome Dr. Drew Weisman, recent Nobel Laureate to our Penn site at One U [ph] City later this year. We are proud to serve these world-class medical and scientific leaders as they pursue life-changing discoveries. Fifth and finally, we continue to demonstrate access to multiple capital markets at attractive pricing to maintain financial strength and flexibility. We have raised nearly $3 billion year-to-date in various capital markets ahead of the recent rise in interest rates. These actions enhance our liquidity and underscore the competitive advantages Ventas has because of our size, scale and diversified enterprise. Across Ventas, we are laser-focused on maximizing fundamental performance and generating superior total return for shareholders by enabling exceptional environments that meet the needs of individuals, families and communities. In closing, we are pleased to improve our 2023 outlook and to see that while we certainly have more work to do. Our total returns to shareholders over the last one and three-year periods and since the beginning of 2022, have outperformed both the health care REIT and the REIT indices. The whole Ventas team remains intent on delivering outsized value to its shareholders and other stakeholders. Now, I'm happy to turn the call over to Justin. I think it's important to know Austin, also that last year was an extraordinary measure that had never been taken and so we -- this is just returning to normalcy with the January 1 increases. Great. Question. We'll tag team that. First of all, we do see our cost of capital and the yield of senior housing investments, which were most attracted to coming into line. You noted a number of advantages that we have in terms of funding. We have liquidity. We have the VIM platform and of course, we do see these -- the volume of senior housing coming to market and yields increasing so that we feel optimistic about the cost of capital and the yields coming into an attractive focus. And I'll just turn it over to Justin to talk about what kinds of opportunities are building in the pipeline. We really intend to lean into senior housing, where we have significant expertise and really ought to be a great owner of senior housing with our platform and our relationships. And as Justin said, double-digit low to mid double-digit IRR. So, we're very interested in that area. First and foremost, you saw that we did close in the VIM platform a medical office building, which has advantages for the VIM stakeholders, in particular, in terms of being reliable, compounding cash flow. That was a multipart question Juan. Good morning. So, the -- a portion of the Kindred lease for 23 LTACs is up for renewal in 2025. We've talked about EBITDARM coverage being about 0.9 and what's most important, obviously, is what the earnings capacity of these assets is likely to be post 2025 in terms of thinking about the outcomes. Right now, you can see that Kindred has adopted some initiatives for improving the operating performance, which we know are focused really on cost savings, in particular, labor and contract labor. And we're seeing that even in the quarter to date, those are beginning to show early signs of improvement. And so that's how we're really thinking about the 2025 renewal/maturity. LTAC certainly have a pool of qualified operators across the country from publicly traded select to a variety of regional operators, and we're familiar with all of those. Yes, I mean one of the things I talked about is at our largest project, which is in Charlotte, North Carolina, which is really at this intersection of universities and medicine and research. It's our largest project. It's one of the fastest-growing cities, and it is already 80% pre-leased. We just had Siemens sign a large lease there. And we're really at kind of the mid construction phase. And so that's the most significant, but we are seeing other leasing activity. We only have a couple of other developments underway and we are seeing leasing activity there. And it's a multiyear return as well that builds on itself. Good morning Jesus. I'm going to ask Pete to talk about the opportunity in the medical office building portfolio outpatient medical that he's taken over and is deploying the Lillibridge playbook. There's a lot of opportunity, and we're obviously off to a good start there. And Pete, I'll turn that over to you and-- Thanks Pete. Thanks Nick. We'd love to help you out, but we have a firm policy on not commenting on other transactions, and we have a great outpatient medical and research business, as I described, and we're really interested in investing in senior housing. And so I think you should defer those questions to the companies themselves. Thanks so much. We're very pleased to deliver a strong quarter for our shareholders and improve our outlook. And all of us at Ventas really appreciate your attention, your interest in our company and we look forward to seeing you in Los Angeles. Thanks."

And with that, I will turn the call over to Debra A. Cafaro, Chairman and CEO.\nDebra Cafaro: Thank you, BJ, and good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants. We want to welcome you to the Ventas second quarter 2023 earnings call. We are pleased with our enterprise results this quarter of normalized FFO of $0.75 per share. This strong result reflects broad-based property NOI growth across our diverse portfolio, with all segments contributing positively and same-store year-over-year cash NOI growth of 7%. Our SHOP communities led the way, as we continued to benefit from the multiyear growth and recovery cycle underway in senior housing. Notably, our U.S. Assisted Living portfolio grew NOI 32% year-over-year. Our Outpatient Medical and Research and our Triple-Net leased portfolios complemented the SHOP growth. We are also reaffirming the full year normalized FFO per share outlook we provided to you earlier in the year. At the midpoint of $2.97 per share, our guidance reflects 5% year-over-year growth and the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. At a high level, the key drivers of our normalized FFO per share for the year are consistent with those we shared originally, that is, significant property-related growth approximating $0.29, partially offset by a $0.16 impact of higher interest rates. I\u2019d like to unpack for you some of the recent developments and share some key highlights. We are off to a strong start with a portfolio of 153 properties we took ownership of on May 1 by converting our Santerre Mezzanine Loan to equity. The portfolio consists of over 40% Outpatient Medical buildings, over 40% Triple-Net Healthcare facilities and the balance SHOP communities. There are three key components of our improved outlook for the portfolio. First, we have increased our expectations for annualized NOI from the portfolio to $104 million from about $93 million. This improved outlook is the result of our intense focus, our team\u2019s experience and capabilities, certain positive operating trends and strong early returns. We believe the timing for taking ownership is advantageous and that our experience will help us maximize cash flow from this portfolio over time. Second, valuation, we stated last quarter that we believe the portfolio was worth about $1.5 billion, equal to the debt stack, third-party independent valuation experts now value it at 4% above that level. At our $1.5 billion cash investment basis, the per pound valuation on the portfolio is below replacement cost. Third, we replaced the $1 billion senior secured loan on the portfolio with a permanent capital structure at an attractive all-in rate, further enhancing the portfolio\u2019s FFO contribution and demonstrating another way that Ventas\u2019 strength can drive cash flow improvements on the portfolio over time. In addition, as previously indicated, we are also selectively starting to dispose of certain of the assets and expect to sell about $60 million in SNFs later this year at a mid-8% cash cap rate. So while we have more work to do, we have had good success so far and our cross-functional teams are intensely focused on maximizing the value and the NOI of the portfolio. Looking at our broader enterprise. In SHOP, we continue to strongly believe in and experience the demand driven multiyear growth and recovery cycle. We have runway in front of us to recapture about $300 million of NOI, as we return to pre-pandemic margins and occupancy, and perhaps, exceed that level, because of favorable and improving supply-demand fundamentals we expect over the next three years to five years. With virtually no construction starts in our markets and industry starts at the lowest level since 2011, the over 80 population is set to grow 24% over the next five years. Thus, we are well positioned to continue to enjoy outsized growth. Demand continues to be strong. Our SHOP performance in the quarter was led by U.S. Assisted Living. We benefited from strong RevPOR growth and moderating expense growth as anticipated and our highly occupied Canadian portfolio continued to shine. Occupancy in our Holiday U.S. Independent Living portfolio lagged our expectations during the quarter. These are good assets in good markets, and Justin and his team are taking significant steps to drive performance, utilizing the proven Ventas OI playbook that has been so successful since Justin joined us. Our Outpatient Medical and Research portfolio, which is about a third of our business had another outstanding quarter with nearly 4% year-over-year same-store cash NOI growth. Both Outpatient Medical and Research contributed equally to this good growth and performance, which have been impressive and consistent under Pete\u2019s leadership. Outpatient Medical has now delivered year-over-year same-store cash NOI growth of over 3% in seven of the last eight quarters and year-over-year same-store occupancy growth for eight consecutive quarters. New leasing in the second quarter was up 35% over the prior year. Across our large 10-million square foot research portfolio, our university centered portfolio continues to benefit from a creditworthy tenant mix and a robust pipeline of leasing demand from universities and government institutions with 600,000 square feet leased in the first half to high quality tenants and we are actively engaged in late-stage conversations with multiple large users for over 0.5 million square feet. Finally, quality tenant interest continues to be high in our $425 million Atrium Health/Wake Forest University School of Medicine Development in Charlotte, North Carolina. With recent activity, we are closing in on 80% preleasing even though we are still in the early stages of construction. Moving on to capital raising. We continued to prioritize our liquidity, financial strength and flexibility. We had significant successes in raising $2.4 billion in capital across diverse markets so far this year. These transactions evidence the competitive advantage of our scale and the skill and discipline we have in sourcing attractively priced capital even during dynamic market periods. I am pleased that we are now in a net cash position with over $3 billion of liquidity. Thanks, Bob. We also have an active pipeline of investment opportunities both for Ventas\u2019 portfolio and under the umbrella of Ventas\u2019 third-party institutional capital management platform. In particular, we expect to complete about $0.25 billion of investment within VIM later this year, focused on core outpatient medical buildings and stabilized growing senior housing communities. With its existing capacity and investment objectives, VIM provides a competitive advantage for us as we use our platform to capture opportunities in a disruptive market for high quality assets. Overall, on the investment front, we remain focused on assets with outsized embedded growth potential and high quality stabilized assets and portfolios with good risk reward characteristics. Cap rates continued to show a wide dispersion even within asset classes depending upon the credit profile, growth potential and price per square foot or unit. We see some high quality outpatient medical buildings with strong hospital systems and good credit and life science assets trading in the mid-to-low 5s. While other assets with more garden variety characteristics or risk profiles have gapped out. There is a significant opportunity in front of us to lean into the senior housing growth and recovery story as good assets with challenged financing profiles look for solutions. We are heading into the peak years for senior housing loan maturities through 2025 with over $20 billion in debt coming due. With occupancy still about 500 basis points below pre-pandemic levels and rising interest rates, we are beginning to see significant opportunities to generate higher returns on quality senior housing assets. We are well placed to capture these opportunities with our Ventas OI tools and analytics, our team, our ability to raise capital and our expanding group of operator relationships. Against a dynamic macroeconomic backdrop, we remain advantaged given our size, liquidity and the strong fundamentals across our portfolio. Our asset classes benefit from a compelling demand outlook. While the external environment this year has been unpredictable and volatile, at Ventas we have been laser focused on execution, performance and growth, and delivering returns for our shareholders. Our team has really accomplished a lot across our enterprise and handles every macro and specific challenge that\u2019s come our way with focus and enthusiasm. I greatly appreciate their commitment to Ventas and our stakeholders. Our enterprise momentum is strong. We are capitalizing on the large and growing demographically driven demand across our business and the unprecedented organic multiyear growth opportunity in SHOP and we are pleased to confirm our enterprise normalized FFO outlook for the balance of the year. Justin?\nJustin Hutchens: Thank you, Debbie. I will start by covering the Q2 SHOP performance. The demand story remained strong. As the top of the sales funnel, including leads and move-ins are consistently performing above pre-pandemic and prior year levels. Our SHOP portfolio continues to deliver double-digit same-store cash NOI growth, in line with our expectations for the quarter. SHOP NOI and was led by the U.S. with 32% growth and 14% overall. Margin expanded 160 basis points. Notably, the U.S. led the way with 18.5% growth and 230 basis points margin expansion, respectively. The Assisted Living results are driven by our legacy strong performers, including Atria and Sunrise. And our regional assisted living operator relationships that have joined us to transition communities over the past year and a half are delivering exceptional results as our strategy committed to ensuring we are in the right market, right asset, right operators is working. Our NOI generating CapEx program continues as we have now completed over 100 projects with 70 more planned to complete this year in our U.S. AL and IL portfolios and the early returns are excellent. These projects are all part of our CapEx budget that we established at the beginning of the year. Our highly stabilized, high quality Canadian portfolio reached 94% occupancy in the second quarter and NOI grew 2%. The revenue growth in our portfolio remained strong. Revenue grew 6.7% year-over-year, driven largely by RevPOR growth of 6.6% and led by an exceptional U.S. RevPOR growth of 7.4%. Operating expenses grew approximately 4% year-over-year, which was better than our expectations. Within OpEx, labor was better than expected as contract labor continued its downward trend and partially offset by an increase in regular labor expense. The key selling season is well underway and we had a strong ramp in June, driving 50 basis points of spot occupancy growth during the quarter. However, we didn\u2019t see the strong performance at month end that we expected in Independent Living. Occupancy grew 10 basis points year-over-year, which was disappointing and driven by softness in our Holiday by Atria U.S. IL portfolio. We have identified 38 communities that are particularly lagging occupancy performance. Adjusting for these 38 communities, the total SHOP same-store portfolio would have achieved 17.3% NOI growth year-over-year versus 14% reported in the second quarter and the U.S. would have grown 24% versus 18.5% reported. These communities will benefit from executing the more aggressive measures in our OI playbook, including operator transitions and comprehensive redevelopments and these plans are already underway. First, we will ensure we have the right operator in place by transitioning 26 Holiday by Atria communities to existing Ventas manager relationships in Florida, Texas and California. These regional operators have demonstrated strong performance, robust sales management and they have had a solid geographic overlap with the transition asset markets. Next, we will continue our successful NOI generating CapEx program. We have completed several of these projects in our Holiday by Atria portfolio that are delivering very good results. We have another round of projects planned to complete in our Holiday portfolio by year-end. Finally, we will ensure that we are utilizing our full OI approach, which has proven to be very successful in communities that are transitioned to new operators by collaborating with the right operators and combining their intent to local market focus and execution with our respective operating expertise, best-in-class data analytics, aligned management agreements, portfolio management and capital investments, we are driving performance. Our best proof point of the successful execution is the transition 90 portfolio, where we completed the transition of 90 assisted living communities in early 2022 in regional clusters to seven different operators. We sold and are closed nine of those communities and invested CapEx across the portfolio. This portfolio has experienced net move-in growth in 13 months of the past 15 months and delivered year-over-year occupancy improvement of 370 basis points. RevPOR growth of 8.2%, and therefore, NOI has had extraordinary growth in a relatively short period of time with all seven operators contributing. These newly appointed operators have demonstrated they have the recipe for success in delivering on the value proposition for their respective residents in these markets. This is a prime example of performing on our right market, right asset and right operator philosophy. We have the playbook, we are executing and we expect to continue to drive performance across our broader SHOP portfolio. Finally, for our same-store portfolio NOI, we are reaffirming our SHOP same-store growth range of 15% to 21% ex the 38 assets. We expect full year occupancy growth of 80 basis points to 120 basis points, which is approximately consistent with the first half of the year performance. In closing, we remain very confident in the multiyear recovery in senior housing as the table is set for net absorption across the sector. Bob?\nBob Probst: Thanks, Justin. I will share some highlights of our Q2 performance, discuss our balance sheet and close with our updated 2023 guidance. Starting with 20 -- with Q2 total enterprise performance, we reported second quarter attributable net income of $0.26 per share. There are notable positive net income and NAREIT FFO impacts in the quarter arising from the equitization of the mezzanine loan and the sale of approximately 24% of our shareholding in Ardent. These impacts were excluded from normalized FFO as previously communicated. Normalized FFO per share of $0.75 in the second quarter was ahead of our expectations and increased 4% year-over-year. Meanwhile, total company same-store cash NOI increased 7% year-over-year, with all segments contributing to that growth, and our equitized loan portfolio had a strong start. A few comments on the proactive steps we have taken this year to raise capital at attractive rates and to manage our balance sheet. The market backdrop is challenging, with rates continuing to increase and the 10-year treasury currently well over 4%. We have leveraged our access to diverse sources of capital, having raised $2.4 billion at a compelling 4.6% cash rate with near-term line of sight to a further $600 million in H2. We tapped into multiple capital markets and geographies, including the U.S. and Canada, raising secured, unsecured bank debt and convertible debt across multiple maturities, as well as raising equity and selling assets. And we held down our all-in costs through 10-year treasury interest rate hedges at 3.37% and two-year pay fixed hedges on floating rate debt at 3.88% that we executed post the SVB collapse. All of these hedges are significantly in the money. The use of these capital sources is refinancing 2023 and 2024 debt maturities and most notably paying down in full the $1 billion Santerre senior secured debt, thereby replacing 2024 maturing debt with a longer duration, more permanent capital structure that is accretive to Ventas. As a result of all these efforts, our balance sheet is in a strong spot. We are in a net cash position with near-term liquidity exceeding $3 billion, which covers our limited maturing debt through 2024 by nearly 2.5 times and floating rate exposure is at 10%, the low end of our targeted range. These are strong proof points of our advantaged access to attractive capital and our skill in using that access to the benefit of our shareholders. Finally, our net debt-to-EBITDA in Q2 improved to 7.0 times versus the 7.2 times we anticipated following the equitization of the Mezz. We are committed to a BBB+ balance sheet and we expect that the multiyear SHOP recovery will continue to further improve our leverage metric over time. I will conclude with our updated outlook for 2023. After a good first half of the year, we are reaffirming and narrowing our initial February normalized FFO guidance of $2.97 per share at the midpoint for full year 2023. On a year-over-year basis, our normalized FFO at the midpoint continues to represent 5% growth on an adjusted basis. Bridging versus our initial guidance, we now expect a positive $0.04 impact from the equitized loan portfolio together with the Outpatient Medical and Research and Triple-Net segments, offset by a minus $0.04 SHOP impact driven by U.S. IL occupancy. A final step in the bridge is a positive $0.02 from proactive capital raising, offsetting a $0.02 headwind from a higher forward interest rate curve and incremental dispositions now included in guidance. Net total company same-store cash NOI year-over-year growth is now expected to reach 8% at the midpoint, 50 basis points above our initial guidance. Please see our investor presentation and supplemental disclosure posted to our website for further guidance assumptions. To close, we are pleased with the results for the first half of the year and we are committed to delivering performance and value for our shareholders in the second half and beyond. For Q&A, we ask each caller to stick to one question to be respectful to everyone on the line. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Carroll of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nMichael Carroll: Yeah. Thanks. Justin, can you talk a little bit about how widespread the seniors housing weakness was in the IL portfolio? I know in your prepared remarks you sounded like -- it made it sound like the Atria by Holiday portfolio was largely impacted, but 38 assets were where most of it was, is that a fair comment?\nJustin Hutchens: That\u2019s a great question. To be a little more specific about it, we have -- all of our Independent Living communities in the U.S. that are not Holiday by Atria are doing great. They have double-digit NOI growth. They have occupancy growth that\u2019s consistent with -- more consistent with the Assisted Living growth that we have seen. The issue is really narrowed down to Holiday and let me describe that a little bit for you. We will have 85 communities with Atria that are Holiday communities moving forward. Over half of those by the end of the year will have benefited from the redev program that I mentioned in our prepared remarks, 17 or 18 of those are done already. We have many more plans throughout the year. So the plan with those communities are staying with Atria to continue to redev program, which is generating very good results. The communities that are transitioning are going to operators that have a great track record in their respective states and have had an excellent track record for us thus far in the Ventas relationship. There\u2019s 26 of those, they were particularly underperforming and we are confident we are putting them in good hands and we have an action plan in place to get those on track. So, I would say it, yeah, it\u2019s really not an IL issue, it\u2019s more of a Holiday by Atria issue and we have plans in place to address it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Yeah. Hey, guys. Appreciate the time. On the Santerre portfolio, it looks like it kind of was a $0.04 positive versus like the initial guide. What in particular in the portfolio is driving that outperformance?\nDebra Cafaro: So this is Debbie. Thanks for the question. I would say, we are off to a strong start there. We are -- the NOI expectations have been increased and that\u2019s principally the reason, and that\u2019s really from this intense kind of focus on asset management and integration and making sure we are taking all the steps we can to maximize cash flow and value.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Sorry. Senior housing, is it from net lease\u2026\nDebra Cafaro: Oh! Yes.\nJoshua Dennerlein: \u2026. or MOB segment? Yeah.\nDebra Cafaro: Sure. So Pete\u2019s bringing the magic to the MOB portfolio, which is in very early stages and is the largest part of the portfolio. And then the Triple-Net Healthcare portfolio is going well and we are generating additional expectations from there. And I do want to take a minute and turn it over to Pete to talk about some of his early activities and you will get a sense for why it\u2019s going as well.\nPete Bulgarelli: Thanks, Debbie. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Joshua. Just a reminder, the MOB portion of the equitized loan portfolio is 88 assets, about 3.2 million square feet. Also, just as a reminder, of the systems that are associated with these medical office buildings, 67% of those overlap with the systems from our legacy portfolio and of the medical office buildings, 75% of them are sitting in the same MSAs as we have existing medical office buildings. So our integration efforts are much easier to do and I\u2019d tell you we have been really busy. We have been using the Lillibridge playbook. We have done an engineering assessment for each one of the buildings. We have strategic asset plans for each one of the buildings. We have approved and are beginning to spend capital to improve the safety, efficiency and curb appeal of the buildings. We are transitioning OpEx contracts like cleaning and elevator maintenance and so forth. We think we have identified about 400,000 square feet of or $400,000 worth of savings for our tenants just by transitioning contracts. We have done a tenant satisfaction survey and we received the results and are working on action plans. And finally, we have transitioned some of the property management of these buildings. We have transitioned six this week to Lillibridge, which brings the total since May the 18 and the good news is on the MOB portion, we are about $500,000 ahead of our pro forma for this portfolio.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Kammert with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nJim Kammert: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. As regards the $0.04, let\u2019s just call it, earnings drag associated with the reposition or to be repositioned assets, what portion of that would be maybe like transactional, legal and other just sort of contractual issues that you may not recoup versus can you get all $0.04 of earnings power more back post transition? I am just trying to better understand. Thank you.\nJustin Hutchens: Hi. It\u2019s Justin. Yeah. The $0.04 we view as recoverable through performance improvements and it\u2019s really all captured in the Holiday portfolio action plans that I described.\nDebra Cafaro: Yeah. We want to get the $0.04 back and then a lot more.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Griffin with Citigroup. Your line is open.\nMichael Griffin: Thanks. Just going back to those assets you expect to transition. I mean, was the underperformance mainly due to kind of occupancy declines, labor issues that you saw at those facilities? Any kind of color around that would be helpful.\nJustin Hutchens: Sure. Yeah. The biggest issue with this portfolio has been occupancy. We have had -- where we have had some successes where we invested the CapEx and that\u2019s been a good driver of price and NOI, particularly occupancy remains a focus really across this portfolio and especially in those markets that we are transitioning. The operators are transitioning to have proven to have a robust sales management platform and have executed quickly in the communities that they have managed for us so far. So we are really excited to for them to get started.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nJonathan Hughes: Hi. Good morning. Why is the SHOP transition portfolio being done now and not before these headwinds became what seems to be pretty severe? And then the second one, why raise the relatively small amount of equity given the organic delevering visibility from the SHOP NOI recovery that\u2019s expected to drive leverage down nearly a full turn? Thanks.\nJustin Hutchens: Hi. It\u2019s Justin. Fair question. I will take the first part. So the Holiday portfolio was an acquisition by Atria. They had acquired the Manager Holiday and they have been integrating for a period of time. We saw those integration efforts come to conclusion at the end of 2022. At that stage, we were really looking forward to the key selling season to see proof points that the merger integration had been working, and like I said in our prepared remarks, they fell short. So some of the actions were already underway, which includes the redevs. We are doing a more comprehensive redevs in several communities, as I mentioned and then we are transitioning to new operators. We are taking action, we had good visibility into the merger integration and now that we are at this stage, it\u2019s time to step up ROI activities.\nBob Probst: I will take the second one, Jonathan, on equity.\nJonathan Hughes: And then\u2026\nBob Probst: If\u2026\nJonathan Hughes: Thanks, Robert.\nBob Probst: \u2026 I start with the commitment we have to our BBB+ balance sheet, which you know is real. Secondly, the Santerre equitization is 30 basis points levering, ceteris paribus, we highlighted in the last earnings call. As we also emphasized, we are putting a permanent capital structure on that equitized investment and that\u2019s what we have been doing. And that includes equity, includes asset sales, it includes a variety of debt and so it\u2019s really all part of balance sheet management and liquidity and leverage and that\u2019s the rationale.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nMike Mueller: Yeah. Hi. As it relates to the full year SHOP same-store NOI guidance, are you expecting a second half of the year acceleration or did you consider pulling the top end of the range down?\nJustin Hutchens: In regards to the guidance, really, I will just run through it and so we are looking at cash NOI 15% to 21%. That really preserved the existing midpoint and we have good visibility that, that\u2019s the runway. Occupancy at the midpoint, around 100 basis points, it\u2019s consistent with the performance we have seen year-to-date. RevPOR, the same, revenue a little less than the original guide and OpEx a little less as well. So it\u2019s pretty consistent and there\u2019s a little bit of growth in it, because, obviously, we have been running around -- in this portfolio around 17% so in the second quarter. So a little bit of occupancy growth is contemplated.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Yeah. Thanks. Justin, did I hear you correctly that year-to-date growth in occupancy was around 100 basis points if you exclude the 38 assets from the same-store pool, implying no real need for acceleration? And then I am curious with same-store revenue and same-store NOI guidance have been, had you kept the 38 assets in the same-store pool and then the balance of the portfolio, is that outperforming original expectations or performing more in line? Thanks.\nJustin Hutchens: Yeah. So on the first point on the occupancy, I am basically just saying we are expecting it to perform consistent with where it performed in the first half of the year in terms of growth supporting 100 basis points year-over-year growth. In terms of the difference in pools, the 468 is obviously performing a little better in the quarter and it\u2019s supporting our original full year guidance. So, therefore, the natural conclusion is there\u2019s probably less performance if you kept those communities in, that\u2019s demonstrated in the $0.04 that we talked about earlier, that $0.04 is really pointing to the Holiday by Atria portfolio, and therefore, the actions we are taking are really to address that performance.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJuan Sanabria: Hi. Good morning. Two-part question I guess. One, just to follow up on Mike\u2019s and Austin\u2019s question. What is the same-store NOI growth year-to-date for the recast pool? And then secondly, there\u2019s been some discussion on it as well about financial distress in seniors housing. There\u2019s some anecdotes about some concessions or discounting being done on the new customer rates. So just curious what you have seen competitively or maybe some of your operators are doing themselves on the new rate front and if there\u2019s -- if you have seen any of that pressure on the new customer rates.\nBob Probst: Yeah. Juan, let me take the first one. Just the first half on this pool of 468 Justin described ex the 38 assets year-over-year growing in the 18%-ish range. We highlighted in the materials, the impact of the 38 assets coming out of the pool in the second quarter. That\u2019s 330 basis points impact positively to the growth rate. As you think about the full year pool, that\u2019s a good proxy of the impact, and so, hopefully, that puts some numbers behind it all.\nJustin Hutchens: In regards to pricing, I can say within our portfolio that our releasing spreads are as good as they have ever been historically. They have been mostly positive to slightly negative even following big rent increases in the beginning of the year. We are in the key selling season now. Clearly, operators are wanting to take advantage of that. So there\u2019s always some kind of price movement that occurs during this period, and certainly, it\u2019s something that we constantly look at and operators look at where can we reprice to make sure we are striking that balance between volume and rate. So I would expect to see movement in certain markets amongst operators to try to compete.\nJuan Sanabria: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. Just a two-parter for me as well. So, one, it looks like you took out the pricing power slide from the 1Q deck, just going through right now. But can you remind us what in-place rent increases are, how are they trending, certainly, for the back half of the year and how you are thinking about? That is part one. And then part two is and I think others have asked this in a different way, I will give a stab at it. But just trying to really hone in on what changed over a three-month period, right, to take the SHOP occupancy down 50 basis points. It sounds like you are saying it was just the peak selling season did not progress as expected. But just wondering, shouldn\u2019t there have been some signs or something, just maybe can you just hone in on just what really changed here?\nJustin Hutchens: So -- yeah. This is Justin. I will start with the second question first and that\u2019s the change in occupancy. As I have mentioned, what we are looking for with all the integration activities behind the Holiday by Atria portfolio, we are really looking for is key selling season. Key selling season starts in May. June, July, August are going to be particularly strong months. So all eyes are on June and you really don\u2019t know the net impact until the end of the month. When the end of the month came in, it was disappointing. And the way models work, you have to bake in results and so that would flow through the rest of the year. As I mentioned, we have actions underway to address that trending. In terms of pricing, pricing still remained very strong. We didn\u2019t feature it in this deck, because it\u2019s really more of a first quarter phenomenon for us as we have high levels of in-house rent increases. We still see very strong increases on our anniversary. Those are really not -- it\u2019s not a big part of our portfolio, but it\u2019s more independent living, and you generally see around 7% or so in those increases, so very strong. Pricing power is, in our view, is going to continue to be a big opportunity and only gets better as occupancy goes up. We are not even close to having scarcity of value. But what we have is a backdrop that has supply-demand dynamics that supports net absorption in the sector and we are going to play into that with price and volume and we think that opportunity will continue for some time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street. Your line is open.\nJohn Pawlowski: Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on that last question there. Maybe I am misunderstanding page 18 in the investor deck, but it looks like occupancy guidance was reduced for the revised same-store pool. So it\u2019s not just Atria issues driving the weakness in occupancy. Are there broader -- is there broader sluggishness in the IL portfolio outside of Atria?\nJustin Hutchens: Okay. Yeah. Sure. Good -- that\u2019s a good opportunity to clarify something. So we are moving communities away from Holiday by Atria, there\u2019s 26 of those, we mentioned 12 redevs that we are doing. There are also communities that are remaining with Atria and there\u2019s actions underway to help improve the performance within those, they are still in the same-store pool. They are getting redevs, but they are not the comprehensive redev that would remove them from the pool. So that\u2019s probably where the confusion is. That remains an area of focus, even within that, the revised same-store pool, there\u2019s Holiday communities that are -- that have a big opportunity to improve performance.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Your line is open.\nSteven Valiquette: Hi. Thanks. My primary question is kind of similar to some of these other ones and the reasons for the underperformance in that Holiday IL portfolio. But I guess just to dive in deeper on the occupancy shortfall. Just curious on like the competitive landscape. So in other words, is Holiday just being outmaneuvered by competitors or was there just softness in those markets that hit all competitors for various reasons and it sounds like maybe pricing was not the issue. But just curious whether was Holiday just losing market share versus competitors or was everybody feeling the pinch in these particular markets? Just curious more color around that if you have been able to decipher that yet? Thanks.\nJustin Hutchens: Yeah. Sure. So I would say, there\u2019s opportunity to keep up with the market. We can\u2019t really point to a big macro reason or even a local market reason in these markets, it really is going to come down to execution. We are doing what we can to make them more competitive. We put new operators in place. We are putting redev CapEx in place. That will help drive pricing, NOI, volume. Atria is very focused on this. The new operators are focused on this. We are all over it. So our intent is to get them back to market and beyond.\nSteven Valiquette: Okay. Maybe just a quick follow-up. What would be the lowest hanging fruit then with the new operators coming in, like, what\u2019s the easiest thing to pick up as far as number one in the list to improve performance within all the things you are going to do.\nJustin Hutchens: Yeah. Great question. It\u2019s sales execution. One of the things that I noted in the prepared remarks is that, leading indicators have been strong and that\u2019s true in a lot of these communities in a lot of these markets as well. We just need to capture that opportunity. I have confidence in the new operator\u2019s ability to do this. They are excited and ready to get started.\nSteven Valiquette: Okay. Appreciate the color. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question is a follow-up from Austin Wurschmidt of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Great. Thanks for taking the follow-up. You guys flagged plans to sell $63 million of SNFs later this year at a mid-8% cap rate. I guess, one, what is that on a price-per-bed basis, and then two, do you think that the mid-8% cap rate is reflective of the overall SNF portfolio? And I asked because I think we talked about at NAREIT and ability to sell some of the non-core SNFs at $80,000 to $120,000 a bed range, which would imply a lower cap rate for the overall portfolio versus the mid-8% you quoted? Thanks.\nDebra Cafaro: Yeah. So I am enjoying being back in the SNF business, especially as some of the operating trends are getting a little bit better. These are about $135,000 a bed, each of the situations within the Healthcare Triple-Net portfolio that we took ownership of is unique situation and that will change kind of cap rate and per bed valuations. But we are happy with the low 8%s and -- on these portfolios and there\u2019s unique -- part of the value-add of this project is really the experience and the judgment to handle each one of these uniquely and get the best outcome and with these particular sales, we are doing that.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Debra A. Cafaro, Chairman and CEO, for closing remarks.\nDebra Cafaro: Thanks so much and I want to thank all of you again for joining us this morning. We are excited about the opportunity ahead of us. We remain convinced of the momentum and the multiyear growth and recovery story and we are all aligned around achieving and capturing that. So we look forward to seeing you soon, and again, appreciate your participation this morning. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Bob Probst",
            "content": "Thanks, Justin. I will share some highlights of our Q2 performance, discuss our balance sheet and close with our updated 2023 guidance. Starting with 20 -- with Q2 total enterprise performance, we reported second quarter attributable net income of $0.26 per share. There are notable positive net income and NAREIT FFO impacts in the quarter arising from the equitization of the mezzanine loan and the sale of approximately 24% of our shareholding in Ardent. These impacts were excluded from normalized FFO as previously communicated. Normalized FFO per share of $0.75 in the second quarter was ahead of our expectations and increased 4% year-over-year. Meanwhile, total company same-store cash NOI increased 7% year-over-year, with all segments contributing to that growth, and our equitized loan portfolio had a strong start. A few comments on the proactive steps we have taken this year to raise capital at attractive rates and to manage our balance sheet. The market backdrop is challenging, with rates continuing to increase and the 10-year treasury currently well over 4%. We have leveraged our access to diverse sources of capital, having raised $2.4 billion at a compelling 4.6% cash rate with near-term line of sight to a further $600 million in H2. We tapped into multiple capital markets and geographies, including the U.S. and Canada, raising secured, unsecured bank debt and convertible debt across multiple maturities, as well as raising equity and selling assets. And we held down our all-in costs through 10-year treasury interest rate hedges at 3.37% and two-year pay fixed hedges on floating rate debt at 3.88% that we executed post the SVB collapse. All of these hedges are significantly in the money. The use of these capital sources is refinancing 2023 and 2024 debt maturities and most notably paying down in full the $1 billion Santerre senior secured debt, thereby replacing 2024 maturing debt with a longer duration, more permanent capital structure that is accretive to Ventas. As a result of all these efforts, our balance sheet is in a strong spot. We are in a net cash position with near-term liquidity exceeding $3 billion, which covers our limited maturing debt through 2024 by nearly 2.5 times and floating rate exposure is at 10%, the low end of our targeted range. These are strong proof points of our advantaged access to attractive capital and our skill in using that access to the benefit of our shareholders. Finally, our net debt-to-EBITDA in Q2 improved to 7.0 times versus the 7.2 times we anticipated following the equitization of the Mezz. We are committed to a BBB+ balance sheet and we expect that the multiyear SHOP recovery will continue to further improve our leverage metric over time. I will conclude with our updated outlook for 2023. After a good first half of the year, we are reaffirming and narrowing our initial February normalized FFO guidance of $2.97 per share at the midpoint for full year 2023. On a year-over-year basis, our normalized FFO at the midpoint continues to represent 5% growth on an adjusted basis. Bridging versus our initial guidance, we now expect a positive $0.04 impact from the equitized loan portfolio together with the Outpatient Medical and Research and Triple-Net segments, offset by a minus $0.04 SHOP impact driven by U.S. IL occupancy. A final step in the bridge is a positive $0.02 from proactive capital raising, offsetting a $0.02 headwind from a higher forward interest rate curve and incremental dispositions now included in guidance. Net total company same-store cash NOI year-over-year growth is now expected to reach 8% at the midpoint, 50 basis points above our initial guidance. Please see our investor presentation and supplemental disclosure posted to our website for further guidance assumptions. To close, we are pleased with the results for the first half of the year and we are committed to delivering performance and value for our shareholders in the second half and beyond. For Q&A, we ask each caller to stick to one question to be respectful to everyone on the line. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator. I will take the second one, Jonathan, on equity. If... ... I start with the commitment we have to our BBB+ balance sheet, which you know is real. Secondly, the Santerre equitization is 30 basis points levering, ceteris paribus, we highlighted in the last earnings call.

Juan, let me take the first one. Just the first half on this pool of 468 Justin described ex the 38 assets year-over-year growing in the 18%-ish range. We highlighted in the materials, the impact of the 38 assets coming out of the pool in the second quarter. That's 330 basis points impact positively to the growth rate. As you think about the full year pool, that's a good proxy of the impact, and so, hopefully, that puts some numbers behind it all."

            "name": "Justin Hutchens",
            "content": "Thank you, Debbie. I will start by covering the Q2 SHOP performance. The demand story remained strong. As the top of the sales funnel, including leads and move-ins are consistently performing above pre-pandemic and prior year levels. Our SHOP portfolio continues to deliver double-digit same-store cash NOI growth, in line with our expectations for the quarter. SHOP NOI and was led by the U.S. with 32% growth and 14% overall. Margin expanded 160 basis points. Notably, the U.S. led the way with 18.5% growth and 230 basis points margin expansion, respectively. The Assisted Living results are driven by our legacy strong performers, including Atria and Sunrise. And our regional assisted living operator relationships that have joined us to transition communities over the past year and a half are delivering exceptional results as our strategy committed to ensuring we are in the right market, right asset, right operators is working. Our NOI generating CapEx program continues as we have now completed over 100 projects with 70 more planned to complete this year in our U.S. AL and IL portfolios and the early returns are excellent. These projects are all part of our CapEx budget that we established at the beginning of the year. Our highly stabilized, high quality Canadian portfolio reached 94% occupancy in the second quarter and NOI grew 2%. The revenue growth in our portfolio remained strong. Revenue grew 6.7% year-over-year, driven largely by RevPOR growth of 6.6% and led by an exceptional U.S. RevPOR growth of 7.4%. Operating expenses grew approximately 4% year-over-year, which was better than our expectations. Within OpEx, labor was better than expected as contract labor continued its downward trend and partially offset by an increase in regular labor expense. The key selling season is well underway and we had a strong ramp in June, driving 50 basis points of spot occupancy growth during the quarter. However, we didn't see the strong performance at month end that we expected in Independent Living. Occupancy grew 10 basis points year-over-year, which was disappointing and driven by softness in our Holiday by Atria U.S. IL portfolio. We have identified 38 communities that are particularly lagging occupancy performance. Adjusting for these 38 communities, the total SHOP same-store portfolio would have achieved 17.3% NOI growth year-over-year versus 14% reported in the second quarter and the U.S. would have grown 24% versus 18.5% reported. These communities will benefit from executing the more aggressive measures in our OI playbook, including operator transitions and comprehensive redevelopments and these plans are already underway. First, we will ensure we have the right operator in place by transitioning 26 Holiday by Atria communities to existing Ventas manager relationships in Florida, Texas and California. These regional operators have demonstrated strong performance, robust sales management and they have had a solid geographic overlap with the transition asset markets. Next, we will continue our successful NOI generating CapEx program. We have completed several of these projects in our Holiday by Atria portfolio that are delivering very good results. We have another round of projects planned to complete in our Holiday portfolio by year-end. Finally, we will ensure that we are utilizing our full OI approach, which has proven to be very successful in communities that are transitioned to new operators by collaborating with the right operators and combining their intent to local market focus and execution with our respective operating expertise, best-in-class data analytics, aligned management agreements, portfolio management and capital investments, we are driving performance. Our best proof point of the successful execution is the transition 90 portfolio, where we completed the transition of 90 assisted living communities in early 2022 in regional clusters to seven different operators. We sold and are closed nine of those communities and invested CapEx across the portfolio. This portfolio has experienced net move-in growth in 13 months of the past 15 months and delivered year-over-year occupancy improvement of 370 basis points. RevPOR growth of 8.2%, and therefore, NOI has had extraordinary growth in a relatively short period of time with all seven operators contributing. These newly appointed operators have demonstrated they have the recipe for success in delivering on the value proposition for their respective residents in these markets. This is a prime example of performing on our right market, right asset and right operator philosophy. We have the playbook, we are executing and we expect to continue to drive performance across our broader SHOP portfolio. Finally, for our same-store portfolio NOI, we are reaffirming our SHOP same-store growth range of 15% to 21% ex the 38 assets. We expect full year occupancy growth of 80 basis points to 120 basis points, which is approximately consistent with the first half of the year performance. In closing, we remain very confident in the multiyear recovery in senior housing as the table is set for net absorption across the sector. Bob? That's a great question. To be a little more specific about it, we have -- all of our Independent Living communities in the U.S. that are not Holiday by Atria are doing great. They have double-digit NOI growth. They have occupancy growth that's consistent with -- more consistent with the Assisted Living growth that we have seen. The issue is really narrowed down to Holiday and let me describe that a little bit for you. We will have 85 communities with Atria that are Holiday communities moving forward. Over half of those by the end of the year will have benefited from the redev program that I mentioned in our prepared remarks, 17 or 18 of those are done already. We have many more plans throughout the year. So the plan with those communities are staying with Atria to continue to redev program, which is generating very good results. The communities that are transitioning are going to operators that have a great track record in their respective states and have had an excellent track record for us thus far in the Ventas relationship. There's 26 of those, they were particularly underperforming and we are confident we are putting them in good hands and we have an action plan in place to get those on track. So, I would say it, yeah, it's really not an IL issue, it's more of a Holiday by Atria issue and we have plans in place to address it. Hi. It's Justin. Yeah. The $0.04 we view as recoverable through performance improvements and it's really all captured in the Holiday portfolio action plans that I described. Sure. Yeah. The biggest issue with this portfolio has been occupancy. We have had -- where we have had some successes where we invested the CapEx and that's been a good driver of price and NOI, particularly occupancy remains a focus really across this portfolio and especially in those markets that we are transitioning. The operators are transitioning to have proven to have a robust sales management platform and have executed quickly in the communities that they have managed for us so far. So we are really excited to for them to get started. Hi. It's Justin. Fair question. I will take the first part. So the Holiday portfolio was an acquisition by Atria. They had acquired the Manager Holiday and they have been integrating for a period of time. We saw those integration efforts come to conclusion at the end of 2022. At that stage, we were really looking forward to the key selling season to see proof points that the merger integration had been working, and like I said in our prepared remarks, they fell short. So some of the actions were already underway, which includes the redevs. We are doing a more comprehensive redevs in several communities, as I mentioned and then we are transitioning to new operators. We are taking action, we had good visibility into the merger integration and now that we are at this stage, it's time to step up ROI activities. In regards to the guidance, really, I will just run through it and so we are looking at cash NOI 15% to 21%. That really preserved the existing midpoint and we have good visibility that, that's the runway. Occupancy at the midpoint, around 100 basis points, it's consistent with the performance we have seen year-to-date. RevPOR, the same, revenue a little less than the original guide and OpEx a little less as well. So it's pretty consistent and there's a little bit of growth in it, because, obviously, we have been running around -- in this portfolio around 17% so in the second quarter. So a little bit of occupancy growth is contemplated. Yeah. So on the first point on the occupancy, I am basically just saying we are expecting it to perform consistent with where it performed in the first half of the year in terms of growth supporting 100 basis points year-over-year growth. In terms of the difference in pools, the 468 is obviously performing a little better in the quarter and it's supporting our original full year guidance. So, therefore, the natural conclusion is there's probably less performance if you kept those communities in, that's demonstrated in the $0.04 that we talked about earlier, that $0.04 is really pointing to the Holiday by Atria portfolio, and therefore, the actions we are taking are really to address that performance. In regards to pricing, I can say within our portfolio that our releasing spreads are as good as they have ever been historically. They have been mostly positive to slightly negative even following big rent increases in the beginning of the year. We are in the key selling season now. Clearly, operators are wanting to take advantage of that. So there's always some kind of price movement that occurs during this period, and certainly, it's something that we constantly look at and operators look at where can we reprice to make sure we are striking that balance between volume and rate. So I would expect to see movement in certain markets amongst operators to try to compete. So -- yeah. This is Justin. I will start with the second question first and that's the change in occupancy. As I have mentioned, what we are looking for with all the integration activities behind the Holiday by Atria portfolio, we are really looking for is key selling season. Key selling season starts in May. June, July, August are going to be particularly strong months. So all eyes are on June and you really don't know the net impact until the end of the month. When the end of the month came in, it was disappointing. And the way models work, you have to bake in results and so that would flow through the rest of the year. As I mentioned, we have actions underway to address that trending. In terms of pricing, pricing still remained very strong. We didn't feature it in this deck, because it's really more of a first quarter phenomenon for us as we have high levels of in-house rent increases. We still see very strong increases on our anniversary. Those are really not -- it's not a big part of our portfolio, but it's more independent living, and you generally see around 7% or so in those increases, so very strong. Pricing power is, in our view, is going to continue to be a big opportunity and only gets better as occupancy goes up. We are not even close to having scarcity of value. But what we have is a backdrop that has supply-demand dynamics that supports net absorption in the sector and we are going to play into that with price and volume and we think that opportunity will continue for some time. Okay. Yeah. Sure. Good -- that's a good opportunity to clarify something. So we are moving communities away from Holiday by Atria, there's 26 of those, we mentioned 12 redevs that we are doing. There are also communities that are remaining with Atria and there's actions underway to help improve the performance within those, they are still in the same-store pool. They are getting redevs, but they are not the comprehensive redev that would remove them from the pool. So that's probably where the confusion is. That remains an area of focus, even within that, the revised same-store pool, there's Holiday communities that are -- that have a big opportunity to improve performance. Yeah. Sure. So I would say, there's opportunity to keep up with the market. We can't really point to a big macro reason or even a local market reason in these markets, it really is going to come down to execution. We are doing what we can to make them more competitive. We put new operators in place. We are putting redev CapEx in place. That will help drive pricing, NOI, volume. Atria is very focused on this. The new operators are focused on this. We are all over it. So our intent is to get them back to market and beyond. Yeah. Great question. It's sales execution. One of the things that I noted in the prepared remarks is that, leading indicators have been strong and that's true in a lot of these communities in a lot of these markets as well. We just need to capture that opportunity. I have confidence in the new operator's ability to do this. They are excited and ready to get started."

            "content": "Thanks, Debbie. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Joshua. Just a reminder, the MOB portion of the equitized loan portfolio is 88 assets, about 3.2 million square feet. Also, just as a reminder, of the systems that are associated with these medical office buildings, 67% of those overlap with the systems from our legacy portfolio and of the medical office buildings, 75% of them are sitting in the same MSAs as we have existing medical office buildings. So our integration efforts are much easier to do and I'd tell you we have been really busy. We have been using the Lillibridge playbook. We have done an engineering assessment for each one of the buildings. We have strategic asset plans for each one of the buildings. We have approved and are beginning to spend capital to improve the safety, efficiency and curb appeal of the buildings. We are transitioning OpEx contracts like cleaning and elevator maintenance and so forth. We think we have identified about 400,000 square feet of or $400,000 worth of savings for our tenants just by transitioning contracts. We have done a tenant satisfaction survey and we received the results and are working on action plans. And finally, we have transitioned some of the property management of these buildings. We have transitioned six this week to Lillibridge, which brings the total since May the 18 and the good news is on the MOB portion, we are about $500,000 ahead of our pro forma for this portfolio."

            "name": "Debra Cafaro",
            "content": "Thank you, BJ, and good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants. We want to welcome you to the Ventas second quarter 2023 earnings call. We are pleased with our enterprise results this quarter of normalized FFO of $0.75 per share. This strong result reflects broad-based property NOI growth across our diverse portfolio, with all segments contributing positively and same-store year-over-year cash NOI growth of 7%. Our SHOP communities led the way, as we continued to benefit from the multiyear growth and recovery cycle underway in senior housing. Notably, our U.S. Assisted Living portfolio grew NOI 32% year-over-year. Our Outpatient Medical and Research and our Triple-Net leased portfolios complemented the SHOP growth. We are also reaffirming the full year normalized FFO per share outlook we provided to you earlier in the year. At the midpoint of $2.97 per share, our guidance reflects 5% year-over-year growth and the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. At a high level, the key drivers of our normalized FFO per share for the year are consistent with those we shared originally, that is, significant property-related growth approximating $0.29, partially offset by a $0.16 impact of higher interest rates. I'd like to unpack for you some of the recent developments and share some key highlights. We are off to a strong start with a portfolio of 153 properties we took ownership of on May 1 by converting our Santerre Mezzanine Loan to equity. The portfolio consists of over 40% Outpatient Medical buildings, over 40% Triple-Net Healthcare facilities and the balance SHOP communities. There are three key components of our improved outlook for the portfolio. First, we have increased our expectations for annualized NOI from the portfolio to $104 million from about $93 million. This improved outlook is the result of our intense focus, our team's experience and capabilities, certain positive operating trends and strong early returns. We believe the timing for taking ownership is advantageous and that our experience will help us maximize cash flow from this portfolio over time. Second, valuation, we stated last quarter that we believe the portfolio was worth about $1.5 billion, equal to the debt stack, third-party independent valuation experts now value it at 4% above that level. At our $1.5 billion cash investment basis, the per pound valuation on the portfolio is below replacement cost. Third, we replaced the $1 billion senior secured loan on the portfolio with a permanent capital structure at an attractive all-in rate, further enhancing the portfolio's FFO contribution and demonstrating another way that Ventas' strength can drive cash flow improvements on the portfolio over time. In addition, as previously indicated, we are also selectively starting to dispose of certain of the assets and expect to sell about $60 million in SNFs later this year at a mid-8% cash cap rate. So while we have more work to do, we have had good success so far and our cross-functional teams are intensely focused on maximizing the value and the NOI of the portfolio. Looking at our broader enterprise. In SHOP, we continue to strongly believe in and experience the demand driven multiyear growth and recovery cycle. We have runway in front of us to recapture about $300 million of NOI, as we return to pre-pandemic margins and occupancy, and perhaps, exceed that level, because of favorable and improving supply-demand fundamentals we expect over the next three years to five years. With virtually no construction starts in our markets and industry starts at the lowest level since 2011, the over 80 population is set to grow 24% over the next five years. Thus, we are well positioned to continue to enjoy outsized growth. Demand continues to be strong. Our SHOP performance in the quarter was led by U.S. Assisted Living. We benefited from strong RevPOR growth and moderating expense growth as anticipated and our highly occupied Canadian portfolio continued to shine. Occupancy in our Holiday U.S. Independent Living portfolio lagged our expectations during the quarter. These are good assets in good markets, and Justin and his team are taking significant steps to drive performance, utilizing the proven Ventas OI playbook that has been so successful since Justin joined us. Our Outpatient Medical and Research portfolio, which is about a third of our business had another outstanding quarter with nearly 4% year-over-year same-store cash NOI growth. Both Outpatient Medical and Research contributed equally to this good growth and performance, which have been impressive and consistent under Pete's leadership. Outpatient Medical has now delivered year-over-year same-store cash NOI growth of over 3% in seven of the last eight quarters and year-over-year same-store occupancy growth for eight consecutive quarters. New leasing in the second quarter was up 35% over the prior year. Across our large 10-million square foot research portfolio, our university centered portfolio continues to benefit from a creditworthy tenant mix and a robust pipeline of leasing demand from universities and government institutions with 600,000 square feet leased in the first half to high quality tenants and we are actively engaged in late-stage conversations with multiple large users for over 0.5 million square feet. Finally, quality tenant interest continues to be high in our $425 million Atrium Health/Wake Forest University School of Medicine Development in Charlotte, North Carolina. With recent activity, we are closing in on 80% preleasing even though we are still in the early stages of construction. Moving on to capital raising. We continued to prioritize our liquidity, financial strength and flexibility. We had significant successes in raising $2.4 billion in capital across diverse markets so far this year. These transactions evidence the competitive advantage of our scale and the skill and discipline we have in sourcing attractively priced capital even during dynamic market periods. I am pleased that we are now in a net cash position with over $3 billion of liquidity. Thanks, Bob. We also have an active pipeline of investment opportunities both for Ventas' portfolio and under the umbrella of Ventas' third-party institutional capital management platform. In particular, we expect to complete about $0.25 billion of investment within VIM later this year, focused on core outpatient medical buildings and stabilized growing senior housing communities. With its existing capacity and investment objectives, VIM provides a competitive advantage for us as we use our platform to capture opportunities in a disruptive market for high quality assets. Overall, on the investment front, we remain focused on assets with outsized embedded growth potential and high quality stabilized assets and portfolios with good risk reward characteristics. Cap rates continued to show a wide dispersion even within asset classes depending upon the credit profile, growth potential and price per square foot or unit. We see some high quality outpatient medical buildings with strong hospital systems and good credit and life science assets trading in the mid-to-low 5s. While other assets with more garden variety characteristics or risk profiles have gapped out. There is a significant opportunity in front of us to lean into the senior housing growth and recovery story as good assets with challenged financing profiles look for solutions. We are heading into the peak years for senior housing loan maturities through 2025 with over $20 billion in debt coming due. With occupancy still about 500 basis points below pre-pandemic levels and rising interest rates, we are beginning to see significant opportunities to generate higher returns on quality senior housing assets. We are well placed to capture these opportunities with our Ventas OI tools and analytics, our team, our ability to raise capital and our expanding group of operator relationships. Against a dynamic macroeconomic backdrop, we remain advantaged given our size, liquidity and the strong fundamentals across our portfolio. Our asset classes benefit from a compelling demand outlook. While the external environment this year has been unpredictable and volatile, at Ventas we have been laser focused on execution, performance and growth, and delivering returns for our shareholders. Our team has really accomplished a lot across our enterprise and handles every macro and specific challenge that's come our way with focus and enthusiasm. I greatly appreciate their commitment to Ventas and our stakeholders. Our enterprise momentum is strong. We are capitalizing on the large and growing demographically driven demand across our business and the unprecedented organic multiyear growth opportunity in SHOP and we are pleased to confirm our enterprise normalized FFO outlook for the balance of the year. Justin? So this is Debbie. Thanks for the question. I would say, we are off to a strong start there. We are -- the NOI expectations have been increased and that's principally the reason, and that's really from this intense kind of focus on asset management and integration and making sure we are taking all the steps we can to maximize cash flow and value. Oh! Yes. Sure. So Pete's bringing the magic to the MOB portfolio, which is in very early stages and is the largest part of the portfolio. And then the Triple-Net Healthcare portfolio is going well and we are generating additional expectations from there. And I do want to take a minute and turn it over to Pete to talk about some of his early activities and you will get a sense for why it's going as well. Yeah. We want to get the $0.04 back and then a lot more. Yeah. So I am enjoying being back in the SNF business, especially as some of the operating trends are getting a little bit better. These are about $135,000 a bed, each of the situations within the Healthcare Triple-Net portfolio that we took ownership of is unique situation and that will change kind of cap rate and per bed valuations. But we are happy with the low 8%s and -- on these portfolios and there's unique -- part of the value-add of this project is really the experience and the judgment to handle each one of these uniquely and get the best outcome and with these particular sales, we are doing that. Thanks so much and I want to thank all of you again for joining us this morning. We are excited about the opportunity ahead of us. We remain convinced of the momentum and the multiyear growth and recovery story and we are all aligned around achieving and capturing that. So we look forward to seeing you soon, and again, appreciate your participation this morning. Thank you."

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Debra A Cafaro, Chairman and CEO.\nDebra Cafaro: Thanks, BJ, and good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants. Welcome to the Ventas First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. I'm excited to speak with you today as we recap an outstanding first quarter underscore the momentum we have across our large and diverse enterprise and reaffirm our full year normalized FFO guidance of $2.90 to $3.04 per share. Our diversified business is unified in serving a large and growing aging population. Within commercial real estate, we are highly advantaged due to favorable demographic demand, the unprecedented organic growth opportunity we are already starting to realize and our scale, liquidity and access to capital. As a team, we are enthusiastic about the future and focused on delivering superior performance. The success we achieved in the first quarter was powered by our high-quality shop business, where the U.S. communities grew 22%, bolstered by the growth of our highly occupied Canadian communities. Our other asset classes are also contributing reliable compounding growth. With MOBs outperforming and our university centered life science R&I business benefiting from strong tenant mix, with significant demand from universities, health systems, investment-grade companies and government institutions. The multiyear growth and recovery cycle in senior housing is well underway. We have already started to capture the significant NOI upside opportunity in our current results. Looking forward, we project an incremental $300-plus million of additional NOI opportunity available from simply reaching pre-pandemic margins and occupancy of 88% in the portfolio. Beyond that target, we believe that above 90% occupancy and higher margins are also attainable because current supply-demand conditions are materially more favorable than they were during the last peak period. With 99% of our shop communities located in markets without competing new supply barriers to new construction starts and our senior housing team using operational insights to collaborate with operators and drive results. These conditions present a compelling multiyear growth opportunity. Turning to capital. The $30-plus billion scale of our platform, our liquidity and our diverse geographic footprint and business model give us access to multiple sources of attractive capital. We remain committed to a strong balance sheet and our BBB+ ratings. Our third-party institutional capital management business, VIM, is also a competitive advantage for Ventas. With over $5 billion in assets under management, VIM provides a way for us to capitalize on attractive investments through cycles. In the current environment, VIM provides us and our VIM stakeholders with interesting investment opportunities. Overall, on the investment front, we're focused on assets with outsized embedded growth at or below replacement cost pricing and high-quality stabilized assets and portfolios with good risk reward in a variety of economic conditions. Now let me spend a minute on results. First quarter normalized FFO was $0.74 per share with year-over-year total company same-store cash NOI growth of over 8%. Our performance was fueled by significant property NOI growth led by SHOP. Pete Bulgarelli and his team once again delivered excellent MOB performance, generating our seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year occupancy growth and industry-leading NOI margin. As well as extending our track record of over 3% same-store NOI growth to six of the last seven quarters. Now let me touch on some other key highlights of our enterprise. Our non-property strategic investments continue to generate value. We just closed on the partial sale of our equity investment in Ardent Health Services, yielding approximately $50 million in total proceeds. This transaction is a testament to our partner, Sam Zell's ability to make outstanding investments, attract quality investors, and find excellent management teams. The price represents a greater than 4x equity multiple on Ventas' original investment basis. We retained an approximately 7.5% stake in Ardent with an implied valuation of $150 million. On May 1, we completed our previously announced plan to take ownership of the Santerre portfolio, consisting of MOBs, shop communities and triple net leased health care facilities. We believe that the conversion of our cash pay mezzanine loan into real estate ownership should produce FFO within our previously announced guidance range and that the value of the assets at March 31 approximated $1.5 billion, which is the sum of the debt stack. Our experienced team is now focused on maximizing both the value and the NOI of the portfolio over time. It's important to realize that the expected FFO contribution we are forecasting from this loan to own is substantially consistent with what we would have generated if our mezz loan had been paid in full at maturity, and we reinvested the proceeds and debt pay down. Our strong ESG practices also drive value for Ventas' stakeholders. We were proud to receive the 2023 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year sustained excellence in Energy Management Award, the highest honor awarded by ENERGY STAR. We are also committed to best-in-class corporate governance practices and are proud of the excellence independence and diversity of our Board. Finally, we were honored to recently celebrate Ventas' 25-year anniversary. I want to publicly thank all my Ventas colleagues and Board members, past and present, partners and stakeholders, including those of you listening today, who have made the significant milestone possible. With our momentum and a cohesive experience team at Ventas, we are optimistic about the prospects for our next 25 years. And now I'll turn the call over to Justin.\nJustin Hutchens: Thank you, Debbie. I'll start by covering our shop trends in the first quarter. Our SHOP portfolio continues to deliver exceptional results, exceeding our expectations with strong year-over-year growth driven by pricing power and cost control. SHOP NOI grew 17.4% as margin expanded 200 basis points. Notably, the U.S. led the way with 22.4% growth, attributable to strong performance in our legacy Atria and Sunrise portfolios and our transition communities with assisted living being the biggest contributor to the growth. Our Canadian portfolio, which grew 5%, continues to be a beacon of stability and high performance with exceptional margins and consistently high occupancy above 90% and in each and every quarter since the first quarter of 2019. This portfolio remains a reliable source of growing cash flow, buoyed by Le Groupe Maurice performance. The revenue growth in our portfolio remains strong. With a notable 8% year-over-year increase, the revenue growth was largely driven by the continued acceleration of RevPOR, which is a testament to the strength of our business model and our operators' unwavering commitment to delivering exceptional value to their residents. Our pricing power continues to be a driving force behind our success. In fact, we've experienced the strongest year-over-year RevPOR growth we've seen in the last 10 years, with an impressive 6.8% increase. This growth was primarily due to in-house rent and care increases as well as improving releasing spreads. In addition, we also saw a robust sequential RevPAR growth of 4.1% in spite of the fact that one of our large operators pulled forward their rent increases to the fourth quarter, which causes a less favorable comp. These results are a testament to our continued efforts to optimize pricing. Occupancy grew 80 basis points year-over-year and was down 90 basis points sequentially, in line with typical seasonality as expected. Moving on to expenses. Operating expenses grew 5% year-over-year, which is in line with expectations. Within OpEx, labor, which is 60% of the spend is playing out as expected. As the permanent employee base is increasing and replacing contract labor. That hiring has continued its positive trend for six consecutive quarters, causing contract labor to reduce by 59% year-over-year. We believe there is still room for improvement in this area, which will result in cost reduction and also improve the consistency and quality of care delivery. At Ventas, we've been committed to staying ahead of the curve when it comes to optimizing our portfolio and executing on our strategy through our right market, right asset, right operator approach, which is anchored by Ventas OI, our best-in-class data analytics platform and informed by experiential insights. Through this approach, we're leveraging data and insights to select the most promising markets for capital investments and operational improvement by carefully selecting communities are well positioned for success within those markets, identifying specific operational improvements and partnering with the right operators to drive exceptional performance. For instance, let's take a closer look at the strong performance in the U.S. I'd like to highlight that NOI growth of 22.4% was broad-based across the U.S. I'll discuss this in the context of our legacy portfolio which contains 234 long-held communities representing 71% of the U.S. same-store shop NOI and our transition portfolio, which contains 200 communities that have transitioned to new operators since the beginning of 2021 and represents 29% of the U.S. same-store shop NOI. A legacy portfolio had strong growth at 20% and our transition portfolio delivered an even better NOI growth rate of 30% on a lower NOI base. Our meticulous and strategic approach in selecting the right operators for the group of transition assets is backed by our Ventas OI methodology and CapEx investments, which is paying off and generating outstanding NOI growth. Notably, Discovery Senior Living, a Dallas and Priority Life Care are among the numerous operators that contributed significantly to the growth in the first quarter. And the future growth prospects for this group of communities across all of our operators are truly exciting. I'll double-click on Discovery is an example of the value creation thus far backed by Ventas OI. We transitioned 16 assisted living communities to them in the fourth quarter of 2021. These communities are located in a tight geographic area and in existing discovery markets. When comparing the first quarter of 2022 to 2023, their portfolio achieved 770 basis points of occupancy growth, and grew NOI by many multiples thus far. We completed 13 of the 15 planned NOI-generating CapEx projects in this portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2022. We look forward to more successful performance as these communities have benefited from a strong operational turnaround and should also benefit from the repositioning in their markets moving forward. We've seen similar results in the Priory Life and Sedaris portfolios. These are great examples of Ventas OI in collaboration with an operator with a strong regional focus delivering excellent results. We invested in the right markets with the right operators and ensure the assets are positioned well for success. We've also shared a few community-specific examples in our earnings deck. We are pleased to announce, as expected, that we are delivering over 100 NOI-generating CapEx projects in our SHOP portfolio, which when combined with the operational improvements that are already well underway -- will significantly enhance the market position of our communities in terms of rate and occupancy over time. We are already seeing excellent early returns, which is a testament to the effectiveness of our strategy and our commitment to delivering exceptional value creation, and we have more attractive opportunities planned in the near future. With the right investments and strategic focus, we believe that we have an extraordinary opportunity to drive NOI recovery in the SHOP portfolio that Debbie mentioned with the potential to generate over $1 billion in NOI when the portfolio reaches 88% occupancy and a 30% margin. While there is still work to be done to realize this potential, we're pleased with the progress we've made so far. In the first quarter of this year, our annualized run rate for NOI in the SHOP portfolio was $682 million, continuing a trajectory of growth and success. Looking ahead, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of 15% to 21% NOI growth in our year-over-year SHOP same-store pool. We expect a significant occupancy ramp throughout the year, supported by an accelerating aging demographic and muted new supply. As we approach the key selling season, which starts now. We are encouraged by very strong lead volume year-to-date and the quarter is off to a good start. Now I'll comment on investment activity. Our pipeline remains active, and our team is evaluating a select group of potential investments. high-quality, stable assets and those trading below replacement costs with growth potential are still commanding relatively low cap rates of 5% to 6%. We are seeing market disconnects as asset pricing is not fully reflecting the rising cost of capital. We are, however, seeing recent examples where the bid-ask spread is tightening, especially in Class A senior housing. We are prioritizing smaller, high-quality, high-performing relationship-oriented transactions. NOI generating CapEx remains our highest and best use of capital as we continue to drive the SHOP recovery. With that, I'll hand over to Bob.\nBob Probst: Thanks, Justin. I'm happy to report a strong start to the year with results ahead of our expectations. I'll share some highlights of our Q1 performance, discuss our balance sheet and close with our reaffirmed 2023 normalized FFO guidance. Starting with some highlights from our office segment. Our Medical Office business outperformed once again in the first quarter with same-store cash NOI growth of 3.1%, Ventas' MOB NOI growth and margins are best-in-class. Meanwhile, our university-based R&I same-store cash NOI increased over 3%, adjusting for $1 million of holdover rent received in the prior year. In terms of overall enterprise performance, we reported first quarter attributable net income of $0.04 per share. Normalized FFO per share in Q1 was ahead of our expectations at $0.74, led by property strength across the business, with total company same-store cash NOI increasing 8.1%. Q1 normalized FFO increased 4% year-over-year, adjusting for HHS funds received in the prior year. The year-over-year growth is largely explained by excellent SHOP NOI growth, partially offset by higher interest rates. Excluding the year-over-year impact of higher interest rates on floating rate debt, grew 11% in the first quarter. Now a few comments on our continued focus on financial strength and flexibility. We have the benefit of scale, liquidity and access to diverse forms of attractive capital. And we have an enviable multiyear organic cash flow growth opportunity. These strengths were evident in significant proactive measures taken so far this year. Some examples, we've raised nearly $1 billion already this year from diverse capital sources at attractive rates through a combination of senior loans, secured financing and asset sales, and have already substantially completed our 2023 refinancing requirements. We've now turned our focus to forward maturities. Last month, we proactively tapped the Canadian bond market upsizing after strong demand to a CAD600 million five-year senior note issuance at 5.398%, with proceeds principally used to repurchase our first tranche of debt maturing in April 2024. In addition to raising new funds, we're actively managed interest rate risk in a dynamic rate environment. Notably, in March, we executed 400 million of pay fixed, two-year interest rate swaps and at an attractive rate of 3.79%, improving our floating rate debt exposure by 160 basis points to approximately 10% in Q1 at the low end of our 10% to 20% target range. We have robust liquidity of 2.4 billion, increasing to over 2.6 billion when including additional asset sales expected in 2023. Our leverage at Q1 was 6.9x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, which was consistent with the prior quarter. Cash flow growth from our unprecedented organic NOI growth opportunity remains the most powerful driver to return to our pre-COVID 5x to 6x leverage target. A few comments on our capital plans vis-\u00e0-vis center, we expect to fund repayment of the nonrecourse senior loan which has been extended through June of 2024 on a long-term basis over time through a variety of capital sources, including asset sales. We remain committed to a strong balance sheet and our BBB+ credit rating. I'll conclude with our 2023 outlook. We are reaffirming our previously issued normalized FFO guidance for full year 2023 and at $2.90 to $3.04 per share or $2.97 per share at the midpoint. As a reminder, this normalized FFO range represents outstanding year-over-year organic property growth led by SHOP, partially offset by higher interest rates. We've also reaffirmed our enterprise and segment level same-store cash NOI guidance ranges. Two points in our reaffirmed guidance that I'd like to underscore; first, our current normalized FFO guidance range on Santerre is consistent with our prior range in February, but with a different P&L composition. Taking ownership of the Santerre portfolio on May 1, has the effect of increasing NOI from the assets as well as higher interest expense from the senior debt. Second, normalized FFO guidance also now incorporates 0.02 of dilution from the proactive refinancing in Canada, which was not included in prior guidance. A final thought on normalized FFO phasing, we expect FFO in the second quarter of 2023 to be roughly stable to the first quarter FFO of $0.73 when adjusted for the $0.01 triple net catch-up cash rent collection in Q1. Sequential growth in SHOP is offset by higher interest rates. As the key selling season and shock kicks in and interest rates plateau, FFO growth is expected to pick up in the balance of 23. To close, we began 2023 with a strong start. The entire Ventas team is enthusiastic about the future and focused on delivering superior performance. For Q&A, we ask each caller to stick to one question to be respectful to everyone on the line. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator.\nOperator: At this time, I'd like to remind everyone in order to First question comes from the line of Michael Griffin with Citi. Please go ahead.\nNick Joseph: It's actually Nick Joseph here with Michael. Just maybe on the Santerre portfolio, you talked about maximizing value and NOI over time. Just hoping you could quantify the opportunities that you see with the portfolio and how operationally you can get there?\nDebra Cafaro: Good morning. It's Debbie. Well, I think what you will see is the biggest part of the portfolio is really the MOBs, that have also been the most stable but are at probably 75% to 80% occupancy now. And so once we really put those under Pete and the team's expert oversight. We think there's upside there. On the SHOP, we would expect those assets, which are mostly for large-scale communities to benefit from the multiyear recovery and also the application of OI, again, over time. And then on the triple net health care, they've obviously been affected by COVID. They're mostly SNFs, and we would expect to see those trends that you are seeing in the SNF business improve over time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nNick Yulico: Maybe a question for Bob. I know last quarter and in the March presentation, you talked about a sequential somewhat flat FFO in the first quarter, I think, around $0.71, you did I guess, $0.74, you had that $0.01 triple net catch up, but it looks like it was about another $0.02 of additional benefit there. Just hoping to understand a little bit more what that outperformance was driven by?\nBob Probst: Sure, Nick. Well said. So $0.74, I would definitely highlight the penny on the triple net catch-up brand. So that's $0.02 of outperformance really across the property portfolio. It was general strength relatively across the board, and hence, the 8% same-store growth. So, it was broad-based strength, which we're feeling good about.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Jim Camrick with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nJim Camrick: Thinking about the progression for the shop NOI recovery, $300 million plus. Is that still fair to say that's a three- to four-year type objective? And what capital might be needed to achieve that in terms of a little bit higher occupancy and margin, if any? Just trying to think about the flow-through of that NOI potential.\nJustin Hutchens: It's Justin. Well, first of all, we're really encouraged by what we consider to be this early strong performance. It should be a multiyear recovery. As Debbie mentioned, the supply-demand characteristics are extremely favorable. The execution into this has been strong thus far. So we'd expect this to continue for a period of time, and we have a lot of upside. We're only 77% occupied in the U.S. We've taken actions to make sure we're well positioned to grow operationally and supported by the Ventas AI approach, and we've made CapEx investments. I've mentioned that there's been about 100 that are really completing like right now, and so that will start benefiting us now and in the foreseeable future. We do have more planned over time to help reposition and that's going to be mostly focused in this pool that I mentioned, which is the transition group. We have a very well-invested very strong performing legacy group that has really strong market position, which will also contribute to the growth and would require much less CapEx investment. So I don't think it's a really big number. I think we're spending about $1 million per community. We have 100 that have already completed, and there's more to come, and we'll talk about that in upcoming quarters.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nMike Mueller: I was curious. Do you anticipate keeping everything tied to the Santerre portfolio, particularly the SNF investments?\nDebra Cafaro: This is Debbie. Thanks for the question. I would say that we're really focused on maximizing the value in the NOI of all the assets, including that portfolio. As I mentioned, the vast majority of that are SNFs, they were affected by COVID, but I will tell you that they have -- SNFs are having some positive trends a lot of those SNFs are in states with good Medicaid reimbursement increases that are generally considered attractive states. But I'll also tell you, we haven't been shy in the past about selling nursing homes. So you can draw your own conclusions there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Conor Siversky with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nConor Siversky: Quickly on the MOBs and the Santerre portfolio, there's a note in the deck referencing the Lillibridge playbook. Could you provide any indication or expectation as to how much CapEx could go into these assets? And then what you expect the occupancy ramp to look like?\nPeter Bulgarelli: Sure, Conor. Thanks. This is Pete. We find the medical office building portfolio within Santerre to be interesting. There is a 75% overlap with the MOB, NOI in similar MSAs to ours. 75% affiliated with health systems. And we've got a 67% overlap. We like the fact they're on campus. We like the average age and the Walt is about the same as ours. But as you indicated, I mean, occupancy is an opportunity. It's 77%. Right now and also something that's relatively low and seems like an opportunity to us is an annual escalator average of 2.2%. So we think there's opportunity. Now both of those occupancy and escalators take time. You have to roll through the leases as they go. And so I think it's a multiyear opportunity for us but there is significant upside in this portfolio.\nDebra Cafaro: And Pete, maybe you could just address kind of the pyramid of how you've attacked our portfolio to generate those industry-leading kind of margins and retention and so on. There is a playbook of a pyramid.\nPeter Bulgarelli: Yes, absolutely. Yes. We view it as a pyramid. And do you have the right assets, and we feel like most of this portfolio is good for us. We need to be sure that the buildings are competitive in the marketplace. We need to be sure that the tenants are excited to be there, so we need to have high tenant satisfaction and strong relationships with the systems. We need to have a center of leasing excellence, and we need to run these buildings efficiently. And that's a Lillibridge playbook. We've improved performance dramatically in the core portfolio over the last four or five years, and we expect to do the same with Santerre.\nConor Siversky: Okay. And then one quick follow-up, if I may. Justin had mentioned that the yields on senior housing assets are pretty sticky in the current environment. So as you're addressing this select acquisition pipeline, I mean, could we expect to see more MOBs within that pool?\nJustin Hutchens: Yes, sure. So there's -- we're interested in high-quality, high-performing relationship-oriented transactions as our first priority. That can definitely include MOBs we would expect CS Class A senior housing as part of that as well. We are interested in pursuing high-growth assets as well. We anticipate there will be a market for that around senior housing in the upcoming quarters. So we're casting a wide net in terms of managing our pipeline, but being more narrowly focused in the near term and using our wide variety of sources of capital to pursue the higher-quality assets.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSteven Valiquette: So just quickly on Page 10 of the 1Q supplement. You showed the same-store trailing five-quarter comparison for the SHOP portfolio, which is helpful. And when looking at the to 2Q trend last year, sequentially, you had about 70 bps sequential occupancy improvement last year for 1Q to 2Q. So when kind of thinking about the sequential trends from 1Q to 2Q for this year, -- just curious if you think that 70 bps is a good proxy for sequential occupancy gains for that same-store pool this year? And also, are there any notable differences in those sequential trends that you expect in the U.S. versus Canada, thinking about that?\nJustin Hutchens: Yes. Sure. Good question. So we're really pleased that we gave full year guidance this year, and we're not getting into the descriptions around our performance expectations in each quarter. Last year, in terms of occupancy growth, it's pretty solid. It was even more in the prior year. I did mention in my prepared remarks that we have an aggressive occupancy ramp that we're expecting in support of our performance expectations, the key selling season starts now. So -- and we're well positioned, we think, to play within that. So we'll see how that plays out.\nSteven Valiquette: Okay. Just on the second part of that question, just conceptually between U.S. and Canada, anything worth calling out there one way or the other on thinking about it? Or is there nothing that sticks out at the moment?\nJustin Hutchens: Yes. Canada has an absolute much higher occupancy at 94% although they're still growing. And so they do experience a key selling season similar to the U.S., but they're working off of a much higher base.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMichael Carroll: Justin, I wanted to follow up on the 100 CapEx projects that you mentioned over the past few quarters within the SHOP portfolio. I'm not sure if you highlighted the yields on those deals? And do you take those projects out of same store, I guess, if not, is there an earnings drag coming in through the portfolio right now as you're doing those renovations?\nJustin Hutchens: Great question. We are not reporting the yields. We did give examples. Some of our early examples of communities, there's a few that are highlighted in the earnings deck. Obviously, we picked some of the better ones where we have leads that are up 150% versus prior year, and our NOI is up 400% year-over-year. And these communities that are relatively low NOI with a lot of upside benefiting from the operational turnaround and the capital investments. We're pleased to see the early results in communities like these. We expect that this is not necessarily a near-term driver of value creation. We think it's also more of a longer-term driver. When we look to invest into communities with this type of CapEx, we're looking at least for a double-digit return. Usually, it's like 10% to 15% return on that capital investment. That's -- there's a lot of moving parts to determine what the actual outcome was when you're measuring that. And to the other part of the question, these are in our same-store pool, and they do not come offline. So you'll see the full benefit of this execution in the same-store pool.\nBob Probst: As they're not particularly disruptive to the community.\nDebra Cafaro: They've been carefully kind of specked out show us to minimize current disruption in cash flows and occupancy.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJuan Sanabria: Just wanted a congratulations on the 20th anniversary. Thank you.\nDebra Cafaro: I was here for 24 plus.\nJuan Sanabria: Just wanted to ask a couple of questions on Santerre. So excuse the kind of multipart question, but I guess, -- what is the expected leverage impact? And is that inclusive of keeping the NFS, which sounds like they may be sold? And on the SNF, can you give us a sense of the total number of units or the rent coverage there? And just the last one, if you don't mind, is the seniors housing or SHOP piece, is that traditional seniors housing or CCRCs because they sounded like they were chunkier assets?\nDebra Cafaro: So, I'm going to get Bob to answer the first, and that's on a status quo basis.\nBob Probst: Status quo day one leverage is about 30 basis points impact, Juan.\nDebra Cafaro: And then in terms of the senior housing, I would say, as I mentioned, the vast majority of the NOI is coming from these large-scale communities, which are all rental based and they're in good markets. And so those are -- some people call them rental CCRCs, other people call them senior housing communities. It's a nomenclature. But they're very large communities with high replacement costs in good markets, with a pre-existing operator that we have. And so that's the answer to that question. Then on the SNF, there's about 5,000 beds in the health care triple-net portfolio and -- in terms of coverage, we want to -- we'll do that at the appropriate time once we feel confident in the reported operating results and at the appropriate time, consistent with our policies.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nTayo Okusanya: Yes. we better say happy birthday, happy 21st as well. Life Sciences, I'm just kind of curious, again, during the quarter, with the same-store numbers, kind of large increases in same-store apex, some occupancy pressures as well. Just kind of talk us through some of kind of what happened specifically during the quarter. I think it's a portfolio where I think in the past few quarters have got occupancy losses. So just trying to understand exactly what's happening and what one can expect going forward.\nPeter Bulgarelli: Sure. Thanks, Tayo. This is Pete. Good to hear from you. So look, from an operating perspective, in the same-store pool, there was a decline Bob had described that because of the holdover rent in the first quarter last year. It's adjusted for 3.2%. There's another adjustment that you should be aware of and that affected the OpEx, which also affects the NOI. Last year, we -- in the first quarter, we had a TIF credit, a large TIF credit, which is accounted for as a contra expense. And so as a result, as opposed to an 8.8% OpEx growth, it was 5.6%, if you look at it from a true organic perspective, which is below inflation. So I'm happy with that OpEx number. And then if you run it through NOI, once again, organically, not thinking about the holdover rent, not thinking about the TIF onetime TIF credit, Same-store NOI growth was 5%. And I'm pretty happy with 5% NOI growth in this environment for Life Sciences. But I'm actually even more happy about is really our leasing momentum right now. Leasing in the first quarter of '23 was well over twice what it was in first quarter of '22, substantially ahead of fourth quarter '22 as well. And what's interesting about our leasing pipeline is 60% institutional. And it's really because our focus is on the university-based life sciences markets. So they're dominated typically by government entities, universities, health systems, so on and so forth. And so they don't move very quickly, but they do move and is kind of regardless of inflation either way or life industry conditions, and so we feel very good about our pipeline, and we think it bodes well for the future.\nTayo Okusanya: Got you. And when do all these one-timers normalize out so we can get to kind of true underlying strength, and also any commentary about occupancy as well would be helpful just kind of given some of the occupancy declines in the past few quarters?\nDebra Cafaro: Yes. Without those two prior year items, it would be 5% same-store cash NOI growth.\nPeter Bulgarelli: Yes. And we have had some office tenants decide either not to renew their lease or downsize. As we said in previous calls, it's an opportunity in some cases for us to transition to lab space, and we're seeing good momentum in those lab conversions. So we're optimistic about that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRonald Kamdem: Just a quick one. Looking through the presentation, just the two things that jumped out. One was the pricing power slide. I think you guys have 11% plus rent increases. I think last quarter, you added 10%. So number one, I might sell to take that, that pricing is actually accelerating going into the selling season? And then number two, if I may, if I look at the NOI opportunity slide, you're talking about a potential long-term target now of 1 billion in NOI. I think previously, that number was 900 million. Maybe can you just walk us through what's driving that delta?\nDebra Cafaro: Yes. Bob, do you want to take the chart question?\nBob Probst: Sure. Yes. We chose to simplify the methodology, honestly, to determine what the potential is after a lot of questions around what the assumptions are and basically just say, look, pre-COVID -- occupancy was 88% and margins where NOI margins were 30% on the portfolio at that time. And hence, to get to that level, what's the NOI opportunity, and that's the 300 million. And on the portfolio today, that equates to $1 billion of NOI. And so it's really both simplification and aligning with some fear disclosure, frankly, that drives the change.\nDebra Cafaro: And so that's the recovery opportunity as we think about the unprecedented kind of organic growth that could be in front of us, to get back to that level. And then as I mentioned, the conditions on the ground right now are more favorable than they were at a time prior to 2014 when occupancies go into the low 90s. And so, that's kind of the dream scenario if we can we can do that and the conditions do exist on the supply-demand side to potentially overshoot the pre-COVID targets.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. And what about...\nDebra Cafaro: Pricing?\nJustin Hutchens: Yes, I can jump in, Justin. So, on the pricing, you mentioned the slide we're showing that the contributors we have rent increases over 11%. And by the way, we have over half of our residents that will have contributed to those rent increases now at this stage. So that's great, care pricing up 9% year-over-year and the street rates up. So I mentioned RevPOR is up 6.8%. We have all of these positive contributors to that. There's a little nuances, for instance, in care pricing. Last year, there was a big spike in agency and therefore, a move to accelerate the growth in care pricing. In response to that, we're comparing to that number on a year-over-year basis. And so it's just normalized a bit. Street rates, these are very strong. They're also contributing to our positive re-leasing spreads that we've had in the first quarter where our new move-ins are paying more than people moving out on the same unit basis, which is great. We would also point out that we continue to expect to see that improve over time. As Debbie mentioned, there's a really strong supply/demand backdrop. And one thing that should happen in time is those street rate growth rates should start to match closer to the in-house rent increases, maybe in some cases, even getting ahead. We're just not there yet. There's still a lag. It's definitely growing. The market is supporting the higher pricing at the street rate level, and we would expect that over time to become even better.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is George on for Vikram. Could you provide more color on CapEx for the remaining of the year? And any anecdotes of benefits to senior housing ramp from it?\nBob Probst: Sure. So I'll focus on redev CapEx because that's really the emphasis of our shop investment that Justin was highlighting. We expect $230 million this year of redev spend. That's really not only the completion of the projects, which really started last year and are completing for the key selling season but also the pipeline of opportunities behind that we see, and that adds up to 230 million. And as a use of cash in our view, is one of the highest return opportunities that we have. So we're going to invest behind those assets.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please go ahead.\nJohn Pawlowski: Justin, just curious what type of growth rates are you seeing your housing operators expecting this year on wage increases for the full-time employees?\nJustin Hutchens: Yes, sure. So, we've -- first of all, expenses are exactly on track to where we expected a 5% growth. Within that, the labor is the biggest piece is 60% of the expenses. We're pleased to see that the agency cost has come down. That's down to 3.3% of total labor, which is the lowest it's been -- so you have that happening. And then as you -- the net hiring has been improving and you're bringing in new people, you're onboarding, you're paying for the onboarding, so there's an offset that you see. And when I said that, there could be opportunity for improvement -- really what I'm speaking about is the opportunity for agency to continue to trend down, if it does, and then getting past the period where you have this onboarding costs. And so -- we'll see how that plays out. We certainly haven't changed any guidance or anything like that. And so far, we're right on track with the 5% overall.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. But on a per FTE, I'm just trying to get a sense for kind of comp per occupied bed moving forward? What's kind of the structural per FTE wage growth your operators are seeing this year?\nDebra Cafaro: Yes. It's higher than the 5%. So that's consistent with what we're seeing in the macro environment as you look at wage inflation, which is improving, but is improving relatively slowly. And so the benefit that we're seeing overall in labor is that the year-over-year growth rates are moderating considerably in the aggregate our ability to predict them has been very good, I would say. And within that agency is coming out at a good pace, -- and we're getting that installed base, which is very positive, but we're assuming there is reasonable wage unit inflation in that installed base. But we're still coming out ahead, and that's the key point. And as Justin said, your care is better in your culture and your communities better as you get a higher installed base. So I hope that answers your question.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Austin Worsmith with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Just wanted to hit on the shop occupancy again, I'm curious, I know you guys had expected some seasonality, but did the level of sequential occupancy decrease in 1Q surprised you at all given how strong the leading indicators were to start the year? And then I'm just curious if there were any move-outs concentrated with any segment or region of the portfolio or pushback related to rent increases that drove some of that?\nJustin Hutchens: Sure. So first of all, the first quarter occupancy was exactly as expected. We had predicted that we'd have typical seasonality. We did. So we're right on track in that regard. To your comment, leads have been very strong. Move-ins in the first quarter were higher than the prior year and higher than 2019. There's been move out. Some of that I mentioned on the last earnings call were driven their financially-driven move-outs, which is typical, particularly when rents were pushed as high as they were, this year. So, no surprises whatsoever in terms of the execution so far and we'll look forward to seeing how the key selling season plays out.\nOperator: With that, I'll turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.\nDebra Cafaro: Thank you, operator, and I want to say thank you very much to all of the participants for your interest in and support of our company. We're really happy to deliver an excellent quarter on your behalf. We look forward to seeing you in person in June.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bob Probst",
            "content": "Thanks, Justin. I'm happy to report a strong start to the year with results ahead of our expectations. I'll share some highlights of our Q1 performance, discuss our balance sheet and close with our reaffirmed 2023 normalized FFO guidance. Starting with some highlights from our office segment. Our Medical Office business outperformed once again in the first quarter with same-store cash NOI growth of 3.1%, Ventas' MOB NOI growth and margins are best-in-class. Meanwhile, our university-based R&I same-store cash NOI increased over 3%, adjusting for $1 million of holdover rent received in the prior year. In terms of overall enterprise performance, we reported first quarter attributable net income of $0.04 per share. Normalized FFO per share in Q1 was ahead of our expectations at $0.74, led by property strength across the business, with total company same-store cash NOI increasing 8.1%. Q1 normalized FFO increased 4% year-over-year, adjusting for HHS funds received in the prior year. The year-over-year growth is largely explained by excellent SHOP NOI growth, partially offset by higher interest rates. Excluding the year-over-year impact of higher interest rates on floating rate debt, grew 11% in the first quarter. Now a few comments on our continued focus on financial strength and flexibility. We have the benefit of scale, liquidity and access to diverse forms of attractive capital. And we have an enviable multiyear organic cash flow growth opportunity. These strengths were evident in significant proactive measures taken so far this year. Some examples, we've raised nearly $1 billion already this year from diverse capital sources at attractive rates through a combination of senior loans, secured financing and asset sales, and have already substantially completed our 2023 refinancing requirements. We've now turned our focus to forward maturities. Last month, we proactively tapped the Canadian bond market upsizing after strong demand to a CAD600 million five-year senior note issuance at 5.398%, with proceeds principally used to repurchase our first tranche of debt maturing in April 2024. In addition to raising new funds, we're actively managed interest rate risk in a dynamic rate environment. Notably, in March, we executed 400 million of pay fixed, two-year interest rate swaps and at an attractive rate of 3.79%, improving our floating rate debt exposure by 160 basis points to approximately 10% in Q1 at the low end of our 10% to 20% target range. We have robust liquidity of 2.4 billion, increasing to over 2.6 billion when including additional asset sales expected in 2023. Our leverage at Q1 was 6.9x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, which was consistent with the prior quarter. Cash flow growth from our unprecedented organic NOI growth opportunity remains the most powerful driver to return to our pre-COVID 5x to 6x leverage target. A few comments on our capital plans vis-a\u0300-vis center, we expect to fund repayment of the nonrecourse senior loan which has been extended through June of 2024 on a long-term basis over time through a variety of capital sources, including asset sales. We remain committed to a strong balance sheet and our BBB+ credit rating. I'll conclude with our 2023 outlook. We are reaffirming our previously issued normalized FFO guidance for full year 2023 and at $2.90 to $3.04 per share or $2.97 per share at the midpoint. As a reminder, this normalized FFO range represents outstanding year-over-year organic property growth led by SHOP, partially offset by higher interest rates. We've also reaffirmed our enterprise and segment level same-store cash NOI guidance ranges. Two points in our reaffirmed guidance that I'd like to underscore; first, our current normalized FFO guidance range on Santerre is consistent with our prior range in February, but with a different P&L composition. Taking ownership of the Santerre portfolio on May 1, has the effect of increasing NOI from the assets as well as higher interest expense from the senior debt. Second, normalized FFO guidance also now incorporates 0.02 of dilution from the proactive refinancing in Canada, which was not included in prior guidance. A final thought on normalized FFO phasing, we expect FFO in the second quarter of 2023 to be roughly stable to the first quarter FFO of $0.73 when adjusted for the $0.01 triple net catch-up cash rent collection in Q1. Sequential growth in SHOP is offset by higher interest rates. As the key selling season and shock kicks in and interest rates plateau, FFO growth is expected to pick up in the balance of 23. To close, we began 2023 with a strong start. The entire Ventas team is enthusiastic about the future and focused on delivering superior performance. For Q&A, we ask each caller to stick to one question to be respectful to everyone on the line. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator. Sure, Nick. Well said. So $0.74, I would definitely highlight the penny on the triple net catch-up brand. So that's $0.02 of outperformance really across the property portfolio. It was general strength relatively across the board, and hence, the 8% same-store growth. So, it was broad-based strength, which we're feeling good about. As they're not particularly disruptive to the community. Status quo day one leverage is about 30 basis points impact, Juan. Sure. Yes. We chose to simplify the methodology, honestly, to determine what the potential is after a lot of questions around what the assumptions are and basically just say, look, pre-COVID -- occupancy was 88% and margins where NOI margins were 30% on the portfolio at that time. And hence, to get to that level, what's the NOI opportunity, and that's the 300 million. And on the portfolio today, that equates to $1 billion of NOI. And so it's really both simplification and aligning with some fear disclosure, frankly, that drives the change. Sure. So I'll focus on redev CapEx because that's really the emphasis of our shop investment that Justin was highlighting. We expect $230 million this year of redev spend. That's really not only the completion of the projects, which really started last year and are completing for the key selling season but also the pipeline of opportunities behind that we see, and that adds up to 230 million. And as a use of cash in our view, is one of the highest return opportunities that we have. So we're going to invest behind those assets."

            "content": "Sure, Conor. Thanks. This is Pete. We find the medical office building portfolio within Santerre to be interesting. There is a 75% overlap with the MOB, NOI in similar MSAs to ours. 75% affiliated with health systems. And we've got a 67% overlap. We like the fact they're on campus. We like the average age and the Walt is about the same as ours. But as you indicated, I mean, occupancy is an opportunity. It's 77%. Right now and also something that's relatively low and seems like an opportunity to us is an annual escalator average of 2.2%. So we think there's opportunity. Now both of those occupancy and escalators take time. You have to roll through the leases as they go. And so I think it's a multiyear opportunity for us but there is significant upside in this portfolio. Yes, absolutely. Yes. We view it as a pyramid. And do you have the right assets, and we feel like most of this portfolio is good for us. We need to be sure that the buildings are competitive in the marketplace. We need to be sure that the tenants are excited to be there, so we need to have high tenant satisfaction and strong relationships with the systems. We need to have a center of leasing excellence, and we need to run these buildings efficiently. And that's a Lillibridge playbook. We've improved performance dramatically in the core portfolio over the last four or five years, and we expect to do the same with Santerre. Sure. Thanks, Tayo. This is Pete. Good to hear from you. So look, from an operating perspective, in the same-store pool, there was a decline Bob had described that because of the holdover rent in the first quarter last year. It's adjusted for 3.2%. There's another adjustment that you should be aware of and that affected the OpEx, which also affects the NOI. Last year, we -- in the first quarter, we had a TIF credit, a large TIF credit, which is accounted for as a contra expense. And so as a result, as opposed to an 8.8% OpEx growth, it was 5.6%, if you look at it from a true organic perspective, which is below inflation. So I'm happy with that OpEx number. And then if you run it through NOI, once again, organically, not thinking about the holdover rent, not thinking about the TIF onetime TIF credit, Same-store NOI growth was 5%. And I'm pretty happy with 5% NOI growth in this environment for Life Sciences. But I'm actually even more happy about is really our leasing momentum right now. Leasing in the first quarter of '23 was well over twice what it was in first quarter of '22, substantially ahead of fourth quarter '22 as well. And what's interesting about our leasing pipeline is 60% institutional. And it's really because our focus is on the university-based life sciences markets. So they're dominated typically by government entities, universities, health systems, so on and so forth. And so they don't move very quickly, but they do move and is kind of regardless of inflation either way or life industry conditions, and so we feel very good about our pipeline, and we think it bodes well for the future. Yes. And we have had some office tenants decide either not to renew their lease or downsize. As we said in previous calls, it's an opportunity in some cases for us to transition to lab space, and we're seeing good momentum in those lab conversions. So we're optimistic about that."

            "name": "Justin Hutchens",
            "content": "Thank you, Debbie. I'll start by covering our shop trends in the first quarter. Our SHOP portfolio continues to deliver exceptional results, exceeding our expectations with strong year-over-year growth driven by pricing power and cost control. SHOP NOI grew 17.4% as margin expanded 200 basis points. Notably, the U.S. led the way with 22.4% growth, attributable to strong performance in our legacy Atria and Sunrise portfolios and our transition communities with assisted living being the biggest contributor to the growth. Our Canadian portfolio, which grew 5%, continues to be a beacon of stability and high performance with exceptional margins and consistently high occupancy above 90% and in each and every quarter since the first quarter of 2019. This portfolio remains a reliable source of growing cash flow, buoyed by Le Groupe Maurice performance. The revenue growth in our portfolio remains strong. With a notable 8% year-over-year increase, the revenue growth was largely driven by the continued acceleration of RevPOR, which is a testament to the strength of our business model and our operators' unwavering commitment to delivering exceptional value to their residents. Our pricing power continues to be a driving force behind our success. In fact, we've experienced the strongest year-over-year RevPOR growth we've seen in the last 10 years, with an impressive 6.8% increase. This growth was primarily due to in-house rent and care increases as well as improving releasing spreads. In addition, we also saw a robust sequential RevPAR growth of 4.1% in spite of the fact that one of our large operators pulled forward their rent increases to the fourth quarter, which causes a less favorable comp. These results are a testament to our continued efforts to optimize pricing. Occupancy grew 80 basis points year-over-year and was down 90 basis points sequentially, in line with typical seasonality as expected. Moving on to expenses. Operating expenses grew 5% year-over-year, which is in line with expectations. Within OpEx, labor, which is 60% of the spend is playing out as expected. As the permanent employee base is increasing and replacing contract labor. That hiring has continued its positive trend for six consecutive quarters, causing contract labor to reduce by 59% year-over-year. We believe there is still room for improvement in this area, which will result in cost reduction and also improve the consistency and quality of care delivery. At Ventas, we've been committed to staying ahead of the curve when it comes to optimizing our portfolio and executing on our strategy through our right market, right asset, right operator approach, which is anchored by Ventas OI, our best-in-class data analytics platform and informed by experiential insights. Through this approach, we're leveraging data and insights to select the most promising markets for capital investments and operational improvement by carefully selecting communities are well positioned for success within those markets, identifying specific operational improvements and partnering with the right operators to drive exceptional performance. For instance, let's take a closer look at the strong performance in the U.S. I'd like to highlight that NOI growth of 22.4% was broad-based across the U.S. I'll discuss this in the context of our legacy portfolio which contains 234 long-held communities representing 71% of the U.S. same-store shop NOI and our transition portfolio, which contains 200 communities that have transitioned to new operators since the beginning of 2021 and represents 29% of the U.S. same-store shop NOI. A legacy portfolio had strong growth at 20% and our transition portfolio delivered an even better NOI growth rate of 30% on a lower NOI base. Our meticulous and strategic approach in selecting the right operators for the group of transition assets is backed by our Ventas OI methodology and CapEx investments, which is paying off and generating outstanding NOI growth. Notably, Discovery Senior Living, a Dallas and Priority Life Care are among the numerous operators that contributed significantly to the growth in the first quarter. And the future growth prospects for this group of communities across all of our operators are truly exciting. I'll double-click on Discovery is an example of the value creation thus far backed by Ventas OI. We transitioned 16 assisted living communities to them in the fourth quarter of 2021. These communities are located in a tight geographic area and in existing discovery markets. When comparing the first quarter of 2022 to 2023, their portfolio achieved 770 basis points of occupancy growth, and grew NOI by many multiples thus far. We completed 13 of the 15 planned NOI-generating CapEx projects in this portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2022. We look forward to more successful performance as these communities have benefited from a strong operational turnaround and should also benefit from the repositioning in their markets moving forward. We've seen similar results in the Priory Life and Sedaris portfolios. These are great examples of Ventas OI in collaboration with an operator with a strong regional focus delivering excellent results. We invested in the right markets with the right operators and ensure the assets are positioned well for success. We've also shared a few community-specific examples in our earnings deck. We are pleased to announce, as expected, that we are delivering over 100 NOI-generating CapEx projects in our SHOP portfolio, which when combined with the operational improvements that are already well underway -- will significantly enhance the market position of our communities in terms of rate and occupancy over time. We are already seeing excellent early returns, which is a testament to the effectiveness of our strategy and our commitment to delivering exceptional value creation, and we have more attractive opportunities planned in the near future. With the right investments and strategic focus, we believe that we have an extraordinary opportunity to drive NOI recovery in the SHOP portfolio that Debbie mentioned with the potential to generate over $1 billion in NOI when the portfolio reaches 88% occupancy and a 30% margin. While there is still work to be done to realize this potential, we're pleased with the progress we've made so far. In the first quarter of this year, our annualized run rate for NOI in the SHOP portfolio was $682 million, continuing a trajectory of growth and success. Looking ahead, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of 15% to 21% NOI growth in our year-over-year SHOP same-store pool. We expect a significant occupancy ramp throughout the year, supported by an accelerating aging demographic and muted new supply. As we approach the key selling season, which starts now. We are encouraged by very strong lead volume year-to-date and the quarter is off to a good start. Now I'll comment on investment activity. Our pipeline remains active, and our team is evaluating a select group of potential investments. high-quality, stable assets and those trading below replacement costs with growth potential are still commanding relatively low cap rates of 5% to 6%. We are seeing market disconnects as asset pricing is not fully reflecting the rising cost of capital. We are, however, seeing recent examples where the bid-ask spread is tightening, especially in Class A senior housing. We are prioritizing smaller, high-quality, high-performing relationship-oriented transactions. NOI generating CapEx remains our highest and best use of capital as we continue to drive the SHOP recovery. With that, I'll hand over to Bob. It's Justin. Well, first of all, we're really encouraged by what we consider to be this early strong performance. It should be a multiyear recovery. As Debbie mentioned, the supply-demand characteristics are extremely favorable. The execution into this has been strong thus far. So we'd expect this to continue for a period of time, and we have a lot of upside. We're only 77% occupied in the U.S. We've taken actions to make sure we're well positioned to grow operationally and supported by the Ventas AI approach, and we've made CapEx investments. I've mentioned that there's been about 100 that are really completing like right now, and so that will start benefiting us now and in the foreseeable future. We do have more planned over time to help reposition and that's going to be mostly focused in this pool that I mentioned, which is the transition group. We have a very well-invested very strong performing legacy group that has really strong market position, which will also contribute to the growth and would require much less CapEx investment. So I don't think it's a really big number. I think we're spending about $1 million per community. We have 100 that have already completed, and there's more to come, and we'll talk about that in upcoming quarters. Yes, sure. So there's -- we're interested in high-quality, high-performing relationship-oriented transactions as our first priority. That can definitely include MOBs we would expect CS Class A senior housing as part of that as well. We are interested in pursuing high-growth assets as well. We anticipate there will be a market for that around senior housing in the upcoming quarters. So we're casting a wide net in terms of managing our pipeline, but being more narrowly focused in the near term and using our wide variety of sources of capital to pursue the higher-quality assets. Yes. Sure. Good question. So we're really pleased that we gave full year guidance this year, and we're not getting into the descriptions around our performance expectations in each quarter. Last year, in terms of occupancy growth, it's pretty solid. It was even more in the prior year. I did mention in my prepared remarks that we have an aggressive occupancy ramp that we're expecting in support of our performance expectations, the key selling season starts now. So -- and we're well positioned, we think, to play within that. So we'll see how that plays out. Yes. Canada has an absolute much higher occupancy at 94% although they're still growing. And so they do experience a key selling season similar to the U.S., but they're working off of a much higher base. Great question. We are not reporting the yields. We did give examples. Some of our early examples of communities, there's a few that are highlighted in the earnings deck. Obviously, we picked some of the better ones where we have leads that are up 150% versus prior year, and our NOI is up 400% year-over-year. And these communities that are relatively low NOI with a lot of upside benefiting from the operational turnaround and the capital investments. We're pleased to see the early results in communities like these. We expect that this is not necessarily a near-term driver of value creation. We think it's also more of a longer-term driver. When we look to invest into communities with this type of CapEx, we're looking at least for a double-digit return. Usually, it's like 10% to 15% return on that capital investment. That's -- there's a lot of moving parts to determine what the actual outcome was when you're measuring that. And to the other part of the question, these are in our same-store pool, and they do not come offline. So you'll see the full benefit of this execution in the same-store pool. Yes, I can jump in, Justin. So, on the pricing, you mentioned the slide we're showing that the contributors we have rent increases over 11%. And by the way, we have over half of our residents that will have contributed to those rent increases now at this stage. So that's great, care pricing up 9% year-over-year and the street rates up. So I mentioned RevPOR is up 6.8%. We have all of these positive contributors to that. There's a little nuances, for instance, in care pricing. Last year, there was a big spike in agency and therefore, a move to accelerate the growth in care pricing. In response to that, we're comparing to that number on a year-over-year basis. And so it's just normalized a bit. Street rates, these are very strong. They're also contributing to our positive re-leasing spreads that we've had in the first quarter where our new move-ins are paying more than people moving out on the same unit basis, which is great. We would also point out that we continue to expect to see that improve over time. As Debbie mentioned, there's a really strong supply/demand backdrop. And one thing that should happen in time is those street rate growth rates should start to match closer to the in-house rent increases, maybe in some cases, even getting ahead. We're just not there yet. There's still a lag. It's definitely growing. The market is supporting the higher pricing at the street rate level, and we would expect that over time to become even better. Yes, sure. So, we've -- first of all, expenses are exactly on track to where we expected a 5% growth. Within that, the labor is the biggest piece is 60% of the expenses. We're pleased to see that the agency cost has come down. That's down to 3.3% of total labor, which is the lowest it's been -- so you have that happening. And then as you -- the net hiring has been improving and you're bringing in new people, you're onboarding, you're paying for the onboarding, so there's an offset that you see. And when I said that, there could be opportunity for improvement -- really what I'm speaking about is the opportunity for agency to continue to trend down, if it does, and then getting past the period where you have this onboarding costs. And so -- we'll see how that plays out. We certainly haven't changed any guidance or anything like that. And so far, we're right on track with the 5% overall. Sure. So first of all, the first quarter occupancy was exactly as expected. We had predicted that we'd have typical seasonality. We did. So we're right on track in that regard. To your comment, leads have been very strong. Move-ins in the first quarter were higher than the prior year and higher than 2019. There's been move out. Some of that I mentioned on the last earnings call were driven their financially-driven move-outs, which is typical, particularly when rents were pushed as high as they were, this year. So, no surprises whatsoever in terms of the execution so far and we'll look forward to seeing how the key selling season plays out."

            "name": "Debra Cafaro",
            "content": "Thanks, BJ, and good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants. Welcome to the Ventas First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. I'm excited to speak with you today as we recap an outstanding first quarter underscore the momentum we have across our large and diverse enterprise and reaffirm our full year normalized FFO guidance of $2.90 to $3.04 per share. Our diversified business is unified in serving a large and growing aging population. Within commercial real estate, we are highly advantaged due to favorable demographic demand, the unprecedented organic growth opportunity we are already starting to realize and our scale, liquidity and access to capital. As a team, we are enthusiastic about the future and focused on delivering superior performance. The success we achieved in the first quarter was powered by our high-quality shop business, where the U.S. communities grew 22%, bolstered by the growth of our highly occupied Canadian communities. Our other asset classes are also contributing reliable compounding growth. With MOBs outperforming and our university centered life science R&I business benefiting from strong tenant mix, with significant demand from universities, health systems, investment-grade companies and government institutions. The multiyear growth and recovery cycle in senior housing is well underway. We have already started to capture the significant NOI upside opportunity in our current results. Looking forward, we project an incremental $300-plus million of additional NOI opportunity available from simply reaching pre-pandemic margins and occupancy of 88% in the portfolio. Beyond that target, we believe that above 90% occupancy and higher margins are also attainable because current supply-demand conditions are materially more favorable than they were during the last peak period. With 99% of our shop communities located in markets without competing new supply barriers to new construction starts and our senior housing team using operational insights to collaborate with operators and drive results. These conditions present a compelling multiyear growth opportunity. Turning to capital. The $30-plus billion scale of our platform, our liquidity and our diverse geographic footprint and business model give us access to multiple sources of attractive capital. We remain committed to a strong balance sheet and our BBB+ ratings. Our third-party institutional capital management business, VIM, is also a competitive advantage for Ventas. With over $5 billion in assets under management, VIM provides a way for us to capitalize on attractive investments through cycles. In the current environment, VIM provides us and our VIM stakeholders with interesting investment opportunities. Overall, on the investment front, we're focused on assets with outsized embedded growth at or below replacement cost pricing and high-quality stabilized assets and portfolios with good risk reward in a variety of economic conditions. Now let me spend a minute on results. First quarter normalized FFO was $0.74 per share with year-over-year total company same-store cash NOI growth of over 8%. Our performance was fueled by significant property NOI growth led by SHOP. Pete Bulgarelli and his team once again delivered excellent MOB performance, generating our seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year occupancy growth and industry-leading NOI margin. As well as extending our track record of over 3% same-store NOI growth to six of the last seven quarters. Now let me touch on some other key highlights of our enterprise. Our non-property strategic investments continue to generate value. We just closed on the partial sale of our equity investment in Ardent Health Services, yielding approximately $50 million in total proceeds. This transaction is a testament to our partner, Sam Zell's ability to make outstanding investments, attract quality investors, and find excellent management teams. The price represents a greater than 4x equity multiple on Ventas' original investment basis. We retained an approximately 7.5% stake in Ardent with an implied valuation of $150 million. On May 1, we completed our previously announced plan to take ownership of the Santerre portfolio, consisting of MOBs, shop communities and triple net leased health care facilities. We believe that the conversion of our cash pay mezzanine loan into real estate ownership should produce FFO within our previously announced guidance range and that the value of the assets at March 31 approximated $1.5 billion, which is the sum of the debt stack. Our experienced team is now focused on maximizing both the value and the NOI of the portfolio over time. It's important to realize that the expected FFO contribution we are forecasting from this loan to own is substantially consistent with what we would have generated if our mezz loan had been paid in full at maturity, and we reinvested the proceeds and debt pay down. Our strong ESG practices also drive value for Ventas' stakeholders. We were proud to receive the 2023 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year sustained excellence in Energy Management Award, the highest honor awarded by ENERGY STAR. We are also committed to best-in-class corporate governance practices and are proud of the excellence independence and diversity of our Board. Finally, we were honored to recently celebrate Ventas' 25-year anniversary. I want to publicly thank all my Ventas colleagues and Board members, past and present, partners and stakeholders, including those of you listening today, who have made the significant milestone possible. With our momentum and a cohesive experience team at Ventas, we are optimistic about the prospects for our next 25 years. And now I'll turn the call over to Justin. Good morning. It's Debbie. Well, I think what you will see is the biggest part of the portfolio is really the MOBs, that have also been the most stable but are at probably 75% to 80% occupancy now. And so once we really put those under Pete and the team's expert oversight. We think there's upside there. On the SHOP, we would expect those assets, which are mostly for large-scale communities to benefit from the multiyear recovery and also the application of OI, again, over time. And then on the triple net health care, they've obviously been affected by COVID. They're mostly SNFs, and we would expect to see those trends that you are seeing in the SNF business improve over time. This is Debbie. Thanks for the question. I would say that we're really focused on maximizing the value in the NOI of all the assets, including that portfolio. As I mentioned, the vast majority of that are SNFs, they were affected by COVID, but I will tell you that they have -- SNFs are having some positive trends a lot of those SNFs are in states with good Medicaid reimbursement increases that are generally considered attractive states. But I'll also tell you, we haven't been shy in the past about selling nursing homes. So you can draw your own conclusions there. And Pete, maybe you could just address kind of the pyramid of how you've attacked our portfolio to generate those industry-leading kind of margins and retention and so on. There is a playbook of a pyramid. They've been carefully kind of specked out show us to minimize current disruption in cash flows and occupancy. I was here for 24 plus. So, I'm going to get Bob to answer the first, and that's on a status quo basis. And then in terms of the senior housing, I would say, as I mentioned, the vast majority of the NOI is coming from these large-scale communities, which are all rental based and they're in good markets. And so those are -- some people call them rental CCRCs, other people call them senior housing communities. It's a nomenclature. But they're very large communities with high replacement costs in good markets, with a pre-existing operator that we have. And so that's the answer to that question. Then on the SNF, there's about 5,000 beds in the health care triple-net portfolio and -- in terms of coverage, we want to -- we'll do that at the appropriate time once we feel confident in the reported operating results and at the appropriate time, consistent with our policies. Yes. Without those two prior year items, it would be 5% same-store cash NOI growth. Yes. Bob, do you want to take the chart question? And so that's the recovery opportunity as we think about the unprecedented kind of organic growth that could be in front of us, to get back to that level. And then as I mentioned, the conditions on the ground right now are more favorable than they were at a time prior to 2014 when occupancies go into the low 90s. And so, that's kind of the dream scenario if we can we can do that and the conditions do exist on the supply-demand side to potentially overshoot the pre-COVID targets. Pricing? Yes. It's higher than the 5%. So that's consistent with what we're seeing in the macro environment as you look at wage inflation, which is improving, but is improving relatively slowly. And so the benefit that we're seeing overall in labor is that the year-over-year growth rates are moderating considerably in the aggregate our ability to predict them has been very good, I would say. And within that agency is coming out at a good pace, -- and we're getting that installed base, which is very positive, but we're assuming there is reasonable wage unit inflation in that installed base. But we're still coming out ahead, and that's the key point. And as Justin said, your care is better in your culture and your communities better as you get a higher installed base. So I hope that answers your question. Thank you, operator, and I want to say thank you very much to all of the participants for your interest in and support of our company. We're really happy to deliver an excellent quarter on your behalf. We look forward to seeing you in person in June."

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Ventas Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to BJ Grant, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.\nBill Grant: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Ventas 2024 third quarter results conference call.

Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and a variety of topics may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in such statements.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Debra Cafaro, Chairman and CEO of Ventas.\nDebra Cafaro: Thank you BJ. I want to welcome all of our shareholders and other participants to the Ventas third quarter 2024 earnings call. Today, I will discuss Ventas' strong results in the quarter and our improved 2024 expectations as we execute on our Focus 123 [ph] strategy to capture the unprecedented multiyear growth opportunity in senior housing. As one of the largest participants in the longevity economy, Ventas thrives in meeting demand from a large and growing aging population. Within this favorable macro environment, we are taking two clear actions to deliver results and growth, now and into the future. First, we are driving profitable organic growth in our senior housing operating portfolio, generating our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit NOI growth from our [indiscernible] SHOP business. Our team is using its experiential insights and data analytics to propel results and take advantage of this unique opportunity of favorable supply-demand in senior housing. Second, at the same time, we are ramping up our investments in senior housing. Here, we also enjoy a compelling value creation opportunity of private-to-public arbitrage. We can and are acquiring assets with highly attractive financial return expectations at accretive year 1 yield that expand our senior housing footprint, increase our enterprise growth rate, and strengthen our balance sheet. We rarely see this powerful combination of organic and external growth opportunities, and we are dedicating our resources to seed them to create value for our stakeholders. Before I unpack those themes, let's get to the numbers. Ventas delivered $0.80 of normalized FFO per share in the third quarter, reflecting 7% year-over-year increase driven by occupancy and revenue outperformance. This result was powered by SHOP with 15% year-over-year cash NOI growth. Total same-store cash NOI grew nearly 8% and our credit statistics continue to improve. As a result, we're once again raising our 2024 normalized FFO per share guidance, as well as our SHOP and Total Company same-store cash NOI expectations. As we execute our strategy, SHOP organic growth is the engine and is powering us forward. Year-to-date, SHOP NOI has increased nearly 16% and our RevPOR, OpExPOR spread is a strong 300 basis points, leading to margin expansion. Margin is increasing and should expand further as occupancies continue to rise and operating leverage takes hold. With the over-ageing population expected to increase 27% over the next 5 years, our communities are well-positioned for future NOI growth because they provide exceptional, affordable environments in markets with compelling supply-demand dynamics. As we look ahead, we believe we have a long runway for continued growth in senior housing. Our prior occupancy peak and SHOP reached 92% in late 2014, when conditions weren't nearly as favorable as they are now. Our goal is to shoot for and exceed prior peaks of occupancy and NOI over time as surging demand outpaces senior housing construction, which sits at record low levels and inflation moderates. Our markets show particularly favorable conditions and we expect to continue to drive significant upside as our Ventas team and OI platform work with our peer providers to drive outperformance. We've also ramped up our investments in senior housing to $1.7 billion this year. Here too, we are utilizing our OI insight, field experience and industry relationships to identify attractive opportunities, increase our enterprise growth rate, and expand our senior housing footprint. As a result of this investment activity, we expect SHOP NOI to increase by 12 percentage points and senior housing to grow to well over half of our business by year-end. These acquisitions fit squarely into our articulated strategic and financial framework and should create value for shareholders. We've rarely seen such favorable investment market conditions where the pool of available assets is large and growing, and investments should generate relatively high year 1 yield and offer significant future growth. Importantly, we are well-positioned from a balance sheet, cost of capital and experience standpoint to be highly active and successful. We intend to build on our momentum to continue to expand our participation in the unprecedented multiyear growth opportunity in senior housing. At Ventas, we have a long history of taking a holistic view of delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders. Last month, we released our 2023-2024 Corporate Sustainability Report, which details our key initiatives as we enable exceptional environments benefiting a large and growing aging population. I am proud of our sustainability leadership and accomplishments and our team which are widely recognized. Our integrated approach has enabled us to deliver nearly 19% annual PSR since the beginning of 2000. In sum, I feel great about where our business is and where it's heading. Our enterprise enjoys durable, inelastic demographic demand, powering a multiyear runway for growth. Our platform and team are driving outperformance and capturing market share. Because of these favorable secular and structural advantages, we are well-positioned to deliver value for our shareholders and advance our important mission to help people live longer, healthier and happier lives. And the whole Ventas team is enthusiastically going after it. Now I'm happy to turn the call over to Justin.\nJustin Hutchens: Thank you, Debbie. I'll start with our efforts to deliver profitable organic growth in senior housing. The third quarter same-store SHOP portfolio grew occupancy by an industry-leading 350 basis points year-over-year, leading to our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit NOI growth at over 15% and an overall operating margin of 26.3%, which is up 150 basis points year-over-year. We also had one of our best occupancy growth quarters sequentially with 140 basis points. Leading indicators of Leads and Tours [ph] have been outperforming all year and continue to do so in October. Revenue growth was around 9% across the portfolio and the U.S NOI growth was 17.7%. Sunrise, Sincerely [ph], and Discovery continue to deliver excellent operating results in the U.S. Double clicking on our occupancy performance, our Canadian portfolio is an all-time high of 97% occupied in September, led by Le Groupe Maurice and Atria. Occupancy outperformed the market. The U.S spot occupancy grew 370 basis points year-over-year in the top 99 markets, which is 140 basis points faster than the NIC average. Furthermore, we grew 130 basis points in these markets, which is almost double the NIC average. Moving on to guidance. As the third quarter exceeded our expectations and October is off to a good start, our average occupancy growth expectations have increased to about 290 basis points, which is up 40 basis points versus the original guidance. Year-to-date RevPOR growth has exceeded OpExPOR by 300 basis points, and we expect a continued healthy spread as pricing continues to outpace the moderating inflationary pressures we have experienced this year. All of this considered, we are pleased to raise SHOP full-year guidance expectations for the third time this year to 15%. Furthermore, we believe rate growth will be favorable into 2025 as we anticipate significant demand, well-positioned communities, and a value proposition that is attractive to seniors and their families. Moving on to Ventas OI. Our SHOP performance stems from a right market, right asset, right operator approach, enhanced by the Ventas OI platform, which leverages a billion operational and financial data points and experiential insights. This platform empowers our SHOP operators with advantages in sales, pricing, market positioning, CapEx, and digital marketing, to name a few. Key drivers include acquisitions, new shop operators, CapEx investment, and strategic conversions from Triple-Net to SHOP, all aimed at boosting occupancy and NOI amid favorable supply-demand trends in senior housing. The OI platform also enables us to segment the portfolio in ways designed to increase NOI and margin. We are all familiar with the rule of thumb, a 50% incremental margin flow-through in communities that are between 80% and 90% occupancy and the 70% flow-through in communities that are above 90% occupied. I don't think it's widely understood how higher occupied communities can power growth. Let me walk you through a case study to highlight this opportunity. If you want to follow along, you can see this case study on Page 12 in our earnings deck. Our Zero Lost Revenue Days initiative aims for full occupancy across select communities in our portfolio, minimizing vacancy and maximizing NOI growth. 40% of our SHOP portfolio is in the 90% plus occupied category, offering substantial outperformance potential. Due to the operating leverage in our business, scarcity value, and lack of frictional vacancy, we have significant opportunity to drive NOI growth in highly occupied communities. It's important to note that we typically don't experience frictional vacancy in senior housing due to the relative small unit size, lengthy notice periods to vacate, and low wear and tear on the units, ultimately allowing for sufficient time to plan a unit turn. As occupancy grows across our portfolio, the benefits of highly occupied communities are materializing. I'll highlight eight communities in September that reached Zero Lost Revenue Days, maintaining 100% occupancy every day of the month. These properties saw a 440 basis point occupancy increase over the last year, a 7% RevPOR improvement, 12% revenue growth, and over 25% NOI growth. These communities all delivered market-leading quality care and services, which is essential to attracting and retaining residents and employees. The philosophy is simple. Full is full. And it underscores the value of renting every unit daily, maximizing NOI through operating leverage, scarcity value, and zero vacancy. While not achievable for every property, we aim to continue to replicate this result with operators and targeted communities through our portfolio, including our new acquisitions. I'll summarize my SHOP commentary by highlighting our continued occupancy outperformance NOI growth. We truly are seeing momentum in the business. Next, I'll comment on our Triple-Net lease with Brookdale, which expires at the end of 2025. Brookdale has the option to renew by November 30 of this year. It is a well-covered lease with strong and improving coverage, comprised of underlying assets that sit in markets with a 1,000 basis points of potential occupancy upside. Due to the strong underlying performance of the portfolio and compelling projected tailwinds, there are a variety of outcomes that are positive for Ventas, which could include full renewal, full transition to SHOP, or something in between. We'll update you about the progress of this lease when we know more. Now I'll move on to investments. We continue to execute on our Focus strategy, which is to capture value creating external growth concentrated in senior housing. The market is presenting compelling opportunities. We are in a great position to capitalize on these opportunities, given our advantaged position as a large owner of senior housing with financial strength and flexibility, far-reaching senior housing sector relationships, and a successful transaction track record. Our investment pace is accelerating, with $1.7 billion of senior housing investment closed or under contract, which is $1 billion more than we stated a quarter ago. The $1.7 billion is comprised of 43 new senior housing communities, 16 different transactions, with a median size of $47 million. We have targeted high performing communities with upside that have demonstrated market-leading performance and should continue to grow NOI due to the strong market fundamentals, increased operating leverage, and competitive pricing. The communities we have purchased are generally large-scale, offering a variety of services including independent living, assisted living and memory care. We are purchasing communities in an attractive investment basis of 250,000 per unit, which is a significant discount to replacement costs. These investments are right in our strike zone. Our stated financial criteria of 7% to 8% expected year 1 NOI yield, low to mid-teens, unlevered IRR, and we continue to purchase below replacement costs. The affordability in the new markets we are entering is supportive where residents can afford greater than 7x our length of stay. We also expect a significant net absorption opportunity during the next few years as a result of growing demographics and minimal new supply in the markets we have selected. We continue to expand with our existing operator relationships as well as welcoming new high performing operators in aligned management agreement. I'll spotlight an investment where we acquired 20 senior housing communities currently operated by Grace Management. This strategic acquisition includes communities operating a mix of independent living, assisted living and memory care, aligning with our focus on value-creating growth in senior housing. These communities are located in markets that support significant potential occupancy growth and price opportunity over the next few years. At 92% occupancy, this investment should benefit from the high operating leverage opportunity as I noted earlier. We expect 7% to 8% year 1 yield and low mid to teen unlevered IRRs consistent with our target financial metrics. This investment expands our relationship with Grace, who is a strong performing existing Ventas operator. Our investment pipeline remains active as we continue to pursue high performing senior housing communities with attractive financial returns. In summary, we are effectively executing on both our organic growth priority in senior housing and value-created senior housing investments. Bob?\nRobert Probst: Thank you, Justin. I'll give an update of our financial results, provide an overview of our balance sheet, and close with our improved outlook for the year. Ventas reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.05 per share in the third quarter. Our Q3 normalized FFO per share of $0.80 represents a 7% increase year-over-year. Our total company same-store portfolio cash NOI increased 7.6% in the third quarter, led by over 15% growth in SHOP. Our Outpatient Medical & Research segment, or OMAR, same-store cash NOI increased to 2% in the third quarter and grew over 3% on a year-to-date basis. In our outpatient medical portfolio, Pete and team remain active on leasing, executing 1 million square feet of new and renewal deals in the quarter for a total of 2.5 million square feet year-to-date. Tenant retention of 85% has improved 300 basis points from the prior year. As a result, outpatient medical same-store occupancy improved 20 basis points year-over-year in the third quarter. Our university-based research same-store portfolio increased cash NOI by nearly 5% both in the third quarter and year-to-date, led by new leasing and higher rents. Our core research portfolio is performing very well to strengthen our market and institutional demand. As Justin described, we have increased our investments in senior housing with 1.7 billion of senior housing investments closed or under contract. Refunded, the 1.4 billion of closed senior housing investments via 1.1 billion in equity issuance at an average price of $54.20 and $300 million of completed dispositions. I note that since the second quarter, we have raised approximately 570 million of equity at an average price of $61.27. Consistent with our strategy, organic shop growth and equity-funded senior housing investments have materially improved our balance sheet. Our 3Q net debt to EBITDA of 6.3x has improved by 60 basis points since the start of the year, and we now have land of site to our targeted 5x to 6x range. We also have robust current liquidity of $3.1 billion. We have addressed our 2024 maturing debt and proactively refinanced a portion of our 2025 debt maturities, including through a 550 million 5% bond issued in September prior to the recent run up in long rates. I'll close with our updated 2024 guidance. We've raised our outlook for '24 for the third time this year. We now expect net income attributable to common stockholders to range from $0.09 to $0.13 per diluted share. We increased the midpoint of our full year normalized FFO guidance to $3.16 per share from the previous midpoint of $3.15. Our improved full year midpoint is driven by a $0.02 improvement from increased investment activity and higher shop same-store growth expectations, partially offset by a penny dilutive impact of our strong stock price performance on our exchangeable notes. I would note that $1.2 billion of our $1.7 billion in senior housing investments are closing on a weighted average basis in the middle of Q4, thereby limiting the 2024 accretion. We have raised our total company's same-store cash NOI to now approximate 7.4% year-over-year at the midpoint, as well as increased our SHOP same-store cash NOI [technical difficulty] growth year-over-year. For additional 2024 guidance assumptions, please see our Q3 supplemental and earnings presentation deck posted to our website. To close, we are pleased with the results both in the quarter and so far this year, and to once again have improved our full year expectations. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nick Joseph from Citi. Please go ahead.\nNicholas Joseph: Thanks. Debbie, you mentioned a long runway and obviously the improving operating fundamentals, pricing, expenses, occupancy, everything. I guess my question is just, what are the early indicators that supply could start to re-emerge? We obviously haven't seen in the start state yet, but just wondering what you're seeing from the sector overall as you talk to lenders or others within the industry, what could spur that just given the really strong forward outlook?\nDebra Cafaro: Thanks Nick. Good morning. So the construction as a percentage of inventory is at record low, as I mentioned. I think just a little over 2,000 units were started this quarter, and we're seeing annual increases in the resident, the customer base of over 500,000 a year growing. And so we're still seeing constrained supply considerations including lending, including costs, and including rent levels which would have to be significantly higher to justify new construction. So there is a long runway. We know there's a significant lag as we saw in the financial crisis it was 4 or 5 years and then we really peaked in occupancy and as I mentioned conditions were far less favorable then. Senior population grew 4% over 5 years and now it's growing 27%. We see that step function a few years from now in the population when the baby boomers start to enter the over aging population. So it is a long runway and we feel really good about it and that's why we feel that this combination of organic and external growth is a real winner.\nNicholas Joseph: Thanks. And then maybe just on that ramping investments in senior housing, just given that kind of runway, can you talk about the seller motivation [ph] at this point and kind of the opportunity set that you're seeing there. I would think that a seller can also see the improvements from the fundamental perspective. So why sell now into this runway?\nDebra Cafaro: Yes, good question.\nJustin Hutchens: Hi, its Justin. Yes, if you just look at, for instance, the $1.7 billion that we've either closed or under contract, there's been what 16 transactions. About 9 of those have been developers that were cashing in. There were some repeat sellers. These were just groups we've done transactions with before, came back to us to do it again, just give them a good track record we had with them. And then there's a handful of just PE [ph] firms that were selling for a variety of reasons. I think it's very clear that the fundamentals are really good and that's a great, given all the backdrop and the long runway that Debbie described, it creates a great buying opportunity for us, given our capabilities and our financial strength and flexibility, but it also has created a selling opportunity for certain players as well. So the opportunities have been certainly growing in our pipeline.\nDebra Cafaro: Yes and the asset should perform better in our hands.\nNicholas Joseph: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Kammert from Evercore. Please go ahead.\nJames Kammert: Hey, good morning. Thank you. If I could, Justin, drill down on your case study on Page 12 of the very high occupied cohort of units or communities. Was that a cross-section? And thinking about the whole 111 communities, a cross-section of operators?\nJustin Hutchens: Yes, so we do have -- it's a cross-section. In the case study, I really focused on eight communities particularly, and even though it was a cross-section, you have a mix of majority IL, AL, a couple in Canada, most of them were in the U.S. So it does speak for the opportunity, I think, really across the board. And we're going to have really the best opportunity to be 100% occupied or really achieve that zero-vacant unit standard in communities that have already established themselves as market leaders. And we have many of those. Certainly, the acquisition pipeline that we pursued are with bona fide market leaders that have a lot of upside ahead. So, we're really pushing to support that outcome and we're pleased to see it start happening.\nJames Kammert: Great. And then a second question, if I may. Just stepping back more secularly, what does all your wealth of data collection tell you about sort of penetration rates for senior housing in your markets. Are you able to track that or get some -- share some insight as to, how these by age cohort, how people are increasing or decreasing their usage of the product? Thank you.\nJustin Hutchens: Well, I can tell you that we do track penetration rate. We track it. There's a number of factors that go into our net absorption projections. Penetration across the sector is at 11%. It's basically exactly where it was pre-pandemic. There's -- penetration tends to follow affordability. It's not -- it's one of the reasons why we tend to prefer markets that have very strong affordability because you're going to have a higher utilization of senior housing in those markets. And it trended up. I mean, clearly, a few years ago penetration had fallen off a little bit. It's back where it was. And really to get the results that we're anticipating over time in this multiyear kind of occupancy growth opportunity, you really don't need to see penetration rate move much, if at all. So, there's a strong aging demographic, there's very strong affordability. We're selecting markets that, first and foremost, that have those characteristics. And as Debbie said, we have the platform to really ensure good performance in these markets. And it's certainly helpful to have strong tailwinds.\nJames Kammert: Okay. Thank you again.\nDebra Cafaro: Thanks, James.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Kilichowski from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nJohn Kilichowski: Thank you. Just on the guide for SHOP, and forgive me if I missed this, but I noticed there was an updated RevPOR, OpExPOR guide. This quarter, RevPOR came in at 4.4 and OpExPOR 1.3 year-to-date. Is that -- and just kind of going back to your 2Q guidance, I believe it was 5.25. Are those both in line with your 2Q guidance, or are you seeing maybe a little softer RevPOR, but also softer OpExPOR that's kind of balancing that out? Curious if there's any conservatism heading into 4Q.\nJustin Hutchens: Right. So first of all, we are -- we focused on the spread between the two, and that's been around 300 basis points. And that really held, we expect that to continue. That was considered in the guidance update that we gave. That full year number you mentioned, that's a pretty good proxy for where we've been running. The 300 basis point spread is reflected in the year-to-date performance.\nRobert Probst: To put it another way, I would -- this is Bob. I would say year-to-date P&L elements in the supplemental is a good indicator of the Peace Parks in terms of RevPOR and OpExPOR growth as we think about the year.\nJohn Kilichowski: Got it. Thank you. And then maybe just jump into your top tenants and more specifically Atria, but please touch on any others if there's anything newsworthy. But just could you talk about Atria's performance and maybe bifurcate the IL and AL portfolios?\nRobert Probst: Yes, sure. So Atria is our largest shop operator. We have a legacy portfolio with them in the U.S. and Canada, and then we have the holiday portfolio. They've consistently been a really good performer in our legacy portfolio. We've had a working relationship with them over time where we've been really helping them to focus their footprint in the cluster markets. And so at one point you might have thought of Atria as a national platform. Now I think of them as a super regional because they're well clustered. We're getting solid execution in the legacy portfolio. The holiday portfolio has been a work in progress. They're a big contributor to the occupancy growth we've had year-over-year though. So we like -- what we're seeing has been around 400 basis points of occupancy growth year-over-year. So, I would say they're checking our boxes. In the U.S., I also mentioned in Canada that they're one of the leaders in terms of driving higher occupancy. Where Canada is 97% occupied, Atria has been a key contributor to that, the other being the group, Maurice. There's a new CEO at Atria as well. [Indiscernible] been in place for a couple quarters now. She's brought a lot of enthusiasm, experience and direction to the company that we're really pleased about.\nOperator: Great. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Spector from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJeffrey Spector: Great. Thank you. My first question on opportunities, is it time to lean into life science or will there be a time over the coming months to lean into life science again?\nDebra Cafaro: Hi, Jeff. It's Debbie. We're definitely prioritizing investing in senior housing. That's really foundational to the strategy that we're executing and certainly we believe in the business long-term. But right now, our key focus is in [indiscernible] and senior housing.\nJeffrey Spector: Okay, fair. Thank you. Then my second question, can you discuss the margins during the quarter? It looks like they compressed across the different formats. I apologize if I missed this. Can you explain margins during the quarter?\nJustin Hutchens: With asset class, I can start with SHOP.\nJeffrey Spector: Okay, good.\nJustin Hutchens: So Shop had -- we had, year-over-year, we've had, what 150 basis points of margin expansion. That's what we, kind of an expansion we expect to see given the revenue growth we're having relative to the expense growth overall is driven by occupancy and rate. It's really mentioned that RevPOR OpEx metric. There's a sequential change that was impacted by some, we have insurance renewals in the third quarter. There's seasonal expenses that we face. There's -- so there's just typically for us, we don't see improvement from between second and third quarter. And so there's a little bit of a climb sequentially. But on a year-over-year basis, we're certainly seeing margin expansion.\nJeffrey Spector: Thanks, Justin.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRonald Kamdem: Hey, just two quick ones. With the acquisition sort of ramping and I think becoming more and more clear that '25 is going to be strong, maybe any updated thoughts on when you think private capital, private equity will start to look at the space, come into the space, and why you think they have not done it so far if everything is so good? Thanks.\nJustin Hutchens: Yes, so this is Justin again. I definitely would say private capital is always circling. The conditions over the past year really haven't been supportive of private capital due to the availability and cost of debt. That's put us in really an advanced position. But I would expect that given the fundamentals that we'll see the competition again. We're clearly used to facing the competition and feel very comfortable that we'll get our fair share. We have an advantage platform, from a financial strength flexibility standpoint, we're advantaged from Ventas OI standpoint, where we have the team and the capabilities to really drive outside performance and also just to underwrite, see opportunities where others might not. So I really like our opportunity to continue to compete.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. I guess my second question was, look, almost 9% top-line growth is pretty impressive. We're obviously trying to figure out what next year and the years beyond bring. I guess my question is when I look at this 350 basis points occupancy gain and almost 4.5 RevPOR. Is there anything -- Is there any obvious reasons why that should start to flow? Was there maybe some low-hanging fruit that we picked this year? Maybe we should be thinking about just trying to think about the sustainability of these very impressive numbers.\nRobert Probst: Yes. I'd say, first of all, we're not going to give you 2025 guidance expectations in answering this. One thing that did flatter expenses this year is we had a year-over-year comparison versus agency costs last year. So, that impacted off export and labor core metrics. That agency is pretty much out of our system now. So, that's a comp to consider moving forward, the supply demand, the pricing opportunity, know, all these fundamentals that we're facing, we expect to continue. So, we'll look forward talking more about our expectations moving forward.\nRonald Kamdem: Got it. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Mizuho.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, this is [indiscernible] on for Vikram. Can you just give us some details on how the transition assets are growing relative to the same store and when they would become part of the same-store pool? And separately, what's the average occupancy of the acquired assets this quarter? Thank you.\nDebra Cafaro: Our same-store pool -- thanks for the question. I think it's important to start by saying that, our same-store pool is really the lion share of our total shop portfolio. So is it good representation of the overall performance?\nJustin Hutchens: Yes, so when we talked about transition communities, a lot of those are in the same-store pool already. There's some that we transitioned last year that will come into the pool. And in that case, we've had really good occupancy growth. We're looking forward to NII opportunity moving forward in those communities. But honestly, it's largely represented already based on the pool that we've been reporting on. Also, in terms of your question around acquisitions, the acquisition [indiscernible] has been around 90%, 91%. That's across the board. And the reason for that is we're targeting bona fide market leaders in markets that have more upside so that we can drive occupancy and price in communities that have a proven track record of delivering best-in-class quality care and services and should continue to really outperform. And so we really like how the acquisitions are positioned.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And just a second question in terms of capital allocation. Given the Canadian portfolio is nearly fully occupied, how do you think about monetizing part of it or maybe the entire portfolio and redeploying the capital into higher growth profile assets?\nDebra Cafaro: Thanks for the question. Yes, you're right. The Canadian portfolio is an incredible tool. I mean, it really has been terrific and continues to be a significant contributor to growth. And so, we've managed that portfolio by basically leveraging it in a way that provides a greatest value instead want to continue to work with the operators to drive occupancy and performance.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you so much.\nDebra Cafaro: Yes, I mean, in -- our philosophy is really to grow our SHOP with risk.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Anderson from Wedbush. Please go ahead.\nRichard Anderson: Thanks, good morning. So, back to the question about competition for assets and the lack of sort of, maybe relative lack of PE because of availability of debt. When you look at cap rates, I think you did, on the activity so far, 8% yield on your senior housing activity. And then you compare that to multifamily, 4% or 5%, industrial 4% or 5%. You can argue your outlook is by far much better, at least in terms of visibility. The lack of competition, putting aside the PE component, just that people can't do it. You need a certain level of operating talent to go after some of these assets. So it's always going to be a limited competitive set, or do you think it comes back? And corollary to that question, if your cost of equity is in the range of five, is that the way we should be thinking about 300 basis point type spread when we think about 2025 estimates?\nDebra Cafaro: Thanks, Rich. Look, I think that there are multiple reasons that we're enjoying these compelling investment opportunities now. Obviously, our cost of capital and the relationships and experience are helping. There is limited competition because of debt markets, but you really hit on I think something very important and differentiating and I'll brag on Justin and the team a little bit. I mean, there is a moat. It is a business that requires significant expertise and also data analytics. And that's the more it feeds on itself in a positive way. And so we have the scale, we have the data, we have the experience, with Justin having operated, we have an industry relationship with the operators. And all of those things create a significant competitive advantage that should enable us to really be a premier global owner of senior housing. And that does, I think, keep competition less. And of course, we're always dealing with competition over the last 25 years, and we now have to get more than our fair share. But that is you've really hit on I think a very important reason and that is the competitive mode that we have that gives us these compelling investment opportunities.\nRichard Anderson: And in terms of spread investing, is kind of 300 basis points where you're thinking if you just do an inverse of the AFFO yield, AFFO multiple?\nDebra Cafaro: I mean -- yes, I mean, look, we're very pleased to be delivering strong cost performance for our shareholders. That's what we're here for. And that's obviously a variable metric that goes into our calculus and it changes over time. And right now it's working for us and hopefully we'll continue to do so and even get better.\nRichard Anderson: Last question on Brookdale. I know you're not going to say much, but maybe a little bit more. Could they go past their November 30th decision day? Would you allow them to, or is that a full stop? You got to know by then. I'm just curious what your flexibility is to allow the negotiation to extend into perhaps next year. Thanks.\nDebra Cafaro: Well, I mean, if it goes beyond the contractual notice date, then [indiscernible] no longer has the option to renew the cub.\nRichard Anderson: Okay, fair enough. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJuan Sanabria: Good morning. I'm just hoping you could talk a little bit about the shop lead indicators. Would you be able to provide a spot SHOP, same-store occupancy for October and or comment on what the OI or data would suggest about rent bumps, Jan 1, which I'm sure you're thinking about this coming year versus what you experienced in 24?\nJustin Hutchens: Juan, I'm going to try to answer this. So without giving too much information up here, I'm going to start with rent because we're just not going to get into the '25 numbers, but we do think the environment is favorable for pricing. And so we'll report more on that in the future. In terms of the lead indicators, we've had throughout the entire year leads and tours have been running higher than last year. That was true through the third quarter. It's true in October. So that's obviously driving move-ins and occupancy growth. As I mentioned we've had industry-leading occupancy growth and that really all starts with our ability to drive business to the doorstep. So we're pleased with that performance and encouraged by it, even this late in the season, to see the activity that we're seeing.\nJuan Sanabria: Okay. And then just on your zero vacant days, I guess a couple questions there. You mentioned notice periods. How many people actually give notice that they're moving out? I thought a fair amount of people unfortunately pass away. And is there an element where you can start booking revenues before a person moves in associated with shrinking those vacant days?\nJustin Hutchens: So there's notice periods in the resident agreements that can range anywhere from 10 days to 30 days, depending on the circumstances. So you have visibility into when a unit will become available. There's also the opportunity for new residents. If you think about the demand that you're experiencing in a community that has zero vacant units, prospective residents are going to want to make sure they have access to the unit. So they take financial possession proactively. That happens oftentimes. But even if they don't, if you really think about what we're talking about, we're talking about a 400 square foot unit that has -- it's lightly furnished, has some personal belongings but nothing like we have in our own homes. And you're -- one operator targets a 30-minute turnaround because it's a deep clean and a touch up pain. If it needs more than that, you might add a few hours to that. But this is not a complex unit turn. It's extremely simple. It can happen quickly. You can plan for it. And so that really leads to this opportunity to have zero-making units. That combined with the demand at the doorstep and, most importantly, positioning yourself as a market leader because you're the best at what you do in your market.\nJuan Sanabria: Thank you.\nDebra Cafaro: Your next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Yes, good afternoon. Most of my questions have been answered, but Debbie and Justin, curious as again we're kind of going through election season, if there's anything out there you guys are looking at that could potentially impact healthcare as a whole, and maybe senior housing in particular, one of the things I'm kind of looking at is if we end up in a world where regulation makes it harder for PE to be involved in health care. But anything that's kind of top of mind would be helpful.\nDebra Cafaro: Well, we're really focused -- hi Omotayo, I'm glad you got on, even though most of your questions were answered. But I do think that we are in a favorable spot as we participate in this longevity economy because we do have a consumer-driven product that has significant demand and we have the platform that is driving out performance there. It should have limited impact, really, regardless of what happens in the election. There may be impacts on long rates, depending on who's elected, that could affect kind of the real estate sector writ large. But as a public company who is in an advantaged position relative to private equity in real estate right now I would think that we would be -- we would have a better position than the real estate market public and private. The public guys you have [indiscernible] or have an advantage because of access to cost of capital.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Thank you.\nDebra Cafaro: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Stroyeck from Green Street. Please go ahead.\nMichael Stroyeck: Thanks and good morning. Maybe 1 on the outpatient medical portfolio. So, now that that legacy portfolio is part of the same store pool. You need to quantify how much NOI or occupancy upside actually remains across those assets and has there been any deceleration and why growth or occupancy gains and recent quarters now that just the lowest hanging fruit within that portfolio may be already taken care of?\nPeter Bulgarelli: Yes, thanks Michael. This is Pete. I appreciate the question. Just to level set, we've got about 79 buildings that entered the quarterly same-store pool for ELP this quarter and we've been really hard at work in applying the Little Bridge Playbook to the ADCET portfolio. We've replaced 19 property management teams, we've replaced half the leasing brokers, and we've replaced virtually 100% of the contracts that relate to the services in the buildings. So you're starting to see a lot of results. Tenant satisfaction went from the bottom quartile to the third quartile. So really happy about that. And then, not surprisingly retention has been up as a result of happier tenant satisfaction. Occupancy is up and so is NOI growth. So we're really excited about all that. We think that this portfolio will be an accelerant for us going forward. If anything, our growth outlook on this portfolio is stronger than what it was when we first got it. And there's probably 8% plus occupancy improvement potential to get it to the level that the rest of the portfolio is. So upside there for occupancy growth.\nMichael Stroyeck: Absolutely. Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe on the secured loan investment during the quarter, could you provide just some additional details surrounding the ROFO on that, and then any details on the actual underlying properties in terms of location, occupancy levels, acuity mix, anything you can provide there would be helpful.\nJustin Hutchens: Yes, sure, Justin. Yes, this is a unique opportunity to potentially own one of the highest quality senior housing assets in the country, quite frankly. This is [indiscernible] senior living. It's a high-rise in Seattle that has a mix of independent living and assisted living and member care product. It's high price point, very attractive physical plant. You're getting a renter anywhere from $10,000 to $20,000 per month. It was a good opportunity to get a high yield loan. It's a senior secured loan, so we're the only lender. We have properties collateral and other credit enhancements. But I think what's most exciting and interesting to us is potentially buying it. We have a typical ROFO. Clearly, we're the right type of buyer for an asset like this. It was just a neat opportunity to put money out at a really nice return and bridge the potential ownership. Thank you.\nMichael Stroyeck: Thanks for the time. Q O Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nPeter Bulgarelli: Yes, thanks. I know you guys don't like to talk about individual operators, but you did comment on Holiday earlier in the call. I was wondering if you could provide more details on how they're performing or the changes that they've implemented last August. Have those really taken hold and you're seeing better results that you think are sustainable going into 2025?\nJustin Hutchens: Yes, I think that probably the best way to attack that is really just to talk about our overall independent living performance in the U.S. Independent living has been a strong, really equal contributor to the overall occupancy growth that we've had. Holiday is part of that. We've had other operators operate independent living as well. There's been really strong demand. There is -- it also tends to be a higher occupied asset. So it also has very high operating leverage. And so as occupancy grows, we expect it to be a big contributor from an NOI standpoint. But we've seen really good progress and momentum in the independent living product across the board.\nPeter Bulgarelli: Okay, and then I think earlier, Justin, I think there was a question about the occupancy trends throughout the quarter. I mean, I'm just trying to really understand, like, what's the typical seasonal trend you see in occupancy? Does it really start to accelerate in mid-summer or then kind of tail off in the late summer and have you seen that? And I believe there's a question about what was spot occupancy at the end of the quarter. I don't know if you answered that, if you did, apologies, but if you didn't, I mean is that something that you can disclose?\nDebra Cafaro: We had great sequential average occupancy growth that Justin talked about, if he can repeat it here from the second to the third.\nJustin Hutchens: Yes, so typically you would see, the key selling season is May to September. Most of the occupancy growth is going to come during that period. It is also typical seasonality to see a downturn in occupancy in the fourth quarter. We are not seeing that. We're expecting growth in occupancy in the fourth quarter based on the performance that we've seen so far. So everything is off to a really good start in that regard. We've talked about our outperformance as well and I think that's notable when you compare us to the top 99 markets, we\u2019ve been -- we have 380 basis points growth in the [indiscernible] top 99 versus 230 across the sector and then our sequential growth was really strong. And so we are -- as I mentioned, now it's 140 basis points outperformance versus 70 basis points. So, it's two times the sector sequential occupancy growth in the third quarter. And as I mentioned, all the leading indicators and our expectations around occupancy remain very confident. So that's leading into a good fourth quarter so far.\nPeter Bulgarelli: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Kelleher from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nMichael Kelleher: Yes, hi. Just as you look ahead to 2025, are you expecting to fully or substantially equity fund acquisitions again?\nRobert Probst: Yes, this is Bob. I'll take that one. So, we've been very successful in executing on the strategy we laid out at the beginning of the year, which is investing behind senior housing to grow our participation. And if the market is there to fund that with equity, that has been working for us, clearly that's been the playbook. And you can see that not only in the growth in our senior housing portfolio, but also in our bridge, which is improved 60 basis points year-to-date. But as I look [indiscernible] I would like to call it more a cowbell. We like what we're up to and given the market conditions, hope that can continue.\nMichael Kelleher: Got it. Okay. And then second question, can you give us a sense at this point of the initial drag if the full Brookdale lease transitions to the shop?\nDebra Cafaro: Well, yes. Remember there's, what I would comment on is that if it transitions to shop, remember that the lease has -- is well covered from an EBITDAR or NOI standpoint to [indiscernible]. And so there's an excess amount of EBITDAR compared to RET. So that would have to be taken into account as you consider what the impact would be of a conversion of the whole Brookdale lease to shop. And that's a favorable fact pattern.\nMichael Kelleher: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nDebra Cafaro: Does that make sense? Do you understood?\nMichael Kelleher: Yes, I think so.\nDebra Cafaro: [Multiple speakers] what I\u2019m saying. Okay, good. There's more EBITDAR than cash rev.\nMichael Kelleher: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nDebra Cafaro: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with Baird. Please go ahead.\nWes Golladay: Hey, good morning, everyone. I just had a quick follow-up on that Brookdale comp. Would there be a ROI opportunity and potentially deferred CapEx on those assets?\nJustin Hutchens: Hi, Justin. So I mean, I think the best way to look at Brookdale at this stage is that they have an option to renew. And so, if they renew, then in 2026 there's a 4% or 3% escalator. It could be as high as 10% that's subject to a fair market lease review. If there something [indiscernible] obviously that would be mutually agreed upon. And if they don't, then it becomes a SHOP opportunity. And we do like the opportunity to run the playbook. We have a bent up platform, we have well established operators that have been ready to turn around. We've proven we know where to invest and when to drive occupancy. And they're in markets that have significant tailwinds. And so it's a good opportunity, but all the options are really on the table right now, and it's coming down to the deadline.\nDebra Cafaro: And the outcomes are all favorable.\nWes Golladay: Okay. fantastic. And then maybe revisiting Kindred, I know that there was some talk about the non-cash moving around, and now that everything is finalized, can you tell us more about or quantify the impact of the non-cash rent for next year?\nRobert Probst: Wes, this is Bob. We talked about this last quarter in terms of the noncash impact. This year is a pull forward effectively of the restructure of the lease and the extension of the lease. That's pretty much in line, frankly, with where we were this time last quarter in terms of our estimate for this year. The rent reduction and all those details are in the press release. So I'd refer you to that for all the details, but it's pretty much as expected.\nWes Golladay: Okay, thank you.\nDebra Cafaro: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nNicholas Yulico: Oh, thanks. Good morning. Just going back to the senior housing investments, the over $900 million that are closing, or I guess partially closed already. The 7.5% expected yield on that, can you just talk about what the day one yield is, so we can just understand how much NOI growth is assumed for the assets next year?\nDebra Cafaro: Hi, Nick, Debbie. Yes, I mean, you could expect if the year 1 yields are kind of 7.5% that you'd have kind of a current yield and kind of a low sevens go into that higher number over the next 12 months after acquisition. So there's growth in the assets.\nNicholas Yulico: Okay, thanks. And then second question is just in terms of the LTAC purchase, can you talk about what triggered that? What was the reason to do that after the resolving of the Kindred lease?\nDebra Cafaro: Sure. So, we had really a favorable resolution with Kindred that had used a lot of the tools in our toolbox and our experience in these types of situations. So, the goal of all of it was really to improve coverage on the overall master lease with the investments really fit in to that philosophy because they will bring up coverage in the -- they have brought up coverage in the overall master lease. They're well-performing assets that have additional EBITDAR improvement and positive trends. And so it really -- it significantly improved, Kindred's credit profile. So it helps the lease, it helps then pass with a good risk-adjusted return and made for a stronger tenant overall because it enables Kindred to improve its balance sheet. So overall, it just fit in nicely along with the warrants and revenue-based rent, which will give us a potential, upside performance or valuation improve. So it's an overall holistic approach, as we would always do in these situations, to get an outcome that is the best for our stakeholders.\nNicholas Yulico: All right. Thank you, Debbie.\nDebra Cafaro: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Great. Thanks and good morning, everybody. What's the average occupancy across the senior housing assets that you've closed or under contract to buy this year. I'm just curious as your cost of capital improves or if it continues to improve, if you'd consider pursuing even lower yielding assets that may have a longer occupancy tail to growth or whether or not the assets in that close to 90% or 90% plus occupancy range are more attractive given the flow-through profile you highlighted in your prepared remarks?\nDebra Cafaro: Great question. What we really like right now is the investments that we've made and that are under contract really are right down the fairway in terms of what our financial and strategic objective [indiscernible]. So as I mentioned in my remarks, really high kind of immediate yields and they have significant growth embedded in them. And that's a very attractive profile and we want to continue executing on that profile because we think it's a really good risk-adjusted return. Now, we could expand the aperture along the lines of what you've described, but we have to feel that the risk-adjusted return is the same or better than what we're currently doing, which is pretty darn exciting.\nAustin Wurschmidt: That's fair. Thanks for the thoughts there. Then just going back to Brookdale, I guess, why would a something in between kind of outcome be on the table given the all or nothing renewal and the internal view around prioritizing senior housing acquisitions? I mean, this seems like a great avenue. So just kind of help me understand what something in between outcome might look like. Thanks.\nJustin Hutchens: Well, I mean, from our perspective, we like the opportunity to have some or all of those communities in our SHOP portfolio. But the reality is Brookdale has the option to renew. So, the decision really sits with them. If there is something in between, it could really be a win, where we could have some amount of the community move to shop and go pursue the opportunity in the playbook like I mentioned. But that's hypothetical. What we really need to have happen is to see what Brookdale's decision is and then we'll go from there.\nDebra Cafaro: Yes, there can always be something better than a binary out and that's what we always look for.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Understood. Thank you.\nDebra Cafaro: Thank you.\nOperator: As there are no further questions at this time, I would like to turn the call over back to Debra Cafaro, Chairman and CEO, for closing remarks.\nDebra Cafaro: John, thanks so much. I really want to thank all of our participants in the call for your interest in Ventas and your participation today. We look forward to seeing you in Las Vegas soon.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's meeting. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Robert Probst",
            "content": "Thank you, Justin. I'll give an update of our financial results, provide an overview of our balance sheet, and close with our improved outlook for the year. Ventas reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.05 per share in the third quarter. Our Q3 normalized FFO per share of $0.80 represents a 7% increase year-over-year. Our total company same-store portfolio cash NOI increased 7.6% in the third quarter, led by over 15% growth in SHOP. Our Outpatient Medical & Research segment, or OMAR, same-store cash NOI increased to 2% in the third quarter and grew over 3% on a year-to-date basis. In our outpatient medical portfolio, Pete and team remain active on leasing, executing 1 million square feet of new and renewal deals in the quarter for a total of 2.5 million square feet year-to-date. Tenant retention of 85% has improved 300 basis points from the prior year. As a result, outpatient medical same-store occupancy improved 20 basis points year-over-year in the third quarter. Our university-based research same-store portfolio increased cash NOI by nearly 5% both in the third quarter and year-to-date, led by new leasing and higher rents. Our core research portfolio is performing very well to strengthen our market and institutional demand. As Justin described, we have increased our investments in senior housing with 1.7 billion of senior housing investments closed or under contract. Refunded, the 1.4 billion of closed senior housing investments via 1.1 billion in equity issuance at an average price of $54.20 and $300 million of completed dispositions. I note that since the second quarter, we have raised approximately 570 million of equity at an average price of $61.27. Consistent with our strategy, organic shop growth and equity-funded senior housing investments have materially improved our balance sheet. Our 3Q net debt to EBITDA of 6.3x has improved by 60 basis points since the start of the year, and we now have land of site to our targeted 5x to 6x range. We also have robust current liquidity of $3.1 billion. We have addressed our 2024 maturing debt and proactively refinanced a portion of our 2025 debt maturities, including through a 550 million 5% bond issued in September prior to the recent run up in long rates. I'll close with our updated 2024 guidance. We've raised our outlook for '24 for the third time this year. We now expect net income attributable to common stockholders to range from $0.09 to $0.13 per diluted share. We increased the midpoint of our full year normalized FFO guidance to $3.16 per share from the previous midpoint of $3.15. Our improved full year midpoint is driven by a $0.02 improvement from increased investment activity and higher shop same-store growth expectations, partially offset by a penny dilutive impact of our strong stock price performance on our exchangeable notes. I would note that $1.2 billion of our $1.7 billion in senior housing investments are closing on a weighted average basis in the middle of Q4, thereby limiting the 2024 accretion. We have raised our total company's same-store cash NOI to now approximate 7.4% year-over-year at the midpoint, as well as increased our SHOP same-store cash NOI [technical difficulty] growth year-over-year. For additional 2024 guidance assumptions, please see our Q3 supplemental and earnings presentation deck posted to our website. To close, we are pleased with the results both in the quarter and so far this year, and to once again have improved our full year expectations. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator. To put it another way, I would -- this is Bob. I would say year-to-date P&L elements in the supplemental is a good indicator of the Peace Parks in terms of RevPOR and OpExPOR growth as we think about the year. Yes, sure. So Atria is our largest shop operator. We have a legacy portfolio with them in the U.S. and Canada, and then we have the holiday portfolio. They've consistently been a really good performer in our legacy portfolio. We've had a working relationship with them over time where we've been really helping them to focus their footprint in the cluster markets. And so at one point you might have thought of Atria as a national platform. Now I think of them as a super regional because they're well clustered. We're getting solid execution in the legacy portfolio. The holiday portfolio has been a work in progress. They're a big contributor to the occupancy growth we've had year-over-year though. So we like -- what we're seeing has been around 400 basis points of occupancy growth year-over-year. So, I would say they're checking our boxes. In the U.S., I also mentioned in Canada that they're one of the leaders in terms of driving higher occupancy. Where Canada is 97% occupied, Atria has been a key contributor to that, the other being the group, Maurice. There's a new CEO at Atria as well. [Indiscernible] been in place for a couple quarters now. She's brought a lot of enthusiasm, experience and direction to the company that we're really pleased about. Yes. I'd say, first of all, we're not going to give you 2025 guidance expectations in answering this. One thing that did flatter expenses this year is we had a year-over-year comparison versus agency costs last year. So, that impacted off export and labor core metrics. That agency is pretty much out of our system now. So, that's a comp to consider moving forward, the supply demand, the pricing opportunity, know, all these fundamentals that we're facing, we expect to continue. So, we'll look forward talking more about our expectations moving forward. Yes, this is Bob. I'll take that one. So, we've been very successful in executing on the strategy we laid out at the beginning of the year, which is investing behind senior housing to grow our participation. And if the market is there to fund that with equity, that has been working for us, clearly that's been the playbook. And you can see that not only in the growth in our senior housing portfolio, but also in our bridge, which is improved 60 basis points year-to-date.

So I'd refer you to that for all the details, but it's pretty much as expected."

            "name": "Justin Hutchens",
            "content": "Thank you, Debbie. I'll start with our efforts to deliver profitable organic growth in senior housing. The third quarter same-store SHOP portfolio grew occupancy by an industry-leading 350 basis points year-over-year, leading to our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit NOI growth at over 15% and an overall operating margin of 26.3%, which is up 150 basis points year-over-year. We also had one of our best occupancy growth quarters sequentially with 140 basis points. Leading indicators of Leads and Tours [ph] have been outperforming all year and continue to do so in October. Revenue growth was around 9% across the portfolio and the U.S NOI growth was 17.7%. Sunrise, Sincerely [ph], and Discovery continue to deliver excellent operating results in the U.S. Double clicking on our occupancy performance, our Canadian portfolio is an all-time high of 97% occupied in September, led by Le Groupe Maurice and Atria. Occupancy outperformed the market. The U.S spot occupancy grew 370 basis points year-over-year in the top 99 markets, which is 140 basis points faster than the NIC average. Furthermore, we grew 130 basis points in these markets, which is almost double the NIC average. Moving on to guidance. As the third quarter exceeded our expectations and October is off to a good start, our average occupancy growth expectations have increased to about 290 basis points, which is up 40 basis points versus the original guidance. Year-to-date RevPOR growth has exceeded OpExPOR by 300 basis points, and we expect a continued healthy spread as pricing continues to outpace the moderating inflationary pressures we have experienced this year. All of this considered, we are pleased to raise SHOP full-year guidance expectations for the third time this year to 15%. Furthermore, we believe rate growth will be favorable into 2025 as we anticipate significant demand, well-positioned communities, and a value proposition that is attractive to seniors and their families. Moving on to Ventas OI. Our SHOP performance stems from a right market, right asset, right operator approach, enhanced by the Ventas OI platform, which leverages a billion operational and financial data points and experiential insights. This platform empowers our SHOP operators with advantages in sales, pricing, market positioning, CapEx, and digital marketing, to name a few. Key drivers include acquisitions, new shop operators, CapEx investment, and strategic conversions from Triple-Net to SHOP, all aimed at boosting occupancy and NOI amid favorable supply-demand trends in senior housing. The OI platform also enables us to segment the portfolio in ways designed to increase NOI and margin. We are all familiar with the rule of thumb, a 50% incremental margin flow-through in communities that are between 80% and 90% occupancy and the 70% flow-through in communities that are above 90% occupied. I don't think it's widely understood how higher occupied communities can power growth. Let me walk you through a case study to highlight this opportunity. If you want to follow along, you can see this case study on Page 12 in our earnings deck. Our Zero Lost Revenue Days initiative aims for full occupancy across select communities in our portfolio, minimizing vacancy and maximizing NOI growth. 40% of our SHOP portfolio is in the 90% plus occupied category, offering substantial outperformance potential. Due to the operating leverage in our business, scarcity value, and lack of frictional vacancy, we have significant opportunity to drive NOI growth in highly occupied communities. It's important to note that we typically don't experience frictional vacancy in senior housing due to the relative small unit size, lengthy notice periods to vacate, and low wear and tear on the units, ultimately allowing for sufficient time to plan a unit turn. As occupancy grows across our portfolio, the benefits of highly occupied communities are materializing. I'll highlight eight communities in September that reached Zero Lost Revenue Days, maintaining 100% occupancy every day of the month. These properties saw a 440 basis point occupancy increase over the last year, a 7% RevPOR improvement, 12% revenue growth, and over 25% NOI growth. These communities all delivered market-leading quality care and services, which is essential to attracting and retaining residents and employees. The philosophy is simple. Full is full. And it underscores the value of renting every unit daily, maximizing NOI through operating leverage, scarcity value, and zero vacancy. While not achievable for every property, we aim to continue to replicate this result with operators and targeted communities through our portfolio, including our new acquisitions. I'll summarize my SHOP commentary by highlighting our continued occupancy outperformance NOI growth. We truly are seeing momentum in the business. Next, I'll comment on our Triple-Net lease with Brookdale, which expires at the end of 2025. Brookdale has the option to renew by November 30 of this year. It is a well-covered lease with strong and improving coverage, comprised of underlying assets that sit in markets with a 1,000 basis points of potential occupancy upside. Due to the strong underlying performance of the portfolio and compelling projected tailwinds, there are a variety of outcomes that are positive for Ventas, which could include full renewal, full transition to SHOP, or something in between. We'll update you about the progress of this lease when we know more. Now I'll move on to investments. We continue to execute on our Focus strategy, which is to capture value creating external growth concentrated in senior housing. The market is presenting compelling opportunities. We are in a great position to capitalize on these opportunities, given our advantaged position as a large owner of senior housing with financial strength and flexibility, far-reaching senior housing sector relationships, and a successful transaction track record. Our investment pace is accelerating, with $1.7 billion of senior housing investment closed or under contract, which is $1 billion more than we stated a quarter ago. The $1.7 billion is comprised of 43 new senior housing communities, 16 different transactions, with a median size of $47 million. We have targeted high performing communities with upside that have demonstrated market-leading performance and should continue to grow NOI due to the strong market fundamentals, increased operating leverage, and competitive pricing. The communities we have purchased are generally large-scale, offering a variety of services including independent living, assisted living and memory care. We are purchasing communities in an attractive investment basis of 250,000 per unit, which is a significant discount to replacement costs. These investments are right in our strike zone. Our stated financial criteria of 7% to 8% expected year 1 NOI yield, low to mid-teens, unlevered IRR, and we continue to purchase below replacement costs. The affordability in the new markets we are entering is supportive where residents can afford greater than 7x our length of stay. We also expect a significant net absorption opportunity during the next few years as a result of growing demographics and minimal new supply in the markets we have selected. We continue to expand with our existing operator relationships as well as welcoming new high performing operators in aligned management agreement. I'll spotlight an investment where we acquired 20 senior housing communities currently operated by Grace Management. This strategic acquisition includes communities operating a mix of independent living, assisted living and memory care, aligning with our focus on value-creating growth in senior housing. These communities are located in markets that support significant potential occupancy growth and price opportunity over the next few years. At 92% occupancy, this investment should benefit from the high operating leverage opportunity as I noted earlier. We expect 7% to 8% year 1 yield and low mid to teen unlevered IRRs consistent with our target financial metrics. This investment expands our relationship with Grace, who is a strong performing existing Ventas operator. Our investment pipeline remains active as we continue to pursue high performing senior housing communities with attractive financial returns. In summary, we are effectively executing on both our organic growth priority in senior housing and value-created senior housing investments. Bob? Hi, its Justin. Yes, if you just look at, for instance, the $1.7 billion that we've either closed or under contract, there's been what 16 transactions. About 9 of those have been developers that were cashing in. There were some repeat sellers. These were just groups we've done transactions with before, came back to us to do it again, just give them a good track record we had with them. And then there's a handful of just PE [ph] firms that were selling for a variety of reasons. I think it's very clear that the fundamentals are really good and that's a great, given all the backdrop and the long runway that Debbie described, it creates a great buying opportunity for us, given our capabilities and our financial strength and flexibility, but it also has created a selling opportunity for certain players as well. So the opportunities have been certainly growing in our pipeline. Yes, so we do have -- it's a cross-section. In the case study, I really focused on eight communities particularly, and even though it was a cross-section, you have a mix of majority IL, AL, a couple in Canada, most of them were in the U.S. So it does speak for the opportunity, I think, really across the board. And we're going to have really the best opportunity to be 100% occupied or really achieve that zero-vacant unit standard in communities that have already established themselves as market leaders. And we have many of those. Certainly, the acquisition pipeline that we pursued are with bona fide market leaders that have a lot of upside ahead. So, we're really pushing to support that outcome and we're pleased to see it start happening. Well, I can tell you that we do track penetration rate. We track it. There's a number of factors that go into our net absorption projections. Penetration across the sector is at 11%. It's basically exactly where it was pre-pandemic. There's -- penetration tends to follow affordability. It's not -- it's one of the reasons why we tend to prefer markets that have very strong affordability because you're going to have a higher utilization of senior housing in those markets. And it trended up. I mean, clearly, a few years ago penetration had fallen off a little bit. It's back where it was. And really to get the results that we're anticipating over time in this multiyear kind of occupancy growth opportunity, you really don't need to see penetration rate move much, if at all. So, there's a strong aging demographic, there's very strong affordability. We're selecting markets that, first and foremost, that have those characteristics. And as Debbie said, we have the platform to really ensure good performance in these markets. And it's certainly helpful to have strong tailwinds. Right. So first of all, we are -- we focused on the spread between the two, and that's been around 300 basis points. And that really held, we expect that to continue. That was considered in the guidance update that we gave. That full year number you mentioned, that's a pretty good proxy for where we've been running. The 300 basis point spread is reflected in the year-to-date performance. With asset class, I can start with SHOP. So Shop had -- we had, year-over-year, we've had, what 150 basis points of margin expansion. That's what we, kind of an expansion we expect to see given the revenue growth we're having relative to the expense growth overall is driven by occupancy and rate. It's really mentioned that RevPOR OpEx metric. There's a sequential change that was impacted by some, we have insurance renewals in the third quarter. There's seasonal expenses that we face. There's -- so there's just typically for us, we don't see improvement from between second and third quarter. And so there's a little bit of a climb sequentially. But on a year-over-year basis, we're certainly seeing margin expansion. Yes, so this is Justin again. I definitely would say private capital is always circling. The conditions over the past year really haven't been supportive of private capital due to the availability and cost of debt. That's put us in really an advanced position. But I would expect that given the fundamentals that we'll see the competition again. We're clearly used to facing the competition and feel very comfortable that we'll get our fair share. We have an advantage platform, from a financial strength flexibility standpoint, we're advantaged from Ventas OI standpoint, where we have the team and the capabilities to really drive outside performance and also just to underwrite, see opportunities where others might not. So I really like our opportunity to continue to compete. Yes, so when we talked about transition communities, a lot of those are in the same-store pool already. There's some that we transitioned last year that will come into the pool. And in that case, we've had really good occupancy growth. We're looking forward to NII opportunity moving forward in those communities. But honestly, it's largely represented already based on the pool that we've been reporting on. Also, in terms of your question around acquisitions, the acquisition [indiscernible] has been around 90%, 91%. That's across the board. And the reason for that is we're targeting bona fide market leaders in markets that have more upside so that we can drive occupancy and price in communities that have a proven track record of delivering best-in-class quality care and services and should continue to really outperform. And so we really like how the acquisitions are positioned. Juan, I'm going to try to answer this. So without giving too much information up here, I'm going to start with rent because we're just not going to get into the '25 numbers, but we do think the environment is favorable for pricing. And so we'll report more on that in the future. In terms of the lead indicators, we've had throughout the entire year leads and tours have been running higher than last year. That was true through the third quarter. It's true in October. So that's obviously driving move-ins and occupancy growth. As I mentioned we've had industry-leading occupancy growth and that really all starts with our ability to drive business to the doorstep. So we're pleased with that performance and encouraged by it, even this late in the season, to see the activity that we're seeing. So there's notice periods in the resident agreements that can range anywhere from 10 days to 30 days, depending on the circumstances. So you have visibility into when a unit will become available. There's also the opportunity for new residents. If you think about the demand that you're experiencing in a community that has zero vacant units, prospective residents are going to want to make sure they have access to the unit. So they take financial possession proactively. That happens oftentimes. But even if they don't, if you really think about what we're talking about, we're talking about a 400 square foot unit that has -- it's lightly furnished, has some personal belongings but nothing like we have in our own homes. And you're -- one operator targets a 30-minute turnaround because it's a deep clean and a touch up pain. If it needs more than that, you might add a few hours to that. But this is not a complex unit turn. It's extremely simple. It can happen quickly. You can plan for it. And so that really leads to this opportunity to have zero-making units. That combined with the demand at the doorstep and, most importantly, positioning yourself as a market leader because you're the best at what you do in your market. Yes, sure, Justin. Yes, this is a unique opportunity to potentially own one of the highest quality senior housing assets in the country, quite frankly. This is [indiscernible] senior living. It's a high-rise in Seattle that has a mix of independent living and assisted living and member care product. It's high price point, very attractive physical plant. You're getting a renter anywhere from $10,000 to $20,000 per month. It was a good opportunity to get a high yield loan. It's a senior secured loan, so we're the only lender. We have properties collateral and other credit enhancements. But I think what's most exciting and interesting to us is potentially buying it. We have a typical ROFO. Clearly, we're the right type of buyer for an asset like this. It was just a neat opportunity to put money out at a really nice return and bridge the potential ownership. Thank you. Yes, I think that probably the best way to attack that is really just to talk about our overall independent living performance in the U.S. Independent living has been a strong, really equal contributor to the overall occupancy growth that we've had. Holiday is part of that. We've had other operators operate independent living as well. There's been really strong demand. There is -- it also tends to be a higher occupied asset. So it also has very high operating leverage. And so as occupancy grows, we expect it to be a big contributor from an NOI standpoint. But we've seen really good progress and momentum in the independent living product across the board. Yes, so typically you would see, the key selling season is May to September. Most of the occupancy growth is going to come during that period. It is also typical seasonality to see a downturn in occupancy in the fourth quarter. We are not seeing that. We're expecting growth in occupancy in the fourth quarter based on the performance that we've seen so far. So everything is off to a really good start in that regard. We've talked about our outperformance as well and I think that's notable when you compare us to the top 99 markets, we've been -- we have 380 basis points growth in the [indiscernible] top 99 versus 230 across the sector and then our sequential growth was really strong. And so we are -- as I mentioned, now it's 140 basis points outperformance versus 70 basis points. So, it's two times the sector sequential occupancy growth in the third quarter. And as I mentioned, all the leading indicators and our expectations around occupancy remain very confident. So that's leading into a good fourth quarter so far. Hi, Justin. So I mean, I think the best way to look at Brookdale at this stage is that they have an option to renew. And so, if they renew, then in 2026 there's a 4% or 3% escalator. It could be as high as 10% that's subject to a fair market lease review. If there something [indiscernible] obviously that would be mutually agreed upon. And if they don't, then it becomes a SHOP opportunity. And we do like the opportunity to run the playbook. We have a bent up platform, we have well established operators that have been ready to turn around. We've proven we know where to invest and when to drive occupancy. And they're in markets that have significant tailwinds. And so it's a good opportunity, but all the options are really on the table right now, and it's coming down to the deadline. Well, I mean, from our perspective, we like the opportunity to have some or all of those communities in our SHOP portfolio. But the reality is Brookdale has the option to renew. So, the decision really sits with them. If there is something in between, it could really be a win, where we could have some amount of the community move to shop and go pursue the opportunity in the playbook like I mentioned. But that's hypothetical. What we really need to have happen is to see what Brookdale's decision is and then we'll go from there."

            "name": "Debra Cafaro",
            "content": "Thank you BJ. I want to welcome all of our shareholders and other participants to the Ventas third quarter 2024 earnings call. Today, I will discuss Ventas' strong results in the quarter and our improved 2024 expectations as we execute on our Focus 123 [ph] strategy to capture the unprecedented multiyear growth opportunity in senior housing. As one of the largest participants in the longevity economy, Ventas thrives in meeting demand from a large and growing aging population. Within this favorable macro environment, we are taking two clear actions to deliver results and growth, now and into the future. First, we are driving profitable organic growth in our senior housing operating portfolio, generating our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit NOI growth from our [indiscernible] SHOP business. Our team is using its experiential insights and data analytics to propel results and take advantage of this unique opportunity of favorable supply-demand in senior housing. Second, at the same time, we are ramping up our investments in senior housing. Here, we also enjoy a compelling value creation opportunity of private-to-public arbitrage. We can and are acquiring assets with highly attractive financial return expectations at accretive year 1 yield that expand our senior housing footprint, increase our enterprise growth rate, and strengthen our balance sheet. We rarely see this powerful combination of organic and external growth opportunities, and we are dedicating our resources to seed them to create value for our stakeholders. Before I unpack those themes, let's get to the numbers. Ventas delivered $0.80 of normalized FFO per share in the third quarter, reflecting 7% year-over-year increase driven by occupancy and revenue outperformance. This result was powered by SHOP with 15% year-over-year cash NOI growth. Total same-store cash NOI grew nearly 8% and our credit statistics continue to improve. As a result, we're once again raising our 2024 normalized FFO per share guidance, as well as our SHOP and Total Company same-store cash NOI expectations. As we execute our strategy, SHOP organic growth is the engine and is powering us forward. Year-to-date, SHOP NOI has increased nearly 16% and our RevPOR, OpExPOR spread is a strong 300 basis points, leading to margin expansion. Margin is increasing and should expand further as occupancies continue to rise and operating leverage takes hold. With the over-ageing population expected to increase 27% over the next 5 years, our communities are well-positioned for future NOI growth because they provide exceptional, affordable environments in markets with compelling supply-demand dynamics. As we look ahead, we believe we have a long runway for continued growth in senior housing. Our prior occupancy peak and SHOP reached 92% in late 2014, when conditions weren't nearly as favorable as they are now. Our goal is to shoot for and exceed prior peaks of occupancy and NOI over time as surging demand outpaces senior housing construction, which sits at record low levels and inflation moderates. Our markets show particularly favorable conditions and we expect to continue to drive significant upside as our Ventas team and OI platform work with our peer providers to drive outperformance. We've also ramped up our investments in senior housing to $1.7 billion this year. Here too, we are utilizing our OI insight, field experience and industry relationships to identify attractive opportunities, increase our enterprise growth rate, and expand our senior housing footprint. As a result of this investment activity, we expect SHOP NOI to increase by 12 percentage points and senior housing to grow to well over half of our business by year-end. These acquisitions fit squarely into our articulated strategic and financial framework and should create value for shareholders. We've rarely seen such favorable investment market conditions where the pool of available assets is large and growing, and investments should generate relatively high year 1 yield and offer significant future growth. Importantly, we are well-positioned from a balance sheet, cost of capital and experience standpoint to be highly active and successful. We intend to build on our momentum to continue to expand our participation in the unprecedented multiyear growth opportunity in senior housing. At Ventas, we have a long history of taking a holistic view of delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders. Last month, we released our 2023-2024 Corporate Sustainability Report, which details our key initiatives as we enable exceptional environments benefiting a large and growing aging population. I am proud of our sustainability leadership and accomplishments and our team which are widely recognized. Our integrated approach has enabled us to deliver nearly 19% annual PSR since the beginning of 2000. In sum, I feel great about where our business is and where it's heading. Our enterprise enjoys durable, inelastic demographic demand, powering a multiyear runway for growth. Our platform and team are driving outperformance and capturing market share. Because of these favorable secular and structural advantages, we are well-positioned to deliver value for our shareholders and advance our important mission to help people live longer, healthier and happier lives. And the whole Ventas team is enthusiastically going after it. Now I'm happy to turn the call over to Justin. Thanks Nick. Good morning. So the construction as a percentage of inventory is at record low, as I mentioned. I think just a little over 2,000 units were started this quarter, and we're seeing annual increases in the resident, the customer base of over 500,000 a year growing. And so we're still seeing constrained supply considerations including lending, including costs, and including rent levels which would have to be significantly higher to justify new construction. So there is a long runway. We know there's a significant lag as we saw in the financial crisis it was 4 or 5 years and then we really peaked in occupancy and as I mentioned conditions were far less favorable then. Senior population grew 4% over 5 years and now it's growing 27%. We see that step function a few years from now in the population when the baby boomers start to enter the over aging population. So it is a long runway and we feel really good about it and that's why we feel that this combination of organic and external growth is a real winner. Yes, good question. Yes and the asset should perform better in our hands. Thanks, James. Hi, Jeff. It's Debbie. We're definitely prioritizing investing in senior housing. That's really foundational to the strategy that we're executing and certainly we believe in the business long-term. But right now, our key focus is in [indiscernible] and senior housing. Our same-store pool -- thanks for the question. I think it's important to start by saying that, our same-store pool is really the lion share of our total shop portfolio. So is it good representation of the overall performance? Thanks for the question. Yes, you're right. The Canadian portfolio is an incredible tool. I mean, it really has been terrific and continues to be a significant contributor to growth. And so, we've managed that portfolio by basically leveraging it in a way that provides a greatest value instead want to continue to work with the operators to drive occupancy and performance. Yes, I mean, in -- our philosophy is really to grow our SHOP with risk. Thanks, Rich. Look, I think that there are multiple reasons that we're enjoying these compelling investment opportunities now. Obviously, our cost of capital and the relationships and experience are helping. There is limited competition because of debt markets, but you really hit on I think something very important and differentiating and I'll brag on Justin and the team a little bit. I mean, there is a moat. It is a business that requires significant expertise and also data analytics. And that's the more it feeds on itself in a positive way. And so we have the scale, we have the data, we have the experience, with Justin having operated, we have an industry relationship with the operators. And all of those things create a significant competitive advantage that should enable us to really be a premier global owner of senior housing. And that does, I think, keep competition less. And of course, we're always dealing with competition over the last 25 years, and we now have to get more than our fair share. But that is you've really hit on I think a very important reason and that is the competitive mode that we have that gives us these compelling investment opportunities. I mean -- yes, I mean, look, we're very pleased to be delivering strong cost performance for our shareholders. That's what we're here for. And that's obviously a variable metric that goes into our calculus and it changes over time. And right now it's working for us and hopefully we'll continue to do so and even get better. Well, I mean, if it goes beyond the contractual notice date, then [indiscernible] no longer has the option to renew the cub. Your next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Well, we're really focused -- hi Omotayo, I'm glad you got on, even though most of your questions were answered. But I do think that we are in a favorable spot as we participate in this longevity economy because we do have a consumer-driven product that has significant demand and we have the platform that is driving out performance there. It should have limited impact, really, regardless of what happens in the election. There may be impacts on long rates, depending on who's elected, that could affect kind of the real estate sector writ large. But as a public company who is in an advantaged position relative to private equity in real estate right now I would think that we would be -- we would have a better position than the real estate market public and private. The public guys you have [indiscernible] or have an advantage because of access to cost of capital. Thank you. We had great sequential average occupancy growth that Justin talked about, if he can repeat it here from the second to the third. Well, yes. Remember there's, what I would comment on is that if it transitions to shop, remember that the lease has -- is well covered from an EBITDAR or NOI standpoint to [indiscernible]. And so there's an excess amount of EBITDAR compared to RET. So that would have to be taken into account as you consider what the impact would be of a conversion of the whole Brookdale lease to shop. And that's a favorable fact pattern. Does that make sense? Do you understood? [Multiple speakers] what I'm saying. Okay, good. There's more EBITDAR than cash rev. Okay, thanks. And the outcomes are all favorable. Thanks. Hi, Nick, Debbie. Yes, I mean, you could expect if the year 1 yields are kind of 7.5% that you'd have kind of a current yield and kind of a low sevens go into that higher number over the next 12 months after acquisition. So there's growth in the assets. Sure. So, we had really a favorable resolution with Kindred that had used a lot of the tools in our toolbox and our experience in these types of situations. So, the goal of all of it was really to improve coverage on the overall master lease with the investments really fit in to that philosophy because they will bring up coverage in the -- they have brought up coverage in the overall master lease. They're well-performing assets that have additional EBITDAR improvement and positive trends. And so it really -- it significantly improved, Kindred's credit profile. So it helps the lease, it helps then pass with a good risk-adjusted return and made for a stronger tenant overall because it enables Kindred to improve its balance sheet. So overall, it just fit in nicely along with the warrants and revenue-based rent, which will give us a potential, upside performance or valuation improve. So it's an overall holistic approach, as we would always do in these situations, to get an outcome that is the best for our stakeholders. Thank you. Great question. What we really like right now is the investments that we've made and that are under contract really are right down the fairway in terms of what our financial and strategic objective [indiscernible]. So as I mentioned in my remarks, really high kind of immediate yields and they have significant growth embedded in them. And that's a very attractive profile and we want to continue executing on that profile because we think it's a really good risk-adjusted return. Now, we could expand the aperture along the lines of what you've described, but we have to feel that the risk-adjusted return is the same or better than what we're currently doing, which is pretty darn exciting. Yes, there can always be something better than a binary out and that's what we always look for. Thank you. John, thanks so much. I really want to thank all of our participants in the call for your interest in Ventas and your participation today. We look forward to seeing you in Las Vegas soon."

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Ventas Second 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to BJ Grant, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nBill Grant: Thank you, Bailey, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Ventas Second Quarter 2024 results conference call.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Debra Cafaro, Chairman and CEO of Ventas.\nDebra Cafaro: Thank you BJ. On behalf of all of my colleagues, I want to welcome our shareholders and other participants to the Ventas Second Quarter 2024 earnings call. It\u2019s an exciting time for our business. We are driving performance in the early stages of an unprecendented multi-year NOI growth opportunity, fueled by powerful demographic demand and the most favorable fundamentals ever in the senior housing industry. Ventas plays an essential role in the longevity economy, serving a large and growing aging population, with over half our business and senior housing. This creates a compelling, near and long-term growth and value creation opportunity. Today I'll discuss Ventus's strong results and our latest increase in our 2024 expectations. As we generate outperformance in our senior housing operating portfolio, increase shop investment activity, optimize net operating income throughout our portfolio, and improve our financial strengths. Let's start with results. We began 2024 with momentum, which continued in the second quarter. Our enterprise delivered $0.80 of normalized FFO per share, reflecting 7% year-over-year growth. SHOP led the way with same-store cash and NOI growth of over 15%. Total company same-store cash NOI grew nearly 8%. And our balance sheet is trending positively, with 50 basis points of leverage improvement already year-to-date. We are pleased to once again raise our 2024 normalized FFO per share guidance and our total company same-store NOI expectations on the strength of this performance. Our growth expectations and value creation opportunity put us in the top cohort of companies across the REIT landscape. We're executing on our focus strategy designed to deliver growth and value to our stakeholders. As a reminder, there are three prongs to the Ventas strategy. Deliver profitable organic growth in our senior housing portfolio, capture value through investments focused on senior housing, and drive cash flow throughout our portfolio. Here are some key updates in each of those areas. In SHOP, we have now delivered eight consecutive quarters of double-digit, year-over-year same-store organic cash NOI growth. More importantly, we see a durable multi-year NOI growth opportunity ahead of us, powered by occupancy gains and revenue growth. Senior living provides invaluable benefits to residents and their families. In the quarter, occupancy grew 320 basis points year-over-year, significantly outperforming industry benchmarks, and revenue expanded 8%. Our data-driven decisions enable execution by talented operators, enabled our communities to attract more than our fair share of the strong demographic demand for senior living. Remember that our prior senior housing occupancy peak was 92%. Currently, our portfolio has trended to 84% occupancy and 27% margins. There is an additional $140 million incremental NOI opportunity simply by getting to 88% occupancy and 30% margins in the portfolio, when shop NOI would approximate $1 billion a year. From there, we expect our portfolio, operators, and communities to shoot for and potentially beyond that 92% prior occupancy peak because surging demand and suppressed senior housing construction are creating such favorable conditions, particularly in our markets. The shop resident base we serve, primarily the over 80 population, should grow by over 24% in the next five years. This population is increasing rapidly each year, from about half a million people annually now to over 800,000 individuals starting in 2027, as the leading edge of the gigantic baby boomer cohort turns 80. Yet, there were only about 1,300 units of senior housing started in the second quarter, and construction as a percent of inventory is only 1%. Both the lowest on record. Equally important, the duration of new construction continues to elongate, and we expect deliveries to be constrained for years to come. This favorable supply-demand backdrop provides powerful tailwinds and a long and unprecedented runway for growth. Justin will explain how our actions, platform, data and insights, together with our operators, deliver value to seniors and their families and position Ventas to outperform a strong market. We are also increasing our investment activity focused on senior housing as we execute on the second prong of our strategy. We're on track to close about $750 million of investments this year. Given the favorable market conditions and the strength of our pipeline for quality acquisitions, we are committed to ramping up our investment activity. Ventas is one of the country's largest owners of senior housing and we are excited about the external growth opportunities we see in the market. Rarely in my career have investment conditions been as constructive. We can invest in senior housing assets with high single-digit going-in yields and substantial near-term NOI growth prospects. Replacement costs, net absorption projections and affordability remain key criteria in our investment approach. These senior housing investments expand our shop footprint, increase our enterprise growth rate and reinforce our consistent commitment to financial strength. Third, we're also focused on driving cash flow and value creation throughout our portfolio. Our outpatient medical and research portfolio once again contributed complementary compounding growth for Ventas, powered by our competitively advantaged Lillibridge operating platform that excels in tenant satisfaction and retention. We also want to provide you with greater clarity on the 23 LTACs operated by Kindred with the least maturity of April 30, 2025. These long-term acute care hospitals represent about 5% of our NOI or $110 million annually. We've made a lot of progress since we last updated you. Currently, we are in advanced discussions with Kindred regarding a lease resolution for these properties. While a deal is not done and terms could change, we and Kindred are close to a transaction that would result in a 25% to 30% full-year rent reduction on these 23 LTACs starting May 1, 2025. About two-thirds of that amount would be reflected in calendar year 2025. We'll be happy to share more with you if and when a deal is concluded. We continue working toward a positive lease resolution that optimizes Ventas value and the NOI from these 23 properties, strengthens the master lease, and supports Kindred's future success. There are two final items that represent our approach to thoughtful investing and creation of win-win outcomes with our operators over time. First, Ardent recently completed its successful IPO, and we congratulate the management team and our partners. Ardent has done it right, focusing on patients, quality clinical care, employees, and communities. Ardent's current equity value exceeds $2.5 billion, and as Sam Zell used to say, liquidity is value. With $1.6 billion invested in assets operated by Ardent, Ventas has always been happy with Ardent's financial stability, its operational acumen, and its steady growth. The company's IPO has further enhanced this positive investment. In addition, Ventas has an ownership stake in Ardent, currently valued at about $170 million, over four times our original investment. And we believe there's additional upside in Ardent's business and its valuation. Also, in the second quarter, we monetized about 10% of our Brookdale warrants for $6 million in cash profits. We received these warrants as part of the successful lease arrangements we concluded with Brookdale in 2020. The warrants provide upside sharing in Brookdale's success and take advantage of the positive macro conditions in senior housing. Our current in-the-money value of our Brookdale warrants is about $70 million. Stepping back, we are optimistic about the future of our business, which is centered on helping a large and growing aging population live longer, healthier and happier lives. As the broader economy shows significant signs of flowing down and the labor market softens, Ventas' business with over half in senior housing is highly advantaged across the REIT space. All our asset classes benefit from inelastic, need-driven, demographically-driven demand, and most benefit from a softer employment backdrop. As a result, we have an unprecedented multi-year growth opportunity right in front of us. With favorable results this quarter and our improved outlook, our team is focused on doing everything we can to execute our strategy and continue to drive Ventas' performance and returns. With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Justin.\nJustin Hutchens: Thank you, Debbie. I'm happy to report on another good quarter for our shop portfolio and another guidance raise led by occupancy. As Debbie mentioned, the macro backdrop is very supportive from a supply-demand standpoint. I'm pleased that part one of our strategy, which is to deliver profitable growth in senior housing, is off to a good start, as we are seeing very strong execution from our operators with support from our Ventas OI platform initiatives. The key selling season is delivering strong results so far in May, June, and July, as leading indicators and occupancy are all performing really well, building on our best-in-class occupancy performance. I'd also like to highlight that our net move-in volume year-to-date was 13 times higher than last year, contributing to our outperformance, driven by our Atria and Holiday portfolios, as well as Santerre Priority Life and Discovery Senior Living. The second quarter same-store shop revenue grew 8%, and occupancy grew by 320 basis points, led by the U.S., with 380 basis points year-over-year, and 90 basis points sequentially, leading to an absolute occupancy of 85.6%, led by Canada at almost 96%, and an overall operating margin of 27.4%, all of which are industry-leading metrics. I'd like to spotlight Le Groupe Maurice, who operates full-service active adult communities for us in Quebec, and represents nearly 60% of our NOI in Canada. They have consistently delivered stellar performance. The 380 basis points of occupancy gains in the U.S. was driven by broad-based performance across our portfolio, with growth of 400 basis points in assisted living, and 340 basis points in independent living year-over-year. Spot occupancy was particularly strong in our communities compared to the market. The U.S. spot occupancy grew 450 basis points year-over-year in the top 99 markets, which is 200 basis points faster than the NIC average. Furthermore, the U.S. spot occupancy grew 150 basis points sequentially in the top 99 markets, almost three times faster than the NIC average. 88% of our total shop NOI is included in our same store portfolio. We were pleased to achieve 8% revenue growth in our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit NOI growth at 15.2% year-over-year. The spread between RevPOR growth at 4% and OpExPOR growth at 1% remains very healthy at about 300 basis points. The key driver of value creation will continue to be occupancy growth due to the high operating leverage in the business. Margin expansion will increase as occupancy ticks higher, and particularly in communities that are over 90% occupied. I'd like to thank our operating partners. There are too many to mention, as there are so many strong contributors taking great care of people and delivering excellent operating results. Given the outperformance in the first half, we are happy to raise our full-year guidance expectations again on our same-store-shop portfolio by 50 basis points to 14.5% at the midpoint. Our average occupancy growth expectations have increased to about 280 basis points, up from 270. The remaining key assumptions that drive the midpoint of our range remain in line with what we previously communicated. Now I'll give an update on our Ventas OI platform and initiatives. We continue to advance our Ventas Operational Insights platform, which was formally launched in 2022. This platform is designed to drive outperformance in this multi-year occupancy growth opportunity and is the cornerstone of part one of our strategy, which is to drive organic growth in our shop portfolio. This platform enables us to combine our best-in-class analytics with our operating expertise to drive thoughtful conversations and actionable insights with the operators to quickly make informed decisions on critical areas of the business. The increased availability of real-time data through systems and reporting automation have allowed our operating partners to benefit from key insights across a wide variety of initiatives. Our platform has enabled deep analysis into sales and price optimization, market positioning, targeted NOI generating CapEx, and digital marketing, to name a few. I'll cover some proof points on how we have driven occupancy and NOI with Ventas OI. I'll start with NOI generating CapEx. In assessing which communities receive refreshed capital investments, we analyze the community's position in the market and prioritize those where investment would most improve occupancy and rate relative to the competitive set. We further analyze overall market characteristics, including forward-looking net demand, home values, net worth, affordability, among other data points to support our position that capital would drive robust NOI growth and generate outsized returns. We have completed 215 projects since the start of this program in late 2022, of which 133 are at least six months post-project completion. This group has grown occupancy by over 530 basis points and outperformed their respective markets by 350 basis points of growth. RevPOR has also grown 6.5%, demonstrating the effectiveness of this re-dev program. Next, price volume optimization. We continue to collaborate with operators on a monthly basis, monitoring street rate pricing on nearly all units in our U.S. shop portfolio relative to our proprietary market data to ensure pricing is set to optimize move-ins. Our automated monthly rent roll consolidation process enables us to efficiently analyze over 8 million rows of historical street rate pricing data to better understand market positioning and proactively identify price opportunities. We've executed this process and successfully optimized price and volume, resulting in improved sales momentum through the second quarter across several operators, including Sunrise, Atria Holiday, and Priority Life Care. These operators have improved their move-in performance by 25%. Next, digital marketing. We've also executed digital marketing initiatives focused on driving higher move-ins. Improving the attractiveness of the website to Google search, for instance, and user experience improvements have allowed potential residents and families to easily gather information to learn about the living, service, and care options available in our communities. Our focus on digital marketing has produced double-digit improvement in move-ins derived from website referrals. Summarizing VentasOI, the tools we have created for our platform have enabled us to perform and continue delivering growth. As part of our OI engagements, over 1,000 of which we've completed since I started, we are proactively sharing insights, data, and benchmarks with our operating partners to align on performance expectations. Moving on to investments, where we are executing on part two of our strategy, which is to capture value-creating external growth focused on senior housing. We are in a unique period of time. The best I've seen in my career, where we have a combination of relatively high yield and high growth investment opportunities in senior housing leading to very attractive, unlevered IRRs. The sector is supported by tremendous demographic tailwinds. In the second quarter, we continued our strong run of executing on attractive external growth opportunities. We closed approximately $300 million of value-creating investments in 12 senior housing communities, 10 of which are with existing Ventas operator relationships, bringing the year-to-date volume up to $350 million at a blended going-in yield greater than 8%. In addition to the accretive going-in yield, these investments are positioned squarely within our right market, right asset, right operator framework, and now is the right time to invest in senior housing as this favorable positioning amplified by the unprecedented supply demand backdrop will drive continued NOI growth resulting in unlevered IRRs in the low to mid-teens. We also continue to invest in extremely attractive basis below replacement costs with an average per unit purchase price of $250,000. Looking forward, our pipeline remains robust, filled with actionable opportunities with both existing and new operator relationships with a profile similar to the deals already closed in 2024. Specifically, we have lined a site to an incremental $400 million of senior housing investments bringing the total 2024 senior housing investment volume to $750 million. Additionally, we are deeply engaged in executing this high priority of expanding our shop portfolio. We continue to underwrite a large and growing pipeline of attractive, near term opportunities and are confident in our ability to continue creating value via additional external growth going forward. Now I'll hand over to Bob.\nRobert Probst: Thank you, Justin. I'll start with our second quarter performance, provide an update on our leverage and liquidity and conclude with our updated and improved guidance. I'm pleased to report that Ventas delivered strong second quarter results led by SHOP and with contributions across the property portfolio. In our Outpatient Medical & Research Segment, or OMAR, we generated over 3% same store cash NOI growth in the quarter with strong margins and stable occupancy. In our outpatient medical portfolio, Pete and team continued to build leasing momentum, executing over 800,000 square feet of new and renewal deals in the quarter, which translated to 30 basis points of sequential occupancy gains. Further, the equalized loan portfolio outpatient medical assets have made significant progress, increasing occupancy 450 basis points year-over-year to 81.5% in the second quarter, leveraging the Lillibridge operating platform and playbook to drive growth. Meanwhile, our university-based research portfolio increased same-store cash NOI by 5.5% in the second quarter, with 160 basis points of occupancy growth across the same store portfolio. Our new leasing pipeline is attractive at 1.3 million square feet, with over half already executed. For the enterprise in the second quarter, we reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.05 per share. Our Q2 normalized FFO per share of $0.80 represents a 7% increase year-over-year. Underpaying this result was year-over-year shop same store growth of 15%, and total company's same store growth of nearly 8%. We're seeing the benefit of the execution of our strategy with a 50 basis point improvement in our net debt EBITDA metrics so far this year. Organic shop growth and equity-funded new investments in senior housing are driving the improvement. The multi-year growth expected in senior housing and the robust investment pipeline are expected to continue to improve our leverage ratio going forward. So far this year, we've closed down 350 million of new investments and have raised 500 million in equity. We have included in our updating guidance another 400 million in equity-funded investments focused on senior housing that are expected to close this year. Year-to-date, we completed 234 million in asset sales. And our liquidity at the end of the second quarter was strong at $3.3 billion, including over $550 million of cash on hand and with limited remaining debt maturities in 2024. I'll close with our updated improved 2024 guidance. We've raised our outlook for net income attributable to common stockholders to now range from $0.07 to $0.13 per diluted share. We increased the midpoint of our full-year normalized FFO guidance to $3.15 per share from the previous midpoint at $3.14 per share. Our improved full-year midpoint is driven by $0.025 combined improvement from shop organic and inorganic growth, partially offset by a $0.015 non-cash impact from potential kindred lease resolution in 2024. We've also raised our same-store cash NOI year-over-year growth midpoint expectations for each of our segments. Total company's same-store cash NOI is now expected to grow 7.25% year-over-year, an increase of 25 basis points from our prior guidance, and 100 basis points higher than our original guidance back in February. For additional 2024 guidance assumptions, please see our Q2 supplemental and earnings presentation deck posted to our website. To close, we are pleased with the results for the first half of the year and we're committed to continued value creation in the second half and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nick Joseph of Citi. Your line is open.\nNicholas Joseph: Thank you. Just wanted to hopefully get a little more color on the potential kindred resolution. As you think about resetting those rents, how do you think about rent coverage, the opportunity for growth there? And then just in terms of the timing, when would you expect kind of a final resolution and is it going to be for all of the facilities or could some of them come back to you? Thanks.\nDebra Cafaro: Good morning, Nick. Good to hear from you. The answer to your questions are that we are in advanced discussions. We believe we're close on a transaction that applies to the 23 LTACs, whose maturity is April 30, 2025. And obviously we're working for multiple goals, which is to improve Ventas enterprise value, to get the most NOI from those properties that we can, and also to strengthen the master lease and to support kindred's future success. So those are all factors in how we're thinking about it.\nNicholas Joseph: Thank you. And then maybe just pivoting to the acquisition pipeline. Sounds like sounds like it's starting to go there. So just curious kind of what you're seeing. Are these lease up opportunities and a more stabilized kind of just color broadly on the opportunity set that you're looking at?\nDebra Cafaro: Justin.\nJustin Hutchens: Sure. So we are seeing a number of different opportunities. Where we're leaning in is when the pipeline meets our investment criteria and we're very focused on the market asset operator framework, looking for markets that have strong supply demand fundamentals and support strong net absorption and affordability. We do like, apply in the Ventas OI platform. We're also narrating the strong track record in the communities and looking for, generally well invested communities as well. We're primarily expanding with the existing operator relationships, but we have had the opportunity to add some new relationships as well. And we're looking for campuses that include independent living, sister living and memory care, rental campuses. And we're seeing those in the pipeline. The pipeline's been growing throughout the year and we were actively engaged in it. And we like our opportunity to continue to grow.\nNicholas Joseph: Thank you very much.\nDebra Cafaro: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nMichael Carroll: Yes, thanks. I wanted to touch on the kindred update real quick. And I know Debbie probably can't talk about too much directly related to this discussion. But, in general, why would Ventas record about a penny and a half non-cash charge in 2024? I mean, is there like a cash payment that's expected that needs to be amortized this year? I guess what's some of the reasons that we drive that?\nDebra Cafaro: Yes. Yes, it's all non-cash. I mean, it's a pretty simple, but it's a gap related, somewhat counterintuitive rule. Like basically, if you have a lease with a tenant and it gets extended, you basically sum up the rent over the years and you divide by the period left and that can pull forward an impact. And that's really all it is.\nMichael Carroll: And that happens from the time you signed the deal. It happens immediately.\nDebra Cafaro: So it's just a gap reflection of the expectations on cash rents that we gave you.\nMichael Carroll: Okay, that makes a lot of sense. Thanks. And then just real quick on the on the shop guidance, I know that the RevPOR target is 5% and you're tracking a little behind that in the first half of the year. I guess are you able to push street rates higher? And is that's why you think you can generate slightly better shop RevPOR growth in the second half of the year kind of accelerating that growth compared to the first half of the year?\nJustin Hutchens: Well, so first of all, on the guidance, it's occupancy led. We've obviously raised our occupancy expectation and we raised our NOI expectation as well. We did not change the other metrics. RevPOR, in this environment where you have a lot of occupancy growth, mix can be more impactful just due to the sheer volume of occupancy growth that we've had. In the second quarter, there's a couple of things impacting RevPOR. We had mix where we had very strong occupancy growth in our mid-price point product. So it just has an impact on the weighted average. And then there's a year-over-year comp, that's affecting it because of the very strong rent increases we had in certain operators in the first half of last year. As we move forward, we would expect that there's better comps in the second half of the year. We have a large part of the key selling season still ahead of us, a lot of potential volume as part of that. So, mix will remain in focus. And so we thought leaving the TILDA 5 was appropriate, given those facts, and look forward to growing NOI.\nMichael Carroll: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Yes, good morning everyone. I just wanted to ask about the acquisitions that you're including in GuideNow. I guess historically you only included what was signed up until that point. I guess why change your strategy here? And then if you could maybe just let us know how much of a benefit that additional acquisitions is for 2024. I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of the timing and whatnot.\nDebra Cafaro: Hi, Josh. Thanks for your question. We're excited about the opportunities to invest in senior housing, and Bob will answer your impact question.\nRobert Probst: And you're right to say that, that started this year in February, including deals that we hadn't closed was unusual for us. But we feel very confident given the pipeline and the team that we can execute on those deals. We started the year at 350 in our guidance done, closed. We have now 400 million in the forecast to close this year. So doing what we said, the contribution from those is in the two and a half cents increased guidance on FFO from shop organic and inorganic, I would say the split of those is roughly equal. If not tipped a bit towards the new investment. So they are created from the get go equity funded and very consistent with the strategy we laid out.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay, and then I guess maybe just the acquisitions themselves, like what kind of a cap rates are you seeing? And is it all senior housing? And our idea structure or is there a kind of mix of other things in there?\nDebra Cafaro: Josh, our capital allocation priority is focused on senior housing shop investments and Justin will touch on, there's a series of both qualitative data driven characteristics we're looking for as well as financial.\nJustin Hutchens: Yes, absolutely. So, starting, I'll just kind of highlight, for example, the some metrics around the deal activity that's already closed. In those deals, we underwrote net absorption upside over a three year period in the markets of around a thousand basis points. Very strong population growth near zero new supply deliveries expected in the next few years within the markets. Very attractive investment basis at 250,000 per unit, well below replacement costs. They're about 10 years old on average. There are 124 units offering independent living, assisted living and memory care. Good margins going in, but a lot of upside, going in margin around 28%. A lot of upside as we grow occupancy and rate over time and aligned management contracts. They're rewarding growth both for revenue and NOI outcomes, to the manager. And then, good operators, most of which are existing relationships, but we're also, working with some new operators and the going in yields have been really, above eight thus far. We were targeting seven to eight overall, the unlevered IRRs, low-to-mid teens. So that's the characteristics we've seen and continue to see in this next tranche, very similar characteristics in this 400 million that we have line of sight on.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Appreciate that.\nDebra Cafaro: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRonald Kamdem: Hey, just two quick ones for me. Just staying on acquisitions. Obviously you've seen a pickup this year, which is why you increased the guidance, but trying to figure out is there sort of volume and opportunity that, you could get to a billion on an annual run rate basis is sort of question number one. And number two is just, can you remind us the sellers of these all sort of funds coming due just to nature of the sellers here? Thanks.\nJustin Hutchens: Well, we're certainly interested in ramping up the activity. We haven't put any targets out there in terms of volume, but more is the priority for sure given the fundamentals and the returns that we're seeing in the investments. The types of sellers, there's some certainly sellers that have debt maturities and they're having to make a decision. Even though fundamentals are good, do they put more capital in or do they, do they, sell the asset and move on to other priorities? We've been able to take advantage of some of those opportunities. There's other sellers that just quite frankly are dealing with fund maturities and they're just active sellers and then there's others that are selling senior housing a little bit reluctantly because they have other asset classes that they're dealing with and debt and other aspects of their fund. And so, we've had a wide variety and that's what's been consistent though is, good fundamentals. We're targeting markets that have really, great upside and then the returns have been excellent.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. That's it for me. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jim Kammert with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nJames Kammert: Thank you. Good morning. Certainly appreciate Debbie your comment regarding inelastic need-based profile, this industry. I don't think many would disagree, but you also hear, at least I have that some, you know, the arguments that staying at home is still cheaper than senior care. How do you maybe within your OI or marketing initiatives? One, I guess you agree with that statement, and two, how do you educate the consumer here about the trade-off?\nDebra Cafaro: Great question. And, and one of the things we care a lot about is we and operators are offering residents and their families a really important service. And it's really valuable. Anyone who's gone through it in their families really understands that. And penetration is back at or above, that is utilization by the population is at or above where it was pre-COVID. So that's trending in the right direction. The numbers are gigantic. So that dwarfs the impact even of penetration rate. And importantly, there are a lot of studies that show not only are seniors more secure and enjoy better lives when they move to senior housing from their homes, that it's safer, it's more secure, it's more social, but also it is more expensive to stay in your home. And that's the cost of replacing all those services, even if you can do it, which in many, many cases, if you live alone in a suburban home, you can't even get those services on a regular basis, that it is more economical to move to senior housing. You don't have lawn mowing and maintenance, taxes and insurance meals, etcetera. So it really is a replacement for what you're spending anyway or even better if you're requiring in-home health services.\nJames Kammert: Great. I need to do more reading. Thank you. And then I'll go quick one to pick on Bob. Good news is here, I think your exchange will note you're in the money. And could you remind me, give them a share price, could you remind me how is it accounting for that? I know you have the option to settle the conversion value in cash, but how will you account for that in potential dilution if the presuming stock stays above the conversion price? Thanks.\nRobert Probst: Yes, Jim, it is a high quality situation for sure. The conversion price is just below 55. Those get accounted for in the fully diluted shares. It's a really modest impact at this stage and effectively embedded in the guidance, but I put this in the high quality problem camp. But de minimis as we think about the numbers this year as it stands now.\nJames Kammert: Right. Thank you.\nRobert Probst: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO. Your line is open.\nJuan Sanabria: Hi, good morning. Just a bigger picture strategic question for Debbie, I guess. Obviously, you rightfully so bullish on the acquisition opportunity in seniors housing and you have a successful third-party management business. Is there an opportunity to kind of accelerate your investments in seniors housing using some of the capital partners you have or maybe new ones to do stuff in joint venture or fund format?\nDebra Cafaro: Hi, Juan. We do have a successful Ventas investment management business, including an open-end fund. It is a great advantage to have that capital available to us. At the present time, because of the REITs kind of footprint and experience and platform in senior housing. We are focused on capturing those opportunities really at the enterprise level, but we have in selective appropriate circumstances done a few senior housing assets with our partners. So most should be to the balance sheet and maybe ones that have a little bit less growth could be appropriate for a more core-like investor base.\nJuan Sanabria: Thanks. And then just with regards to SHOP business and kind of guidance. How should we think about occupancy growth going forward? You've noticed some seasonality on the RevPOR side. Is there anything equivalent on the occupancy side or any impact from changes in the pool in the second half of the year?\nDebra Cafaro: Yes. Good question on the timing. So Bob, do you want to take that?\nRobert Probst: Sure. There's no pool impact, one, that's been very consistent since February. There is -- depending on whether you're looking year-over-year or sequentially, there clearly is seasonality in senior housing. Again, the key selling season is Q3 running into Q3, typically through September could bleed into October. Then typically, you'll have some moderation in the fourth on a sequential basis. For us, what we're seeing again is just this robust year-over-year growth that's driving the improved midpoint. But if you're modeling sequentially, you should factor that in.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Hi, good morning everyone. Just wanted to go back to [indiscernible] a little bit. So the guidance seems like you're calling for a 25% to 30% rent reduction I do recall commentary that this business itself is improving fundamentally. So just curious why give up that upside like just having kind of an immediate kind of rent reduction?\nDebra Cafaro: Good morning, Tayo. Thanks for the question. Look, we want to give our shareholders some kind of broad directional guidance of our expectations at this time on what the rent levels will be. Obviously, we have a lot of tools in our toolbox that we've used in connection with leases over the years, and that would be equally true here. And remember, our goals, we do want to strengthen the master lease. We do want to capture as much NOI as we can, and we want Kindred to be successful. So we put all those in the basket as we think about structuring and making decisions about a lease extension.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Okay. That's helpful. And just the second question some of your managerial contracts in Atria Sunrise that are a little bit more tight in the top line. Curious, that when those managerial contracts themselves expire if they do or the idea of being able to move these contracts more towards contract time towards the bottom line such that Ventas and the third-party managers a little bit better in line in terms of bottom line performing?\nDebra Cafaro: Yes. Operational alignment is one of Justin's favorite topic. So...\nJustin Hutchens: It is, for sure. So Sunrise, we've already -- that contract, we actually updated A few years ago, it's well aligned. It's really driven through revenue and NOI performance. The fees are driven through realignment. I'm very happy with that agreement. We're -- we have windows in the upcoming few years in the legacy Atria portfolio, that will also be a good opportunity just to improve upon the alignment and that relationship, everything else in the SHOP portfolio is on our newer agreements. But one thing I want to say is that Atria given a lot of the transition they've gone through, there's not a question in my mind in terms of the level of focus they have on operations, particularly on ours. They've -- there's been a number of actions that have led to a much tighter footprint that we've taken some that they've taken and other owners. And so the level of focus that we've seen with them under the new leadership and the contributions they've made to the occupancy across the board that I mentioned and especially in independent living, where we've had 340 basis points of occupancy growth year-over-year. We have their full attention and they have our full support. So we look forward to ongoing good performance with them.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Perfect. Thank you.\nDebra Cafaro: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc City Market. Your line is open.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Great, thanks. Just going back to the SHOP guidance, same-store NOI growth for that segment implies some deceleration in the back half of the year. And I guess, just given the operating leverage, low total portfolio occupancy, and just relative to the backdrop that you outlined in your prepared remarks, what are sort of the linked factors in the near term impacting you from sustaining that mid-teens growth that you've achieved year-to-date?\nJustin Hutchens: So one of the things that's happened is we're off to a really strong start. So we've actually raised guidance twice now. So and that's due to the outperformance we've had early in the year. As you get into later in the year, Bob mentioned some of the seasonality, you can see in occupancy, you can also see some seasonality in expenses. We've assumed kind of regular inflation in the expenses. That's what's driving that 2.5% OpEx for growth metric that you see as part of the guidance page. And there's utilities and other seasonal impacts you can have in the second half. So you might accuse us to be a little conservative on the expense side, but we're just anticipating kind of normal seasonality.\nRobert Probst: I like your words mid-teens because the first half, we grew 15%. Our guidance for the year is 14.5%. So pretty darn consistent, I would say.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Okay, that\u2019s fair. How does Canada affect kind of the same-store NOI growth level going forward, given you are more highly occupied in that region? And what sort are your thoughts on the remaining upside for the region? Thank you.\nJustin Hutchens: Well, so we have a page, and if you have our earnings deck, Page 10 will articulate the performance of Canada. Canada grew 12% in the second quarter year-over-year. That was driven by really good rate growth, which was also mix driven. We had a higher price point product that outperformed Canada and drove the RevPOR up and their occupancy is still growing 170 basis points. Canada is 96% occupied now, and they keep growing occupancy. And so it's just a good performer, and we wouldn't expect it to continue to be a double-digit performer going forward, but it's been a good year in Canada.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Thanks for the time.\nDebra Cafaro: Thank you Austin.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nVikram Malhotra: Good morning. I just wondered maybe first just get some more color. You mentioned the comps or maybe even conservatism on four on the expense side. But you're sort of going from the ones to like the 2.5% guidance you gave. So I'm wondering is there any specific region or maybe it's just labor cost you're anticipating that would drive that up so much in two quarters?\nDebra Cafaro: Good. Bob, can you take that?\nRobert Probst: I think the key thing to note, as you'll recall, is the contract labor or agency labor profile last year. Which we as we were staffing up really came down first half to second half. And so on a year-over-year basis in the first half on the OpEx port, that's a good guy. You don't have that same dynamic in the back half of the year. So that's a really important part of the answer to your question.\nVikram Malhotra: Okay, that's helpful. And then you mentioned the mix shift on RevPOR and obviously with Sunrise. But I'm wondering if you just segment the SHOP portfolio. I'm sure there are markets or segments where you have like 90% occupancy. What's the distribution in terms of where you're seeing the most pricing par versus maybe what's lagging?\nJustin Hutchens: Yes. So we've been -- we've seen really broad-based growth. We've had better occupancy growth in our products that are closer to like a mid or a mid-high price point. We've seen better growth in the West, which is a relatively lower price point than the East. There's been better growth in lower acuity assisted living and independent living than the higher acuity product, but very strong occupancy growth. And so there's the mix is really just a combination of reasons why our lower price point product is outperforming. It also happens to be the recipient of a lot of the NOI-generating CapEx. And so within that group, we had over 500 basis points of occupancy growth but also had 6.5% of RevPOR growth. So within it, it's a strong contributor to both occupancy and to rate. But as it's a big part of the growth story and the growth profile, it brings the weighted average down from a RevPOR standpoint. So I think the reality is, like I said earlier, the volume is so high mix becomes a bigger factor in the metrics. But key takeaway is 8% revenue growth and 14.5% NOI and really strong occupancy performance.\nVikram Malhotra: Makes sense. And then just a last one. Could you just give us an update on the Brookdale leases that come due next year, just where -- what the metrics are in terms of coverage or just latest thoughts on what you might do there?\nJustin Hutchens: So it's Justin again. So Brookdale, I'll start here. So it's a well-covered lease. You'll probably notice that if you look at the supplemental that they've moved up a row. And so good coverage, good performer. They have -- we've had growth in our portfolio. They're in markets that we project around 1,000 basis points of net absorption upside. So really strong growth profile opportunities ahead of it. So really, if this portfolio were to make its way to our SHOP portfolio to be very happy. So we're really concerned about an extension. Brookdale has the opportunity to extend the lease. And if they do that, they have to decide by the end of November, all or nothing extension. If they do extend, then the lease will escalate in 2026, at least 3% and as high as 10% based on a fair market value review. Considering the performance and the coverage that I've mentioned and the upside opportunity in the market, we would expect that it could be on the better end of that, but we'll have to wait and see. But we love the optionality we have here and kind of worst case, Brookdale extends and you have a well-covered lease.\nVikram Malhotra: Thank you.\nDebra Cafaro: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Anderson with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.\nRichard Anderson: Hey thanks good morning and nice quarter. So question I asked on the Well tower call, and I got fully shut down. I'm going to ask you the same question, see what you say. So as occupancy gets higher, so does it become increasingly more difficult to grow it from there? So my theory is at 75% occupancy, you have the full range of unit options to offer people. But if you're at 85%, you have fewer options. So it's just harder to fill that Swiss cheese effect, if I can use that. Do you agree with that, that when you get to sort of post-pandemic occupancy and then start targeting that 92% peak in your history that process will maybe logically take longer to achieve?\nDebra Cafaro: I'm going to let Mr. Zero Lost Revenue days take that.\nJustin Hutchens : So Debbie is referring to my passion project, which is encouraging our operators and communities to get to where they're achieving zero lost revenue days we benchmark this, and we report on it every month and...\nDebra Cafaro: Commonly known as 100% occupancy.\nJustin Hutchens : Exactly. But truly 100%. So the one thing I love about senior housing business is that you can truly be 100%. We do have communities already in our portfolio that literally are turning units. They may have 4 or 5 out. They're turning all of them with new move-ins within the same month and having zero frictional vacancy. So my point of view, Rich, is it's actually easier, the higher occupied you get. And the reason for that is because you've established yourself as a strong market participant or market leader. Usually, there's an opportunity to fill the last unit or two with just with extra effort. I'm not going to say it's easy, but it's much easier to fill a year or two than to look upward at 20 units. So I like the opportunity in our communities that are over 90% to push all the way to 100 or as close as they can get to it. And the other thing that comes with that, obviously, is scarcity value and price goes with it. So that's the big opportunity. So I don't think I agree with you.\nRichard Anderson: Okay. Foiled again. My next question, when you talk about the redevelopment program in SHOP, and you mentioned some of the occupancy lift that you got from that, is that factoring in at all to the same-store optics that -- or results that you got in the quarter? In other words, 380 basis point improvement in the U.S. Is there any amount of that is benefiting from the CapEx program where you get the revenue lift and the occupancy lift, but you're still capitalizing the costs?\nDebra Cafaro: Yes. Good question. I mean one thing that's good about the way we're showing our SHOP results is that the vast majority of our communities are in our same-store results. And so those -- most of those projects in during the redevelopment process. And we take the downs to the extent there are any that time and then remain in now, and that's true for almost all ranges.\nJustin Hutchens : Yes, that's right. So when we're reporting on 133 seasoned projects, those are all same-store and they never came out. They were in during the construction period. And so there's a little disruption we've absorbed already and now we're experiencing the benefits of the upside opportunity from the investment. There's some projects that are a bigger readout that do come out. Those are more intrusive and there's a lot of criteria around defining which projects qualify for that to be in the non-same store pool. But the fees that we're reporting on are definitely in the pool.\nRichard Anderson: So when you think about the redevs activity. Is it a wash then, the stuff that's sort of underwhelming occupancy and the stuff that's boosting occupancy when you net those two, the $380 million in the U.S. would probably still be pretty close to $380 million?\nRobert Probst: I think it's a net gainer, Rich. There is some disruption. But honestly, you can sell the redev in many cases to the residents. You can show the plans, they can see the opportunity. And so you see in advance of the completion, you see occupancy and price lift. So there is some disruption net-net, definitely a positive.\nDebra Cafaro: And you're trying to get them done so that you're meeting this intensive demand that's right that's present at this time. So\u2026\nRichard Anderson: Okay, got it. Thanks very much.\nDebra Cafaro: Thank you Rich.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Stroyeck with Green Street. Your line is open.\nMichael Stroyeck: Thanks for fitting me in. Good morning. Maybe one on the transaction market. What's the typical cap rate spread that you're seeing on assisted living deals versus independent living?\nJustin Hutchens : So we haven't -- really, everything we've bought has had a combination of services. And so I really wouldn't be able to comment on a freestanding kind of living cap rate, for instance, versus a freestanding assisted living and most of what we're buying has both impendent living and assisted living on the campus, along with memory care services. I know historically, there's been a spread because of the longer length of state independent living a little less there's been like a 50 basis point spread in the past. I don't know that I can really confirm that, that exists today just based on the activity that we have in our pipeline.\nMichael Stroyeck: Okay. That makes sense. And then it looks like a couple of research assets have entered the redev pool in this quarter. What sort of return are you targeting on those projects? And should we expect additional research assets to enter redevelopment in the coming quarters?\nPeter Bulgarelli: Thanks for the question. This is Pete. Happy to answer. We are we don't expect additional assets to go into redevelopment in the next -- in the foreseeable future. The return aspects will be substantial. These buildings are in really good markets. They're well located in these markets. They're quality buildings, and they just need a bit of upgrade to compete in the marketplace itself. And one good example is 3711 Market in Philadelphia. It's a great market for us, performing really well. It's a healthy life sciences market. The building has about 50% office tenants. Some of those office tenants have left, we have an opportunity to turn it into research space, which will dramatically increase the rental rate that we can achieve in that building. And we're looking forward to really strong rate growth and rent growth in the next year or so from that asset.\nMichael Stroyeck: Got it Thank you.\nDebra Cafaro: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Kilichowski with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nJohn Kilichowski: Hi, thank you. So just to circle back to OpExPOR [ph]. I understand you get sort of the tougher comps on agency labor. But it sounds like we're hearing reports from other operators that labor expenses have started to soften recently, which matches the job reports we saw this morning. I'm just curious if you're keeping your guide here is expressing a little bit of conservatism that there could be greater availability of labor in the second half of the year if unemployment ticks up?\nJustin Hutchens : Yes. I mean they're there could be some conservatism in that metric. We have to those around everything. We were very explicit around two metrics, one being occupancy, that will be in NOI. The others RevPOR has some mix considerations and then OpExPOR, and they both have year-over-year comp considerations and the OpExPOR we have some comp considerations as well as just an expectation of normal inflation. So we'll just have to see how it plays out. But the labor market has been very favorable.\nDebra Cafaro: Yes, you're right. You're right. Today's report may influence that, and we'll continue to monitor and make sure we have a healthy spread between the 2 key metrics to drive revenue and NOI growth.\nJohn Kilichowski: So. I mean, would you be able to comment at all what you've seen quarter-to-date from labor? Is it starting to shift in your favor? Or is it same time as it was in 2Q?\nDebra Cafaro: Again, we should distinguish between year-over-year and sequential, I do think that what Bob said is important in the year-over-year comparisons. And then as we look forward, again, the labor market is pretty dynamic right now. And so -- we're assuming kind of steady as she goes. But as you point out, especially based on today's report, we may see a little improvement in that going forward, but it's too early to say.\nJohn Kilichowski: Got it. And then maybe just jumping to the dispositions in the quarter. It looks like really strong execution there, but is there any color you could give on what drove the low cap rates on those assets? Are these noncore and maybe lower quality where there's like a pro forma upside for the buyer? Or are these high-quality assets and they are just here to fund acquisitions because we're strategically rotating more in a SHOP?\nRobert Probst: Yes, I'll take that one. So just some numbers. We've sold about $230-odd million. We've got a full year guide of $300 million, so the majority is cash in the bank. It's a very low cap rate kind of in the 2% to 3% range, which is great. And that's led by senior housing. And your other question was, is this capital recycling upgrading the portfolio, exiting nonstrategic markets. Yes. And using the data analytics that we have to identify those markets that may not have that opportunity to grow like the rest of the portfolio. The buyer may see that opportunity and therein lies the transaction. And so we're pleased with that growth rate. Clearly, that's another source of capital for us while upgrading the portfolio. So we're happy with reset.\nDebra Cafaro: And then senior housing with the data analytics, we're curating the portfolio on the buy and the sell side.\nRobert Probst: Yes, same approach.\nJohn Kilichowski: Got it. Thank you.\nDebra Cafaro: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with Baird. Your line is open.\nWesley Golladay: Hey good morning everyone. I just wanted to get your thoughts on deleveraging essentially over advertising deals ahead of a strong cycle. Are you looking to create investment capacity for a much bigger pipeline? Are there any macro concerns? Are you just waiting for the cost and desktop? Just get your thoughts on that.\nDebra Cafaro: Yes. I mean our whole strategy is designed to increase our enterprise growth rate, expand our shop footprint and because of the way we are funding the assets to continue to improve our balance sheet. And you saw that year-to-date.\nRobert Probst: Yes. The playbook has been, first and foremost, the organic growth in SHOP is going to be the key driver of leverage improvement. And if you just look at numbers on that, 130 million or so organic growth this year. That by itself is 40 basis points of leverage improvement net debt to EBITDA. And then in addition to that, equity-funded investments is the gravy on top. And indeed, we've been able to do both this year, were 50 basis points lower so far from the start of this year and now -- and that same playbook is going to continue to run out. And it provides financial flexibility and opportunity to go on offense, and that's why we like 5 times to 6 times range, and we'll continue to execute on the strategy to get there.\nWesley Golladay: Okay. And then turning to the senior housing development. Is there any point where you want to start on the developments, deliver countercyclical in a few years from now? Any markets that may be the first to get supply and then maybe look into Canada, obviously a little bit more stabilized market, would they start to get supply at any point?\nDebra Cafaro: I mean, right now, our overarching capital allocation priority is to invest in cash flowing senior housing assets that meet the characteristics that Justin outlined and provide near-term accretion, even when equity funded and immediate near-term growth that enhances our enterprise value. That could change over time. But right now, we're very, very focused on that.\nWesley Golladay: Okay, thanks for the time.\nDebra Cafaro: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nikita Bely [ph] with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey good morning guys. Can you talk a little bit about your development programs, specifically in your outpatient medical and research, the progress that you guys made and so far conversations you're having on the remaining leasing still have to do on that?\nDebra Cafaro: Yes. We can talk about this, and there are quite a few that are well underway. And Pete, can you take that?\nPeter Bulgarelli: Sure. Sure. There's -- so for outpatient medical, we have really a fairly minor list of assets that are under redevelopment. We have sub redevelopments, which are development okay? So let me just finish what I was going to say. So redevelopment, many times we're looking to do is upgrade the buildings create spec suites and so forth, and those have been very good returns for us. On medical office buildings, we have an outpatient medical, we have one asset with Sutter that is 100% leased. It just came online or complete, and we're really excited about that asset. On the -- we talked a bit about development in life sciences redevelopment, but on the development assets themselves, you have to think about it in really two different tranches. We have a set of assets that are online, they're operating and they're largely full. Examples would be Pit 1 and Pit 2, where they're 100% occupied. You've got our asset in Phoenix with Arizona State, which has attracted National Institute of Health as a major tenant. It's under construction, the 10 improvements. In Philadelphia, you've got one new city, which is 93% and Drexel, which is 100%. We have another tranche of assets that are under development, still under construction. They we're optimistic about, one associated with UC Davis, two that are with Atrium Health in Charlotte and 4 MLK and they're under construction. They have good pre-leasing, 60%, 70% pre-leasing, and we're optimistic about those assets going forward.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nNicholas Yulico: Thanks. Just a couple of quick ones. On July, I want to see if we can get the SHOP same-store occupancy to get a feel how it's improved sequentially.\nJustin Hutchens: What I can tell you is that I mentioned in the prepared remarks that the key selling season is off to a strong start, including July. And that's what we have for now.\nNicholas Yulico: I mean, any reason not to give it, I mean, multifamily self-storage gives it, why not you're Senior Housing?\nDebra Cafaro: Well, they operate their own portfolios for what. But I think what Justin said is a good is a good data point for now.\nNicholas Yulico: Okay. And then in terms of the investments, can you just give us a feel -- I know you quote the initial yield, but it's, I think, a year 1 yield. How much NOI growth is embedded in that assumption to get to a stabilized yield, just so we're modeling this correctly.\nDebra Cafaro: Yes. Say that again, Nick. I think...\nNicholas Yulico: I'm just trying to understand like in terms of the initial yield that you're quoting for senior housing, how much NOI growth is embedded in the first year to get to that initial yield? Just want to make sure we're modeling this correctly. Thanks.\nDebra Cafaro: Got it. I mean it gets into our underwriting, obviously. We look at the last year's, we look at pre-COVID numbers, we look at trailing 3 and where it is kind of at the time of acquisition, and we model what our expectations are going forward. Given the fundamentals you would expect that there would be some growth from, say, the trailing 3 or the in place in that number, typically a modest amount. And in some cases, if occupancy is 100%, we may actually diminish it a little bit. So it really depends on the asset. And most of them will have, as we talked about, given the template for the investments 7% to 8% yields going in with significant near-term growth, you'll see some elevation from the at closing NOI number. But it's modest, but it's ramping.\nNicholas Yulico: Okay, thanks.\nDebra Cafaro: Yes.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will turn it back over to Debra A. Cafaro, Chairman and CEO, for closing remarks.\nDebra Cafaro: Thank you so much. And I want to thank all the participants on today's call for your interest and support Ventas. We hope you have a great rest of the summer, and we look forward to seeing you in person soon. Thank you.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Robert Probst",
            "content": "Thank you, Justin. I'll start with our second quarter performance, provide an update on our leverage and liquidity and conclude with our updated and improved guidance. I'm pleased to report that Ventas delivered strong second quarter results led by SHOP and with contributions across the property portfolio. In our Outpatient Medical & Research Segment, or OMAR, we generated over 3% same store cash NOI growth in the quarter with strong margins and stable occupancy. In our outpatient medical portfolio, Pete and team continued to build leasing momentum, executing over 800,000 square feet of new and renewal deals in the quarter, which translated to 30 basis points of sequential occupancy gains. Further, the equalized loan portfolio outpatient medical assets have made significant progress, increasing occupancy 450 basis points year-over-year to 81.5% in the second quarter, leveraging the Lillibridge operating platform and playbook to drive growth. Meanwhile, our university-based research portfolio increased same-store cash NOI by 5.5% in the second quarter, with 160 basis points of occupancy growth across the same store portfolio. Our new leasing pipeline is attractive at 1.3 million square feet, with over half already executed. For the enterprise in the second quarter, we reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.05 per share. Our Q2 normalized FFO per share of $0.80 represents a 7% increase year-over-year. Underpaying this result was year-over-year shop same store growth of 15%, and total company's same store growth of nearly 8%. We're seeing the benefit of the execution of our strategy with a 50 basis point improvement in our net debt EBITDA metrics so far this year. Organic shop growth and equity-funded new investments in senior housing are driving the improvement. The multi-year growth expected in senior housing and the robust investment pipeline are expected to continue to improve our leverage ratio going forward. So far this year, we've closed down 350 million of new investments and have raised 500 million in equity. We have included in our updating guidance another 400 million in equity-funded investments focused on senior housing that are expected to close this year. Year-to-date, we completed 234 million in asset sales. And our liquidity at the end of the second quarter was strong at $3.3 billion, including over $550 million of cash on hand and with limited remaining debt maturities in 2024. I'll close with our updated improved 2024 guidance. We've raised our outlook for net income attributable to common stockholders to now range from $0.07 to $0.13 per diluted share. We increased the midpoint of our full-year normalized FFO guidance to $3.15 per share from the previous midpoint at $3.14 per share. Our improved full-year midpoint is driven by $0.025 combined improvement from shop organic and inorganic growth, partially offset by a $0.015 non-cash impact from potential kindred lease resolution in 2024. We've also raised our same-store cash NOI year-over-year growth midpoint expectations for each of our segments. Total company's same-store cash NOI is now expected to grow 7.25% year-over-year, an increase of 25 basis points from our prior guidance, and 100 basis points higher than our original guidance back in February. For additional 2024 guidance assumptions, please see our Q2 supplemental and earnings presentation deck posted to our website. To close, we are pleased with the results for the first half of the year and we're committed to continued value creation in the second half and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator. And you're right to say that, that started this year in February, including deals that we hadn't closed was unusual for us. But we feel very confident given the pipeline and the team that we can execute on those deals. We started the year at 350 in our guidance done, closed. We have now 400 million in the forecast to close this year. So doing what we said, the contribution from those is in the two and a half cents increased guidance on FFO from shop organic and inorganic, I would say the split of those is roughly equal. If not tipped a bit towards the new investment. So they are created from the get go equity funded and very consistent with the strategy we laid out. Yes, Jim, it is a high quality situation for sure. The conversion price is just below 55. Those get accounted for in the fully diluted shares. It's a really modest impact at this stage and effectively embedded in the guidance, but I put this in the high quality problem camp. But de minimis as we think about the numbers this year as it stands now. Yes. Sure. There's no pool impact, one, that's been very consistent since February. There is -- depending on whether you're looking year-over-year or sequentially, there clearly is seasonality in senior housing. Again, the key selling season is Q3 running into Q3, typically through September could bleed into October. Then typically, you'll have some moderation in the fourth on a sequential basis. For us, what we're seeing again is just this robust year-over-year growth that's driving the improved midpoint. But if you're modeling sequentially, you should factor that in. I like your words mid-teens because the first half, we grew 15%. Our guidance for the year is 14.5%. So pretty darn consistent, I would say. I think the key thing to note, as you'll recall, is the contract labor or agency labor profile last year. Which we as we were staffing up really came down first half to second half. And so on a year-over-year basis in the first half on the OpEx port, that's a good guy. You don't have that same dynamic in the back half of the year. So that's a really important part of the answer to your question. I think it's a net gainer, Rich. There is some disruption. But honestly, you can sell the redev in many cases to the residents. You can show the plans, they can see the opportunity. And so you see in advance of the completion, you see occupancy and price lift. So there is some disruption net-net, definitely a positive. Yes, I'll take that one. So just some numbers. We've sold about $230-odd million. We've got a full year guide of $300 million, so the majority is cash in the bank. It's a very low cap rate kind of in the 2% to 3% range, which is great. And that's led by senior housing. And your other question was, is this capital recycling upgrading the portfolio, exiting nonstrategic markets. Yes. And using the data analytics that we have to identify those markets that may not have that opportunity to grow like the rest of the portfolio. The buyer may see that opportunity and therein lies the transaction. And so we're pleased with that growth rate. Clearly, that's another source of capital for us while upgrading the portfolio. So we're happy with reset. Yes, same approach. Yes. The playbook has been, first and foremost, the organic growth in SHOP is going to be the key driver of leverage improvement. And if you just look at numbers on that, 130 million or so organic growth this year. That by itself is 40 basis points of leverage improvement net debt to EBITDA. And then in addition to that, equity-funded investments is the gravy on top. And indeed, we've been able to do both this year, were 50 basis points lower so far from the start of this year and now -- and that same playbook is going to continue to run out. And it provides financial flexibility and opportunity to go on offense, and that's why we like 5 times to 6 times range, and we'll continue to execute on the strategy to get there."

            "name": "Justin Hutchens",
            "content": "Thank you, Debbie. I'm happy to report on another good quarter for our shop portfolio and another guidance raise led by occupancy. As Debbie mentioned, the macro backdrop is very supportive from a supply-demand standpoint. I'm pleased that part one of our strategy, which is to deliver profitable growth in senior housing, is off to a good start, as we are seeing very strong execution from our operators with support from our Ventas OI platform initiatives. The key selling season is delivering strong results so far in May, June, and July, as leading indicators and occupancy are all performing really well, building on our best-in-class occupancy performance. I'd also like to highlight that our net move-in volume year-to-date was 13 times higher than last year, contributing to our outperformance, driven by our Atria and Holiday portfolios, as well as Santerre Priority Life and Discovery Senior Living. The second quarter same-store shop revenue grew 8%, and occupancy grew by 320 basis points, led by the U.S., with 380 basis points year-over-year, and 90 basis points sequentially, leading to an absolute occupancy of 85.6%, led by Canada at almost 96%, and an overall operating margin of 27.4%, all of which are industry-leading metrics. I'd like to spotlight Le Groupe Maurice, who operates full-service active adult communities for us in Quebec, and represents nearly 60% of our NOI in Canada. They have consistently delivered stellar performance. The 380 basis points of occupancy gains in the U.S. was driven by broad-based performance across our portfolio, with growth of 400 basis points in assisted living, and 340 basis points in independent living year-over-year. Spot occupancy was particularly strong in our communities compared to the market. The U.S. spot occupancy grew 450 basis points year-over-year in the top 99 markets, which is 200 basis points faster than the NIC average. Furthermore, the U.S. spot occupancy grew 150 basis points sequentially in the top 99 markets, almost three times faster than the NIC average. 88% of our total shop NOI is included in our same store portfolio. We were pleased to achieve 8% revenue growth in our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit NOI growth at 15.2% year-over-year. The spread between RevPOR growth at 4% and OpExPOR growth at 1% remains very healthy at about 300 basis points. The key driver of value creation will continue to be occupancy growth due to the high operating leverage in the business. Margin expansion will increase as occupancy ticks higher, and particularly in communities that are over 90% occupied. I'd like to thank our operating partners. There are too many to mention, as there are so many strong contributors taking great care of people and delivering excellent operating results. Given the outperformance in the first half, we are happy to raise our full-year guidance expectations again on our same-store-shop portfolio by 50 basis points to 14.5% at the midpoint. Our average occupancy growth expectations have increased to about 280 basis points, up from 270. The remaining key assumptions that drive the midpoint of our range remain in line with what we previously communicated. Now I'll give an update on our Ventas OI platform and initiatives. We continue to advance our Ventas Operational Insights platform, which was formally launched in 2022. This platform is designed to drive outperformance in this multi-year occupancy growth opportunity and is the cornerstone of part one of our strategy, which is to drive organic growth in our shop portfolio. This platform enables us to combine our best-in-class analytics with our operating expertise to drive thoughtful conversations and actionable insights with the operators to quickly make informed decisions on critical areas of the business. The increased availability of real-time data through systems and reporting automation have allowed our operating partners to benefit from key insights across a wide variety of initiatives. Our platform has enabled deep analysis into sales and price optimization, market positioning, targeted NOI generating CapEx, and digital marketing, to name a few. I'll cover some proof points on how we have driven occupancy and NOI with Ventas OI. I'll start with NOI generating CapEx. In assessing which communities receive refreshed capital investments, we analyze the community's position in the market and prioritize those where investment would most improve occupancy and rate relative to the competitive set. We further analyze overall market characteristics, including forward-looking net demand, home values, net worth, affordability, among other data points to support our position that capital would drive robust NOI growth and generate outsized returns. We have completed 215 projects since the start of this program in late 2022, of which 133 are at least six months post-project completion. This group has grown occupancy by over 530 basis points and outperformed their respective markets by 350 basis points of growth. RevPOR has also grown 6.5%, demonstrating the effectiveness of this re-dev program. Next, price volume optimization. We continue to collaborate with operators on a monthly basis, monitoring street rate pricing on nearly all units in our U.S. shop portfolio relative to our proprietary market data to ensure pricing is set to optimize move-ins. Our automated monthly rent roll consolidation process enables us to efficiently analyze over 8 million rows of historical street rate pricing data to better understand market positioning and proactively identify price opportunities. We've executed this process and successfully optimized price and volume, resulting in improved sales momentum through the second quarter across several operators, including Sunrise, Atria Holiday, and Priority Life Care. These operators have improved their move-in performance by 25%. Next, digital marketing. We've also executed digital marketing initiatives focused on driving higher move-ins. Improving the attractiveness of the website to Google search, for instance, and user experience improvements have allowed potential residents and families to easily gather information to learn about the living, service, and care options available in our communities. Our focus on digital marketing has produced double-digit improvement in move-ins derived from website referrals. Summarizing VentasOI, the tools we have created for our platform have enabled us to perform and continue delivering growth. As part of our OI engagements, over 1,000 of which we've completed since I started, we are proactively sharing insights, data, and benchmarks with our operating partners to align on performance expectations. Moving on to investments, where we are executing on part two of our strategy, which is to capture value-creating external growth focused on senior housing. We are in a unique period of time. The best I've seen in my career, where we have a combination of relatively high yield and high growth investment opportunities in senior housing leading to very attractive, unlevered IRRs. The sector is supported by tremendous demographic tailwinds. In the second quarter, we continued our strong run of executing on attractive external growth opportunities. We closed approximately $300 million of value-creating investments in 12 senior housing communities, 10 of which are with existing Ventas operator relationships, bringing the year-to-date volume up to $350 million at a blended going-in yield greater than 8%. In addition to the accretive going-in yield, these investments are positioned squarely within our right market, right asset, right operator framework, and now is the right time to invest in senior housing as this favorable positioning amplified by the unprecedented supply demand backdrop will drive continued NOI growth resulting in unlevered IRRs in the low to mid-teens. We also continue to invest in extremely attractive basis below replacement costs with an average per unit purchase price of $250,000. Looking forward, our pipeline remains robust, filled with actionable opportunities with both existing and new operator relationships with a profile similar to the deals already closed in 2024. Specifically, we have lined a site to an incremental $400 million of senior housing investments bringing the total 2024 senior housing investment volume to $750 million. Additionally, we are deeply engaged in executing this high priority of expanding our shop portfolio. We continue to underwrite a large and growing pipeline of attractive, near term opportunities and are confident in our ability to continue creating value via additional external growth going forward. Now I'll hand over to Bob. Sure. So we are seeing a number of different opportunities. Where we're leaning in is when the pipeline meets our investment criteria and we're very focused on the market asset operator framework, looking for markets that have strong supply demand fundamentals and support strong net absorption and affordability. We do like, apply in the Ventas OI platform. We're also narrating the strong track record in the communities and looking for, generally well invested communities as well. We're primarily expanding with the existing operator relationships, but we have had the opportunity to add some new relationships as well. And we're looking for campuses that include independent living, sister living and memory care, rental campuses. And we're seeing those in the pipeline. The pipeline's been growing throughout the year and we were actively engaged in it. And we like our opportunity to continue to grow. Well, so first of all, on the guidance, it's occupancy led. We've obviously raised our occupancy expectation and we raised our NOI expectation as well. We did not change the other metrics. RevPOR, in this environment where you have a lot of occupancy growth, mix can be more impactful just due to the sheer volume of occupancy growth that we've had. In the second quarter, there's a couple of things impacting RevPOR. We had mix where we had very strong occupancy growth in our mid-price point product. So it just has an impact on the weighted average. And then there's a year-over-year comp, that's affecting it because of the very strong rent increases we had in certain operators in the first half of last year. As we move forward, we would expect that there's better comps in the second half of the year. We have a large part of the key selling season still ahead of us, a lot of potential volume as part of that. So, mix will remain in focus. And so we thought leaving the TILDA 5 was appropriate, given those facts, and look forward to growing NOI. Yes, absolutely. So, starting, I'll just kind of highlight, for example, the some metrics around the deal activity that's already closed. In those deals, we underwrote net absorption upside over a three year period in the markets of around a thousand basis points. Very strong population growth near zero new supply deliveries expected in the next few years within the markets. Very attractive investment basis at 250,000 per unit, well below replacement costs. They're about 10 years old on average. There are 124 units offering independent living, assisted living and memory care. Good margins going in, but a lot of upside, going in margin around 28%. A lot of upside as we grow occupancy and rate over time and aligned management contracts. They're rewarding growth both for revenue and NOI outcomes, to the manager. And then, good operators, most of which are existing relationships, but we're also, working with some new operators and the going in yields have been really, above eight thus far. We were targeting seven to eight overall, the unlevered IRRs, low-to-mid teens. So that's the characteristics we've seen and continue to see in this next tranche, very similar characteristics in this 400 million that we have line of sight on. Well, we're certainly interested in ramping up the activity. We haven't put any targets out there in terms of volume, but more is the priority for sure given the fundamentals and the returns that we're seeing in the investments. The types of sellers, there's some certainly sellers that have debt maturities and they're having to make a decision. Even though fundamentals are good, do they put more capital in or do they, do they, sell the asset and move on to other priorities? We've been able to take advantage of some of those opportunities. There's other sellers that just quite frankly are dealing with fund maturities and they're just active sellers and then there's others that are selling senior housing a little bit reluctantly because they have other asset classes that they're dealing with and debt and other aspects of their fund. And so, we've had a wide variety and that's what's been consistent though is, good fundamentals. We're targeting markets that have really, great upside and then the returns have been excellent. It is, for sure. So Sunrise, we've already -- that contract, we actually updated A few years ago, it's well aligned. It's really driven through revenue and NOI performance. The fees are driven through realignment. I'm very happy with that agreement. We're -- we have windows in the upcoming few years in the legacy Atria portfolio, that will also be a good opportunity just to improve upon the alignment and that relationship, everything else in the SHOP portfolio is on our newer agreements. But one thing I want to say is that Atria given a lot of the transition they've gone through, there's not a question in my mind in terms of the level of focus they have on operations, particularly on ours. They've -- there's been a number of actions that have led to a much tighter footprint that we've taken some that they've taken and other owners. And so the level of focus that we've seen with them under the new leadership and the contributions they've made to the occupancy across the board that I mentioned and especially in independent living, where we've had 340 basis points of occupancy growth year-over-year. We have their full attention and they have our full support. So we look forward to ongoing good performance with them. So one of the things that's happened is we're off to a really strong start. So we've actually raised guidance twice now. So and that's due to the outperformance we've had early in the year. As you get into later in the year, Bob mentioned some of the seasonality, you can see in occupancy, you can also see some seasonality in expenses. We've assumed kind of regular inflation in the expenses. That's what's driving that 2.5% OpEx for growth metric that you see as part of the guidance page. And there's utilities and other seasonal impacts you can have in the second half. So you might accuse us to be a little conservative on the expense side, but we're just anticipating kind of normal seasonality. Well, so we have a page, and if you have our earnings deck, Page 10 will articulate the performance of Canada. Canada grew 12% in the second quarter year-over-year. That was driven by really good rate growth, which was also mix driven. We had a higher price point product that outperformed Canada and drove the RevPOR up and their occupancy is still growing 170 basis points. Canada is 96% occupied now, and they keep growing occupancy. And so it's just a good performer, and we wouldn't expect it to continue to be a double-digit performer going forward, but it's been a good year in Canada. Yes. So we've been -- we've seen really broad-based growth. We've had better occupancy growth in our products that are closer to like a mid or a mid-high price point. We've seen better growth in the West, which is a relatively lower price point than the East. There's been better growth in lower acuity assisted living and independent living than the higher acuity product, but very strong occupancy growth. And so there's the mix is really just a combination of reasons why our lower price point product is outperforming. It also happens to be the recipient of a lot of the NOI-generating CapEx. And so within that group, we had over 500 basis points of occupancy growth but also had 6.5% of RevPOR growth. So within it, it's a strong contributor to both occupancy and to rate. But as it's a big part of the growth story and the growth profile, it brings the weighted average down from a RevPOR standpoint. So I think the reality is, like I said earlier, the volume is so high mix becomes a bigger factor in the metrics. But key takeaway is 8% revenue growth and 14.5% NOI and really strong occupancy performance. So it's Justin again. So Brookdale, I'll start here. So it's a well-covered lease. You'll probably notice that if you look at the supplemental that they've moved up a row. And so good coverage, good performer. They have -- we've had growth in our portfolio. They're in markets that we project around 1,000 basis points of net absorption upside. So really strong growth profile opportunities ahead of it. So really, if this portfolio were to make its way to our SHOP portfolio to be very happy. So we're really concerned about an extension. Brookdale has the opportunity to extend the lease. And if they do that, they have to decide by the end of November, all or nothing extension. If they do extend, then the lease will escalate in 2026, at least 3% and as high as 10% based on a fair market value review. Considering the performance and the coverage that I've mentioned and the upside opportunity in the market, we would expect that it could be on the better end of that, but we'll have to wait and see. But we love the optionality we have here and kind of worst case, Brookdale extends and you have a well-covered lease. So Debbie is referring to my passion project, which is encouraging our operators and communities to get to where they're achieving zero lost revenue days we benchmark this, and we report on it every month and... Exactly. But truly 100%. So the one thing I love about senior housing business is that you can truly be 100%. We do have communities already in our portfolio that literally are turning units. They may have 4 or 5 out. They're turning all of them with new move-ins within the same month and having zero frictional vacancy. So my point of view, Rich, is it's actually easier, the higher occupied you get. And the reason for that is because you've established yourself as a strong market participant or market leader. Usually, there's an opportunity to fill the last unit or two with just with extra effort. I'm not going to say it's easy, but it's much easier to fill a year or two than to look upward at 20 units. So I like the opportunity in our communities that are over 90% to push all the way to 100 or as close as they can get to it. And the other thing that comes with that, obviously, is scarcity value and price goes with it. So that's the big opportunity. So I don't think I agree with you. Yes, that's right. So when we're reporting on 133 seasoned projects, those are all same-store and they never came out. They were in during the construction period. And so there's a little disruption we've absorbed already and now we're experiencing the benefits of the upside opportunity from the investment. There's some projects that are a bigger readout that do come out. Those are more intrusive and there's a lot of criteria around defining which projects qualify for that to be in the non-same store pool. But the fees that we're reporting on are definitely in the pool. So we haven't -- really, everything we've bought has had a combination of services. And so I really wouldn't be able to comment on a freestanding kind of living cap rate, for instance, versus a freestanding assisted living and most of what we're buying has both impendent living and assisted living on the campus, along with memory care services. I know historically, there's been a spread because of the longer length of state independent living a little less there's been like a 50 basis point spread in the past. I don't know that I can really confirm that, that exists today just based on the activity that we have in our pipeline. Yes. I mean they're there could be some conservatism in that metric. We have to those around everything. We were very explicit around two metrics, one being occupancy, that will be in NOI. The others RevPOR has some mix considerations and then OpExPOR, and they both have year-over-year comp considerations and the OpExPOR we have some comp considerations as well as just an expectation of normal inflation. So we'll just have to see how it plays out. But the labor market has been very favorable. What I can tell you is that I mentioned in the prepared remarks that the key selling season is off to a strong start, including July. And that's what we have for now."

            "content": "Thank you BJ. On behalf of all of my colleagues, I want to welcome our shareholders and other participants to the Ventas Second Quarter 2024 earnings call. It's an exciting time for our business. We are driving performance in the early stages of an unprecendented multi-year NOI growth opportunity, fueled by powerful demographic demand and the most favorable fundamentals ever in the senior housing industry. Ventas plays an essential role in the longevity economy, serving a large and growing aging population, with over half our business and senior housing. This creates a compelling, near and long-term growth and value creation opportunity. Today I'll discuss Ventus's strong results and our latest increase in our 2024 expectations. As we generate outperformance in our senior housing operating portfolio, increase shop investment activity, optimize net operating income throughout our portfolio, and improve our financial strengths. Let's start with results. We began 2024 with momentum, which continued in the second quarter. Our enterprise delivered $0.80 of normalized FFO per share, reflecting 7% year-over-year growth. SHOP led the way with same-store cash and NOI growth of over 15%. Total company same-store cash NOI grew nearly 8%. And our balance sheet is trending positively, with 50 basis points of leverage improvement already year-to-date. We are pleased to once again raise our 2024 normalized FFO per share guidance and our total company same-store NOI expectations on the strength of this performance. Our growth expectations and value creation opportunity put us in the top cohort of companies across the REIT landscape. We're executing on our focus strategy designed to deliver growth and value to our stakeholders. As a reminder, there are three prongs to the Ventas strategy. Deliver profitable organic growth in our senior housing portfolio, capture value through investments focused on senior housing, and drive cash flow throughout our portfolio. Here are some key updates in each of those areas. In SHOP, we have now delivered eight consecutive quarters of double-digit, year-over-year same-store organic cash NOI growth. More importantly, we see a durable multi-year NOI growth opportunity ahead of us, powered by occupancy gains and revenue growth. Senior living provides invaluable benefits to residents and their families. In the quarter, occupancy grew 320 basis points year-over-year, significantly outperforming industry benchmarks, and revenue expanded 8%. Our data-driven decisions enable execution by talented operators, enabled our communities to attract more than our fair share of the strong demographic demand for senior living. Remember that our prior senior housing occupancy peak was 92%. Currently, our portfolio has trended to 84% occupancy and 27% margins. There is an additional $140 million incremental NOI opportunity simply by getting to 88% occupancy and 30% margins in the portfolio, when shop NOI would approximate $1 billion a year. From there, we expect our portfolio, operators, and communities to shoot for and potentially beyond that 92% prior occupancy peak because surging demand and suppressed senior housing construction are creating such favorable conditions, particularly in our markets. The shop resident base we serve, primarily the over 80 population, should grow by over 24% in the next five years. This population is increasing rapidly each year, from about half a million people annually now to over 800,000 individuals starting in 2027, as the leading edge of the gigantic baby boomer cohort turns 80. Yet, there were only about 1,300 units of senior housing started in the second quarter, and construction as a percent of inventory is only 1%. Both the lowest on record. Equally important, the duration of new construction continues to elongate, and we expect deliveries to be constrained for years to come. This favorable supply-demand backdrop provides powerful tailwinds and a long and unprecedented runway for growth. Justin will explain how our actions, platform, data and insights, together with our operators, deliver value to seniors and their families and position Ventas to outperform a strong market. We are also increasing our investment activity focused on senior housing as we execute on the second prong of our strategy. We're on track to close about $750 million of investments this year. Given the favorable market conditions and the strength of our pipeline for quality acquisitions, we are committed to ramping up our investment activity. Ventas is one of the country's largest owners of senior housing and we are excited about the external growth opportunities we see in the market. Rarely in my career have investment conditions been as constructive. We can invest in senior housing assets with high single-digit going-in yields and substantial near-term NOI growth prospects. Replacement costs, net absorption projections and affordability remain key criteria in our investment approach. These senior housing investments expand our shop footprint, increase our enterprise growth rate and reinforce our consistent commitment to financial strength. Third, we're also focused on driving cash flow and value creation throughout our portfolio. Our outpatient medical and research portfolio once again contributed complementary compounding growth for Ventas, powered by our competitively advantaged Lillibridge operating platform that excels in tenant satisfaction and retention. We also want to provide you with greater clarity on the 23 LTACs operated by Kindred with the least maturity of April 30, 2025. These long-term acute care hospitals represent about 5% of our NOI or $110 million annually. We've made a lot of progress since we last updated you. Currently, we are in advanced discussions with Kindred regarding a lease resolution for these properties. While a deal is not done and terms could change, we and Kindred are close to a transaction that would result in a 25% to 30% full-year rent reduction on these 23 LTACs starting May 1, 2025. About two-thirds of that amount would be reflected in calendar year 2025. We'll be happy to share more with you if and when a deal is concluded. We continue working toward a positive lease resolution that optimizes Ventas value and the NOI from these 23 properties, strengthens the master lease, and supports Kindred's future success. There are two final items that represent our approach to thoughtful investing and creation of win-win outcomes with our operators over time. First, Ardent recently completed its successful IPO, and we congratulate the management team and our partners. Ardent has done it right, focusing on patients, quality clinical care, employees, and communities. Ardent's current equity value exceeds $2.5 billion, and as Sam Zell used to say, liquidity is value. With $1.6 billion invested in assets operated by Ardent, Ventas has always been happy with Ardent's financial stability, its operational acumen, and its steady growth. The company's IPO has further enhanced this positive investment. In addition, Ventas has an ownership stake in Ardent, currently valued at about $170 million, over four times our original investment. And we believe there's additional upside in Ardent's business and its valuation. Also, in the second quarter, we monetized about 10% of our Brookdale warrants for $6 million in cash profits. We received these warrants as part of the successful lease arrangements we concluded with Brookdale in 2020. The warrants provide upside sharing in Brookdale's success and take advantage of the positive macro conditions in senior housing. Our current in-the-money value of our Brookdale warrants is about $70 million. Stepping back, we are optimistic about the future of our business, which is centered on helping a large and growing aging population live longer, healthier and happier lives. As the broader economy shows significant signs of flowing down and the labor market softens, Ventas' business with over half in senior housing is highly advantaged across the REIT space. All our asset classes benefit from inelastic, need-driven, demographically-driven demand, and most benefit from a softer employment backdrop. As a result, we have an unprecedented multi-year growth opportunity right in front of us. With favorable results this quarter and our improved outlook, our team is focused on doing everything we can to execute our strategy and continue to drive Ventas' performance and returns. With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Justin. Good morning, Nick. Good to hear from you. The answer to your questions are that we are in advanced discussions. We believe we're close on a transaction that applies to the 23 LTACs, whose maturity is April 30, 2025. And obviously we're working for multiple goals, which is to improve Ventas enterprise value, to get the most NOI from those properties that we can, and also to strengthen the master lease and to support kindred's future success. So those are all factors in how we're thinking about it. Justin. Thank you. Yes. Yes, it's all non-cash. I mean, it's a pretty simple, but it's a gap related, somewhat counterintuitive rule. Like basically, if you have a lease with a tenant and it gets extended, you basically sum up the rent over the years and you divide by the period left and that can pull forward an impact. And that's really all it is. So it's just a gap reflection of the expectations on cash rents that we gave you. Hi, Josh. Thanks for your question. We're excited about the opportunities to invest in senior housing, and Bob will answer your impact question. Josh, our capital allocation priority is focused on senior housing shop investments and Justin will touch on, there's a series of both qualitative data driven characteristics we're looking for as well as financial. Thanks. Great question. And, and one of the things we care a lot about is we and operators are offering residents and their families a really important service. And it's really valuable. Anyone who's gone through it in their families really understands that. And penetration is back at or above, that is utilization by the population is at or above where it was pre-COVID. So that's trending in the right direction. The numbers are gigantic. So that dwarfs the impact even of penetration rate. And importantly, there are a lot of studies that show not only are seniors more secure and enjoy better lives when they move to senior housing from their homes, that it's safer, it's more secure, it's more social, but also it is more expensive to stay in your home. And that's the cost of replacing all those services, even if you can do it, which in many, many cases, if you live alone in a suburban home, you can't even get those services on a regular basis, that it is more economical to move to senior housing. You don't have lawn mowing and maintenance, taxes and insurance meals, etcetera. So it really is a replacement for what you're spending anyway or even better if you're requiring in-home health services. Hi, Juan. We do have a successful Ventas investment management business, including an open-end fund. It is a great advantage to have that capital available to us. At the present time, because of the REITs kind of footprint and experience and platform in senior housing. We are focused on capturing those opportunities really at the enterprise level, but we have in selective appropriate circumstances done a few senior housing assets with our partners. So most should be to the balance sheet and maybe ones that have a little bit less growth could be appropriate for a more core-like investor base. Yes. Good question on the timing. So Bob, do you want to take that? Good morning, Tayo. Thanks for the question. Look, we want to give our shareholders some kind of broad directional guidance of our expectations at this time on what the rent levels will be. Obviously, we have a lot of tools in our toolbox that we've used in connection with leases over the years, and that would be equally true here. And remember, our goals, we do want to strengthen the master lease. We do want to capture as much NOI as we can, and we want Kindred to be successful. So we put all those in the basket as we think about structuring and making decisions about a lease extension. Yes. Operational alignment is one of Justin's favorite topic. So... Thanks. Thank you Austin. Good. Bob, can you take that? Thank you. I'm going to let Mr. Zero Lost Revenue days take that. Commonly known as 100% occupancy. Yes. Good question. I mean one thing that's good about the way we're showing our SHOP results is that the vast majority of our communities are in our same-store results. And so those -- most of those projects in during the redevelopment process. And we take the downs to the extent there are any that time and then remain in now, and that's true for almost all ranges. And you're trying to get them done so that you're meeting this intensive demand that's right that's present at this time. So... Thank you Rich. Thanks. Yes, you're right. You're right. Today's report may influence that, and we'll continue to monitor and make sure we have a healthy spread between the 2 key metrics to drive revenue and NOI growth. Again, we should distinguish between year-over-year and sequential, I do think that what Bob said is important in the year-over-year comparisons. And then as we look forward, again, the labor market is pretty dynamic right now. And so -- we're assuming kind of steady as she goes. But as you point out, especially based on today's report, we may see a little improvement in that going forward, but it's too early to say. And then senior housing with the data analytics, we're curating the portfolio on the buy and the sell side. Thank you. Yes. I mean our whole strategy is designed to increase our enterprise growth rate, expand our shop footprint and because of the way we are funding the assets to continue to improve our balance sheet. And you saw that year-to-date. I mean, right now, our overarching capital allocation priority is to invest in cash flowing senior housing assets that meet the characteristics that Justin outlined and provide near-term accretion, even when equity funded and immediate near-term growth that enhances our enterprise value. That could change over time. But right now, we're very, very focused on that. Thank you. Yes. We can talk about this, and there are quite a few that are well underway. And Pete, can you take that? Well, they operate their own portfolios for what. But I think what Justin said is a good is a good data point for now. Yes. Say that again, Nick. I think... Got it. I mean it gets into our underwriting, obviously. We look at the last year's, we look at pre-COVID numbers, we look at trailing 3 and where it is kind of at the time of acquisition, and we model what our expectations are going forward. Given the fundamentals you would expect that there would be some growth from, say, the trailing 3 or the in place in that number, typically a modest amount. And in some cases, if occupancy is 100%, we may actually diminish it a little bit. So it really depends on the asset. And most of them will have, as we talked about, given the template for the investments 7% to 8% yields going in with significant near-term growth, you'll see some elevation from the at closing NOI number. But it's modest, but it's ramping. Yes. Thank you so much. And I want to thank all the participants on today's call for your interest and support Ventas. We hope you have a great rest of the summer, and we look forward to seeing you in person soon. Thank you."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Ventas First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.\n I would now like to turn the call over to BJ Grant, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nBill Grant: Thank you, Kathleen. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Ventas First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call.\n Yesterday, we issued our first quarter earnings release, supplemental investor package and presentation materials which are available on the Ventas website at ir.ventasreit.com. As a reminder, remarks today may include forward-looking statements and other matters. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and a variety of topics may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, all of which are available on the Ventas website.\n Certain non-GAAP financial measures will also be discussed on this call, and for a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to our supplemental investor package posted on the Investor Relations website.\n And with that, I'll turn the call over to the Chairman and CEO of Ventas, Debra A. Cafaro. \nDebra Cafaro: Thank you, BJ. On behalf of all of my colleagues, I want to welcome our shareholders and other participants to the Ventas First Quarter 2024 earnings call. Today, I'll discuss our good start to the year, describe the actions we are taking to execute on our strategy and create value for our stakeholders, and share our improved outlook for 2024 as the multiyear growth opportunity in senior housing build.\n As a reminder, our 3-pronged Ventas strategy is composed of, first, deliver organic growth in our senior housing portfolio; second, capture value through investments focused on senior housing; and third, drive cash flow throughout our portfolio.\n We entered this year with momentum, and in Q1, our enterprise delivered $0.78 of normalized FFO per share and over $2 billion in annualized NOI. Our strong results came from nearly 7% same-store property NOI growth led by SHOP at over 15%. Notably, demand-driven occupancy gains in our SHOP portfolio are accelerating, fueled by favorable supply-demand fundamentals in our markets and the actions we've taken in concert with our care providers. Move-ins across the portfolio were elevated as we gained 240 basis points of occupancy in our same-store SHOP portfolio year-over-year.\n As the second largest owner of senior housing, we are benefiting from the multiyear senior housing growth opportunity that continues to gain traction from both demand-led occupancy and RevPOR growth. Accelerating demand for our senior housing community underscores the valuable benefits they provide to residents and their families. The over 80 population is expected to grow by 5 million individuals through 2030, yet new construction starts in senior housing are the lowest in over a decade, as is the percentage of inventory under construction.\n In our SHOP portfolio, 99% of Ventas' communities are free from competing construction starts. All of these trends combine to support a highly favorable long-term runway for growth in the biggest part of Ventas' business, senior housing. We also want to expand our footprint in senior housing by capturing value-creating investments in the space. \n On this second prong of our strategy, we are making good progress. Year-to-date, we have closed or placed under contract about $350 million of investments that meet our targets of going in yield, expected unlevered IRRs, occupancy growth potential, affordability and pricing below replacement cost.\n Over my career, it has been rare to see such a compelling investment environment where we can acquire attractive assets in favorable markets at high going-in yields and high growth. Due to market conditions, our efforts and our team's relationship, our pipeline of investment opportunities continues to grow, and we expect to make further progress on our investment plan in the balance of the year.\n Across Ventas, we are also focused on the third element of our strategy, driving cash flow throughout our portfolio. In addition to SHOP, which is now generating over $800 million in annualized NOI, there are two other areas I'd like to cover: Kindred and our outpatient medical and research business. First, respecting the Kindred lease for 23 LTAC, representing approximately 5% of our NOI. The trailing rent coverage remained stable and Kindred has projected improving revenue and expense performance trends for 2024. We continue to have active decisions with Kindred and other parties to optimize Ventas enterprise value and NOI from our property, following the April 2025 lease maturity.\n We and Kindred recently agreed to a 1-month extension for the lease renewal notice date to the end of May. We know you are keenly interested in hearing the outcome of our discussion and we look forward to providing you with more information as soon as we can. \n Our competitively advantaged outpatient medical and research business continues to shine and benefit from strong institutional demand. And it's delivering complementary compounding contributions to our enterprise. As a leader in senior housing, this portfolio is aligned around serving a large and growing aging population. Ventas is advantaged across commercial real estate because demand for our assets is strong and getting stronger.\n The Ventas team is focused on the opportunity for value creation right in front of us. On that point, we are pleased to improve our outlook for the full year. We are raising Ventas' 2024 normalized FFO guidance to between $3.10 and $3.18 per share, and increasing our full year 2024 total company same-store cash NOI guidance to 7% at the midpoint.\n And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Justin. \nJ. Hutchens: Thank you, Debbie. I am pleased to report that our SHOP portfolio performance is off to a strong start. Total SHOP same-store cash NOI growth was 15.2%. The our same-store SHOP communities delivered solid results across all key metrics, including occupancy, RevPOR and OpEx. The first quarter same-store SHOP occupancy grew by 240 basis points year-over-year led by the U.S., which saw 280 basis points of occupancy gains. We have had a strong start to the year with broad-based contributions across community types, geographies and operators.\n In our same-store portfolio in the U.S., move-ins were elevated at 113% versus prior year, led by independent letting move-ins at 127%, outperforming normal seasonal patterns. We have had 9 consecutive months of tours outperforming prior year levels, contributing to the positive move-in momentum we have been experiencing. RevPOR performed in line. Operating expenses were lower than expected due to continued strength in net hiring and cost efficiencies realized by our operators, leveraging insights from our Ventas OI platform. OpExPOR was 1.6%, and or 0.5% when adjusted for the leap year. I'm really happy that our operators are delivering excellent care and services and great results.\n I'd like to highlight Sunrise, Sinceri, Discovery and Le Groupe Maurice in particular, for their superb all-around performance to start the year. Like I said, we are experiencing broad-based contributions from our operators, and we continue to leverage Ventas' OI's vast data sets and powerful analytics and insights to drive performance outcomes.\n Notably, our SHOP portfolio delivered double-digit same-store cash NOI growth for the seventh quarter in a row. Growth in the first quarter was led by our U.S. communities, which grew same-store cash NOI 18%. This strong performance in the U.S. was complemented by our high-quality Canadian portfolio, which is 95% occupied and continues to deliver a valuable and stable cash flow with 9% year-over-year growth.\n Given the strong start to the year, we are happy to raise our full year guidance expectations on our same-store SHOP portfolio, which we now expect to grow 12% to 16% in NOI year-over-year. The key assumptions that drive the midpoint of our range, our average occupancy growth of about 270 basis points, up from 250 led by the U.S. with over 300 basis points, which is higher than we originally anticipated. We still expect RevPOR of about 5%, which puts the total revenue growth at around 8% and OpExPOR growth is expected to be slightly lower than previously forecasted at approximately 2.5%.\n Our total SHOP expectations were originally to add $118 million of NOI growth, and we have raised that expectation to $130 million. April occupancy is already off to a strong start, driven by both tours and move-ins volumes are higher than prior year levels. So we're optimistic about our ongoing occupancy performance. Remember that we are just now entering the critical key selling season. So we'll have to see how that plays out.\n Looking forward, we are energized by the 1,000 basis points of potential occupancy upside in our markets over the course of the next few years. I'm excited about the very strong supply/demand fundamentals combined with well-invested properties and excellent operators supported by our Ventas OI platform to drive growth.\n Moving on to investments. Senior housing is now just over half of the Ventas portfolio NOI with SHOP representing 40% and growing due to the exceptionally strong organic growth and now we are expanding externally as well. We have been actively capturing value-creating external growth opportunities focused on senior housing. So far, we have closed or under contract for approximately $330 million of senior housing investments of which $130 million is already closed. These opportunities are exactly in our sweet spot.\n I am particularly excited by the unique opportunity to invest in relatively high-yielding, high-quality senior housing communities, coupled with outsized growth. These investments have a blended going-in yield in the high 7s, coupled with mid-teens unlevered IRRs. Additionally, we are investing at an attractive discount to replacement costs with an average cost of $241,000 per unit. \n Our approach to executing our investment strategy is guided by our right market, right asset, right operator framework. We're investing in markets with a compelling supply/demand profile, strong affordability and meaningful expected net absorption. We prefer communities that are supported by need-driven demand and offer a combination of services including independent living, assisted living and memory care.\n These communities help us employ a strategic expansion of Ventas strengths in our active value-creating asset management playbook driven through the Ventas OI platform supported by our best-in-class data analytics. We are primarily expanding with existing operators with proven performance. \n Additionally, as part of our data-driven selection process, we welcome new operators with strong track records with capabilities tailored to the service offering at the community as we have more than doubled our SHOP operator pool over the past few years.\n I'll highlight the Magnolia Springs acquisition, which includes 7 communities that are 10 years old on average. They're currently 89% occupied, and our located market is projected to grow around 1,100 basis points over the next few years, supporting more significant revenue growth. The communities average 100 units each and offer a combination of assisted living and memory care services in Indianapolis, Cincinnati and Louisville market areas. \n Affordability on average in the markets is very strong at a projected 7x length of stay. The going in yield is projected to be low 7s and the unlevered IRR is projected to be mid-teens. The discount to replacement cost is estimated to be around 40%. The communities will be operated by our Sinceri who has a proven track record of delivering outstanding care services and performance.\n Moving ahead, we plan to continue to execute on our growing pipeline of senior housing communities. We are actively evaluating many attractive opportunities. In summary, occupancy momentum is strong, and we are off to a strong start to the year. We look forward to continuing SHOP organic growth and executing on our compelling investment pipeline. Bob? \nRobert Probst: Thanks, Justin. I'll share some highlights of our first quarter performance, provide an update on our balance sheet and capital activities and close with our increased 2024 guidance.\n I'll start my first quarter comments with our outpatient medical and research segment, or OMAR, which reported same-store cash NOI growth of nearly 5% in the quarter. In outpatient medical, Pete and team executed 900,000 square feet of new and renewal leases in the first quarter, 50% higher than prior year. Meanwhile, the outpatient medical assets from the equitized loan portfolio increased occupancy by 300 basis points since taking ownership last year due to the effective asset and property management initiatives from the Ventas team.\n Our university-based research same-store cash NOI increased over 5% in the first quarter. with occupancy growth across the same-store portfolio. Our overall new leasing pipeline has increased by 30% to 1.4 million square feet with strong institutional and university demand for university-based life science buildings.\n In terms of first quarter enterprise results, we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $0.04 per share. Normalized FFO per share in Q1 was strong at $0.78, representing 5% year-over-year growth. Our total company same-store cash NOI grew nearly 7%, led by SHOP, increasing 15%. \n Strong SHOP organic growth also drove a 20-basis-point sequential improvement in our net debt-to-EBITDA in the first quarter. Further supporting our leverage trajectory was $94 million in equity raised at an average price of $44.04 to fully fund senior housing investments. The SHOP growth included in the balance of the year guidance is expected to drive continuing leverage improvements in 2024.\n We had some notable capital markets activity so far this year. First, we extended the maturity to 2028 on our $2.75 billion revolving credit facility with improved pricing and strong oversubscription from our banking partners. We thank for their support of our platform. \n Second, we raised $650 million in 5-year Canadian senior notes at 5.1% in the first quarter, taking some 2025 maturing debt off the table early at attractive rates. We also used cash on hand to repay a portion of recent maturing debt, leaving us $700 million of 2024 debt maturities left to refinance this year.\n I'll close with our updated 2024 guidance. We improved our outlook for net income attributable to common stockholders now range from $0.03 to $0.11 per diluted share. We increased the midpoint of our full year normalized FFO guidance to $3.14 per share from the previous midpoint of $3.125. The increase in our midpoint can be explained by a $0.03 per share improvement in organic SHOP NOI, partially offset by higher interest rates.\n We've also raised both our property NOI and same-store cash NOI year-over-year growth midpoint expectations for each of our segments. Total company same-store cash NOI is now expected to grow 7% year-over-year compared to our prior midpoint of 6.25%. \n We have not included any incremental investments in our outlook beyond the $350 million closed or on our contract discussed today. We're increasing our full year capital recycling proceeds to $300 million, as we enhance our portfolio and build additional sources to fund an attractive pipeline of senior housing investments.\n Finally, we expect to spend $250 million in FAD CapEx in 2024. For additional 2024 guidance assumptions, please see our Q1 supplemental and earnings presentation deck posted to our website.\n With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of James Kammert of Evercore. \nJames Kammert: I know it's a bit of a fluid target, obviously. But Justin, you mentioned a couple of times very optimistic about the occupancy potential growth across your core markets, right, if they -- I guess, you're making what sort of assumptions there regarding the pace of that in terms of incremental absorption how many years would that take? I mean, you said about 1,000 points in some of your core markets upside [indiscernible]? \nJ. Hutchens: Yes, sure. So stepping back, obviously, there's been a lot of focus by those of us that participate in the senior housing sector on supply and demand, which has been excellent. Debbie highlighted that, I think, nicely in the opening remarks. \n We've added a page to our earnings deck, you've mentioned that articulates 1,000 basis points of upside in our markets over the next few years. We use a variety of data sources to determine and back testing in those proprietary, but we feel comfortable that's a good outlook. Clearly, we haven't included pacing, but we certainly like the opportunity to continue to perform well within those markets and then to expand into new markets through our external activities and capitalize on the exciting upside. \nJames Kammert: And just a sort of a follow-on to that. If you had -- for every 100 basis points of occupancy, is there any algorithm we can use to think about how that improves margin, because there's obviously a fixed component cost that gets levered. \nJ. Hutchens: Yes. So there's certainly a lot of margin expansion opportunity for us because we're -- overall, both the mid-80s in the U.S. around 80% occupied. In our total SHOP portfolio -- just under 80%, both in independent living and assisted living. \n So there's a lot of occupancy upside ahead. And with that comes the operating leverage that we benefit from in our business. And so there's really good margin expansion ahead. There are some rules of thumb. Maybe we'll include that at some upcoming conferences. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll of RBC Capital Markets. \nMichael Carroll: I wanted to touch on Kindred. I know you made some prepared remarks, Debbie, about it. But can you talk about the reason for the extension option by one extra month? Is this something that Kindred asked for that they needed more time kind of assessing if they wanted to exercise that option or not? \nDebra Cafaro: Happy to talk to you about it. I mean, look, we're engaged in active discussions with Kindred and others. And we're really working to get to the right outcome. And so we believe that, that was really in the best interest of everyone to get to a good outcome, which we define as kind of optimizing Ventas value and NOI. \nMichael Carroll: Okay. And then just kind of on that. I know in the past few quarters, you kind of highlighted that Kindred has been putting in new operational efficiency initiatives to deliver, I guess, better results, has those been put in place yet? And are you seeing returns? \n I mean, if you look at like the trailing 12-month EBITDARM coverage ratio on that portfolio for the past 3 quarters, it's kind of held steady at that 0.9x. So it doesn't seem like coverage has yet picked up, but I know that's a trailing number. So I didn't know if we have more recent data on the most recent quarter kind of highlighting some upticks there. \nDebra Cafaro: I mean you're right on the -- Kindred has initiatives underway to improve both revenue and expense performance, and we are seeing sequential improvement, but the heat map, of course, is a trailing look. And so that's really how you ought to think about it. So you hit the nail on the head. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Griffin of Citi. \nMichael Griffin: Maybe just following up on Michael's question. Could there be an additional extension for Kindred, or do you think end of May is when we will have a decision. \nDebra Cafaro: Yes. So I think that, we're in these active discussions with Kindred and others, and we're really focused on getting the right outcome for Ventas for the enterprise and also for the properties. \n And I would be -- we're working very hard to get to that kind of outcome. And so I'd be less focused on the notice date and just more focused on the work that we're doing, we have a great team working on it. We've been working on it for a while. This is very similar to what happened last time, and we're on it to get a resolution that as soon as we can, and we look forward to telling you as soon as we can. \nNicholas Joseph: I probably should have said this is Nick here with Michael. I guess the second question, just if it is retentive, as you talk to kind of other parties, what would the downtime be for the portfolio, if it goes down that route? \nDebra Cafaro: Right. If -- it's interesting to see that well-respected players like Ensign have now entered the LTAC space. It seems to be enjoying a bit of a moment and that's positive. I would say that there would be a transition kind of on day 1, if there were other tenants for some or all of the properties. So that's the way to think about it. I there's no downtime. It's not like outpatient medical or anything. There's a direct operational transfer if that were to occur. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Deutsche Bank. \nOmotayo Okusanya: Congrats on a great quarter. In terms of acquisitions, again, you have an interesting page in your deck, just kind of talking about all the upcoming debt maturities in senior housing and how you look at that as a potential opportunity. Should we be thinking about acquisitions purely at 3 simple transactions? Or can we possibly see you doing more on the structured finance side as well? \nJ. Hutchens: Primarily 3 simple. That maturity chart really articulates the interesting opportunity because we have tremendously good fundamentals, but you have an asset that's refinancing generally at a lower LTV and higher cost. \n So it's putting pressure on existing owners. And it creates an opportunity for buyers like us to make high-quality acquisitions but with a better capital stack. And there's a variety of sellers as well. There's private equity sellers and operators and multifamily and institutional sellers that we've been seeing in our pipeline, including that which we've been executing on. \nOmotayo Okusanya: Okay, that's helpful. And then if I could sneak one more in. In terms of Brookdale, which is the other rent lease that's coming up, again, coverage is great and all that's fine. But curious if structurally that could change from being a triple net portfolio to much more of a [indiscernible] portfolio, just given how well your SHOP portfolio is doing and how strong senior housing fundamentals are generally. \nDebra Cafaro: Tayo, thanks for asking that. Brookdale is about 7% of our NOI. And you're right, the coverage has been improving, and it's at about 1.3x on a trailing basis. And again, the trends in those markets also support a lot of intermediate-term occupancy increases. And so there are lots of positive outcomes for Ventas as we think about that, which is as you mentioned, at the end of 2025. \nOmotayo Okusanya: So I guess structurally, you expected to stay the same as a triple net? \nJ. Hutchens: So I think when we say we have a lot of positive options. I mean these communities are in markets that also have a tremendous upside from a supply-demand standpoint, the demand metrics are excellent. \n To the same point Debbie made on Kindred, the trailing coverage is always a little out of date. So there's even better performance, I'm sure to come. So we like the opportunity really in any structure to own these communities. And that's the positive opportunity that we're facing. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria of BMO Capital Markets. \nJuan Sanabria: I just wanted to just wanted to ask around acquisitions, and it seems like you've got another group of properties maybe you're looking at. How we should think about funding that? And how you think about your cost of capital with leverage still relatively high but definitely improving. \nRobert Probst: Sure Juan, I'll take that one. Thanks. Starting with the financial returns that we're seeing on these investments, which Justin articulated are really, really attractive even at the current cost of capital. We talked last earnings call about the fact that on balance sheet financing can work given those returns, and in fact, baked that into our guidance. And that's what we executed on in the first quarter. We fully funded those senior housing investments with equity.\n And as we look forward, given the pipeline, what we've incrementally added to guidance is more disposition proceeds at the source. So another couple of hundred million across asset classes as a source of funds just because we see the opportunity in front of us. So pretty much doing what we said and building more dry powder would be my summary. \nJuan Sanabria: And a follow-up for Justin on the 1,000 basis points of occupancy upside on the U.S. portfolio. I guess, first, is that a same-store comment or an overall portfolio comment and kind of where is the starting point now. And what do you see as the kind of the structural ceiling for occupancy knowing there's always some churn of customers or seniors in and out of the communities. \nJ. Hutchens: Great question. So first of all, it's obviously U.S. focused and it's a total SHOP, and we're running just under 80% occupied in both our independent living and assisted living products in the U.S. It's about 2/3 assisted living in the U.S. in our total SHOP portfolio. We do see a lot of upside. The structural upside opportunity in my view, through experience and philosophically is 100% occupied. And we have several communities that are at 99%, 100% occupancy. And so there's nothing like a completely full community to really demonstrate the operating leverage and also just deliver great care and services. And so that's the goal.\n And we have operators that are starting to deliver on that goal, certainly in Canada, it's starting to happen in the U.S. in certain markets, and we'll keep driving. And it's just great to have so much demand at our doorstep and to be able to look forward and have confidence around the opportunity. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem of Morgan Stanley. \nRonald Kamdem: Great. Just two quick ones. So one, trying to connect the dots on the occupancy here. You put a lot of bread crumbs in the presentation, obviously, starting with 1,000 basis points occupancy upside than we're seeing here that you finally hired senior VP and senior housing. The Ventas OI and sort of the occupancy gains you're getting on that CapEx investment. I guess the question to be direct is, is 275 to 300 basis points of occupancy gain a year. Is that the new normal, and if not, like what would be sort of stopping that? \nJ. Hutchens: So a couple of comments in response here. So I mentioned that our U.S. is projected to be over 300-basis-points occupancy growth this year. So that's a set to think about. I also mentioned that we're just at the beginning of the key selling season. So we'll be seeing how that plays out. You make a good point. We're optimistic about the trends leading into it. So we'll see where that goes.\n We have made a new hire, senior VP of senior housing and chief revenue officer for senior housing. This person will introduce when she starts in the first part of June, but her job really will be to lead the SHOP platform to drive performance and has a very, very strong background in top line performance in senior housing and in hospitality, and she's held leadership roles in global Fortune 500 companies. \n So really excited about the addition of the team and continue this momentum and work with what is really a tremendous existing team. That's really been driving the OI platform. And I think the new addition will just make us even stronger. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein of Bank of America. \nJoshua Dennerlein: The SHOP occupancy update in 1Q, that was better than you guys were expecting and then you revised the outlook higher for the year. My question revolves around, is that driven by like the market being better, so like the beta being driven from the aging of America? Or is there some kind of like alpha overlay that you guys are doing internally that's driving better customer demand, and that's why you're getting this like uplift. If the latter, could you just maybe elaborate on what you're doing to drive that alpha? \nDebra Cafaro: It's both. And I sort of take the macro and then I defer to Justin on all of the kind of OI-driven actions and initiatives to deliver outsized performance within a demand-driven macro. \nJ. Hutchens: That's great. And it all starts with the macro for sure. And then within that, we've been working for quite some time to make sure we're well positioned to take advantage of this great opportunity. \n A couple of examples. One is just price volume optimization, and this is really the opportunity to ensure that we really -- we maintain our market position. A good example would be Sunrise and Atria, which are well invested, well established operators in local markets. And as we adjust pricing over time, we want to make sure that we're maintaining the relative position in the market. We back tested this, and we -- over the past year, we've had big increases in average move-ins in those companies.\n And then there's other examples. Sinceri jumps out to me as one where we made -- we took actions to invest in the properties and put the new operator in place. And then we've tracked the performance relative to market and they're outperforming market. \n And so that's an opportunity. The overall CapEx investment we highlighted in our earnings deck where we've had year-over-year growth of 470 basis points of occupancy and a street rate growth of over 9%. So it's a combination of a lot of activity and actions and helping to give our operators some strategic support as they do the great job of executing on a day-to-day basis. \nJoshua Dennerlein: On a different note, you guys have the Brookdale warrants. I know they're exercisable through year-end 2025. Just how are you guys thinking about essentially exercising those. I know they're really in the money, which is how do you think about using those as a potential source of capital? \nRobert Probst: Yes, I'll take that one. You're right. We have 16 million warrants at $3 a share. So clearly deeply in the money. And that is, again, another source of funds as we think about the opportunity to both create value recognized gains and invest behind senior housing real estate. And obviously, about 1.5 years left in terms of duration, but a clear opportunity. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico of Scotiabank. \nNicholas Yulico: Maybe just a bigger picture question on kind of the focus for the company right now in terms of -- there is a lot of opportunity to invest in seniors housing. If we fast forward a year from now, is Ventas going to be a larger company, more assets owned, higher senior housing exposure. How should we think about that sort of investment pipeline, how you could capitalize on it? \n Because I think year-to-date or what's in the pipeline is somewhat neutral. You have acquisitions, dispositions roughly matched. How do you think about sort of growing the portfolio right now? \nDebra Cafaro: Yes. I mean, we're -- again, we're executing on the strategy. The driver of organic growth is obviously driving the bus. We're going to -- as the second largest owner of senior housing with the platform that we have and access to capital, we're layering on external growth focused on senior housing that part of the portfolio is definitely going to grow. And we're committed to taking advantage of this multiyear opportunity and the kind of returns that we're seeing in the market for good assets at high yields with high growth potential, we are going to find a way to make those acquisitions and make senior housing a larger part of our overall portfolio. I mean it's already over half with job at 40% and growing. And I think you're going to see those trends continue. \nNicholas Yulico: Okay. Second question is just -- I know you have the slide in there again on the attractive time to invest in senior housing. And talks about year 1 FFO per share neutral/accretive for the investments, realizing that, obviously, there's a long runway here when you're thinking in the long term. But how should we think about your focus on -- at what point is it year 2? How should we think about accretion happening because obviously, earnings growth is important, people focus on that. \nDebra Cafaro: Definitely. And we are, too. Bob? \nRobert Probst: I think going in yields relative to cost of capital, roughly neutral, so not in the immediately accretive. But I would point you to the IRRs and the growth potential in these investments, mid-teens and an example used. That says there's attractive growth in the near term, which would drive accretion. \nDebra Cafaro: Yes. \nRobert Probst: And that's what's so exciting to us. \nDebra Cafaro: And it would be near-term accretion. \nRobert Probst: Near term. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra of Mizuho. \nVikram Malhotra: Congrats on a strong quarter. Just two questions. Maybe Justin one for you. I guess I wanted to be clear, the acceleration trends you've mentioned last quarter and at prior conferences in SHOP. Is that occupancy? Or is that same-store NOI growth as you go through the year? Because you had a really strong 1Q, but the midpoint of the guide still suggests some decel through the year. I know you're being conservative, but I just want to understand the mechanics behind. Is it occupancy acceleration or SHOP acceleration or both? \nJ. Hutchens: Well, first of all, occupancy is accelerating. That's -- it's been underway, and that's part of the guidance expectations that we gave. Good point. We had a real strong start to the first quarter from an NOI standpoint. So that kind of changes the trajectory of what we're expecting in terms of stepping up throughout the year. And also another good point, key selling season starts right now. So we'll give ourselves time to see how that plays out and go from there. \nVikram Malhotra: So just to clarify, are you still -- like you said last quarter, just -- I want to make sure, is it same-store NOI growth acceleration? Or is it the occupancy acceleration. You just said the trajectory change, but are you still anticipating accelerating same-store NOI growth? \nRobert Probst: Yes. I would point you to, first off, occupancy. We posted 240 so far year-to-date. We've got 270 year-over-year. So clearly, there's going to be incremental year-over-year occupancy growth embedded in the forecast. Our range has gone up at the midpoint to 14% on NOI. We posted 15% in the first quarter, pretty close. I think we keep coming back to this key selling season notion. We're just starting that. We want to see how that one plays out. \nVikram Malhotra: Got it. Okay. And then Debbie, if I don't know if you can maybe throw us some more tealeaves here just on the Kindred outcome. I guess, is it fair to assume the fact that you've extended by 1 month, and you've mentioned there are potentially other parties. It's unlikely that -- or it's more likely that Kindred is part of the solution, meaning it's like an all renewal or partial with other players and them just not renewing at all is off the table, just given the fact that you extended it by another month. \nDebra Cafaro: Well, again, happy to give as many tealeaves and more as soon as we can. I would say that we are in active discussions with Kindred and others. It's more likely that Kindred would be part of a solution going forward. But we're continuing to keep working on every alternative so that we can reach the goal, which, again, is optimizing value for Ventas shareholders and the NOI from these properties. So we're very focused, and we're very on it. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Anderson of Wedbush Securities. \nRichard Anderson: So Justin, you talked a little bit about what you do with assets once you own them price optimization, investing in the properties. And also perhaps transitioning to other operators that are proving themselves to be worthy. If you do $1 billion, how much do you think will fall in the transition category? And would you be expecting any meaningful downtime whereas you get the full benefit, maybe not this year, but a year from now? \nJ. Hutchens: Good question. So I'm going to step back and just talk a little bit about the [ pressure tick ]. So obviously, we've talked a lot about markets and first step is always to make sure we're entering the right markets to support upside opportunity and affordability. And then from there, we focus on the particular asset. We're focused on need-driven assisted living and memory care, and a lot of the campus is also including independent living, high-growth, need-driven product. \n Then it's who's really in the best position to manage that. And we make the decision really not because we're trying to cause the delay. It's because we're trying to cause better performance sooner.\n So when we move a new manager in, that's our expectation. We've had very good results with transitions. There's always risk associated with the transition. Obviously, we have a lot of experience having transitioned well over 150 communities over the past few years, managing through that and getting good outcomes. And so it's going to come down to like the decision really is going to be putting ourselves in the best position to drive performance in that community. \nRichard Anderson: Okay. And then second question, I think, Bob, you mentioned a lot of what's -- or everything that's been done so far has been funded with equity. Just back of the envelope, I'm looking at like an AFFO yield of about 6%. But then when you talk about dispositions, and I think you called it OMAR, which is a new one. What -- how much how comparable are disposition cap rates to your equity cost in your view and how much of it comes out of OM and how much comes out of AR, like I'm curious... \nRobert Probst: Yes. It's a memorable acronym OMAR, outpatient medical and research. \nDebra Cafaro: The A is for and. \nRobert Probst: Yes, an. OMAR. Easier to remember. So step back, the guide of dispose of $300 million includes OMAR, but is also across asset classes, including senior housing and others. So I would say the blended cap rate is roughly mid-single digits on that, not dissimilar to the number you quoted. So again, as we think about reinvesting maybe neutral in the short run, but again, upgrading the portfolio and with the growth potential in the investments really accretive over time. So hence, capital recycling increase is another source of funds that we're very focused on. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller of JPMorgan. \nMichael Mueller: I was wondering, can you give us some high-level color on how the SHOP outlook varies maybe from the AL to the IL segment. \nJ. Hutchens: Yes, sure. So most of our NOI growth is coming from AL. We have -- that's going to be on the much higher end of the average, particularly in the U.S. So the IL growth really -- there'll be some growth and some contribution this year, but really more of a 2025 opportunity that we see it in terms of big contributions in the U.S.\n Occupancy trends have been excellent across our independent living portfolio in the U.S. I mentioned that we ran at 127% of prior year move-ins in the U.S. in the first quarter in independent living. We've had multiple months of occupancy growth. April looks good independent living and so there's good leading indicators in that portfolio that will ultimately drive the NOI, but AL is really leading the way right now in the U.S. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay of Baird. \nWesley Golladay: I just want to follow up on that last question regarding the IL picking up next year. Is that just more so operating leverage kicking in next year? \nJ. Hutchens: Yes, exactly. So IL is a high-margin business. It has relatively high fixed costs because you're not delivering care, you're offering more limited services. So the operating leverage is very, very high. And the higher the occupancy, the more you benefit from that, and we have a long runway in terms of occupancy upside. So we look forward to some continued growth there and then see how that plays out, driving NOI moving forward. \nWesley Golladay: Okay. And then I want to go back to that slide. You have about the $19 billion of loans. How much of those loans do you think will have some issues on the refinancing front? And has your view on the amount of distress changed over the last, call it, 6 months. On one hand, you have rates just continue to grind higher, but then the recovery is also accelerating. \nDebra Cafaro: Right. I would say that there are -- there is a large percentage of those loans that have some difficulty in refinancing without additional equity contributions. The assets are good, the markets can be good, the growth can be good. But because LTVs are lower, and as you say, rates are higher and the NOIs, many of them have not recovered to pre-COVID levels or they were newly constructed assets that really were delivered in COVID and therefore, aren't meeting their original pro formas. There's really good upside, but the refinancing mass doesn't necessarily work without significant paydowns.\n And so those owners, which again, I think, is a significant percentage of the $19 billion either have to decide if they want to reach in their pocket and put more equity in or if they can sell them for a reasonable value and just move on whether that's really where they want to go. And that's really part of that opportunity. But as Justin said, there are many other market forces that are pushing sellers to market and that are creating the overall pipeline opportunity that we're seeing. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Stroyeck of Green Street. \nMichael Stroyeck: Maybe one on the outpatient medical business. What drove the sequential occupancy decline during the quarter, whether in terms of tenant credit, asset quality or anything you can provide? And then what were the consistent themes with those move-outs, if any, compared with the recent tenant move-outs we saw second half of last year. \nRobert Probst: Yes. Yes. Thanks for the question. We're actually really happy with our leasing. We've -- in the first quarter, we did 900,000 square feet of leasing, 50% more than prior year, which is terrific. And what I'm also happy to talk about is health system health has really come back. If you look at the [ COPPENHALL data ], the financials for the health systems are almost 40% higher than what they were a year ago. So they're back. They're executing on their strategy, and they're upgrading their facilities and converting nonclinical space to clinical space.\n Now to your point about the 40 basis points, that equates to about 72,000 square feet worth of lost occupancy. I can tell you that almost immediately, we re-leased 55,000 square feet of that 72,000. And in many cases, it's to essentially the same entity. I'll just give you 2 examples. One example is with a health system where an independent practice moved out and the health system who is associated with that practice and immediately lease the space back again. We have to build out the space. So occupancy goes down, but it's essentially re-leased.\n Another example is, a health system had, on a particular floor, a bunch of small suites, they wanted to just let all those go and re-lease the space as one suite, so they can have larger and more efficient practice. So those types of things are going on as vacancy, we're losing a little bit of occupancy as a health systems execute on their strategy and then that will result in better leasing, better rents later in the year or next year. \nMichael Stroyeck: Okay. That's helpful. Maybe a second question, if I may. Going back to that IL versus AL discussion. So IL meaningfully outperformed in terms of occupancy gains during the quarter. Is that a reflection of just greater demand for the IL product are more attributable to an improvement in the operations of that Holiday by Atria portfolio. \nJ. Hutchens: Yes. So we've had -- we definitely have had good recent momentum in our independent living portfolio that includes some Holiday communities, it includes -- former Holiday communities and include some of our existing mostly -- most of our other ILs operated by our legacy Atria within our legacy Atria portfolio. So there's been an intense effort to work with our operators to ensure that we're getting the best performance within those communities, and that continues. \n And the whole playbook really has been used, everything from sales oversight insights, price volume optimization, CapEx investment and then the operators just really executing. And so we're really happy to see the good results and look forward to more growth. \nMichael Stroyeck: So just to clarify, it's pretty broad-based across the IL portfolio. \nJ. Hutchens: Yes, it is broad-based across IL portfolio. \nDebra Cafaro: Yes. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt of KeyBanc Capital Markets. \nAustin Wurschmidt: I just wanted to hit on RevPOR. You guys assumed a firm, the RevPOR growth for the year which does imply acceleration similar to occupancy in the quarters ahead, just kind of what gives you that confidence? And is that acceleration coming from primary markets that have kind of lagged the overall portfolio? Or is it other buckets that are driving that improvement? \nJ. Hutchens: Yes. One thing I just want to point out is when we gave the metrics that are supporting the SHOP guidance, you'll notice a lot of [indiscernible]. So it's approximately 8% revenue, approximately 5% RevPOR approximately 270 of occupancy lift. And then we have an NOI range. And so we left a little room for movement amongst those metrics and see how the key selling season plays out. So I don't think we're necessarily saying we're going from 4.7% to 5%.  We're just saying we expect to be around 5% and which was consistent with what we saw in the first quarter. \nAustin Wurschmidt: Got it. That's helpful. And then just on the street rate growth, broad-based for overall same-store portfolio. I mean, given some of the leading indicators you've pointed to showing strength, the occupancy acceleration. I mean what would lead you to kind of lean into that and maybe kind of test the waters on pushing that a little harder if you continue to see the strength in the demand that you see now for the last couple of quarters? \nJ. Hutchens: Yes. So the part of the price volume optimization is really making sure we're priced right and where there's more demand in a market, an opportunity to move with market pricing more aggressively, we do that. So there's certain markets and certain highly occupied communities that are attracting a higher street rate, higher move-in rate. So that's definitely part of the plan. Now having said that, we have a lot of occupancy upside, and that's the big opportunity for us is to continue to play into the demand drive volume. Balance it so that we're getting the best out of just total revenue growth and then drive NOI. \nAustin Wurschmidt: And the guidance -- I was just thinking that the guidance assumes that, that 7% kind of stays steady to your point on kind of the occupancy upside? \nJ. Hutchens: I mean it's a year-over-year stat. So I think you'll probably see a little bit of movement within the metric. But what we're expecting to see is growth in street rates, growth in move-in rents and growth in occupancy. \nOperator: That concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the conference back over to Debra Cafaro, Chairman and CEO of Ventas for closing remarks. \nDebra Cafaro: Great. Great. I want to thank all my colleagues and also all of our shareholders, analysts and other participants today. We very much appreciate your attention and your interest in Ventas and look forward to seeing you soon. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Justin. I'll share some highlights of our first quarter performance, provide an update on our balance sheet and capital activities and close with our increased 2024 guidance.\n I'll start my first quarter comments with our outpatient medical and research segment, or OMAR, which reported same-store cash NOI growth of nearly 5% in the quarter. In outpatient medical, Pete and team executed 900,000 square feet of new and renewal leases in the first quarter, 50% higher than prior year. Meanwhile, the outpatient medical assets from the equitized loan portfolio increased occupancy by 300 basis points since taking ownership last year due to the effective asset and property management initiatives from the Ventas team.\n Our university-based research same-store cash NOI increased over 5% in the first quarter. with occupancy growth across the same-store portfolio. Our overall new leasing pipeline has increased by 30% to 1.4 million square feet with strong institutional and university demand for university-based life science buildings.\n In terms of first quarter enterprise results, we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $0.04 per share. Normalized FFO per share in Q1 was strong at $0.78, representing 5% year-over-year growth. Our total company same-store cash NOI grew nearly 7%, led by SHOP, increasing 15%. \n Strong SHOP organic growth also drove a 20-basis-point sequential improvement in our net debt-to-EBITDA in the first quarter. Further supporting our leverage trajectory was $94 million in equity raised at an average price of $44.04 to fully fund senior housing investments. The SHOP growth included in the balance of the year guidance is expected to drive continuing leverage improvements in 2024.\n We had some notable capital markets activity so far this year. First, we extended the maturity to 2028 on our $2.75 billion revolving credit facility with improved pricing and strong oversubscription from our banking partners. We thank for their support of our platform. \n Second, we raised $650 million in 5-year Canadian senior notes at 5.1% in the first quarter, taking some 2025 maturing debt off the table early at attractive rates. We also used cash on hand to repay a portion of recent maturing debt, leaving us $700 million of 2024 debt maturities left to refinance this year.\n I'll close with our updated 2024 guidance. We improved our outlook for net income attributable to common stockholders now range from $0.03 to $0.11 per diluted share. We increased the midpoint of our full year normalized FFO guidance to $3.14 per share from the previous midpoint of $3.125. The increase in our midpoint can be explained by a $0.03 per share improvement in organic SHOP NOI, partially offset by higher interest rates.\n We've also raised both our property NOI and same-store cash NOI year-over-year growth midpoint expectations for each of our segments. Total company same-store cash NOI is now expected to grow 7% year-over-year compared to our prior midpoint of 6.25%. \n We have not included any incremental investments in our outlook beyond the $350 million closed or on our contract discussed today. We're increasing our full year capital recycling proceeds to $300 million, as we enhance our portfolio and build additional sources to fund an attractive pipeline of senior housing investments.\n Finally, we expect to spend $250 million in FAD CapEx in 2024. For additional 2024 guidance assumptions, please see our Q1 supplemental and earnings presentation deck posted to our website.\n With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator. Sure Juan, I'll take that one. Thanks. Starting with the financial returns that we're seeing on these investments, which Justin articulated are really, really attractive even at the current cost of capital. We talked last earnings call about the fact that on balance sheet financing can work given those returns, and in fact, baked that into our guidance. And that's what we executed on in the first quarter. We fully funded those senior housing investments with equity.\n And as we look forward, given the pipeline, what we've incrementally added to guidance is more disposition proceeds at the source. So another couple of hundred million across asset classes as a source of funds just because we see the opportunity in front of us. So pretty much doing what we said and building more dry powder would be my summary. Yes, I'll take that one. You're right. We have 16 million warrants at $3 a share. So clearly deeply in the money. And that is, again, another source of funds as we think about the opportunity to both create value recognized gains and invest behind senior housing real estate. And obviously, about 1.5 years left in terms of duration, but a clear opportunity. I think going in yields relative to cost of capital, roughly neutral, so not in the immediately accretive. But I would point you to the IRRs and the growth potential in these investments, mid-teens and an example used. That says there's attractive growth in the near term, which would drive accretion. And that's what's so exciting to us. Near term. Yes. I would point you to, first off, occupancy. We posted 240 so far year-to-date. We've got 270 year-over-year. So clearly, there's going to be incremental year-over-year occupancy growth embedded in the forecast. Our range has gone up at the midpoint to 14% on NOI. We posted 15% in the first quarter, pretty close. I think we keep coming back to this key selling season notion. We're just starting that. We want to see how that one plays out. Yes. It's a memorable acronym OMAR, outpatient medical and research. Yes, an. OMAR. Easier to remember. So step back, the guide of dispose of $300 million includes OMAR, but is also across asset classes, including senior housing and others. So I would say the blended cap rate is roughly mid-single digits on that, not dissimilar to the number you quoted. So again, as we think about reinvesting maybe neutral in the short run, but again, upgrading the portfolio and with the growth potential in the investments really accretive over time. So hence, capital recycling increase is another source of funds that we're very focused on. Yes. Yes. Thanks for the question. We're actually really happy with our leasing. We've -- in the first quarter, we did 900,000 square feet of leasing, 50% more than prior year, which is terrific. And what I'm also happy to talk about is health system health has really come back. If you look at the [ COPPENHALL data ], the financials for the health systems are almost 40% higher than what they were a year ago. So they're back. They're executing on their strategy, and they're upgrading their facilities and converting nonclinical space to clinical space.\n Now to your point about the 40 basis points, that equates to about 72,000 square feet worth of lost occupancy. I can tell you that almost immediately, we re-leased 55,000 square feet of that 72,000. And in many cases, it's to essentially the same entity. I'll just give you 2 examples. One example is with a health system where an independent practice moved out and the health system who is associated with that practice and immediately lease the space back again.

            "name": "J. Hutchens",
            "content": "Thank you, Debbie. I am pleased to report that our SHOP portfolio performance is off to a strong start. Total SHOP same-store cash NOI growth was 15.2%. The our same-store SHOP communities delivered solid results across all key metrics, including occupancy, RevPOR and OpEx. The first quarter same-store SHOP occupancy grew by 240 basis points year-over-year led by the U.S., which saw 280 basis points of occupancy gains. We have had a strong start to the year with broad-based contributions across community types, geographies and operators.\n In our same-store portfolio in the U.S., move-ins were elevated at 113% versus prior year, led by independent letting move-ins at 127%, outperforming normal seasonal patterns. We have had 9 consecutive months of tours outperforming prior year levels, contributing to the positive move-in momentum we have been experiencing. RevPOR performed in line. Operating expenses were lower than expected due to continued strength in net hiring and cost efficiencies realized by our operators, leveraging insights from our Ventas OI platform. OpExPOR was 1.6%, and or 0.5% when adjusted for the leap year. I'm really happy that our operators are delivering excellent care and services and great results.\n I'd like to highlight Sunrise, Sinceri, Discovery and Le Groupe Maurice in particular, for their superb all-around performance to start the year. Like I said, we are experiencing broad-based contributions from our operators, and we continue to leverage Ventas' OI's vast data sets and powerful analytics and insights to drive performance outcomes.\n Notably, our SHOP portfolio delivered double-digit same-store cash NOI growth for the seventh quarter in a row. Growth in the first quarter was led by our U.S. communities, which grew same-store cash NOI 18%. This strong performance in the U.S. was complemented by our high-quality Canadian portfolio, which is 95% occupied and continues to deliver a valuable and stable cash flow with 9% year-over-year growth.\n Given the strong start to the year, we are happy to raise our full year guidance expectations on our same-store SHOP portfolio, which we now expect to grow 12% to 16% in NOI year-over-year. The key assumptions that drive the midpoint of our range, our average occupancy growth of about 270 basis points, up from 250 led by the U.S. with over 300 basis points, which is higher than we originally anticipated. We still expect RevPOR of about 5%, which puts the total revenue growth at around 8% and OpExPOR growth is expected to be slightly lower than previously forecasted at approximately 2.5%.\n Our total SHOP expectations were originally to add $118 million of NOI growth, and we have raised that expectation to $130 million. April occupancy is already off to a strong start, driven by both tours and move-ins volumes are higher than prior year levels. So we're optimistic about our ongoing occupancy performance. Remember that we are just now entering the critical key selling season. So we'll have to see how that plays out.\n Looking forward, we are energized by the 1,000 basis points of potential occupancy upside in our markets over the course of the next few years. I'm excited about the very strong supply/demand fundamentals combined with well-invested properties and excellent operators supported by our Ventas OI platform to drive growth.\n Moving on to investments. Senior housing is now just over half of the Ventas portfolio NOI with SHOP representing 40% and growing due to the exceptionally strong organic growth and now we are expanding externally as well. We have been actively capturing value-creating external growth opportunities focused on senior housing. So far, we have closed or under contract for approximately $330 million of senior housing investments of which $130 million is already closed. These opportunities are exactly in our sweet spot.\n I am particularly excited by the unique opportunity to invest in relatively high-yielding, high-quality senior housing communities, coupled with outsized growth. These investments have a blended going-in yield in the high 7s, coupled with mid-teens unlevered IRRs. Additionally, we are investing at an attractive discount to replacement costs with an average cost of $241,000 per unit. \n Our approach to executing our investment strategy is guided by our right market, right asset, right operator framework. We're investing in markets with a compelling supply/demand profile, strong affordability and meaningful expected net absorption. We prefer communities that are supported by need-driven demand and offer a combination of services including independent living, assisted living and memory care.\n These communities help us employ a strategic expansion of Ventas strengths in our active value-creating asset management playbook driven through the Ventas OI platform supported by our best-in-class data analytics. We are primarily expanding with existing operators with proven performance. \n Additionally, as part of our data-driven selection process, we welcome new operators with strong track records with capabilities tailored to the service offering at the community as we have more than doubled our SHOP operator pool over the past few years.\n I'll highlight the Magnolia Springs acquisition, which includes 7 communities that are 10 years old on average. They're currently 89% occupied, and our located market is projected to grow around 1,100 basis points over the next few years, supporting more significant revenue growth. The communities average 100 units each and offer a combination of assisted living and memory care services in Indianapolis, Cincinnati and Louisville market areas. \n Affordability on average in the markets is very strong at a projected 7x length of stay. The going in yield is projected to be low 7s and the unlevered IRR is projected to be mid-teens. The discount to replacement cost is estimated to be around 40%. The communities will be operated by our Sinceri who has a proven track record of delivering outstanding care services and performance.\n Moving ahead, we plan to continue to execute on our growing pipeline of senior housing communities. We are actively evaluating many attractive opportunities. In summary, occupancy momentum is strong, and we are off to a strong start to the year. We look forward to continuing SHOP organic growth and executing on our compelling investment pipeline. Bob? Yes, sure. So stepping back, obviously, there's been a lot of focus by those of us that participate in the senior housing sector on supply and demand, which has been excellent. Debbie highlighted that, I think, nicely in the opening remarks. \n We've added a page to our earnings deck, you've mentioned that articulates 1,000 basis points of upside in our markets over the next few years. We use a variety of data sources to determine and back testing in those proprietary, but we feel comfortable that's a good outlook. Clearly, we haven't included pacing, but we certainly like the opportunity to continue to perform well within those markets and then to expand into new markets through our external activities and capitalize on the exciting upside. Yes. So there's certainly a lot of margin expansion opportunity for us because we're -- overall, both the mid-80s in the U.S. around 80% occupied. In our total SHOP portfolio -- just under 80%, both in independent living and assisted living. \n So there's a lot of occupancy upside ahead. And with that comes the operating leverage that we benefit from in our business. And so there's really good margin expansion ahead. There are some rules of thumb. Maybe we'll include that at some upcoming conferences. Primarily 3 simple. That maturity chart really articulates the interesting opportunity because we have tremendously good fundamentals, but you have an asset that's refinancing generally at a lower LTV and higher cost. \n So it's putting pressure on existing owners. And it creates an opportunity for buyers like us to make high-quality acquisitions but with a better capital stack. And there's a variety of sellers as well. There's private equity sellers and operators and multifamily and institutional sellers that we've been seeing in our pipeline, including that which we've been executing on. So I think when we say we have a lot of positive options. I mean these communities are in markets that also have a tremendous upside from a supply-demand standpoint, the demand metrics are excellent. \n To the same point Debbie made on Kindred, the trailing coverage is always a little out of date. So there's even better performance, I'm sure to come. So we like the opportunity really in any structure to own these communities. And that's the positive opportunity that we're facing. Great question. So first of all, it's obviously U.S. focused and it's a total SHOP, and we're running just under 80% occupied in both our independent living and assisted living products in the U.S. It's about 2/3 assisted living in the U.S. in our total SHOP portfolio. We do see a lot of upside. The structural upside opportunity in my view, through experience and philosophically is 100% occupied. And we have several communities that are at 99%, 100% occupancy. And so there's nothing like a completely full community to really demonstrate the operating leverage and also just deliver great care and services. And so that's the goal.\n And we have operators that are starting to deliver on that goal, certainly in Canada, it's starting to happen in the U.S. in certain markets, and we'll keep driving. And it's just great to have so much demand at our doorstep and to be able to look forward and have confidence around the opportunity. So a couple of comments in response here. So I mentioned that our U.S. is projected to be over 300-basis-points occupancy growth this year. So that's a set to think about. I also mentioned that we're just at the beginning of the key selling season. So we'll be seeing how that plays out. You make a good point. We're optimistic about the trends leading into it. So we'll see where that goes.\n We have made a new hire, senior VP of senior housing and chief revenue officer for senior housing. This person will introduce when she starts in the first part of June, but her job really will be to lead the SHOP platform to drive performance and has a very, very strong background in top line performance in senior housing and in hospitality, and she's held leadership roles in global Fortune 500 companies. \n So really excited about the addition of the team and continue this momentum and work with what is really a tremendous existing team. That's really been driving the OI platform. And I think the new addition will just make us even stronger. That's great. And it all starts with the macro for sure. And then within that, we've been working for quite some time to make sure we're well positioned to take advantage of this great opportunity. \n A couple of examples. One is just price volume optimization, and this is really the opportunity to ensure that we really -- we maintain our market position. A good example would be Sunrise and Atria, which are well invested, well established operators in local markets. And as we adjust pricing over time, we want to make sure that we're maintaining the relative position in the market. We back tested this, and we -- over the past year, we've had big increases in average move-ins in those companies.\n And then there's other examples. Sinceri jumps out to me as one where we made -- we took actions to invest in the properties and put the new operator in place. And then we've tracked the performance relative to market and they're outperforming market. \n And so that's an opportunity. The overall CapEx investment we highlighted in our earnings deck where we've had year-over-year growth of 470 basis points of occupancy and a street rate growth of over 9%. So it's a combination of a lot of activity and actions and helping to give our operators some strategic support as they do the great job of executing on a day-to-day basis. Well, first of all, occupancy is accelerating. That's -- it's been underway, and that's part of the guidance expectations that we gave. Good point. We had a real strong start to the first quarter from an NOI standpoint. So that kind of changes the trajectory of what we're expecting in terms of stepping up throughout the year. And also another good point, key selling season starts right now. So we'll give ourselves time to see how that plays out and go from there. Good question. So I'm going to step back and just talk a little bit about the [ pressure tick ]. So obviously, we've talked a lot about markets and first step is always to make sure we're entering the right markets to support upside opportunity and affordability. And then from there, we focus on the particular asset. We're focused on need-driven assisted living and memory care, and a lot of the campus is also including independent living, high-growth, need-driven product. \n Then it's who's really in the best position to manage that. And we make the decision really not because we're trying to cause the delay. It's because we're trying to cause better performance sooner.\n So when we move a new manager in, that's our expectation. We've had very good results with transitions. There's always risk associated with the transition. Obviously, we have a lot of experience having transitioned well over 150 communities over the past few years, managing through that and getting good outcomes. And so it's going to come down to like the decision really is going to be putting ourselves in the best position to drive performance in that community. Yes, sure. So most of our NOI growth is coming from AL. We have -- that's going to be on the much higher end of the average, particularly in the U.S. So the IL growth really -- there'll be some growth and some contribution this year, but really more of a 2025 opportunity that we see it in terms of big contributions in the U.S.\n Occupancy trends have been excellent across our independent living portfolio in the U.S. I mentioned that we ran at 127% of prior year move-ins in the U.S. in the first quarter in independent living. We've had multiple months of occupancy growth. April looks good independent living and so there's good leading indicators in that portfolio that will ultimately drive the NOI, but AL is really leading the way right now in the U.S. Yes, exactly. So IL is a high-margin business. It has relatively high fixed costs because you're not delivering care, you're offering more limited services. So the operating leverage is very, very high. And the higher the occupancy, the more you benefit from that, and we have a long runway in terms of occupancy upside. So we look forward to some continued growth there and then see how that plays out, driving NOI moving forward. Yes. So we've had -- we definitely have had good recent momentum in our independent living portfolio that includes some Holiday communities, it includes -- former Holiday communities and include some of our existing mostly -- most of our other ILs operated by our legacy Atria within our legacy Atria portfolio. So there's been an intense effort to work with our operators to ensure that we're getting the best performance within those communities, and that continues. \n And the whole playbook really has been used, everything from sales oversight insights, price volume optimization, CapEx investment and then the operators just really executing. And so we're really happy to see the good results and look forward to more growth. Yes, it is broad-based across IL portfolio. Yes. One thing I just want to point out is when we gave the metrics that are supporting the SHOP guidance, you'll notice a lot of [indiscernible]. So it's approximately 8% revenue, approximately 5% RevPOR approximately 270 of occupancy lift. And then we have an NOI range. And so we left a little room for movement amongst those metrics and see how the key selling season plays out. So I don't think we're necessarily saying we're going from 4.7% to 5%.  We're just saying we expect to be around 5% and which was consistent with what we saw in the first quarter. Yes. So the part of the price volume optimization is really making sure we're priced right and where there's more demand in a market, an opportunity to move with market pricing more aggressively, we do that. So there's certain markets and certain highly occupied communities that are attracting a higher street rate, higher move-in rate. So that's definitely part of the plan. Now having said that, we have a lot of occupancy upside, and that's the big opportunity for us is to continue to play into the demand drive volume. Balance it so that we're getting the best out of just total revenue growth and then drive NOI. I mean it's a year-over-year stat. So I think you'll probably see a little bit of movement within the metric. But what we're expecting to see is growth in street rates, growth in move-in rents and growth in occupancy."

            "content": "Thank you, BJ. On behalf of all of my colleagues, I want to welcome our shareholders and other participants to the Ventas First Quarter 2024 earnings call. Today, I'll discuss our good start to the year, describe the actions we are taking to execute on our strategy and create value for our stakeholders, and share our improved outlook for 2024 as the multiyear growth opportunity in senior housing build.\n As a reminder, our 3-pronged Ventas strategy is composed of, first, deliver organic growth in our senior housing portfolio; second, capture value through investments focused on senior housing; and third, drive cash flow throughout our portfolio.\n We entered this year with momentum, and in Q1, our enterprise delivered $0.78 of normalized FFO per share and over $2 billion in annualized NOI. Our strong results came from nearly 7% same-store property NOI growth led by SHOP at over 15%. Notably, demand-driven occupancy gains in our SHOP portfolio are accelerating, fueled by favorable supply-demand fundamentals in our markets and the actions we've taken in concert with our care providers. Move-ins across the portfolio were elevated as we gained 240 basis points of occupancy in our same-store SHOP portfolio year-over-year.\n As the second largest owner of senior housing, we are benefiting from the multiyear senior housing growth opportunity that continues to gain traction from both demand-led occupancy and RevPOR growth. Accelerating demand for our senior housing community underscores the valuable benefits they provide to residents and their families. The over 80 population is expected to grow by 5 million individuals through 2030, yet new construction starts in senior housing are the lowest in over a decade, as is the percentage of inventory under construction.\n In our SHOP portfolio, 99% of Ventas' communities are free from competing construction starts. All of these trends combine to support a highly favorable long-term runway for growth in the biggest part of Ventas' business, senior housing. We also want to expand our footprint in senior housing by capturing value-creating investments in the space. \n On this second prong of our strategy, we are making good progress. Year-to-date, we have closed or placed under contract about $350 million of investments that meet our targets of going in yield, expected unlevered IRRs, occupancy growth potential, affordability and pricing below replacement cost.\n Over my career, it has been rare to see such a compelling investment environment where we can acquire attractive assets in favorable markets at high going-in yields and high growth. Due to market conditions, our efforts and our team's relationship, our pipeline of investment opportunities continues to grow, and we expect to make further progress on our investment plan in the balance of the year.\n Across Ventas, we are also focused on the third element of our strategy, driving cash flow throughout our portfolio. In addition to SHOP, which is now generating over $800 million in annualized NOI, there are two other areas I'd like to cover: Kindred and our outpatient medical and research business. First, respecting the Kindred lease for 23 LTAC, representing approximately 5% of our NOI. The trailing rent coverage remained stable and Kindred has projected improving revenue and expense performance trends for 2024. We continue to have active decisions with Kindred and other parties to optimize Ventas enterprise value and NOI from our property, following the April 2025 lease maturity.\n We and Kindred recently agreed to a 1-month extension for the lease renewal notice date to the end of May. We know you are keenly interested in hearing the outcome of our discussion and we look forward to providing you with more information as soon as we can. \n Our competitively advantaged outpatient medical and research business continues to shine and benefit from strong institutional demand. And it's delivering complementary compounding contributions to our enterprise. As a leader in senior housing, this portfolio is aligned around serving a large and growing aging population. Ventas is advantaged across commercial real estate because demand for our assets is strong and getting stronger.\n The Ventas team is focused on the opportunity for value creation right in front of us. On that point, we are pleased to improve our outlook for the full year. We are raising Ventas' 2024 normalized FFO guidance to between $3.10 and $3.18 per share, and increasing our full year 2024 total company same-store cash NOI guidance to 7% at the midpoint.\n And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Justin. Happy to talk to you about it. I mean, look, we're engaged in active discussions with Kindred and others. And we're really working to get to the right outcome. And so we believe that, that was really in the best interest of everyone to get to a good outcome, which we define as kind of optimizing Ventas value and NOI. I mean you're right on the -- Kindred has initiatives underway to improve both revenue and expense performance, and we are seeing sequential improvement, but the heat map, of course, is a trailing look. And so that's really how you ought to think about it. So you hit the nail on the head. Yes. So I think that, we're in these active discussions with Kindred and others, and we're really focused on getting the right outcome for Ventas for the enterprise and also for the properties. \n And I would be -- we're working very hard to get to that kind of outcome. And so I'd be less focused on the notice date and just more focused on the work that we're doing, we have a great team working on it. We've been working on it for a while. This is very similar to what happened last time, and we're on it to get a resolution that as soon as we can, and we look forward to telling you as soon as we can. Right. If -- it's interesting to see that well-respected players like Ensign have now entered the LTAC space. It seems to be enjoying a bit of a moment and that's positive. I would say that there would be a transition kind of on day 1, if there were other tenants for some or all of the properties. So that's the way to think about it. I there's no downtime. It's not like outpatient medical or anything. There's a direct operational transfer if that were to occur. Tayo, thanks for asking that. Brookdale is about 7% of our NOI. And you're right, the coverage has been improving, and it's at about 1.3x on a trailing basis. And again, the trends in those markets also support a lot of intermediate-term occupancy increases. And so there are lots of positive outcomes for Ventas as we think about that, which is as you mentioned, at the end of 2025. It's both. And I sort of take the macro and then I defer to Justin on all of the kind of OI-driven actions and initiatives to deliver outsized performance within a demand-driven macro. Yes. I mean, we're -- again, we're executing on the strategy. The driver of organic growth is obviously driving the bus. We're going to -- as the second largest owner of senior housing with the platform that we have and access to capital, we're layering on external growth focused on senior housing that part of the portfolio is definitely going to grow. And we're committed to taking advantage of this multiyear opportunity and the kind of returns that we're seeing in the market for good assets at high yields with high growth potential, we are going to find a way to make those acquisitions and make senior housing a larger part of our overall portfolio. I mean it's already over half with job at 40% and growing. And I think you're going to see those trends continue. Definitely. And we are, too. Bob? Yes. And it would be near-term accretion. Well, again, happy to give as many tealeaves and more as soon as we can. I would say that we are in active discussions with Kindred and others. It's more likely that Kindred would be part of a solution going forward. But we're continuing to keep working on every alternative so that we can reach the goal, which, again, is optimizing value for Ventas shareholders and the NOI from these properties. So we're very focused, and we're very on it. The A is for and. Right. I would say that there are -- there is a large percentage of those loans that have some difficulty in refinancing without additional equity contributions. The assets are good, the markets can be good, the growth can be good. But because LTVs are lower, and as you say, rates are higher and the NOIs, many of them have not recovered to pre-COVID levels or they were newly constructed assets that really were delivered in COVID and therefore, aren't meeting their original pro formas. There's really good upside, but the refinancing mass doesn't necessarily work without significant paydowns.\n And so those owners, which again, I think, is a significant percentage of the $19 billion either have to decide if they want to reach in their pocket and put more equity in or if they can sell them for a reasonable value and just move on whether that's really where they want to go. And that's really part of that opportunity. But as Justin said, there are many other market forces that are pushing sellers to market and that are creating the overall pipeline opportunity that we're seeing. Yes. Great. Great. I want to thank all my colleagues and also all of our shareholders, analysts and other participants today. We very much appreciate your attention and your interest in Ventas and look forward to seeing you soon."
