This call is being recorded. Your lines will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live for the presentation. Please standby.  At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Piepszak. Ms. Piepszak, please go ahead.\nJennifer Piepszak: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. The presentation as always is available on our website and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back. It\u2019s slightly longer this quarter, given we are not having Investor Day, and so after I review our results, I will spend some time on our outlook for 2021 as well as touch on a few important balance sheet topics that are top of mind for us. So starting on page one for the fourth quarter. The firm reported net income of $12.1 billion, EPS of $3.79 on revenue of $13.2 billion, and delivered a return on tangible common equity of 24%. Included in these results are approximately $3 billion of credit reserve releases. Before we get into more detail on our performance, I will just touch on a few highlights. First off, our customers and clients continue to demonstrate strong financial resilience in the face of an unprecedented pandemic as evidenced in our credit metrics thus far. We saw continued momentum in investment banking and grew our share to 9.2%. In CIB markets, revenue was up 20% year-on-year, driven by strong client activity and elevated volatility in the quarter. And in AWM, we had record revenue of 10% year-on-year. On deposits, we saw another quarter of strong growth, up 35% year-on-year and 6%, sequentially as Fed balance sheet expansion continues to increase the overall amount of cash in the system, while loan growth remained muted up 1% both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. On to page two for more on our fourth quarter results. Revenue of $30.2 billion was up $1 billion or 3% year-on-year. Net interest income was down approximately $900 million or 7%, primarily driven by lower rates and mix partly offset by balance sheet growth and higher market NII. Non-interest revenue was up $1.9 billion or 13% on higher IB fees, legacy investment gains in corporate, and higher production revenue in home lending. Expenses of $16 billion were down 2% year-on-year on lower volume and revenue related expenses, partially offset by continued investments. Credit costs were a net benefit of $1.9 billion, down $3.3 billion year-on-year, primarily driven by reserve releases of $2.9 billion that I will cover in more detail shortly. Turning to the full year results on page three. The firm reported net income of $29.1 billion, EPS of $8.88 on record revenue of nearly $123 billion and delivered a return on tangible common equity of 14%. Revenue was up $4.5 billion or 4% year-on-year as net interest income was down $2.8 billion or 5% on lower rates, partly offset by higher markets NII and balance sheet growth, and non-interest revenue was up $7.3 billion or 12% on higher markets and IB fees, as well as higher production revenue in home lending. Expenses of $66.7 billion were up 2% year-on-year driven by volume and revenue-related expenses, higher legal and continued investments, partially offset by lower structural expenses. And credit costs were $17.5 billion, reflecting a net reserve bill of $12.2 billion due to the impacts of COVID-19 and net charge offs that were down year-on-year. Now turning to reserves on page four. We released approximately $3 billion of reserves this quarter across Wholesale and Home Lending. Starting with Wholesale, we released $2 billion due to improving macroeconomic scenarios and the continued ability of our clients to access capital markets and liquidity. In Home Lending, we released $900 million primarily on improvement in HPI expectations and to a lesser extent to portfolio run-off. And in Card, we held reserves flat as we remain cautious about the near-term, especially with the number of unemployed still nearly two times pre-pandemic levels and potential payment shock coming to consumers from expiring benefits. And so, with the near-term outlook still quite uncertain, we remain heavily weighted to our downside scenarios, and at nearly $31 billion we are reserved at approximately $9 billion above the current base case. And to touch on net charge-offs for the quarter, they were down about $450 million year-on-year and remain relatively low across our portfolios. Looking forward, we still don\u2019t expect any meaningful increases in charge-offs until the second half of 2021; and with the recent stimulus, it could be even later. Turning to page five. We have included here an update on our customer assistance programs and you can see the trends are largely similar to last quarter and further evidence of the resilience of our customers. The vast majority of what\u2019s left in deferral is in mortgage with $10 billion of own loans and $13 billion in our service portfolio. And in terms of what we are seeing from our customers that have exited relief, more than 90% of accounts remain current. Turning to balance sheet and capital on page six. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.1%, flat versus the prior quarter on strong earnings generation largely offset by dividends of $2.8 billion and higher RWA. As we stated in our press release last month, the Board has authorized share repurchases and we plan to resume buybacks in the first quarter up to our Fed authorized capacity of $4.5 billion after paying our $0.90 dividend. You can see here on the page, we\u2019ve have included the liquidity coverage ratio for both the firm and the bank, which we believe is important to look at together in order to better understand the liquidity profile of our balance sheets. The firm is at a healthy LCR of 110%; however, the bank LCR is 160% reflecting the extraordinary deposit growth that has meaningfully outpaced loan demand. Now let\u2019s go to our businesses, starting with Consumer & Community Banking on page seven. In the fourth quarter, CCB reported net income of $4.3 billion and an ROE of 32%. Revenue of $12.7 billion was down 8% year-on-year, reflecting deposit margin compression and lower Card NII on lower balances, largely offset by strong deposit growth and higher Home Lending production revenue. Deposit growth was 30% year-on-year, up over $200 billion as balances remain elevated and as we continue to acquire new customers and deepen primary relationships. Loans were down 6% year-on-year with Home Lending down due to portfolio run-off and Card down on lower spend offset by Business Banking, which was up due to PPP loans. Client investment assets were up 17% year-on-year driven by both net inflows and market performance. On spend, combined debit and credit card sales volume in the quarter was up 1% year-on-year, which reflected debit sales up 12%, largely driven by retail and everyday spend, and credit sales down 4% largely driven by T&E. In Home lending, overall production margins remained strong. Total originations were down 2% year-on-year but were up 12% quarter-on-quarter both driven by correspondent as we lean into the channel after pulling back earlier in the year. For the year, total originations were $114 billion, including nearly $73 billion of consumer originations, both the highest since 2013. In auto, loan and lease origination volume was $11 billion up 29% year-on-year. And across the franchise, digital engagement continues to accelerate. Our customers use credit deposit for more than 40% of all check deposits, which is nearly 10 percentage points higher than a year ago. And in Home Lending nearly two-thirds of our consumer applications were completed digitally using Chase My Home and that has tripled since the first quarter. Over 69% -- overall, 69% of our customers are digitally active with Business Banking at 86%, both higher than a year ago. Expenses of $7 billion were down 1% year-on-year and credit cards for a net benefit of $83 million driven by $900 million of reserve releases in Home Lending largely offset by net charge offs in Cards of $767 million. Now turning to the Corporate & Investment Bank on page eight. CIB reported net income of $5.3 billion and an ROI of 26% on revenue of $11.4 billion for the fourth quarter and an ROI of 20% on revenue of $49 billion for the full year. The extraordinary nature of this year has meant that we had records in almost every category for both the quarter and the full year. In Investment Banking, IB fees were up 25% for the year and we grew share to its highest level in a decade. For the quarter, Investment Banking revenue of $2.5 billion was up 37% year-on-year and up 20% sequentially. The quarter\u2019s performance was driven by the continued momentum in the equity issuance market, as well as strong performances in DECM and M&A. In advisory we were up 19% year-on-year driven by the closing of several large transactions. The M&A market continued to strengthen this quarter and in fact announced volumes exceeded pre-COVID levels. Debt underwriting fees were up 23% year-on-year, driven by leveraged finance activity and we maintained our number one rank overall. In equity underwriting fees were up at 8% year-on-year, primarily driven by our strong performance and follow ups in IPOs. Looking forward, we expect IB fees to be up modestly for the first quarter and the overall pipeline remains robust. We expect M&A to remain active on improves overall CEO confidence and the momentum in equity capital markets is expected to continue, of course dependent on a successful containment COVID. Moving to markets, total revenue was $5.9 billion, up 20% year-on-year against a record fourth quarter last year. Fixed income was up 15% year-on-year, driven by good client activity across businesses, particularly in spread products, as well as a favorable trading environment in currencies and emerging markets, credit and commodities. Equities was up 32% year-on-year, driven by strong client activity and equity derivatives and cash throughout the quarter across both flow trading and March episodic transactions. Looking forward, we expect markets to remain active in the first quarter and we have seen strong performance since the start of January, but it\u2019s obviously too early to predict the full quarter. And for the remaining quarters of this year and the full year, the comparisons will be particularly challenging given the extraordinary performance of markets in 2020. Wholesale payments revenue of $1.4 billion was down 4% year-on-year, primarily reflecting the reporting reclassification in merchant services and security services revenue of $1.1 billion was down 1% year-on-year. On a full year basis, the headwinds from lower rates were almost entirely offset by robust deposit growth. Expenses of $4.9 billion were down 9% compared to the prior year, driven by lower compensation and legal expenses. Now let\u2019s go to Commercial Banking on page nine. Commercial Banking reported net income of $2 billion and an ROI of 36%. Revenue of $2.5 billion was up 7% year-on-year with higher lending and investment banking revenue, partially offset by lower deposit revenue. Records gross Investment Banking revenue of $971 million was up 53% year-on-year. And the full year was also record finishing at $3.3 billion surpassing our previously established $3 billion long-term target and given our investments in bank recovery, we believe there\u2019s continued upside from here. Expenses of $950 million were flat year-on-year. Deposits of $277 billion were up 52% year-on-year and 11% quarter-on-quarter as client balances remain elevated. Average loans were up 1% year-on-year, but down 3% sequentially. C&I loans were down 4% on lower revolver balances, with utilization rates nearing record lows as clients continued to access capital markets for liquidity and CRE loans were down 1% on higher prepayment activity in both CTL and Real Estate Banking. Finally, credit cards were a net benefit of $1.2 billion driven by reserve releases. Now on to Asset & Wealth Management on page 10. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $786 million with pretax margin and ROI of 29%. And for the year, AWM generated record net income of $3 billion with pretax margin and ROI of 28%. For the quarter, revenue of $3.9 billion was up 10% year-on-year, as higher performance and management fees, as well as growth and deposit and loan balances were partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $2.8 billion were 13% year-on-year, primarily due to higher legal expenses related to the resolution of matters previously announced. But excluding this, expenses would have been up 4% year-on-year on volume and revenue related expenses. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $33 billion positive across all channels, asset classes and regions and this was true of the $92 billion for the full year as well. In liquidity, we saw net outflows of $36 billion for the quarter and net inflows of $104 billion for the full year. AUM of $2.7 trillion and overall client assets of $3.7 trillion, up 17% and 18% year-on-year, respectively, was driven by net inflows into both liquidity and long-term products, as well as higher market levels. And finally, deposits were up 31% year-on-year and loans were up 15%, as clients continue to increase their liquidity in both for investment opportunities. Now on the Corporate on page 11. Corporate reported net loss of $358 million. Revenue was a loss of approximately $250 million relatively flat year-on-year. Net interest income was down $730 million on lower rates, including the impact of faster prepaid on mortgage securities, as well as limited deployment opportunities on the back of continued deposit growth. Declines in net interest income were largely offset by net gains this quarter of approximately $540 million on several legacy equity investments. And expensive of $361 million were roughly flat year-on-year as well. Now shifting gears, I will turn to our outlook for 2021, which I will cover over the next few pages, starting with NII on page 12. As you can see on the page, we expect NII to be around $55.5 billion in 2021 and this is based on the latest insights, which reflects the steepening yield curve we have seen over the past few weeks. You can see that we do expect to be able to more than offset the impacts of low rates in 2021 from continued deposit growth and higher markets NII. But it\u2019s important to note that it takes a loan growth to truly realize the benefits of a steeper yield curve. I will also just remind you that the increase in CIB markets NII is largely offset in NIR and this component is highly market dependent. And so as it relates to loan growth, while there should be some opportunities in AWM and Wholesale, we expect headwinds at least in the near-term as Corporate cash balances are at all time high, Card payment rates are elevated and there continues to be significant prepayments in Home Lending. But we do expect these to normalize and see loan growth pick up in the second half of the year, particularly in Cards. Therefore, our fourth quarter 2021 NII estimate of $14 billion or more is a reasonable exit rate. And notably, that\u2019s in the zip code of our Q4 \u201819 NII, when rates were significantly higher than they are today. We have also included on the right side of the page some risks and opportunities, and obviously this isn\u2019t an exhaustive list, but are the drivers that could be most impactful to this year\u2019s NII outlook. Now turning to expenses on page 13. As Jamie mentioned last month, we do expect our expenses to increase in 2021 and based on our latest work, we expect that number to be around $68 billion, up versus the prior guidance of $67 billion, largely due to higher volume and revenue related expenses and the impact of FX, both of which have offsets on the revenue line, as well as the impact of expenses from our recent acquisition of cxLoyalty. Then taking a look at the year-over-year expense growth, you can see it\u2019s primarily due to investments, which I will cover in more detail on the next page. Our volume and revenue related expenses are up slightly with some puts and takes there. That\u2019s obviously market dependent, but remember any changes there do come with corresponding changes to our topline. And in structural, we expect a net reduction of approximately $200 million. Notably, this includes a decrease of $500 million, reflecting the realization of continued cost efficiencies in what is largely our fixed cost base. And you can see that it is partially offset by the impact of FX on our non-U.S. dollar expenses. It\u2019s important to note that while structural is coming down, it doesn\u2019t represent the full extent of our productivity, we are realizing efficiencies in each category here. For example, our software engineers are becoming more productive and we are reducing our cost to serve as we see more customers use our digital tools to self serve. Moving to page 14 to take a closer look at our investment spend. Over the past two years, our investment spend has been around $10 billion and we expect that to increase to nearly $12.5 billion in 2021. You can see that we have highlighted on the page the major areas of focus that we have been consistently investing in for years, which has continued to strengthen our franchise and drive revenue growth. Starting on the bottom with technology, this represents roughly half of the overall investment spend and these tech investments are across the Board, as we look to better meet our customer and client needs, improve our customer\u2019s digital experience, strengthen our fraud detection capabilities, as well as modernize and improve our technology infrastructure, cloud and data capabilities. Moving to non-tech investments, we expect marketing spend largely CCB to return to pre-COVID levels this year after being down in 2020. We continue to invest in our distribution capabilities across all of our businesses. This includes hiring bankers and advisors not only in the U.S., but also internationally, as well as expanding our physical footprint. We have been continuing to execute against our branch expansion plans in new markets having opened 170 branches so far out of our plan 400 and expect to be in all contiguous 48 states by mid-2021, Jamie is clapping. And the other bucket on the page is a catch all for everything else, including real estate and other various investments across our businesses. These expenses were fairly stable the past two years and the increase in 2021 is largely related to our $30 billion commitment to the Path Forward, which includes promoting affordable housing, expanding homeownership for underserved communities and supporting minority owned businesses, and then as well as expenses related to our acquisition of cxLoyalty. So, in summary, you can see that we continue to invest through the cycles and it\u2019s these investments that we believe position us well to outperform on a relative basis regardless of the environment. Now I will turn to a few balance sheet and capital related topics, starting on page 15. Over the next few slides, I\u2019d like to provide you some insight on how recent monetary expansion and corresponding growth in the financial system is creating new challenges for bank balance sheets. More specifically, this expansion is putting significant pressure on size based capital requirements, which is likely to impact business decisions, including capital targets. We will start with what has happened this year. In response to the COVID crisis, the Fed\u2019s balance sheet has significantly expanded, which has resulted in $3 trillion of domestic deposit growth across the U.S. commercial banks. What\u2019s important to note is that this QE is unlike anything you have seen before. In the current QE, we have experienced a much bigger and faster expansion, and that expansion has come without meaningful loan demand beyond PPP, as you can see in the loan to deposit ratio on the page. This has resulted in bank balance sheets which are larger but more liquid and less risky. From a bank capital perspective, the key question to ask is how long will this persist? On the chart, you can see that the QE 3 unwind kept the Fed on pause for several years before a modest pace to reductions. So even if the Fed immediately signaled tapering, which of course is not the base case and follows the base case of the last unwind, it will take many years to return to pre-COVID levels. Of course, the unwind speed has risen, but I think we can all agree that bank balance sheets will remain elevated for some time. Now let\u2019s go to page 16 and see how this will impact capital going forward. Two factors that are top of mind for us are GSIB, which we have been talking about for a long time and also SLR, which is not something we typically talk about, but given the overall system expansion now in focus. On the graph, what you can see here are the historical trends of GSIB and SLR base requirements overlaid with the task of the Fed securities holdings. You can see that during the original calibration of these rules, which included significant gold plating, the Fed\u2019s balance sheet was notably lower. With the recent growth in the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, we are seeing upward pressure and increases to GSIB requirements, as well as the SLR shifting from a backstop to a binding measures, which will impact the pace of capital return and these dynamics will likely persist for an extended period. The Fed temporary relief of SLR expires after March 31t. This adjustment for cash and treasury should either be made permanent or at a minimum be extended. With these exclusions, you can see how these remains a backstop measure not a binding one. Then on GSIB, there has been public dialogue about the need to index the score to GDP as a proxy to account for ordinary economic expansion over time and this was also cited by the Fed as a possible shortcoming of their framework. For 2020, GDP is clearly not the best proxy for system expansion, but the principle still applies. GSIB was designed as a relative measure between large and medium-sized banks, and therefore, it should certainly reflect an overall system expansion, which impacted small, medium and large banks alike. By future proofing GSIB and inception with the adjustments outlined on the page, you can see the resulting GSIB score profile, lower over time, but more importantly, flatter over the course of the most recent system expansion. While we recognize that prudent bank capital requirements to promote safety and soundness, satisfying these heightened requirements is certainly not costless which is why these two areas, GSIB and leverage are top of mind for us in 2021. Now let\u2019s look at the impact of this on marginal deposits on page 17. In addition to what we have already discussed, there are two more building blocks required to see the full picture of marginal deposit economics, and they are interest rates and loan demand. We have experienced a combination of both lower interest rates and lower loan demand, which have reduced the NIM of marginal deposits to practically zero, which you can see here on the chart, and this is an issue for all banks, not just GSIBs or JPMorgan. However, what is specific to the larger banks that when the SLR becomes binding, we may be required to issue debt and retain higher equity, which ultimately makes the marginal deposit a negative ROI proposition in today\u2019s ultra-low rate environment. The key question is, what could happen next. We could simply shy away from taking new deposits, redirecting them elsewhere in the system or we can issue or retain additional capital and pass on some of that cost, which is certainly something we wouldn\u2019t want to do in this environment. And therefore, we strongly encourage a serious look at these size-based capital calibrations with an appropriate sense of urgency, as we will soon be facing this critical business decision. All of this can be addressed through a few simple adjustments, namely an extension of the SLR exclusions and the GSIB fixes we have spoken about over time. But to be clear, we believe the framework as a whole has made the banking system safer as we experienced in 2020. But we are also seeing evidence where the lack of coherence and recalibration is risking unintended consequences going forward. With all that said, Before I close things out on capital, here\u2019s how we are thinking about target CET1 levels. While GSIB pressure remains and the need for recalibration is high, our SCB optimization can provide some offset allowing us to manage to 12% CET1 target. The recent stress test showed an implied 20-basis-point reduction to SCB and we have continued our optimization efforts since the resubmission. So we are hopeful for lower SCB later this year, of course that\u2019s scenario dependent. At this point, it\u2019s too early to provide specific color on the impact of SLR. So it\u2019s just important to note that in the absence of any adjustments to the measures, we may have to issue preferred or carry additional CET1 over the 12% target I just mentioned. We obviously can\u2019t emphasize these key messages enough and these factors are clearly front and center as we think about managing our balance sheet and capital targets in the near- and medium-term. Now before we conclude, know that we have included a few additional slides on our businesses in the appendix to give you an update on their strategic highlights and performance, as well as provide the latest financial outlook. The themes and initiatives we talked about at last year\u2019s Investor Day still remain our focus, and we continue to execute and make progress against them. So to wrap up, 2020 was an incredibly challenging year. But it also showcased the benefits of our diversification and scale, and the resulting earnings power of our company, while our employees relentlessly focused on supporting our customers, clients and communities. While downside risks do remain in the near-term and they could be significant, several recent factors help us feel more optimistic as we look ahead to the recovery in the medium and longer term. So with that, Operator, please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: Hi. Good morning, Jamie. Good morning, Jen and Happy New Year.\nJennifer Piepszak: Happy New Year, Steve.\nJamie Dimon: Thank you.\nSteven Chubak: So I want to start off with a question on the NII outlook. The 2021 guide implies rather healthy step up versus the $54 billion, Jamie, that you had reiterated just last month. And your updated NII guide for \u201821, what are you assuming regarding the deployment of excess liquidity given some of the recent curve steepening? And separately, what are your assumptions around the trajectory for Card balances and overall growth in \u201821, especially in light of the expectations for additional stimulus, which we saw at least this past year could drive further consumer deleveraging?\nJennifer Piepszak: Sure. So, I will start with excess liquidity. So I think there the theme is we are being opportunistic but patient. So, as you think about the recent moves that we have seen in the yield curve, in the grand scheme of things, those could be small moves, and as we think about managing the balance sheet, it\u2019s not just about NII, of course it\u2019s about capital. And so, there is risk in adding duration at these levels in a further sell off. So we are being very patient. But we have been and we will continue to be optimistic, and you will have seen that we did add $60 billion to the portfolio in the fourth quarter, so that\u2019s what we are assuming in the outlook is a very balanced view on deploying the excess liquidity. And then\u2026\nJamie Dimon: In the implied terms.\nJennifer Piepszak: Yeah. In the implied terms. Yeah. And then on card balances, it is quite extraordinary what we are seeing in terms of payment rates in the card portfolio, which of course is very healthy as consumers use this opportunity to deleverage, so there is an offset in the -- on the credit line, but we are expecting that to normalize in the back half of 2021 as spend recovers, but it is certainly a risk for us if they remain elevated. So that\u2019s why everything listed on that page is a plus/minus because everything could be an opportunity and a risk.\nSteven Chubak: Okay. Fair enough. And just for my follow up, I wanted to ask on capital, both the slides are really interesting highlighting the impact of QE on the leverage ratio and G-SIB scores. You have been critical of G-SIB surcharges and the need to recalibrate these coefficients for some time. We haven\u2019t really seen much progress there. It kind of feels like waiting for the [indiscernible]. I think the Fed is slow to recalibrate the minimum leverage ratios to account for this QE-driven deposit growth. What mitigating actions can you take to ensure you are not capital constrained as balance sheet growth continues? And maybe any revenue attrition we need to contemplate as part of those mitigating actions?\nJennifer Piepszak: Sure. So I will start with G-SIB, if we take that in turn. So starting with G-SIB, as I said, we do think that we have opportunity in the SCB. Of course, that\u2019s scenario dependent and based on the Fed models, but we do think we have opportunity there based on the work that we have been doing. It will be very difficult for us to get back to 3.5% with the current expansion. So, we are expecting to remain in the 4% bucket. But as you know, that\u2019s not effective until early 2023, so that gives us time to manage SCB, as I mentioned, as an offset. On the leverage issues, we have -- we can cure this through issuing preferreds, but we haven\u2019t made that decision yet, as I said, because it is a critical decision for us to think about. And as you think about capital return, it would depend on where our stock price is as we think about the economic value of issuing preferred to buy back stocks. So there\u2019s a lot for us to think about over the next couple of months.\nJamie Dimon: Because you said the G- SIB fees, it\u2019s very important. If we were on the international standard, our G- SIB fee would be 2%, not 4%. And we have been talking about they were supposed to adjust G-SIB before the growth of the economy and effectively the shrinking size of the banking system. Because the banking system itself is getting smaller as mortgages go to non-banks and private credit goes elsewhere, and the rest of the international, Chinese banks are growing, et cetera. So these adjustments should be made. We pointed out there is $1.3 trillion of liquid assets and marketable securities on our balance sheet which shockingly reached G-SIFI 2. G-SIFI has no risk weighted measurements to it, no diversification to it, no profitability to it. It just kind of these very gross measures, and it needs to be recalibrated and same with SLR. I mean, so do we expect it to happen? Probably not in our lifetimes, because we have politicized bank, detailed bank numbers and so on, and we can live with it for now. But in the long run, it\u2019s not good for America and had been that much of a disadvantage to our competitors overseas.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities.\nJennifer Piepszak: Hi, Jim.\nJim Mitchell: Sorry. Sorry. Hi. Sorry, I was on mute for a second there. Maybe just talking about loan growth? You saw a pretty nice improvement in the Wholesale side. You talked about some opportunities in \u201821. It seems to be mostly coming out of the CIB. Is that sort of acquisition finance? What\u2019s driving some of the improvement on the Wholesale side?\nJennifer Piepszak: Yeah. I would say acquisition financing is the opportunity on the Wholesale side. When we -- there may be some opportunity in the back half of 2021 in C&I. That feels like it\u2019s returning to BAU, but I think that\u2019s going to take some time. But as I said, we are at historic levels of cash on corporate balance sheets, and so outside of acquisition financing and C&I, it will be challenging C&I in the back half of 2021.\nJim Mitchell: Okay. Fair enough. And then maybe on your expense assumptions for the $68 billion, you don\u2019t really mention at all any of the CIB. You would think that if we are, as everyone assumes, we had a record year in 2020, 2021, maybe markets and IB fees are lower. Is there any kind of -- are you building in some lower comps -- revenue based compensation expense in that $68 billion or is that potential a positive?\nJennifer Piepszak: So we capture that in the volume and revenue related, Jim. It just happens to be more than offset by volume and revenue related growth elsewhere.\nJamie Dimon: I just point out the $68 billion. We don\u2019t make commitments or promises, so that $68 billion, I would love to find $2 billion more of investments, literally. I mean, we are seeking every year find more to do to help clients around the world and stuff like that. So that\u2019s kind of our current forecast. And fortunately, we found some more to do, including cxLoyalty and opening more branches and some of the technology we are building, et cetera. But I\u2019d like to find more. It would be the best and possible highest use of our capital.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research.\nJennifer Piepszak: Hi, John.\nJohn McDonald: Hi, Jen. Given the outlook for net interest income and expenses, it seems like the efficiency ratio is going to pick up a few 100 basis points this year in \u201821 versus \u201820. And I know you don\u2019t manage it necessarily year-to-year, but just kind of overtime you seem to have a mid 50s efficiency target. Just kind of wondering how you put guard rails up for yourself in terms of expense discipline in managing over time to have positive operating leverage and an efficiency corridor?\nJennifer Piepszak: Sure. So I will start by saying you are absolutely right that we don\u2019t manage the efficiency ratio in any quarter or even any year and but operating leverage is very important to us. And then, we gave last year at Investor Day at about a 55% efficiency ratio. I will say in a normalized environment, we haven\u2019t had anything that structurally has changed and so that should still be achievable for us in a normalized rate environment and otherwise normalized environment. And then as it relates to expense discipline, it is a bottoms up process. And so everywhere around this company, we are looking to get more efficient and holding people accountable to do just that, which is why I call out on the slide that structural is basically everything that is an investment or volume and revenue related, isn\u2019t necessarily a representation of all of our expense efficiencies. So the discipline is everywhere and it\u2019s the way we run the company, and we do believe in the importance of operating leverage through time, no doubt.\nJohn McDonald: Okay. And then as a follow up, on the NII walk, you have got a $1 billion incremental NII expected in \u201821 versus \u201820 from markets -- CIB markets. Can that be true if markets revenues is down year-over-year? Can they both be true? Just maybe explain that?\nJennifer Piepszak: Yes. It can absolutely be true. So markets is, I mean, in most of our businesses, we don\u2019t run them NII versus non-interest revenue. It is an accounting construct. But markets is particularly true. So, yes, that is possible. In NII, the markets business, you can think about is liability sensitive. So you are going to see the benefit of lower rates in NII that doesn\u2019t necessarily imply anything about the overall performance.\nJamie Dimon: We have positive carry, the trading profit goes down and the carry goes up, the number -- absolute numbers are same.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America.\nJennifer Piepszak: Hi, Erika.\nErika Najarian: Hi. Hi. Good morning. My first question is on the outlook for Card losses. The 2.17% net charge-off rate was certainly eye opening relative to what\u2019s happened in 2020. And the discussions actually that I have been having with investors on the trajectory of Card is, do you think that the bridge that the government built is strong enough that we may not see a spike in losses in Cards like we are all expecting, and Jen, given your comments earlier, what would you need to see to feel more comfortable about releasing reserves from your Card portfolio?\nJennifer Piepszak: Sure. So it\u2019s interesting that you brought up the bridge being strong enough. It does feel like at this point in this crisis, that the bridge has been strong enough. The question that still remains is, is the bridge long enough. And so, while we just had recent stimulus pass, that makes us feel better about the bridge being long enough. But we have to get through the next three months to six months. So it feels like we have been saying that, since this crisis started, but I think it is particularly true at this point, obviously, given the vaccine rollout. So, consumer confidence is still low relative to pre-COVID levels. You can converse that with -- compare that to the Wholesale side, we are seeing confidence is up. That\u2019s not true on the consumer side. And so the next three months to six months is going to be critically important for us to assess whether or not only is it strong enough, but is it long enough and do you see consumer sentiment pick up a bit. There\u2019s also possibility for payment shops as some relief programs, whether it be student loan, forbearance or tax -- taxes owed on benefits received. There are things that could hit a consumer in the next three months to six months that we need to think about.\nJamie Dimon: Right. I would just add, very different for subprime and prime. And if you look at our portfolio, it\u2019s mostly prime. And the folks in the prime category have a lot more income, a lot more savings, housing prices are up. They did not lose their jobs. So the news there is actually rather good. On the lower quartiles it\u2019s the opposite. Even now when we just did all the stimulus checks and we did about $12 million of them, which have already been processed.\nJennifer Piepszak: $12 billion.\nJamie Dimon: $12 million. $12 billion, $12 million for 12 Billion approximately and there\u2019s the bottom. But the folks who had $1,000 in their accounts, where the accounts are coming down and they just got $1,000, they obviously needed. The folks in the higher end, they obviously don\u2019t need quite as much. So it\u2019s positive -- we expected to go up, but it\u2019s possible somehow that doesn\u2019t happen in some dramatic way.\nErika Najarian: Got it. And Jamie, my second question is for you.\nJamie Dimon: I\u2019d say, we are making this point very important.\nErika Najarian: Yes.\nJamie Dimon: We do not consider taking down reserves recurring or low income. We don\u2019t do show across. We don\u2019t consider a profit. It\u2019s ink on paper. It\u2019s based upon lots of different calculations. Obviously, we want real loss to be lower over time. But just if you Card reserves like $17 billion, we took it down next quarter, because we have more optimistic outlooks, we are not going to be sitting here cheering about that, but we are cheering they are much [ph] doing better. But we don\u2019t want to consider that in earnings. I think you all should look at a little bit differently now, particularly with the change in accounting rules.\nErika Najarian: Yeah. I think your investors appreciate that. And the second question I had for you, Jamie is, in last -- on last year\u2019s Investor Day, it was clear to your investor base that you were looking to inorganically enhance your scale in AWM. And what interesting is that, the discussion that I have been having with your investors more recently is them wondering whether or not you would consider a larger deal maybe in payments, given that a lot of investors and banks are thinking that that\u2019s the part that seems to be potentially more vulnerable to technology competitors? What are your thoughts there, and I guess, my own thought process has been tempered by Jennifer\u2019s presentation on capital, but we wanted to get your thoughts there?\nJamie Dimon: Again, we have -- I mean, our capital [inaudible], okay. We have so much capital we cannot use it. If you look at what happened this year, our capital went from 12.4% to 13.3%. And by I think advanced is more representative of real risks it will be 13.8%. That\u2019s after doing $2 trillion of loans, $12 trillion of reserves, $12 trillion -- $12 billion of reserved, $12 billion of dividend. I mean, we are earning, if you look at pretax -- pre-provision $45 billion or $50 billion a year. So we are in very good shape to invest. The most important thing we said to management, we says that we grow that every business organically, every single one opening branches and accounts, doing payments, and we put a lot of time and effort in payments. We are quite good at it between credit card, debit card, Chase merchant services. But I agree with you and but we are open for inorganic too. Inorganic shouldn\u2019t be an excuse not for growing organically and it\u2019s not just Chase, it\u2019s not just asset management, it will be any area where we could do that, I don\u2019t think cxLoyalty was neat thing, [inaudible] was neat thing, we bought 55 IP, which is a special way to manage money, tax efficiently. And so we are going to build it ourselves or buy it. We are open minded. Anyone you have good ideas for us, let us know. We have the wherewithal, but we thought we will also look at buying it. Like I said, we are always looking for a way to invest more of our money intelligently. We have got a tremendous set of assets. We also have a tremendous debt of competitors, particularly in payments, consumer land now and a bunch of other areas. So you saw Google Pay. You saw Wal-mart is going to try to spend a bit more time is expanding. And we like competition, we believe in it. But we have to be really prepared for that and that is deeply on our mind and how we run our business.\nOperator: Your next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nJennifer Piepszak: Hi, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. Good morning. Jamie a question on cxLoyalty, because I thought your loyalty program and capability set there in your payment space and your consumer facing space was quite good. So I am just wondering what the rationale was and is there an expectation that you are going to be leveraging that into non-Card portions of your business, was that part of the so what was this deal?\nJennifer Piepszak: So, Betsy, I will take that one. So this -- we are really excited about this one and really with any tech platform scale matters. So combining our scale with cxLoyalty\u2019s innovative technology will be a win not only for our Chase customers but for cxLoyalty\u2019s existing clients and suppliers. And then you are right to point out our existing UR platform, but that today is predominantly used as a point production portal. So there\u2019s a huge opportunity to capture a greater share of our customer spend on travel, which is $140 billion both on and off us. So in addition to capturing the full economic value of the existing redemptions on the platform, we also have an opportunity to really turn it into a great place for our customers to book travel.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. But still focused on the Card space as opposed to moving into other parts of your relationship with consumers?\nJamie Dimon: It\u2019s consumer, this thing was consumer.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay.\nJennifer Piepszak: Has no [inaudible]. It has to be Card only. Yeah\u2026\nJamie Dimon: Jen, mentioned the number, like more than 30% of travel expense goes through our Cards, something like that. And so we want to give a far better experience to our own customers when it comes to what we offer them to travel. You are right, ultimate reward always does a good job. But why would you try to double that overtime or triple it?\nJennifer Piepszak: And we think we can do a better job for their existing clients and suppliers. So it won\u2019t just be about Chase customers.\nJamie Dimon: Exactly.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. And then the follow up question just on the technology budget increasing, I mean, I know this comes after a year of being somewhat stable year-on-year. And just wanted to dig into the comment you made on the page around data analytics, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence capabilities. Again, you have been a leader in this for a while. So the question is what -- where\u2019s the whitespace that you are moving into? And can you give us a sense as to how important this is for some of the expansion that you are doing geographically in U.K. digital and some of the European footprint that you are expanding into?\nJamie Dimon: So, first of all, cyber we are going to do -- we have to do whatever it takes and we are going to do that in everything we do. But you mentioned, we built a brand new data centers pretty much around the world, which are a lot more efficient. They are going to be effectively not cloud base, but they have all the cloud, technology, et cetera, for our own private cloud. When we move other stuff to the public cloud, we are refactoring applications to get there, where we are doing all the data, you all know the issue with data, not that banks were bad, but data was held in all these different accounts, you are trying to build these data links, you can use AI and machine learning better and it all do haste. The cloud is real. The cost is real. The speed is real. The security is real. The AI is real. The machine learning is real. So every single business and with every single meeting we go through is talking about what are we moving to the cloud, whether it\u2019s internal or external? What are we adding AI machinery on? Are we getting the data analytics right and it is global. It\u2019s -- and we don\u2019t spend that much time on it. But every single business is doing it. You have a tremendous amount of AI being used in asset wealth management, CIB, in trading, in Commercial Banking prospecting and it\u2019s literally the tip of the iceberg. Whatever we say today, 10 years from now, it will be probably 50 times more than we are doing today. And I would spend anything to get it done faster.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.\nJennifer Piepszak: Hi, Ken.\nKen Usdin: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. A question on capital return and capital usage, in the deck and in your press release, you mentioned that you are looking to get back into more return of capital, you mentioned $4.5 billion net and there\u2019s still the net income test. And I just wanted to ask you to kind of walk us through how you think about full usage of that $4.5 billion and then how do you think forward vis-\u00e0-vis the comments we just talked about with regards to potential external opportunities and what\u2019s the best use of that incremental capital, given that you still have a healthy amount sitting there?\nJennifer Piepszak: Sure. So we always start in the same place, which is we would much prefer to do the things that Jamie\u2019s been talking about when to buy back our stocks. So we would much prefer to deploy it to organic growth or acquisitions. Having said that, we do as you point out have significant excess capital at this point. When we look at the first quarter, the Fed capacity was defined by the trailing four quarters of profits and so when you back out our dividend, that\u2019s where you get to the $4.5 billion. So that is the capacity that we have for this quarter and we will do up to that amount, obviously, I don\u2019t know that we will do the full amount, but we will certainly do, obviously, can\u2019t do more than $4.5 billion. And then we are certainly hopeful that we can go back to the EU under the SCB framework beyond the first quarter as we think about buybacks. But we will wait to see what the Fed says at the end of the first quarter.\nKen Usdin: Okay. Great. Thanks.\nJamie Dimon: If you can manage your capital down to the 12% or whatever we said, with that regards have been getting permission from the Fed. They have already implied that\u2019s what they can do. That\u2019s the way it should be done eventually one day.\nKen Usdin: Yeah. Understood.\nJamie Dimon: Another way to point out is that, we have been consistent in 2 times tangible book, but our earnings power and dividend and all stuff like that, it still makes sense to buy back stock. But that diminishes every point, 2.1 or 2.2, or 2.3, we would much rather use our capital to grow organically or inorganically.\nJennifer Piepszak: Yeah. I mean, we will always look at the effective return of us buying back our stock for our remaining shareholders and if we think it makes sense relative to the alternative we are going to keep doing it.\nKen Usdin: Yeah. Consistent with what you have said in the past. Thanks. And just a question on the Card business, you mentioned how much of that spend goes through Chase and just you are -- given that we still have some uncertainties with regards to a true return to open. Yeah, your Card segment revenue yield actually did improve a little bit. I am just wondering if you can kind of help us, just think through, just the pushes and pulls you see on the Card business with regards to your expectations of spend improving, balances improving and competition underneath? Thanks.\nJennifer Piepszak: Yeah. So competition remains very, very strong. As it relates to the revenue yield, it\u2019s a little bit of noise there, because balances are down so much and that\u2019s what that\u2019s derived from. So there\u2019s a little bit of noise there. Importantly, we do, if GDP is back to 2019 levels by the middle of the year, we expect them to continue to recover, and perhaps, significantly, so in the second half. As it relates to travel, whether it\u2019s the second half of \u201821 or \u201822, we are confident that our customers will continue to travel and there\u2019s pent-up demand on shore for travel and so we are excited about those opportunities, whether they come in \u201821 or \u201822 or beyond,\nJamie Dimon: We take very seriously the new entrance like the Goldman Sachs Card and there are a bunch of other folks who are doing similar things that we expect to see more of that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.\nJennifer Piepszak: Hi, Glenn.\nGlenn Schorr: Hello, there. Thank you. So I think it\u2019s good time of the year to get your mark-to-market on, your thoughts on the competitive landscape and I know every business is competitive. But I am more curious on the new side of competitive and maybe I am talking more about the Consumer & Commercial Banking right now. But between all the neo banks that either want to pay much more than you guys on deposits or charge no fees, or the pay -- buy now pay later models, or things where you also even play in banking-as-a-service in trying to provide banking products to big technology companies with big client footprints. I am most curious to see, is this just normal evolution and not changing things or is there something bigger going on here that you want to comment on? Thanks.\nJamie Dimon: Yeah. So I am going to -- in the Commercial Bank it is probably less than you think. I do think there are alternative credit providers. But we will just do a lot of things for our clients, they can quit investment banking, FX swaps, cash management custody, asset management, et cetera. So it\u2019s slightly different. I got a consumer saw me and we wrote in the Chairman\u2019s letter years ago that Silicon Valley is coming. And I think it\u2019s just more and faster and better and quicker. And we have to just be very conscious that includes pay now, pay later and we have some of the products ourselves, but our job is to make sure we use our unbelievable strength and client base and capability and Gordon always points out, when you have that kind of products that goes to keep it simple, clear, basic, what the customer wants, to just to deliver more and better and so we are quite conscious. And I would also add, by the way, it\u2019s not just that, we have -- the team looks at and financial and early pay and all these other competitors. I expect one day, you can see other big foreign banks back here again, including the big Chinese banks, the biggest ones were bigger than us. And I am -- that may be five years or 10 years out, but we better be thinking five years or 10 years out. And so they are all coming, we were comfortable, but we are still exercising and taking our vitamins, okay?\nJennifer Piepszak: And it\u2019s another reason our investments are going up as much, yeah, because we are very well aware of it.\nGlenn Schorr: Fair enough. Keep taking those vitamins. Maybe along the same lines, I think, you spoke -- spoken about the power that the data of your own client footprints and franchises have. I am just curious, we haven\u2019t heard that much lately about what you are collecting, how you can use it, how you can use it to enhance the customer experience accelerate growth. You have all this at your fingertips and people talk about data as being the new golden. I am curious on how you are thinking about it right now?\nJamie Dimon: Yes, yes and yes. That\u2019s all we are going to tell you. I mean, I have talked about how important AI is, obviously, the data in that. AI is data directly related and some of it gets used very well. But if you shut down, some of it doesn\u2019t get used well. We have restrictions, far more restrictions than some of our Silicon Valley competitors. But still there are ways to use our data to do a better job for our clients. And we do a tremendous amount already in marketing, risk, fraud, cyber, you name it. And we use a lot of that -- like a lot of that stuff also protects our clients in cyber.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.\nMike Mayo: Hi. I will ask my question and go back in the queue. Just, I guess, I miss your Investor Day. We have four slides to talk about that. I guess, if your capital cup run us over, maybe your expense budget could run us over too. I mean, spending is certain, returns are uncertain. So seems like there\u2019s more questions this year than in the past. You did get positive off the leverage last year during the pandemic. So, yes, you have earned the right to go ahead and spend more. I think most people would agree. But there\u2019s still just so many questions, so I will just ask on CCB. It looks like slide 16. You mentioned going to all 48 states by mid-2021. I didn\u2019t really get all of that. So what -- how many states have you been in and by the time you get to 48, how much spending is that? What\u2019s the game plan? What\u2019s your plan with branches? Others are shutting branches after the pandemic, you are expanding. If you could just give some color on that or if Gordon\u2019s on the call, we can hear from him too?\nJamie Dimon: Gordon\u2019s not, but so we have -- we started this a while back to expand the branches and stuff like that. We are still -- we are closing plenty of branches. So if you look at what we are doing, we got the number of leads, we have closed like 1,000 the last four years or five years and we have opened like 1,000 or something like that. But -- and I think we did the Bank One JPMorgan deal, we were in 21 states, 23 states. And when we started the expansion originally, the -- we were very conscious that the world needs less branches and the shape of the branches differently and you made hub and spoke and we are always testing new things and stuff like that. But we still have almost a million people today who visit branches and it\u2019s down, but it\u2019s a million people a day, I have got the number, 60% to 70% accounts still open in branches, small businesses still need branches. And the new branches that we opened in Boston, Philadelphia, D.C., they have been doing quite well. And the shocking thing is doing quite well in Card, consumer, investments, small business. So as we go to the all the other states, we just want to be and we know we have to have certain size, not going in each state with one just to plant the flag. That would be kind of waste of time. We look at the major markets, number of people already know us through Chase and stuff like that. And so we are optimistic that the strategy will pay off and it will enhance our businesses and our capabilities and other things, I am not going to tell you because it\u2019s very competitive. I think we have shared too much with our competitors in the past. So I am going to kind of shut myself up a little bit.\nJennifer Piepszak: No. But, Mike, I can just add a little bit of color on the numbers. So we had said that we were going to open up 400 new branches in market expansion. So we have done 170 So far. Importantly, in 2020, we did fewer than 90, and in 2021 we are going to do 150. And so, of course, we -- by 2022 or 2023, that\u2019s going to start to sunset. So there are in the numbers multiyear investments that will -- they are ramping maybe in \u201821, but they will ramp down now that obviously gives us capacity to reinvest those dollars. But we have a lot of capacity within the numbers you see on the page to continue to increase investments without necessarily the absolute number going up. In tech as an example, 10% or 20% of that number in any given year is completed. So that gives us more dollars to reinvest. And then the only thing I\u2019d add on branches is this like the franchise value that comes with opening up these branches in new states is extraordinary and I think underestimated, because it give us the ability to do state and municipal business that we wouldn\u2019t have otherwise been able to do. So it\u2019s not just about consumer banking.\nJamie Dimon: Yeah. And it gives me a chance to North Dakota, which is the only state I have never been in. But believe it or not, we already do a lot of middle market, credit card more in North Dakota. We just didn\u2019t do Consumer Banking. So I do the second where I am allowed, I am on my way to like Bismarck or Fargo or something like. Okay, we have just the new Head of Investor Relations, who is sitting in this room right now, Reggie Chambers, who I am sure you will get to know. This was part of what he did for Sun Belt, which is the all branch expansion, though we don\u2019t really restrict them how much you can tell you. But -- and including looking at different formats. We are not blind to the nature that you have the world changing and digital all that. So we can very quickly, just so, I have got the number change the fleet, like if you said, you have got the world changing more rapidly, we are completely comfortable that in a five-year period, you can dramatically reduce the size of the fleet or the cost of the fleet, et cetera, while serving clients.\nMike Mayo: Okay. So this is kind of like what you did with Commercial Bank few years back going to every state, I guess, but 48 states, where were you, say, a year ago or three years ago, just to give final context to that.\nJamie Dimon: 48 states three years ago. I mean, by the way, Commercial Bank, same thing. We talked about expansion. So we bought WaMu, it took years, but we said we are going to do $1 billion in the WaMu states, which is mostly California, Florida, Atlanta. So we got -- what we are very close to hitting that. I thought governor was like $908 million this year or something like that. I told the teams we reviewed it yesterday that when we hit $1 billion, I want to send a case of really expensive why we are, like, why the guy called Steve Walker, who did it for us and have great. And we told him, right, like great bankers, great capabilities, stuff like that. We were doing $400 million of Investment Banking business when we did the Bank One deal JPMorgan through the Commercial Bank. We set a target of $1 billion and $2 billion and $3 billion, we exceeded $3 billion. I think we did $3.5 billion. The new target is $4 billion. It\u2019s now 25% to 30% of domestic U.S. Investment Banking, which DCM, ECM, M&A through that network and the Investment Bank -- the Commercial Bank expanded into healthcare, technology and we have a couple other areas we are going to be rolling out soon. So these expansions really makes sense. They pay for themselves. They are relentless. They are hard to do. They are obviously right?\nMike Mayo: Okay. I will read to you.\nJamie Dimon: And remember the Commercial Bank deal in these branches. It\u2019s very hard to judge and we have done it. But it\u2019s very hard to build the quality business without a retail branches when you are a Commercial Bank. But you will see very few Commercial Banks that don\u2019t have retail branches.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.\nJennifer Piepszak: Hi, Brian.\nBrian Kleinhanzl: Hey. Good morning. Just a quick question on the expense outlook. I noticed there was a small piece in there related to the workforce optimization, but I guess thinking in the broader context, as we get through COVID-19 and move to the post-COVID-19 world, the general thought process was that there would be this big expense save opportunity coming from that, work-from-home environment. But it doesn\u2019t really show in your expense outlook. Is it something that you didn\u2019t expect to see beyond 2021? Is this a\u2026\nJennifer Piepszak: Yes.\nBrian Kleinhanzl: \u2026step down expenses.\nJamie Dimon: But in the big picture there are people expenses $33 billion, for real estate expenses, I am going to say $3 billion.\nJennifer Piepszak: Yeah.\nJamie Dimon: So, yeah, even -- and I do think it can be much more efficient than that, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s like a game changer.\nJennifer Piepszak: And we can\u2019t move our footprint that quickly anyway. So we do have time here to make sure that we do it really thoughtfully.\nJamie Dimon: But Jen is thinking about moving the finance function to Florida.\nJennifer Piepszak: Hawaii. Yes.\nJamie Dimon: Hawaii.\nJennifer Piepszak: Hawaii, that\u2019s right.\nBrian Kleinhanzl: And then just a follow up, but maybe on the international, I saw still the billion hopes of additional revenue on the international. Just give an update on how that\u2019s tracking so far?\nJennifer Piepszak: Sorry, I didn\u2019t catch that.\nJamie Dimon: The billion what?\nBrian Kleinhanzl: On the international revenue expansion that you were looking for?\nJamie Dimon: Okay. The -- firstly, Investment Bank is expanding globally everywhere as best we can and so as asset management and because we already spoke about China and stuff like that, the Commercial Banks started an international expansion effort to cover companies overseas that we do business with here that we are not covering and it\u2019s doing fine. It\u2019s mostly expense right now. We added bankers and products and services and legal and compliance and we didn\u2019t add -- we have been adding clients as we were quite happy with it. I should point out that we just had the best year ever in Asia. I mean, I think, it was up like 20% or something like that. So and Asia is still will be one of the fastest growing markets in the world. So our -- and that\u2019s kind of country-by-country to make sure we get that right.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.\nJennifer Piepszak: Hi, Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy: Hi, Jennifer. Hi, Jamie. Can you guys share with us, obviously, there\u2019s been a change in the administration in the Senate and a number of our regulatory body heads are going to be replaced this year, including the FCC and the Consumer Protection Bureau. Can you guys give us some color what you are thinking about what may change from a regulatory standpoint with the different political party controlling Washington now?\nJamie Dimon: Yeah. Our focus is always the same. We have got 60 million U.S. clients. We have got 6,000 investment clients around the world. We have got -- we run this company to serve clients, communities, hospitals. We financed $100 billion in states, cities, schools, hospitals each year. That\u2019s what we do. And obviously, we want to satisfy all of our regulators. So I do expect that, there will be a new set of regulators. We will have a new set of demands. Some we agree with. We want to do a better job in climate for the world. We want to be more green. We want to help the disadvantage. We rolled out an enormous amount of progress in racial equality and things like that. So, yeah, but they will be tougher. That\u2019s life. It\u2019s life around the world. We are going to -- we have to do a whole bunch of new regulators, which we are trying to satisfy in the ECB, et cetera. And so, it\u2019s -- I don\u2019t need to change our life that much and competitively, everyone\u2019s in the same kind of boat and so it will be fine. And we want the new president to be successful.\nGerard Cassidy: And then following up, Jennifer, you talked about on page 17 of your slide deck, the issue with deposits and the marginal benefit of these deposits and you guys are wrestling with this issue? Can you share with us, yeah, and you already have talked about the branch expansion in all 48 states could save you U.S. states? How is this going to be managed is best you can over the next 12 months to 24 months, because obviously, long-term you want that branch expansion, but simultaneously, as you have pointed out, you may be getting a negative ROI, if you don\u2019t get relief on the SLR? And is there a chance that you will get that extension on the SLR from the regulators?\nJennifer Piepszak: So I will start with, we certainly remain hopeful that we will get the extension. Importantly, as we think about branch expansion near-term rate headwinds, we certainly consider that, but at the margin there not a factor given the long-term franchise value associated with the branch expansion and the fact that it\u2019s not just about deposits for any one consumer anyway, because we have the opportunity to have a much broader relationship with them and all of that is factored into the branch expansion. But we do consider in the analytics there the near-term headwinds from rates. But there is a steady state number which is more of a normalized level of rates. So it doesn\u2019t -- at a margin it might change some decisions around marketing, but it doesn\u2019t have a big impact on us.\nJamie Dimon: Yeah. The bigger decisions on that which we have a lot of leeway on is out of the investment bank. It\u2019s repo, deposits, corporate clients, trade finance, all those other things. So the -- this is managed very, very closely. Remember GSIB uses one of, say, 20 constraints we managed by business, by product, by area, by region, by\u2026\nJennifer Piepszak: Yeah. And we bring it up, obviously, it is an issue for us in the near- to medium-term, should we not get the extension and it\u2019s one that\u2019s important for people to understand. But we bring it up more so because it should, another example of where lack of coherence around these rules can have an impact, not just on JPMorgan. So we don\u2019t bring it up just because of the impact on JPMorgan. We bring it up because it is perhaps one of the better examples of the need for recalibration. You have to have the right incentives in the system for it to work through time and we are just seeing that\u2019s not the case.\nJamie Dimon: Look we were able to reduce deposits $200 billion within like months last time.\nJennifer Piepszak: Yeah.\nJamie Dimon: So we don\u2019t want to do it, it\u2019s is very customer friendly and say, could you take your deposits elsewhere, but\u2026\nJennifer Piepszak: Right.\nJamie Dimon: They do have -- a lot of this larger corporate client who have other options and bunch of deposits, but money market funds or something like that. So we are mad. It is not -- none of this is going to be an issue for 2021, folks. I mean, fundamentally, it is just how we were a company and even if that temporary relief goes away. And I am always against temporary relief, because for this exact reason, it creates another cliff, even if it goes away we are fine, we just have to manage it much tighter.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nJennifer Piepszak: Hi Matt.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Hi. Maybe a bit of a basic question, but why is markets revenue are trading so good still, not just for you, but the overall wallet? I gather it to be investment banking business, the feeder businesses still very good, there\u2019s lots of liquidity, banks have lots of capital, but of course rates are near zero, budget tight, volatility is low. I will take away some of the answers. But just conceptually it\u2019s been very strong. It sounds like the hope is it will remain strong. What\u2019s really driving it?\nJamie Dimon: There is $350 billion of global financial assets, $50 trillion -- $350 trillion, and probably, in 10 years or 20 years that number is going to be $700 trillion. People have to buy and sell to hedge, finance, with money around the world, FX, currencies, our pension plans. Obviously, volumes go up and down. Spreads generally over time has been coming down, what you would expect in a competitive market. So with the expansion of the balance sheets of the central banks around the world that Jen showed you, the $3 trillion or $4 trillion in the Fed, but globally it is $12 trillion. And companies have a lot of financing to do. And of course, when you have higher DCM and higher ECM and higher M&A that also drives a lot of trading and so you got to kind of put that all in the mix.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: And obviously, the question is how sustainable is this, and I guess, one argument could be that technology has allowed banks to increase the velocity. You can talk about this for some time. Do you think that is a structural change that will benefit the businesses and specifically for you guys over a long-term time period?\nJamie Dimon: Yeah. The way we look is we kept our share of what things we are trying to find digitized and the business has done a kind of the way we expected them to do it. So, yeah, we think scale matters, technology matters, and hopefully, we think we can even grow our share. This is just trench warfare. So we expect to grow it, but we -- I don\u2019t -- it\u2019s a very hard to say, what the base level is and we thought that the base level kind of revise down sometime last year, but will stay as high as it stayed in 2020 then I doubt. It may not go back to what it was. It may be higher than that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Peabody with Portales.\nJennifer Piepszak: Hi Charles.\nCharles Peabody: Good morning. I have a couple of questions related to fintech and unfortunately I was born in a wrong generation, so I need a lot of help. How dependent is the fintech world on the banking system, as I understand they lay on top of the pipes in the plumbing of the banking system. Do you have any leverage in a competitive world against the fintech world? And then, secondly, I noticed that the OCC gave banks the green light to use public blockchain networks and stable points. Can you explain how -- what important that has to JPMorgan?\nJamie Dimon: Yeah. You go ahead with blockchain there.\nJennifer Piepszak: Okay. Sure. So that guidance enables an offering of stable going on a public blockchain. So that doesn\u2019t impact JPM point. JPM point, you should think about as the tokenization of our customer deposits. So it\u2019s obviously very early. We will assess use cases and customers demand. But it\u2019s still too early to see where this goes for us.\nJamie Dimon: And we are using blockchain for sharing data with banks already and so we are at the forefront of that which is good. The other question was about fintech. Look first of all, they are very good competitors. I pointed out to a lot of people, PayPal were $250 million, Squares were done in $20 million, Stripe is worth $80 billion, Ant Financial is down quite a bit now. But they are there. They are strong. They are smart, some effectively ride the rails. So we bank a lot of them. We help them accomplish what they want to accomplish and you have. So my view is we are going to compete, we will need to and we have to look at our -- look inside about what we could do better or could have done better and things like that. So I am confident we will be able to compete. But I think we now are facing old generation of newer, tougher, faster competitors who -- and if they don\u2019t buy the rails of JPMorgan, they can buy rails of someone else. So you see, I have told you before, everyone is going to be involved in payments. Some banks going to white label, which makes which makes fintech competitors white label the bank and build every sort of thing on top of it and we have to be prepared for that. I expect it to be very, very tough competition in the next 10 years. I expect to win. So help me God.\nCharles Peabody: Thanks. So did they need the banking system to complete their loop of service or can they work completely outside the bank?\nJamie Dimon: Well, the most will do for now, but I think it\u2019s a mistake because it\u2019s going to be forever. The game of bank licenses, Utah is giving industrial licenses. Like I said, banks are white labeling. So it\u2019s effectively the same thing. If a fintech companies uses a white label bank just to process their business, they are basically a bank. When -- what the regulator will do, I don\u2019t know, but we have to assume that they are going to do it. And that some don\u2019t need, will find ways, not to use their banking system, which they have done. I mean, if you look at a whole bunch of the things they have used stuff around the banking system, which is fine, I am not against that. The regulators may have a point of view about that one day, but I am less worried about that. I am going to worry about us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lim with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\nJennifer Piepszak: Hi Andrew.\nAndrew Lim: Hi. Hi. Good morning. And so\u2026\nJamie Dimon: Look, Charles, one other point, if our examples unfair competition, which we will do something about eventually. People who we will make a lot more on debit, because they activate under certain things, the only reason they compete is because of that. People basically don\u2019t do KYC AML and create risk for the system. And I can go on and on, but that part we will be a little bit more aggressive on, people who improperly use data has been given to them by client, okay? So you can expect that there will be other battle to take place here.\nAndrew Lim: Hi. Sorry. It\u2019s Andrew Lim here. So I just wanted to pick your brains on inflation and hopefully inflation metrics are picking up. If we look at rates, if you look at the inflation indicators and that\u2019s like a lot of people are jumping on this replacement bandwagon. But I just wanted to see what you are seeing on the ground in a real world as to how this might be manifesting itself even in Commercial Banking or in Investment Banking in terms of like the month, products or volatility. Is that something that you see as a theme developing?\nJamie Dimon: I mean, look, we don\u2019t have that much more insight than you do. You do see signs witnessing in commodities and certain products and consumer goods and stuff like that. It\u2019s hard to tell that supply lines that can\u2019t keep up with demand or you have long-term trends, China is no longer ending the world. That can change inflation. I think and we looked at when Jen gave those numbers, she always using implied curve. I think the best way to think about it is, I think this should be a much bigger conversation next year because we have good growth. I think we have good growth and part inflation, but that will become part of conversation, how bad, what I am going to do and things like that. Just so the risk management thing, you got to build into your mindset that you have got to look at there has been a possibility. So I think a year ago, people have said, not possible before COVID and now because the world has done $12 trillion of QE and something like $10 trillion to $12 trillion of fiscal stimulus, you have got to put on that thing a scenario where you have higher inflation and not 2%. That would be great. It is like Goldilocks. But like 3%, 4%. Just so you understand what the risk is that and how we manage through that. It is not the worst thing in the world by the way. The worst in the world is no growth.\nAndrew Lim: Great. Okay. And for my follow-up question, you talked about how you resolved the issue of excess deposits by pricing way about $200 billion of those. So I am just wondering why you don\u2019t do that now or is the quantum of the problem that much bigger?\nJamie Dimon: We don\u2019t have that all, Jen.\nJennifer Piepszak: Yes. We don\u2019t have to. It\u2019s also -- it is slightly different in the sense that there was capacity in the system then to absorb it. This is an issue for everyone. So that could be a challenge. We can\u2019t make them go away.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. Just a couple of quick follow-ups, one, Jamie, on the topic of payments and competition, Libra\u2019s -- Facebook\u2019s Libra is back out there getting rebranded as Diem and their goal is basically to be global payment network or at least to create one. I am wondering does the OCC stable coin approval do anything for you. You already have JPM coin obviously that\u2019s internal to your own footprint? But I am wondering is there any benefit of the OCC stable coin approval, is there anything with regard to Libra competition that\u2019s coming that would drive changes that you are making in your own platforms?\nJamie Dimon: I don\u2019t think so. But -- I don\u2019t think so. We expect stable\u2026\nBetsy Graseck: Okay.\nJamie Dimon: And obviously there is this talk about several banks having digital currencies and stuff like that, right? Their currency is digital when we move around the world. It\u2019s in central banks where it will move by electrons and stuff like that both. So I do expect that stuff is coming and it may not change our world that much. But some of the competitors we want to do, they want to be in payments. They want the payments data. They want to move the money. Again, it\u2019s going to be a regulatory issue about what that means and\u2026\nBetsy Graseck: And then if I make sure\u2026\nJamie Dimon: Although, it is not unfair. That\u2019s the only thing I can point. So as long as the competition -- as always we can do it safely and competition can do then it\u2019s hard to argue this -- that\u2019s unfair.\nJennifer Piepszak: And Betsy, I mentioned earlier, you might have missed it, but it does not impact JPM coin, JPM coin is different. You should think about that as tokenizing deposits to make payments easier for client.\nBetsy Graseck: Right. Yeah. No.\nJamie Dimon: Yeah.\nBetsy Graseck: Yeah. No. I totally get that. I was just thinking hey, if OCC is allowing stable coin maybe they are trying to help move the center of this back into the banking system. That was kind of question. The follow-up was just on back to slide 14 and the other purple area, were the non-technology expenses are moving up year-on-year and part of that is the $30 billion commitment to the path forward initiative. And Jamie, I wanted to understand, like, how you are thinking about that $30 billion? What kind of time frame is that over and where that money is going? I mean we put a note out as you know, this past quarter on housing and on housing inequality and wondering how you are thinking about how you are going to be investing that $30 billion in kind of output that you want from it?\nJamie Dimon: Right. So we believe that inequality is a real problem and people don\u2019t always know, but like, 40% of Americans make $15 an hour or less, which is $32,000 a year something like that. 50 million don\u2019t have employment and people at the lower end are dying quicker than they die before. So first time in our lifetimes, our grandparents lifetimes Americans mortality is getting worse, not better and society have to fix these problems. Now we need healthy growth, healthy growth I mean like, but you also need education, infrastructure, healthcare and formerly the racial problem has been around for hundreds of years and with all the things that took place after even -- after the civil rights, we haven\u2019t made the progress we should have made. So we -- and fortunately, lot of other people and companies take this really seriously. How can we help all of American citizen in particular the black community who has been left behind for so long. So our effort is five years, the $30 billion includes, exact numbers we published $8 billion of mortgages to lower, middle income neighborhoods, black neighborhoods, primarily black neighborhoods it includes affordable housing, building affordable housing includes billions of dollars for entrepreneurs of color, it includes defense education. We recently went over a million secure card which is what we expected to do, because these are cards that have all the benefits of banking ATMs, online bill pay for $4.95 a month for lower paid individual who are doing more, more education. Of those 400 branches we are opening, 25% or more will be in LMI neighborhoods. We are financing MBI\u2019s and CBFI\u2019s. So it\u2019s a serious effort, it costs hundreds of millions dollar a year. There are hundreds of people work here. So we have a debt how many loan we are going to put in this neighborhood and how many loans we are going to put in that neighborhood. And we are going to report it that to you, we are not going to -- and we are doing work, we don\u2019t mind things not working, but it will change courses and stuff like that. And so and obviously it includes hiring more open black community training here and stuff like that. So I think these efforts in my own view is that the corporate world have to do this if you want to fix it. It\u2019s not going to happen. We need good government. It is not going to happen just with good government. The jobs at the local level. Unemployment sell branches 20% for \u201820 is still high. The kids didn\u2019t have computer to go home and do their Zooming and schools didn\u2019t have them. And unfortunately, a lot of planned appeasing including my wife send lot of computers to people there, but we have to do something about this. We are always so forth. And in my view we should do it for more purposes of loan that would be sufficient, but for commercial purposes do it. If all the parts American doing better, outcomes and more jobs and healthier people, less crying, less prisons, less drugs and so it\u2019s time to get our act together. And again, I think, business has to work in collaboration with government to do it. I just don\u2019t think it is going to happen alone. It is not going to happen just by yelling at people. The successful companies do not create the slums, but they can help fix them.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMike Mayo: Hi. Just following up more on the market expansion. In Commercial Banking, could you just drill down deeper on the international part of that expansion and what\u2019s left to be done in U.S.?\nJamie Dimon: I think I will answer U.S., but I think the U.S., again, we are not going to share so much information from now on. But it\u2019s the same thing we looked at all the major SMSAs with the middle market companies, we are doing deep dive in how many there are and I think we are now in 75 of the top 75 roughly. So that expansion is now just going deeper not maybe more at this point. They will be helped little bit by the retail expansion. I think overseas, I just don\u2019t the number of hand\u2026\nJennifer Piepszak: I don\u2019t know either.\nJamie Dimon: Okay. But you are talking about that will eventually cover and I could be dead wrong in this, 1,000 more clients overseas. These are headquarters or subsidiaries of foreign companies that we probably do business with headquarters subsidiaries in U.S. and we could share more of this with you later down the road.\nJennifer Piepszak: And I would just.\nJamie Dimon: I will tell Charlie, he can\u2019t imitate me on this one.\nJennifer Piepszak: Mike, I would just add just from an expense perspective. It is important to remember on the international front that we are riding existing rails that are already there in the CIB. So we can -- this is an extraordinary opportunity to hire bankers and we already have the infrastructure.\nJamie Dimon: And we usually jelly bank in the U.S. subsidiary\u2026\nJennifer Piepszak: That\u2019s right.\nJamie Dimon: Our U.S. headquarters.\nJennifer Piepszak: So it\u2019s not the list you might think from an expense perspective.\nMike Mayo: Okay. And then just a follow-up on the other questions that have been asked related to fintech. Jamie, you said, you are going to win, right. But based on valuations of the PayPal, Stripes and Visa, Mastercard anything that fintech related. I mean they trounce valuation of your stock. I think the market saying that others are going to win. So how is JPMorgan is going to -- I mean you said, Silicon Valley is coming what, that was like six years ago or something and then each year we say, yeah, we missed it, we missed it, we missed it, well, it\u2019s still?\nJamie Dimon: No. No. No. We never said we -- Mike, we never said we missed it. We have been doing fine over these five years. But we are just lucky. But I do agree with you, I gave that to the management team. My whole operating committee a little deck that show Visa 500 billion, Mastercard 350 billion, PayPal 220 billion, Ant Financial 600 billion, Tencent 800 billion, Alibaba trillion, Facebook, Google, Apple, Amazon, you go on and on. But absolutely, we should be scared chillers about that.\nMike Mayo: So how are you going to win, I mean, just what -- like what\u2026\nJamie Dimon: I am not going to tell you. But we have plenty of resources, a lot of very smart people. We just got to get quicker, better, faster and that\u2019s the -- which we do. We have got -- we have done an exceptional. If you look at what we have done, you would say, we have done a great job. But other people done a good job too. Some have monopolies virtually it is a whole different issue, but.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.\nJennifer Piepszak: Hi, Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Hi. Just one follow up. Obviously, Jennifer, you pointed out that your mortgage production revenue was quite healthy in the quarter and you have penetrated the correspondent champ. Can you guys share with us on the servicing side, with the new -- with the forbearance programs that the government has put into place, is that a positive or negative for servicing revenue as we go forward?\nJennifer Piepszak: Okay.\nJamie Dimon: Jen will have that one.\nJennifer Piepszak: Yes. Yeah. I don\u2019t we know exactly how to answer it, Gerard. All I can say is that, when we give customers the help that they need, if that\u2019s what the bridge them to the other side of this thing, for sure it is good. So I don\u2019t know precisely what the math is, but there\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s good if it helps get our customers to the other side. We service their mortgage.\nGerard Cassidy: In the past when loans go into delinquency obviously and there is -- in a mortgage-backed security, obviously, you guys have to advance the funds and stuff. But the deferral loans are not in that -- I am assuming they are not in that category, is that correct?\nJamie Dimon: Yeah. You are absolutely right.\nGerard Cassidy: Okay.\nJennifer Piepszak: Yeah.\nJamie Dimon: The cost of servicing the default of loan is like 10 times the Silicon service [ph] and non-deposit loans. So Jen is right. Although, we don\u2019t prudently default, there is probably a small benefit.\nGerard Cassidy: Okay. Okay.\nJennifer Piepszak: I got you. We are talking about advancing the servicing cost. Got it.\nJamie Dimon: That\u2019s not an issue either.\nJennifer Piepszak: Yeah. No.\nGerard Cassidy: Okay. Thank you.\nJennifer Piepszak: At this levels.\nGerard Cassidy: I appreciate it.\nJamie Dimon: Folks, thank you very much for spending time with us. We will speak to you all soon.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jennifer Piepszak",
            "content": "Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. The presentation as always is available on our website and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back. It's slightly longer this quarter, given we are not having Investor Day, and so after I review our results, I will spend some time on our outlook for 2021 as well as touch on a few important balance sheet topics that are top of mind for us. So starting on page one for the fourth quarter. The firm reported net income of $12.1 billion, EPS of $3.79 on revenue of $13.2 billion, and delivered a return on tangible common equity of 24%. Included in these results are approximately $3 billion of credit reserve releases. Before we get into more detail on our performance, I will just touch on a few highlights. First off, our customers and clients continue to demonstrate strong financial resilience in the face of an unprecedented pandemic as evidenced in our credit metrics thus far. We saw continued momentum in investment banking and grew our share to 9.2%. In CIB markets, revenue was up 20% year-on-year, driven by strong client activity and elevated volatility in the quarter. And in AWM, we had record revenue of 10% year-on-year. On deposits, we saw another quarter of strong growth, up 35% year-on-year and 6%, sequentially as Fed balance sheet expansion continues to increase the overall amount of cash in the system, while loan growth remained muted up 1% both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. On to page two for more on our fourth quarter results. Revenue of $30.2 billion was up $1 billion or 3% year-on-year. Net interest income was down approximately $900 million or 7%, primarily driven by lower rates and mix partly offset by balance sheet growth and higher market NII. Non-interest revenue was up $1.9 billion or 13% on higher IB fees, legacy investment gains in corporate, and higher production revenue in home lending. Expenses of $16 billion were down 2% year-on-year on lower volume and revenue related expenses, partially offset by continued investments. Credit costs were a net benefit of $1.9 billion, down $3.3 billion year-on-year, primarily driven by reserve releases of $2.9 billion that I will cover in more detail shortly. Turning to the full year results on page three. The firm reported net income of $29.1 billion, EPS of $8.88 on record revenue of nearly $123 billion and delivered a return on tangible common equity of 14%. Revenue was up $4.5 billion or 4% year-on-year as net interest income was down $2.8 billion or 5% on lower rates, partly offset by higher markets NII and balance sheet growth, and non-interest revenue was up $7.3 billion or 12% on higher markets and IB fees, as well as higher production revenue in home lending. Expenses of $66.7 billion were up 2% year-on-year driven by volume and revenue-related expenses, higher legal and continued investments, partially offset by lower structural expenses. And credit costs were $17.5 billion, reflecting a net reserve bill of $12.2 billion due to the impacts of COVID-19 and net charge offs that were down year-on-year. Now turning to reserves on page four. We released approximately $3 billion of reserves this quarter across Wholesale and Home Lending. Starting with Wholesale, we released $2 billion due to improving macroeconomic scenarios and the continued ability of our clients to access capital markets and liquidity. In Home Lending, we released $900 million primarily on improvement in HPI expectations and to a lesser extent to portfolio run-off. And in Card, we held reserves flat as we remain cautious about the near-term, especially with the number of unemployed still nearly two times pre-pandemic levels and potential payment shock coming to consumers from expiring benefits. And so, with the near-term outlook still quite uncertain, we remain heavily weighted to our downside scenarios, and at nearly $31 billion we are reserved at approximately $9 billion above the current base case. And to touch on net charge-offs for the quarter, they were down about $450 million year-on-year and remain relatively low across our portfolios. Looking forward, we still don't expect any meaningful increases in charge-offs until the second half of 2021; and with the recent stimulus, it could be even later. Turning to page five. We have included here an update on our customer assistance programs and you can see the trends are largely similar to last quarter and further evidence of the resilience of our customers. The vast majority of what's left in deferral is in mortgage with $10 billion of own loans and $13 billion in our service portfolio. And in terms of what we are seeing from our customers that have exited relief, more than 90% of accounts remain current. Turning to balance sheet and capital on page six. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.1%, flat versus the prior quarter on strong earnings generation largely offset by dividends of $2.8 billion and higher RWA. As we stated in our press release last month, the Board has authorized share repurchases and we plan to resume buybacks in the first quarter up to our Fed authorized capacity of $4.5 billion after paying our $0.90 dividend. You can see here on the page, we've have included the liquidity coverage ratio for both the firm and the bank, which we believe is important to look at together in order to better understand the liquidity profile of our balance sheets. The firm is at a healthy LCR of 110%; however, the bank LCR is 160% reflecting the extraordinary deposit growth that has meaningfully outpaced loan demand. Now let's go to our businesses, starting with Consumer & Community Banking on page seven. In the fourth quarter, CCB reported net income of $4.3 billion and an ROE of 32%. Revenue of $12.7 billion was down 8% year-on-year, reflecting deposit margin compression and lower Card NII on lower balances, largely offset by strong deposit growth and higher Home Lending production revenue. Deposit growth was 30% year-on-year, up over $200 billion as balances remain elevated and as we continue to acquire new customers and deepen primary relationships. Loans were down 6% year-on-year with Home Lending down due to portfolio run-off and Card down on lower spend offset by Business Banking, which was up due to PPP loans. Client investment assets were up 17% year-on-year driven by both net inflows and market performance. On spend, combined debit and credit card sales volume in the quarter was up 1% year-on-year, which reflected debit sales up 12%, largely driven by retail and everyday spend, and credit sales down 4% largely driven by T&E. In Home lending, overall production margins remained strong. Total originations were down 2% year-on-year but were up 12% quarter-on-quarter both driven by correspondent as we lean into the channel after pulling back earlier in the year. For the year, total originations were $114 billion, including nearly $73 billion of consumer originations, both the highest since 2013. In auto, loan and lease origination volume was $11 billion up 29% year-on-year. And across the franchise, digital engagement continues to accelerate. Our customers use credit deposit for more than 40% of all check deposits, which is nearly 10 percentage points higher than a year ago. And in Home Lending nearly two-thirds of our consumer applications were completed digitally using Chase My Home and that has tripled since the first quarter. Over 69% -- overall, 69% of our customers are digitally active with Business Banking at 86%, both higher than a year ago. Expenses of $7 billion were down 1% year-on-year and credit cards for a net benefit of $83 million driven by $900 million of reserve releases in Home Lending largely offset by net charge offs in Cards of $767 million. Now turning to the Corporate & Investment Bank on page eight. CIB reported net income of $5.3 billion and an ROI of 26% on revenue of $11.4 billion for the fourth quarter and an ROI of 20% on revenue of $49 billion for the full year. The extraordinary nature of this year has meant that we had records in almost every category for both the quarter and the full year. In Investment Banking, IB fees were up 25% for the year and we grew share to its highest level in a decade. For the quarter, Investment Banking revenue of $2.5 billion was up 37% year-on-year and up 20% sequentially. The quarter's performance was driven by the continued momentum in the equity issuance market, as well as strong performances in DECM and M&A. In advisory we were up 19% year-on-year driven by the closing of several large transactions. The M&A market continued to strengthen this quarter and in fact announced volumes exceeded pre-COVID levels. Debt underwriting fees were up 23% year-on-year, driven by leveraged finance activity and we maintained our number one rank overall. In equity underwriting fees were up at 8% year-on-year, primarily driven by our strong performance and follow ups in IPOs. Looking forward, we expect IB fees to be up modestly for the first quarter and the overall pipeline remains robust. We expect M&A to remain active on improves overall CEO confidence and the momentum in equity capital markets is expected to continue, of course dependent on a successful containment COVID. Moving to markets, total revenue was $5.9 billion, up 20% year-on-year against a record fourth quarter last year. Fixed income was up 15% year-on-year, driven by good client activity across businesses, particularly in spread products, as well as a favorable trading environment in currencies and emerging markets, credit and commodities. Equities was up 32% year-on-year, driven by strong client activity and equity derivatives and cash throughout the quarter across both flow trading and March episodic transactions. Looking forward, we expect markets to remain active in the first quarter and we have seen strong performance since the start of January, but it's obviously too early to predict the full quarter. And for the remaining quarters of this year and the full year, the comparisons will be particularly challenging given the extraordinary performance of markets in 2020. Wholesale payments revenue of $1.4 billion was down 4% year-on-year, primarily reflecting the reporting reclassification in merchant services and security services revenue of $1.1 billion was down 1% year-on-year. On a full year basis, the headwinds from lower rates were almost entirely offset by robust deposit growth. Expenses of $4.9 billion were down 9% compared to the prior year, driven by lower compensation and legal expenses. Now let's go to Commercial Banking on page nine. Commercial Banking reported net income of $2 billion and an ROI of 36%. Revenue of $2.5 billion was up 7% year-on-year with higher lending and investment banking revenue, partially offset by lower deposit revenue. Records gross Investment Banking revenue of $971 million was up 53% year-on-year. And the full year was also record finishing at $3.3 billion surpassing our previously established $3 billion long-term target and given our investments in bank recovery, we believe there's continued upside from here. Expenses of $950 million were flat year-on-year. Deposits of $277 billion were up 52% year-on-year and 11% quarter-on-quarter as client balances remain elevated. Average loans were up 1% year-on-year, but down 3% sequentially. C&I loans were down 4% on lower revolver balances, with utilization rates nearing record lows as clients continued to access capital markets for liquidity and CRE loans were down 1% on higher prepayment activity in both CTL and Real Estate Banking. Finally, credit cards were a net benefit of $1.2 billion driven by reserve releases. Now on to Asset & Wealth Management on page 10. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $786 million with pretax margin and ROI of 29%. And for the year, AWM generated record net income of $3 billion with pretax margin and ROI of 28%. For the quarter, revenue of $3.9 billion was up 10% year-on-year, as higher performance and management fees, as well as growth and deposit and loan balances were partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $2.8 billion were 13% year-on-year, primarily due to higher legal expenses related to the resolution of matters previously announced. But excluding this, expenses would have been up 4% year-on-year on volume and revenue related expenses. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $33 billion positive across all channels, asset classes and regions and this was true of the $92 billion for the full year as well. In liquidity, we saw net outflows of $36 billion for the quarter and net inflows of $104 billion for the full year. AUM of $2.7 trillion and overall client assets of $3.7 trillion, up 17% and 18% year-on-year, respectively, was driven by net inflows into both liquidity and long-term products, as well as higher market levels. And finally, deposits were up 31% year-on-year and loans were up 15%, as clients continue to increase their liquidity in both for investment opportunities. Now on the Corporate on page 11. Corporate reported net loss of $358 million. Revenue was a loss of approximately $250 million relatively flat year-on-year. Net interest income was down $730 million on lower rates, including the impact of faster prepaid on mortgage securities, as well as limited deployment opportunities on the back of continued deposit growth. Declines in net interest income were largely offset by net gains this quarter of approximately $540 million on several legacy equity investments. And expensive of $361 million were roughly flat year-on-year as well. Now shifting gears, I will turn to our outlook for 2021, which I will cover over the next few pages, starting with NII on page 12. As you can see on the page, we expect NII to be around $55.5 billion in 2021 and this is based on the latest insights, which reflects the steepening yield curve we have seen over the past few weeks. You can see that we do expect to be able to more than offset the impacts of low rates in 2021 from continued deposit growth and higher markets NII. But it's important to note that it takes a loan growth to truly realize the benefits of a steeper yield curve. I will also just remind you that the increase in CIB markets NII is largely offset in NIR and this component is highly market dependent. And so as it relates to loan growth, while there should be some opportunities in AWM and Wholesale, we expect headwinds at least in the near-term as Corporate cash balances are at all time high, Card payment rates are elevated and there continues to be significant prepayments in Home Lending. But we do expect these to normalize and see loan growth pick up in the second half of the year, particularly in Cards. Therefore, our fourth quarter 2021 NII estimate of $14 billion or more is a reasonable exit rate. And notably, that's in the zip code of our Q4 \u201819 NII, when rates were significantly higher than they are today. We have also included on the right side of the page some risks and opportunities, and obviously this isn't an exhaustive list, but are the drivers that could be most impactful to this year's NII outlook. Now turning to expenses on page 13. As Jamie mentioned last month, we do expect our expenses to increase in 2021 and based on our latest work, we expect that number to be around $68 billion, up versus the prior guidance of $67 billion, largely due to higher volume and revenue related expenses and the impact of FX, both of which have offsets on the revenue line, as well as the impact of expenses from our recent acquisition of cxLoyalty. Then taking a look at the year-over-year expense growth, you can see it's primarily due to investments, which I will cover in more detail on the next page. Our volume and revenue related expenses are up slightly with some puts and takes there. That's obviously market dependent, but remember any changes there do come with corresponding changes to our topline. And in structural, we expect a net reduction of approximately $200 million. Notably, this includes a decrease of $500 million, reflecting the realization of continued cost efficiencies in what is largely our fixed cost base. And you can see that it is partially offset by the impact of FX on our non-U.S. dollar expenses. It's important to note that while structural is coming down, it doesn't represent the full extent of our productivity, we are realizing efficiencies in each category here. For example, our software engineers are becoming more productive and we are reducing our cost to serve as we see more customers use our digital tools to self serve. Moving to page 14 to take a closer look at our investment spend. Over the past two years, our investment spend has been around $10 billion and we expect that to increase to nearly $12.5 billion in 2021. You can see that we have highlighted on the page the major areas of focus that we have been consistently investing in for years, which has continued to strengthen our franchise and drive revenue growth. Starting on the bottom with technology, this represents roughly half of the overall investment spend and these tech investments are across the Board, as we look to better meet our customer and client needs, improve our customer's digital experience, strengthen our fraud detection capabilities, as well as modernize and improve our technology infrastructure, cloud and data capabilities. Moving to non-tech investments, we expect marketing spend largely CCB to return to pre-COVID levels this year after being down in 2020. We continue to invest in our distribution capabilities across all of our businesses. This includes hiring bankers and advisors not only in the U.S., but also internationally, as well as expanding our physical footprint. We have been continuing to execute against our branch expansion plans in new markets having opened 170 branches so far out of our plan 400 and expect to be in all contiguous 48 states by mid-2021, Jamie is clapping. And the other bucket on the page is a catch all for everything else, including real estate and other various investments across our businesses. These expenses were fairly stable the past two years and the increase in 2021 is largely related to our $30 billion commitment to the Path Forward, which includes promoting affordable housing, expanding homeownership for underserved communities and supporting minority owned businesses, and then as well as expenses related to our acquisition of cxLoyalty. So, in summary, you can see that we continue to invest through the cycles and it's these investments that we believe position us well to outperform on a relative basis regardless of the environment. Now I will turn to a few balance sheet and capital related topics, starting on page 15. Over the next few slides, I'd like to provide you some insight on how recent monetary expansion and corresponding growth in the financial system is creating new challenges for bank balance sheets. More specifically, this expansion is putting significant pressure on size based capital requirements, which is likely to impact business decisions, including capital targets. We will start with what has happened this year. In response to the COVID crisis, the Fed's balance sheet has significantly expanded, which has resulted in $3 trillion of domestic deposit growth across the U.S. commercial banks. What's important to note is that this QE is unlike anything you have seen before. In the current QE, we have experienced a much bigger and faster expansion, and that expansion has come without meaningful loan demand beyond PPP, as you can see in the loan to deposit ratio on the page. This has resulted in bank balance sheets which are larger but more liquid and less risky. From a bank capital perspective, the key question to ask is how long will this persist? On the chart, you can see that the QE 3 unwind kept the Fed on pause for several years before a modest pace to reductions. So even if the Fed immediately signaled tapering, which of course is not the base case and follows the base case of the last unwind, it will take many years to return to pre-COVID levels. Of course, the unwind speed has risen, but I think we can all agree that bank balance sheets will remain elevated for some time. Now let's go to page 16 and see how this will impact capital going forward. Two factors that are top of mind for us are GSIB, which we have been talking about for a long time and also SLR, which is not something we typically talk about, but given the overall system expansion now in focus. On the graph, what you can see here are the historical trends of GSIB and SLR base requirements overlaid with the task of the Fed securities holdings. You can see that during the original calibration of these rules, which included significant gold plating, the Fed's balance sheet was notably lower. With the recent growth in the Fed's balance sheet, we are seeing upward pressure and increases to GSIB requirements, as well as the SLR shifting from a backstop to a binding measures, which will impact the pace of capital return and these dynamics will likely persist for an extended period. The Fed temporary relief of SLR expires after March 31t. This adjustment for cash and treasury should either be made permanent or at a minimum be extended. With these exclusions, you can see how these remains a backstop measure not a binding one. Then on GSIB, there has been public dialogue about the need to index the score to GDP as a proxy to account for ordinary economic expansion over time and this was also cited by the Fed as a possible shortcoming of their framework. For 2020, GDP is clearly not the best proxy for system expansion, but the principle still applies. GSIB was designed as a relative measure between large and medium-sized banks, and therefore, it should certainly reflect an overall system expansion, which impacted small, medium and large banks alike. By future proofing GSIB and inception with the adjustments outlined on the page, you can see the resulting GSIB score profile, lower over time, but more importantly, flatter over the course of the most recent system expansion. While we recognize that prudent bank capital requirements to promote safety and soundness, satisfying these heightened requirements is certainly not costless which is why these two areas, GSIB and leverage are top of mind for us in 2021. Now let's look at the impact of this on marginal deposits on page 17. In addition to what we have already discussed, there are two more building blocks required to see the full picture of marginal deposit economics, and they are interest rates and loan demand. We have experienced a combination of both lower interest rates and lower loan demand, which have reduced the NIM of marginal deposits to practically zero, which you can see here on the chart, and this is an issue for all banks, not just GSIBs or JPMorgan. However, what is specific to the larger banks that when the SLR becomes binding, we may be required to issue debt and retain higher equity, which ultimately makes the marginal deposit a negative ROI proposition in today's ultra-low rate environment. The key question is, what could happen next. We could simply shy away from taking new deposits, redirecting them elsewhere in the system or we can issue or retain additional capital and pass on some of that cost, which is certainly something we wouldn't want to do in this environment. And therefore, we strongly encourage a serious look at these size-based capital calibrations with an appropriate sense of urgency, as we will soon be facing this critical business decision. All of this can be addressed through a few simple adjustments, namely an extension of the SLR exclusions and the GSIB fixes we have spoken about over time. But to be clear, we believe the framework as a whole has made the banking system safer as we experienced in 2020. But we are also seeing evidence where the lack of coherence and recalibration is risking unintended consequences going forward. With all that said, Before I close things out on capital, here's how we are thinking about target CET1 levels. While GSIB pressure remains and the need for recalibration is high, our SCB optimization can provide some offset allowing us to manage to 12% CET1 target. The recent stress test showed an implied 20-basis-point reduction to SCB and we have continued our optimization efforts since the resubmission. So we are hopeful for lower SCB later this year, of course that's scenario dependent. At this point, it's too early to provide specific color on the impact of SLR. So it's just important to note that in the absence of any adjustments to the measures, we may have to issue preferred or carry additional CET1 over the 12% target I just mentioned. We obviously can't emphasize these key messages enough and these factors are clearly front and center as we think about managing our balance sheet and capital targets in the near- and medium-term. Now before we conclude, know that we have included a few additional slides on our businesses in the appendix to give you an update on their strategic highlights and performance, as well as provide the latest financial outlook. The themes and initiatives we talked about at last year's Investor Day still remain our focus, and we continue to execute and make progress against them. So to wrap up, 2020 was an incredibly challenging year. But it also showcased the benefits of our diversification and scale, and the resulting earnings power of our company, while our employees relentlessly focused on supporting our customers, clients and communities. While downside risks do remain in the near-term and they could be significant, several recent factors help us feel more optimistic as we look ahead to the recovery in the medium and longer term. So with that, Operator, please open the line for Q&A. Happy New Year, Steve. Sure. So, I will start with excess liquidity. So I think there the theme is we are being opportunistic but patient. So, as you think about the recent moves that we have seen in the yield curve, in the grand scheme of things, those could be small moves, and as we think about managing the balance sheet, it's not just about NII, of course it's about capital. And so, there is risk in adding duration at these levels in a further sell off. So we are being very patient. But we have been and we will continue to be optimistic, and you will have seen that we did add $60 billion to the portfolio in the fourth quarter, so that's what we are assuming in the outlook is a very balanced view on deploying the excess liquidity. And then... Yeah. In the implied terms. Yeah. And then on card balances, it is quite extraordinary what we are seeing in terms of payment rates in the card portfolio, which of course is very healthy as consumers use this opportunity to deleverage, so there is an offset in the -- on the credit line, but we are expecting that to normalize in the back half of 2021 as spend recovers, but it is certainly a risk for us if they remain elevated. So that's why everything listed on that page is a plus/minus because everything could be an opportunity and a risk. Sure. So I will start with G-SIB, if we take that in turn. So starting with G-SIB, as I said, we do think that we have opportunity in the SCB. Of course, that's scenario dependent and based on the Fed models, but we do think we have opportunity there based on the work that we have been doing. It will be very difficult for us to get back to 3.5% with the current expansion. So, we are expecting to remain in the 4% bucket. But as you know, that's not effective until early 2023, so that gives us time to manage SCB, as I mentioned, as an offset. On the leverage issues, we have -- we can cure this through issuing preferreds, but we haven't made that decision yet, as I said, because it is a critical decision for us to think about. And as you think about capital return, it would depend on where our stock price is as we think about the economic value of issuing preferred to buy back stocks. So there's a lot for us to think about over the next couple of months. Hi, Jim. Yeah. I would say acquisition financing is the opportunity on the Wholesale side. When we -- there may be some opportunity in the back half of 2021 in C&I. That feels like it's returning to BAU, but I think that's going to take some time. But as I said, we are at historic levels of cash on corporate balance sheets, and so outside of acquisition financing and C&I, it will be challenging C&I in the back half of 2021. So we capture that in the volume and revenue related, Jim. It just happens to be more than offset by volume and revenue related growth elsewhere. Hi, John. Sure. So I will start by saying you are absolutely right that we don't manage the efficiency ratio in any quarter or even any year and but operating leverage is very important to us. And then, we gave last year at Investor Day at about a 55% efficiency ratio. I will say in a normalized environment, we haven't had anything that structurally has changed and so that should still be achievable for us in a normalized rate environment and otherwise normalized environment. And then as it relates to expense discipline, it is a bottoms up process. And so everywhere around this company, we are looking to get more efficient and holding people accountable to do just that, which is why I call out on the slide that structural is basically everything that is an investment or volume and revenue related, isn't necessarily a representation of all of our expense efficiencies. So the discipline is everywhere and it's the way we run the company, and we do believe in the importance of operating leverage through time, no doubt. Yes. It can absolutely be true. So markets is, I mean, in most of our businesses, we don't run them NII versus non-interest revenue. It is an accounting construct. But markets is particularly true. So, yes, that is possible. In NII, the markets business, you can think about is liability sensitive. So you are going to see the benefit of lower rates in NII that doesn't necessarily imply anything about the overall performance. Hi, Erika. Sure. So it's interesting that you brought up the bridge being strong enough. It does feel like at this point in this crisis, that the bridge has been strong enough. The question that still remains is, is the bridge long enough. And so, while we just had recent stimulus pass, that makes us feel better about the bridge being long enough. But we have to get through the next three months to six months. So it feels like we have been saying that, since this crisis started, but I think it is particularly true at this point, obviously, given the vaccine rollout. So, consumer confidence is still low relative to pre-COVID levels. You can converse that with -- compare that to the Wholesale side, we are seeing confidence is up. That's not true on the consumer side. And so the next three months to six months is going to be critically important for us to assess whether or not only is it strong enough, but is it long enough and do you see consumer sentiment pick up a bit. There's also possibility for payment shops as some relief programs, whether it be student loan, forbearance or tax -- taxes owed on benefits received. There are things that could hit a consumer in the next three months to six months that we need to think about. $12 billion. Hi, Betsy. So, Betsy, I will take that one. So this -- we are really excited about this one and really with any tech platform scale matters. So combining our scale with cxLoyalty's innovative technology will be a win not only for our Chase customers but for cxLoyalty's existing clients and suppliers. And then you are right to point out our existing UR platform, but that today is predominantly used as a point production portal. So there's a huge opportunity to capture a greater share of our customer spend on travel, which is $140 billion both on and off us. So in addition to capturing the full economic value of the existing redemptions on the platform, we also have an opportunity to really turn it into a great place for our customers to book travel. Has no [inaudible]. It has to be Card only. Yeah... And we think we can do a better job for their existing clients and suppliers. So it won't just be about Chase customers. Hi, Ken. Sure. So we always start in the same place, which is we would much prefer to do the things that Jamie's been talking about when to buy back our stocks. So we would much prefer to deploy it to organic growth or acquisitions. Having said that, we do as you point out have significant excess capital at this point. When we look at the first quarter, the Fed capacity was defined by the trailing four quarters of profits and so when you back out our dividend, that's where you get to the $4.5 billion. So that is the capacity that we have for this quarter and we will do up to that amount, obviously, I don't know that we will do the full amount, but we will certainly do, obviously, can't do more than $4.5 billion. And then we are certainly hopeful that we can go back to the EU under the SCB framework beyond the first quarter as we think about buybacks. But we will wait to see what the Fed says at the end of the first quarter. Yeah. I mean, we will always look at the effective return of us buying back our stock for our remaining shareholders and if we think it makes sense relative to the alternative we are going to keep doing it. Yeah. So competition remains very, very strong. As it relates to the revenue yield, it's a little bit of noise there, because balances are down so much and that's what that's derived from. So there's a little bit of noise there. Importantly, we do, if GDP is back to 2019 levels by the middle of the year, we expect them to continue to recover, and perhaps, significantly, so in the second half. As it relates to travel, whether it's the second half of \u201821 or \u201822, we are confident that our customers will continue to travel and there's pent-up demand on shore for travel and so we are excited about those opportunities, whether they come in \u201821 or \u201822 or beyond, Hi, Glenn. And it's another reason our investments are going up as much, yeah, because we are very well aware of it. No. But, Mike, I can just add a little bit of color on the numbers. So we had said that we were going to open up 400 new branches in market expansion. So we have done 170 So far. Importantly, in 2020, we did fewer than 90, and in 2021 we are going to do 150. And so, of course, we -- by 2022 or 2023, that's going to start to sunset. So there are in the numbers multiyear investments that will -- they are ramping maybe in \u201821, but they will ramp down now that obviously gives us capacity to reinvest those dollars. But we have a lot of capacity within the numbers you see on the page to continue to increase investments without necessarily the absolute number going up. In tech as an example, 10% or 20% of that number in any given year is completed. So that gives us more dollars to reinvest. And then the only thing I'd add on branches is this like the franchise value that comes with opening up these branches in new states is extraordinary and I think underestimated, because it give us the ability to do state and municipal business that we wouldn't have otherwise been able to do. So it's not just about consumer banking. Hi, Brian. Yes. Yeah. And we can't move our footprint that quickly anyway. So we do have time here to make sure that we do it really thoughtfully. Hawaii. Yes. Hawaii, that's right. Sorry, I didn't catch that. Hi, Gerard. So I will start with, we certainly remain hopeful that we will get the extension. Importantly, as we think about branch expansion near-term rate headwinds, we certainly consider that, but at the margin there not a factor given the long-term franchise value associated with the branch expansion and the fact that it's not just about deposits for any one consumer anyway, because we have the opportunity to have a much broader relationship with them and all of that is factored into the branch expansion. But we do consider in the analytics there the near-term headwinds from rates. But there is a steady state number which is more of a normalized level of rates. So it doesn't -- at a margin it might change some decisions around marketing, but it doesn't have a big impact on us. Yeah. And we bring it up, obviously, it is an issue for us in the near- to medium-term, should we not get the extension and it's one that's important for people to understand. But we bring it up more so because it should, another example of where lack of coherence around these rules can have an impact, not just on JPMorgan. So we don't bring it up just because of the impact on JPMorgan. We bring it up because it is perhaps one of the better examples of the need for recalibration. You have to have the right incentives in the system for it to work through time and we are just seeing that's not the case. Yeah. Right. Hi Matt. Hi Charles. Okay. Sure. So that guidance enables an offering of stable going on a public blockchain. So that doesn't impact JPM point. JPM point, you should think about as the tokenization of our customer deposits. So it's obviously very early. We will assess use cases and customers demand. But it's still too early to see where this goes for us. Hi Andrew. Yes. We don't have to. It's also -- it is slightly different in the sense that there was capacity in the system then to absorb it. This is an issue for everyone. So that could be a challenge. We can't make them go away. And Betsy, I mentioned earlier, you might have missed it, but it does not impact JPM coin, JPM coin is different. You should think about that as tokenizing deposits to make payments easier for client. I don't know either. And I would just. Mike, I would just add just from an expense perspective. It is important to remember on the international front that we are riding existing rails that are already there in the CIB. So we can -- this is an extraordinary opportunity to hire bankers and we already have the infrastructure. That's right. So it's not the list you might think from an expense perspective. Hi, Gerard. Okay. Yes. Yeah. I don't we know exactly how to answer it, Gerard. All I can say is that, when we give customers the help that they need, if that's what the bridge them to the other side of this thing, for sure it is good. So I don't know precisely what the math is, but there's no doubt it's good if it helps get our customers to the other side. We service their mortgage. Yeah. I got you. We are talking about advancing the servicing cost. Got it. Yeah. No. At this levels."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Jamie Dimon",
            "content": "Thank you. In the implied terms. Because you said the G- SIB fees, it's very important. If we were on the international standard, our G- SIB fee would be 2%, not 4%. And we have been talking about they were supposed to adjust G-SIB before the growth of the economy and effectively the shrinking size of the banking system. Because the banking system itself is getting smaller as mortgages go to non-banks and private credit goes elsewhere, and the rest of the international, Chinese banks are growing, et cetera. So these adjustments should be made. We pointed out there is $1.3 trillion of liquid assets and marketable securities on our balance sheet which shockingly reached G-SIFI 2. G-SIFI has no risk weighted measurements to it, no diversification to it, no profitability to it. It just kind of these very gross measures, and it needs to be recalibrated and same with SLR. I mean, so do we expect it to happen? Probably not in our lifetimes, because we have politicized bank, detailed bank numbers and so on, and we can live with it for now. But in the long run, it's not good for America and had been that much of a disadvantage to our competitors overseas. I just point out the $68 billion. We don't make commitments or promises, so that $68 billion, I would love to find $2 billion more of investments, literally. I mean, we are seeking every year find more to do to help clients around the world and stuff like that. So that's kind of our current forecast. And fortunately, we found some more to do, including cxLoyalty and opening more branches and some of the technology we are building, et cetera. But I'd like to find more. It would be the best and possible highest use of our capital. We have positive carry, the trading profit goes down and the carry goes up, the number -- absolute numbers are same. Right. I would just add, very different for subprime and prime. And if you look at our portfolio, it's mostly prime. And the folks in the prime category have a lot more income, a lot more savings, housing prices are up. They did not lose their jobs. So the news there is actually rather good. On the lower quartiles it's the opposite. Even now when we just did all the stimulus checks and we did about $12 million of them, which have already been processed. $12 million. $12 billion, $12 million for 12 Billion approximately and there's the bottom. But the folks who had $1,000 in their accounts, where the accounts are coming down and they just got $1,000, they obviously needed. The folks in the higher end, they obviously don't need quite as much. So it's positive -- we expected to go up, but it's possible somehow that doesn't happen in some dramatic way. I'd say, we are making this point very important. We do not consider taking down reserves recurring or low income. We don't do show across. We don't consider a profit. It's ink on paper. It's based upon lots of different calculations. Obviously, we want real loss to be lower over time. But just if you Card reserves like $17 billion, we took it down next quarter, because we have more optimistic outlooks, we are not going to be sitting here cheering about that, but we are cheering they are much [ph] doing better. But we don't want to consider that in earnings. I think you all should look at a little bit differently now, particularly with the change in accounting rules. Again, we have -- I mean, our capital [inaudible], okay. We have so much capital we cannot use it. If you look at what happened this year, our capital went from 12.4% to 13.3%. And by I think advanced is more representative of real risks it will be 13.8%. That's after doing $2 trillion of loans, $12 trillion of reserves, $12 trillion -- $12 billion of reserved, $12 billion of dividend. I mean, we are earning, if you look at pretax -- pre-provision $45 billion or $50 billion a year. So we are in very good shape to invest. The most important thing we said to management, we says that we grow that every business organically, every single one opening branches and accounts, doing payments, and we put a lot of time and effort in payments. We are quite good at it between credit card, debit card, Chase merchant services. But I agree with you and but we are open for inorganic too. Inorganic shouldn't be an excuse not for growing organically and it's not just Chase, it's not just asset management, it will be any area where we could do that, I don't think cxLoyalty was neat thing, [inaudible] was neat thing, we bought 55 IP, which is a special way to manage money, tax efficiently. And so we are going to build it ourselves or buy it. We are open minded. Anyone you have good ideas for us, let us know. We have the wherewithal, but we thought we will also look at buying it. Like I said, we are always looking for a way to invest more of our money intelligently. We have got a tremendous set of assets. We also have a tremendous debt of competitors, particularly in payments, consumer land now and a bunch of other areas. So you saw Google Pay. You saw Wal-mart is going to try to spend a bit more time is expanding. And we like competition, we believe in it. But we have to be really prepared for that and that is deeply on our mind and how we run our business. It's consumer, this thing was consumer. Jen, mentioned the number, like more than 30% of travel expense goes through our Cards, something like that. And so we want to give a far better experience to our own customers when it comes to what we offer them to travel. You are right, ultimate reward always does a good job. But why would you try to double that overtime or triple it? Exactly. So, first of all, cyber we are going to do -- we have to do whatever it takes and we are going to do that in everything we do. But you mentioned, we built a brand new data centers pretty much around the world, which are a lot more efficient. They are going to be effectively not cloud base, but they have all the cloud, technology, et cetera, for our own private cloud. When we move other stuff to the public cloud, we are refactoring applications to get there, where we are doing all the data, you all know the issue with data, not that banks were bad, but data was held in all these different accounts, you are trying to build these data links, you can use AI and machine learning better and it all do haste. The cloud is real. The cost is real. The speed is real. The security is real. The AI is real. The machine learning is real. So every single business and with every single meeting we go through is talking about what are we moving to the cloud, whether it's internal or external? What are we adding AI machinery on? Are we getting the data analytics right and it is global. It's -- and we don't spend that much time on it. But every single business is doing it. You have a tremendous amount of AI being used in asset wealth management, CIB, in trading, in Commercial Banking prospecting and it's literally the tip of the iceberg. Whatever we say today, 10 years from now, it will be probably 50 times more than we are doing today. And I would spend anything to get it done faster. If you can manage your capital down to the 12% or whatever we said, with that regards have been getting permission from the Fed. They have already implied that's what they can do. That's the way it should be done eventually one day. Another way to point out is that, we have been consistent in 2 times tangible book, but our earnings power and dividend and all stuff like that, it still makes sense to buy back stock. But that diminishes every point, 2.1 or 2.2, or 2.3, we would much rather use our capital to grow organically or inorganically. We take very seriously the new entrance like the Goldman Sachs Card and there are a bunch of other folks who are doing similar things that we expect to see more of that. Yeah. So I am going to -- in the Commercial Bank it is probably less than you think. I do think there are alternative credit providers. But we will just do a lot of things for our clients, they can quit investment banking, FX swaps, cash management custody, asset management, et cetera. So it's slightly different. I got a consumer saw me and we wrote in the Chairman's letter years ago that Silicon Valley is coming. And I think it's just more and faster and better and quicker. And we have to just be very conscious that includes pay now, pay later and we have some of the products ourselves, but our job is to make sure we use our unbelievable strength and client base and capability and Gordon always points out, when you have that kind of products that goes to keep it simple, clear, basic, what the customer wants, to just to deliver more and better and so we are quite conscious. And I would also add, by the way, it's not just that, we have -- the team looks at and financial and early pay and all these other competitors. I expect one day, you can see other big foreign banks back here again, including the big Chinese banks, the biggest ones were bigger than us. And I am -- that may be five years or 10 years out, but we better be thinking five years or 10 years out. And so they are all coming, we were comfortable, but we are still exercising and taking our vitamins, okay? Yes, yes and yes. That's all we are going to tell you. I mean, I have talked about how important AI is, obviously, the data in that. AI is data directly related and some of it gets used very well. But if you shut down, some of it doesn't get used well. We have restrictions, far more restrictions than some of our Silicon Valley competitors. But still there are ways to use our data to do a better job for our clients. And we do a tremendous amount already in marketing, risk, fraud, cyber, you name it. And we use a lot of that -- like a lot of that stuff also protects our clients in cyber. Gordon's not, but so we have -- we started this a while back to expand the branches and stuff like that. We are still -- we are closing plenty of branches. So if you look at what we are doing, we got the number of leads, we have closed like 1,000 the last four years or five years and we have opened like 1,000 or something like that. But -- and I think we did the Bank One JPMorgan deal, we were in 21 states, 23 states. And when we started the expansion originally, the -- we were very conscious that the world needs less branches and the shape of the branches differently and you made hub and spoke and we are always testing new things and stuff like that. But we still have almost a million people today who visit branches and it's down, but it's a million people a day, I have got the number, 60% to 70% accounts still open in branches, small businesses still need branches. And the new branches that we opened in Boston, Philadelphia, D.C., they have been doing quite well. And the shocking thing is doing quite well in Card, consumer, investments, small business. So as we go to the all the other states, we just want to be and we know we have to have certain size, not going in each state with one just to plant the flag. That would be kind of waste of time. We look at the major markets, number of people already know us through Chase and stuff like that. And so we are optimistic that the strategy will pay off and it will enhance our businesses and our capabilities and other things, I am not going to tell you because it's very competitive. I think we have shared too much with our competitors in the past. So I am going to kind of shut myself up a little bit. Yeah. And it gives me a chance to North Dakota, which is the only state I have never been in. But believe it or not, we already do a lot of middle market, credit card more in North Dakota. We just didn't do Consumer Banking. So I do the second where I am allowed, I am on my way to like Bismarck or Fargo or something like. Okay, we have just the new Head of Investor Relations, who is sitting in this room right now, Reggie Chambers, who I am sure you will get to know. This was part of what he did for Sun Belt, which is the all branch expansion, though we don't really restrict them how much you can tell you. But -- and including looking at different formats. We are not blind to the nature that you have the world changing and digital all that. So we can very quickly, just so, I have got the number change the fleet, like if you said, you have got the world changing more rapidly, we are completely comfortable that in a five-year period, you can dramatically reduce the size of the fleet or the cost of the fleet, et cetera, while serving clients. 48 states three years ago. I mean, by the way, Commercial Bank, same thing. We talked about expansion. So we bought WaMu, it took years, but we said we are going to do $1 billion in the WaMu states, which is mostly California, Florida, Atlanta. So we got -- what we are very close to hitting that. I thought governor was like $908 million this year or something like that. I told the teams we reviewed it yesterday that when we hit $1 billion, I want to send a case of really expensive why we are, like, why the guy called Steve Walker, who did it for us and have great. And we told him, right, like great bankers, great capabilities, stuff like that. We were doing $400 million of Investment Banking business when we did the Bank One deal JPMorgan through the Commercial Bank. We set a target of $1 billion and $2 billion and $3 billion, we exceeded $3 billion. I think we did $3.5 billion. The new target is $4 billion. It's now 25% to 30% of domestic U.S. Investment Banking, which DCM, ECM, M&A through that network and the Investment Bank -- the Commercial Bank expanded into healthcare, technology and we have a couple other areas we are going to be rolling out soon. So these expansions really makes sense. They pay for themselves. They are relentless. They are hard to do. They are obviously right? And remember the Commercial Bank deal in these branches. It's very hard to judge and we have done it. But it's very hard to build the quality business without a retail branches when you are a Commercial Bank. But you will see very few Commercial Banks that don't have retail branches. But in the big picture there are people expenses $33 billion, for real estate expenses, I am going to say $3 billion. So, yeah, even -- and I do think it can be much more efficient than that, but I don't think it's like a game changer. But Jen is thinking about moving the finance function to Florida. Hawaii. The billion what? Okay. The -- firstly, Investment Bank is expanding globally everywhere as best we can and so as asset management and because we already spoke about China and stuff like that, the Commercial Banks started an international expansion effort to cover companies overseas that we do business with here that we are not covering and it's doing fine. It's mostly expense right now. We added bankers and products and services and legal and compliance and we didn't add -- we have been adding clients as we were quite happy with it. I should point out that we just had the best year ever in Asia. I mean, I think, it was up like 20% or something like that. So and Asia is still will be one of the fastest growing markets in the world. So our -- and that's kind of country-by-country to make sure we get that right. Yeah. Our focus is always the same. We have got 60 million U.S. clients. We have got 6,000 investment clients around the world. We have got -- we run this company to serve clients, communities, hospitals. We financed $100 billion in states, cities, schools, hospitals each year. That's what we do. And obviously, we want to satisfy all of our regulators. So I do expect that, there will be a new set of regulators. We will have a new set of demands. Some we agree with. We want to do a better job in climate for the world. We want to be more green. We want to help the disadvantage. We rolled out an enormous amount of progress in racial equality and things like that. So, yeah, but they will be tougher. That's life. It's life around the world. We are going to -- we have to do a whole bunch of new regulators, which we are trying to satisfy in the ECB, et cetera. And so, it's -- I don't need to change our life that much and competitively, everyone's in the same kind of boat and so it will be fine. And we want the new president to be successful. Yeah. The bigger decisions on that which we have a lot of leeway on is out of the investment bank. It's repo, deposits, corporate clients, trade finance, all those other things. So the -- this is managed very, very closely. Remember GSIB uses one of, say, 20 constraints we managed by business, by product, by area, by region, by... Look we were able to reduce deposits $200 billion within like months last time. So we don't want to do it, it's is very customer friendly and say, could you take your deposits elsewhere, but... They do have -- a lot of this larger corporate client who have other options and bunch of deposits, but money market funds or something like that. So we are mad. It is not -- none of this is going to be an issue for 2021, folks. I mean, fundamentally, it is just how we were a company and even if that temporary relief goes away. And I am always against temporary relief, because for this exact reason, it creates another cliff, even if it goes away we are fine, we just have to manage it much tighter. There is $350 billion of global financial assets, $50 trillion -- $350 trillion, and probably, in 10 years or 20 years that number is going to be $700 trillion. People have to buy and sell to hedge, finance, with money around the world, FX, currencies, our pension plans. Obviously, volumes go up and down. Spreads generally over time has been coming down, what you would expect in a competitive market. So with the expansion of the balance sheets of the central banks around the world that Jen showed you, the $3 trillion or $4 trillion in the Fed, but globally it is $12 trillion. And companies have a lot of financing to do. And of course, when you have higher DCM and higher ECM and higher M&A that also drives a lot of trading and so you got to kind of put that all in the mix. Yeah. The way we look is we kept our share of what things we are trying to find digitized and the business has done a kind of the way we expected them to do it. So, yeah, we think scale matters, technology matters, and hopefully, we think we can even grow our share. This is just trench warfare. So we expect to grow it, but we -- I don't -- it's a very hard to say, what the base level is and we thought that the base level kind of revise down sometime last year, but will stay as high as it stayed in 2020 then I doubt. It may not go back to what it was. It may be higher than that. Yeah. You go ahead with blockchain there. And we are using blockchain for sharing data with banks already and so we are at the forefront of that which is good. The other question was about fintech. Look first of all, they are very good competitors. I pointed out to a lot of people, PayPal were $250 million, Squares were done in $20 million, Stripe is worth $80 billion, Ant Financial is down quite a bit now. But they are there. They are strong. They are smart, some effectively ride the rails. So we bank a lot of them. We help them accomplish what they want to accomplish and you have. So my view is we are going to compete, we will need to and we have to look at our -- look inside about what we could do better or could have done better and things like that. So I am confident we will be able to compete. But I think we now are facing old generation of newer, tougher, faster competitors who -- and if they don't buy the rails of JPMorgan, they can buy rails of someone else. So you see, I have told you before, everyone is going to be involved in payments. Some banks going to white label, which makes which makes fintech competitors white label the bank and build every sort of thing on top of it and we have to be prepared for that. I expect it to be very, very tough competition in the next 10 years. I expect to win. So help me God. Well, the most will do for now, but I think it's a mistake because it's going to be forever. The game of bank licenses, Utah is giving industrial licenses. Like I said, banks are white labeling. So it's effectively the same thing. If a fintech companies uses a white label bank just to process their business, they are basically a bank. When -- what the regulator will do, I don't know, but we have to assume that they are going to do it. And that some don't need, will find ways, not to use their banking system, which they have done. I mean, if you look at a whole bunch of the things they have used stuff around the banking system, which is fine, I am not against that. The regulators may have a point of view about that one day, but I am less worried about that. I am going to worry about us. Look, Charles, one other point, if our examples unfair competition, which we will do something about eventually. People who we will make a lot more on debit, because they activate under certain things, the only reason they compete is because of that. People basically don't do KYC AML and create risk for the system. And I can go on and on, but that part we will be a little bit more aggressive on, people who improperly use data has been given to them by client, okay? So you can expect that there will be other battle to take place here. I mean, look, we don't have that much more insight than you do. You do see signs witnessing in commodities and certain products and consumer goods and stuff like that. It's hard to tell that supply lines that can't keep up with demand or you have long-term trends, China is no longer ending the world. That can change inflation. I think and we looked at when Jen gave those numbers, she always using implied curve. I think the best way to think about it is, I think this should be a much bigger conversation next year because we have good growth. I think we have good growth and part inflation, but that will become part of conversation, how bad, what I am going to do and things like that. Just so the risk management thing, you got to build into your mindset that you have got to look at there has been a possibility. So I think a year ago, people have said, not possible before COVID and now because the world has done $12 trillion of QE and something like $10 trillion to $12 trillion of fiscal stimulus, you have got to put on that thing a scenario where you have higher inflation and not 2%. That would be great. It is like Goldilocks. But like 3%, 4%. Just so you understand what the risk is that and how we manage through that. It is not the worst thing in the world by the way. The worst in the world is no growth. We don't have that all, Jen. I don't think so. But -- I don't think so. We expect stable... And obviously there is this talk about several banks having digital currencies and stuff like that, right? Their currency is digital when we move around the world. It's in central banks where it will move by electrons and stuff like that both. So I do expect that stuff is coming and it may not change our world that much. But some of the competitors we want to do, they want to be in payments. They want the payments data. They want to move the money. Again, it's going to be a regulatory issue about what that means and... Although, it is not unfair. That's the only thing I can point. So as long as the competition -- as always we can do it safely and competition can do then it's hard to argue this -- that's unfair. Yeah. Right. So we believe that inequality is a real problem and people don't always know, but like, 40% of Americans make $15 an hour or less, which is $32,000 a year something like that. 50 million don't have employment and people at the lower end are dying quicker than they die before. So first time in our lifetimes, our grandparents lifetimes Americans mortality is getting worse, not better and society have to fix these problems. Now we need healthy growth, healthy growth I mean like, but you also need education, infrastructure, healthcare and formerly the racial problem has been around for hundreds of years and with all the things that took place after even -- after the civil rights, we haven't made the progress we should have made. So we -- and fortunately, lot of other people and companies take this really seriously. How can we help all of American citizen in particular the black community who has been left behind for so long. So our effort is five years, the $30 billion includes, exact numbers we published $8 billion of mortgages to lower, middle income neighborhoods, black neighborhoods, primarily black neighborhoods it includes affordable housing, building affordable housing includes billions of dollars for entrepreneurs of color, it includes defense education. We recently went over a million secure card which is what we expected to do, because these are cards that have all the benefits of banking ATMs, online bill pay for $4.95 a month for lower paid individual who are doing more, more education. Of those 400 branches we are opening, 25% or more will be in LMI neighborhoods. We are financing MBI's and CBFI's. So it's a serious effort, it costs hundreds of millions dollar a year. There are hundreds of people work here. So we have a debt how many loan we are going to put in this neighborhood and how many loans we are going to put in that neighborhood. And we are going to report it that to you, we are not going to -- and we are doing work, we don't mind things not working, but it will change courses and stuff like that. And so and obviously it includes hiring more open black community training here and stuff like that. So I think these efforts in my own view is that the corporate world have to do this if you want to fix it. It's not going to happen. We need good government. It is not going to happen just with good government. The jobs at the local level. Unemployment sell branches 20% for \u201820 is still high. The kids didn't have computer to go home and do their Zooming and schools didn't have them. And unfortunately, a lot of planned appeasing including my wife send lot of computers to people there, but we have to do something about this. We are always so forth. And in my view we should do it for more purposes of loan that would be sufficient, but for commercial purposes do it. If all the parts American doing better, outcomes and more jobs and healthier people, less crying, less prisons, less drugs and so it's time to get our act together. And again, I think, business has to work in collaboration with government to do it. I just don't think it is going to happen alone. It is not going to happen just by yelling at people. The successful companies do not create the slums, but they can help fix them. I think I will answer U.S., but I think the U.S., again, we are not going to share so much information from now on. But it's the same thing we looked at all the major SMSAs with the middle market companies, we are doing deep dive in how many there are and I think we are now in 75 of the top 75 roughly. So that expansion is now just going deeper not maybe more at this point. They will be helped little bit by the retail expansion. I think overseas, I just don't the number of hand... Okay. But you are talking about that will eventually cover and I could be dead wrong in this, 1,000 more clients overseas. These are headquarters or subsidiaries of foreign companies that we probably do business with headquarters subsidiaries in U.S. and we could share more of this with you later down the road. I will tell Charlie, he can't imitate me on this one. And we usually jelly bank in the U.S. subsidiary... Our U.S. headquarters. No. No. No. We never said we -- Mike, we never said we missed it. We have been doing fine over these five years. But we are just lucky. But I do agree with you, I gave that to the management team. My whole operating committee a little deck that show Visa 500 billion, Mastercard 350 billion, PayPal 220 billion, Ant Financial 600 billion, Tencent 800 billion, Alibaba trillion, Facebook, Google, Apple, Amazon, you go on and on. But absolutely, we should be scared chillers about that. I am not going to tell you. But we have plenty of resources, a lot of very smart people. We just got to get quicker, better, faster and that's the -- which we do. We have got -- we have done an exceptional. If you look at what we have done, you would say, we have done a great job. But other people done a good job too. Some have monopolies virtually it is a whole different issue, but. Jen will have that one. Yeah. You are absolutely right. The cost of servicing the default of loan is like 10 times the Silicon service [ph] and non-deposit loans. So Jen is right. Although, we don't prudently default, there is probably a small benefit. That's not an issue either. Folks, thank you very much for spending time with us. We will speak to you all soon."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. [Operator instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Piepszak. Ms. Piepszak, please go ahead.\nJennifer Piepszak: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'll take you through the presentation, which as always, is available on our website. And we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $9.4 billion, EPS of $2.92, and revenue of $29.9 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 19%. Included in these results are $524 million of legal expenses, primarily related to the resolution of legal matters announced last month. Overall for the quarter, while we're still in a very uncertain environment, our underlying business fundamentals performed quite well. So, I'll just touch on a few highlights here before getting into the line-of-business results. The CIB continued its strong performance with IB fees of 9% and markets revenue up 30% year-on-year and we had record revenue in AWM, up 5% year-on-year. On deposits, while we expected to see some normalization in our balances, instead, we saw another quarter of growth, with average deposits up 5% sequentially. And notably, we moved into the Number 1 spot in U.S. retail deposits with 9.8% market share, gaining 50 basis points of share year-on-year. On the other hand, average loans were down 4% quarter-on-quarter, primarily on revolver pay downs from our Wholesale clients. With that, let's turn to Page 2 for more detail on the third-quarter results. We reported revenue of $29.9 billion, which was flat year-on-year. Net interest income was down approximately $1.2 billion or 9% on lower rates, partly offset by higher market NII and balance sheet growth. And noninterest revenue was up 1.2 billion or 7%, primarily driven by CIB, including higher banking and markets revenues, as well as net securities gains in corporate.  Expenses of 16.9 billion were up approximately 500 million or 3% year-on-year on the higher legal expenses that I already mentioned. This quarter, credit costs of approximately 600 million were down 900 million year-on-year, primarily driven by modest reserve releases, which you can see in more detail on Page 3. We released approximately 600 million of reserves this quarter, primarily on run-off in Home Lending and changes in Wholesale loan exposure. Charge-offs across our portfolios remain relatively low and, in fact, were down slightly year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. While we could see an uptick in charge-offs over the next few quarters, given payment relief and government stimulus already provided, and we don't expect any meaningful increases in charge-offs until the second half of 2021. As you can see at the bottom of the page, our updated base case reflects some improvement from last quarter. However, the medium-to-longer term is still highly uncertain in particular as it relates to future stimulus. And so we remain heavily weighted to our downsize scenarios, and with reserves of 33.8 billion, we're prepared for something worse than the base case. And now turning to Page 4, I'll provide a quick update on what we're seeing in our customer assistance programs. You can see here that the vast majority of Card & Auto customers have exited relief, and so what's left in deferral is primarily in Home Lending, including 11 billion of owned loans and 17 billion in our service portfolio. And in terms of what we're seeing with our customers that have exited relief, approximately 90% of accounts remain current. Now, turning to balance sheet and capital on Page 5. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13%, up 60 basis points versus last quarter on earnings generation and lower RWA, partially offset by dividends of $2.8 billion. And it's worth noting that we have over 1.3 trillion of liquidity sources available to us across HQLA and unencumbered securities. Now let's go to our businesses, starting with Consumer & Community Banking on Page 6. CCB reported net income of $3.9 billion and an ROE of 29%. Revenue of 12.8 billion was down 9% year-on-year driven by deposit margins compression and lower Card NII on lower balances, partially offset by deposit growth and strong Home Lending production margins. Deposit growth was 28% year-on-year, up over 190 billion, largely on lower spending and higher cash buffers across both our consumer and small business customers, as well as organic growth. Client investment assets were up 11% year-on-year driven by both net inflows and market performance. Overall, consumer customers are holding up well. They have built savings relative to pre-COVID levels and at the same time, lower debt balances. With regard to digital adoption, early signs suggest the increased customer migration to digital will persist. In fact, nearly 69% of our customers are digitally active, and that's up 3 percentage points year-on-year and accelerating. And quick deposit now represents more than 40% of all check deposits versus 30% pre-COVID. Moving on to consumer lending. Starting with Home Lending, total originations were down 10% year-on-year driven by correspondent. However, consumer volumes were up 46% year-on-year. And notably, more than half of consumer applications were completed digitally, twice the level of the first quarter. In Cards, while our net sales were down 8% year-on-year, spend continued to improve throughout the quarter. And in the month of September, sales were down only 3% year-on-year, reflecting the lowest decline since March. Retail, which is a significant portion of overall spend, was a bright spot, reaching double-digit year-on-year growth in the third quarter, largely driven by card-not-present transactions. And then in Auto, record originations for the quarter of 11.4 billion were up 25% year-on-year. Total CCB loans were down 7% year-on-year, with Home Lending down 15% due to portfolio run-off and Cards down 11% on lower spend, offset by Business Banking, up 83% due PPP loans. Expenses of 6.8 billion were down 4% predominantly due to lower marketing investments. And lastly, credit cost of 794 million included a $300 million reserve release in Home Lending and net charge-offs of 1.1 billion driven by Cards. Now turning to the Corporate & Investment Bank on Page 7. CIB reported net income of $4.3 billion and an ROE of 21% on revenue of 11.5 billion. Investment Banking revenue of 2.1 billion was up 12% year-on-year and down sequentially off an all-time record quarter, and we maintained our Number 1 rank in IB fees year to date. The quarter's performance was largely driven by our equity capital markets business, which saw an uptick in IPO issuance driven by a strong equity backdrop with stocks trading at or near all-time highs. In advisory, we were down 15% year-on-year, largely impacted by the muted M&A announced volumes in the first half of the year. However, we saw a surge in M&A activity this quarter with announced volumes returning to pre-COVID levels as companies began to shift their focus from day-to-day operations to more strategic and opportunistic thinking.  Debt underwriting fees were also up 5% year-on-year, but down 21% sequentially as we saw investment-grade activity return to more normalized levels from the record volumes we saw in the second quarter. The leveraged finance market continued to recover with high-yield spreads approaching pre-COVID levels and some notable acquisition financing deals closing. We maintained our Number 1 rank in overall wallet, and we're the leaders in lead left across leveraged finance. In equity underwriting, fees were up 42% year-on-year, resulting in the best third quarter ever, primarily driven by our strong performance in IPOs and follow-on\u2019s. In terms of the outlook, we expect fourth quarter IB fees to be roughly flat versus a strong quarter last year and down sequentially. However, if valuations remain elevated, we could continue to see momentum in capital markets. Moving to markets, total revenue was 6.6 billion, up 30% year-on-year. While activity continued to normalize, with spread, volume and volatility reducing from the elevated levels of the first half of the year, the performance was strong throughout the quarter and across products, reflecting the resilience in earnings power of this franchise through a broad range of market conditions. Fixed income was up 29% year-on-year against a strong third quarter last year driven by a favorable trading environment across products, notably in commodities, as well as elevated client activity in credit and securitized products. Equities was up 32% year-on-year on continued robust client activity in equity derivatives, as well as a recovery in prime balances and a solid performance in cash. Looking forward, it's important to remember that 4Q 2019 performance was very strong, making for a difficult year-on-year comparison. And obviously, forecasting market\u2019s performance remains challenging in this environment. Wholesale Payments revenue of 1.3 billion was down 5% year-on-year driven by deposit margin compression, largely offset by balance growth, as well as a reporting reclassification in merchant services. Securities Services revenue of $1 billion was flat year-on-year, where higher deposit balances were offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of 5.8 billion were up 5%, compared to the prior year, largely due to higher legal expense, partially offset by lower structural and volume and revenue-related expenses. Now moving on to Commercial Banking on Page 8. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.1 billion and an ROE of 19%. Revenue of 2.3 billion was flat year-on-year driven by deposit margin compression, offset by higher balances and fees and higher lending revenue. Gross Investment Banking revenue of 840 million was up 20% year-on-year on increased debt and equity underwriting activity. Expenses of 966 million were up 3% year-on-year. Average loans were up 5% year-on-year, but down 7% quarter-on-quarter due to declines in revolver utilization by C&I clients and lower origination volume in CRE. Deposits of 248 billion were up 44% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on-quarter as client balances remain elevated. Finally, our credit costs were a net benefit of 147 million, including a $207 million reserve release and net charge-offs of 60 million. Now on to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 9. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of 877 million with pre-tax margin of 31% and ROE of 32%. Record revenue of 3.7 billion for the quarter was up 5% year-on-year as growth in deposit and loan balances, along with higher management fees and brokerage activity, were largely offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of 2.6 billion were flat year-on-year, and credit costs were a net benefit of 51 million, primarily due to reserve releases.  For the quarter, net long-term inflows of 34 billion were positive across all channels and driven by fixed income and equity. At the same time, we saw net liquidity outflows of 33 billion. AUM of 2.6 trillion and overall client assets of 3.5 trillion, up 16% and 15% year-on-year, respectively, were driven by net inflows into liquidity and long-term products, as well as higher market levels. And finally, deposits were up 23% year-on-year, and loans were up 13% with strength in both wholesale and mortgage lending. Now on to corporate on Page 10. Corporate reported a net loss of approximately 700 million. Revenue was a loss of 339 million, down $1 billion year-over-year, driven by lower net interest income on lower rates, including the impact of faster prepays on mortgage securities, partially offset by 466 million of net securities gains in the quarter. Expenses of 719 million were up 438 million year-on-year, primarily due to an impairment on a legacy investment.  Now let's turn to Page 11 for the outlook. You'll see here that our full year outlook for 2020 remains in-line with what I said at Barclays. We expect net interest income to be approximately 55 billion and adjusted expenses to be approximately 66 billion. And while we don't have anything on the page for 2021 and we're not planning to do Investor Day, we'll share more color with you on the outlook in the first quarter of next year.  So, to wrap up, even though recent economic data has been more constructive than we would have expected earlier this year, there remains a significant amount of uncertainty. And so we continue to prepare for a broad range of outcomes while focusing on serving our customers, clients and communities through this time. With that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matthew O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.\nMatthew O\u2019Connor: Good morning. So, I think one of the key questions on investors' minds right now is how will banks grow revenue kind of medium-term here as we think about lower-for-longer rates? And I was hoping you could just talk about how you think about managing the company if rates stay very low for a long time and how you can grow revenue. And obviously, year to date, the revenue has been very good, up 4%. And if you could [just reason] the branch expansion that you alluded to in the comments as part of that answer, that would be helpful? Thank you.\nJennifer Piepszak: Sure. So, in terms of how we think about the revenue outlook for 2021, first of all, it's early and we'll come back to you in the first quarter with more details, but it is true that if we think about the NII outlook that that will be under pressure relative to 2020 and I can't give more detail on that. But also, we are on pace for record revenue in markets and investment banking, and so that will be a tough compare. Having said that, we're not going to change the way we run the company because of what might be temporary rate headwinds, and we see significant franchise value in the growth that we're seeing in the deposit base. And with that branch expansion \u2013 we are continuing on our plans in branch expansion. We have, I think, almost a 120 branches open in our expansion markets. We'll do more than another 150 so far this year. We got approval to enter 10 additional states, which we'll ultimately put us in all lower 48. So, we continue with the branch expansion and remain very excited about it with those new branches, in most cases, performing well above the original business case.\nJamie Dimon: [Indiscernible] to give you a little bit of longer-term view. There's not one single business or not any bankers, countries, products, digital. We're growing securities services and cash management services. We're adding \u2013 we're growing the Chase wealth management business. We're adding private bankers. We're adding products in Asset Management. And we kind of look through all the things \u2013 I kind of call them the weather. We just keep on growing. The branch expansion is one example of that. We never stopped doing that. We never stopped gaining credit card products. We never stopped growing digital Home Lending products, and we'll be doing that for the next decade. And of course, you have all these ins and out from what I call the weather: NII spreads, margins, markets, etcetera, but the goal is always the same. You grow the business to serve your clients around the world.\nMatthew O\u2019Connor: And then as a follow-up, Jen, you'd said that you'd elaborate on the net interest income. I don't know if you meant now or you're going to wait until January for that in terms of the outlook for next year, just some puts and takes.\nJennifer Piepszak: Sure. So there, I had said at Barclays that the current run rate was a good place to start. So 13 billion is a good place to start and for 2021 reflects the impact of the rate environment and some normalization in market's NII. But from there, balance sheet growth and mix should be supportive throughout the year. And so for the full-year of 2021, my best view at this point would be 53 billion, plus or minus. But yes, we'll sharpen our pencils on that and continue to provide updates. But right now, full year, 53 billion.\nOperator: Our next question is from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI.\nGlenn Schorr: Hello there.\nJennifer Piepszak: Hi, Glenn.\nGlenn Schorr: Good morning. So, I guess the reserve release was definitely driven by mortgage prepay and run-offs, I get that. But NPAs were still up 18% quarter-on-quarter. I wonder if you could talk about what drove that. Maybe comment on commercial real estate specifically. It'd be appreciated. Thanks.\nJennifer Piepszak: Sure. So, the reserve release, as you said, was largely on portfolio run-off and changes in exposure in Wholesale, so not a reflection of a change in our outlook. And then the increase in nonaccrual loans is \u2013 on the consumer side is mortgage, and it represents the customers that have come out of forbearance and are not paying. And so as you saw on that slide, the payment deferral slide, about 90% are still current. The other 10% has now been reflected in the nonaccrual exposure. So that is all mortgage. And then the increase in nonaccrual on the wholesale side was just a few name-specific downgrades, which are in sectors you would expect, as you just said, retail-related real estate and oil and gas.  And then more broadly on commercial real estate, I'll just share that we feel adequate reserve for what we're facing. But if you look at rent collection as an example overall, with the exception of retail, between 85% and 95%. And then even retail in the month of September was about 80% \u2013 has recovered to about 80%. So still a lot of uncertainty there, but we feel adequately reserved.\nGlenn Schorr: Okay. I appreciate that. Maybe one on asset management, you have been doing great. I don't need to ask on your specific business, but in the past, you've spoken about potential interest in participating in industry consolidation. We saw some of that happening lately. Can you just talk \u2013 remind us about the parameters of what you would and might not be interested in doing in asset and wealth management? Thanks.\nJamie Dimon: Well, since we have you all on the line, our doors and our telephone lines are wide open. We would be very interested, and we do think you will see consolidation in the business, but we're not going to be more specific than that. [Indiscernible] product-sensitive, the systems, the technology, the business projects, the ability to execute, there's lot \u2013 there are a lot of issues that will determine whether something makes sense for us in there.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities.\nMike Mayo: Hi. Hey, Jen and Jamie, that was some comment. You said you do not expect much higher charge-offs until the second half of next year, and that's even with the higher NPAs. So what are your assumptions behind that, Jen, as far as specifically when the forbearance actions run their course? And, Jamie, policy actions that might be embedded in that expectation?\nJennifer Piepszak: Okay. So I'll just start, Mike, with, first of all, the increase in nonaccrual was on mortgage. And when you look at the LTV on those \u2013 the loan to value on those loans, that's what is embedded into how we're thinking about the \u2013 what charge-offs will look like in the near term. There's still very healthy LTVs on those loans. So really, when we talk about losses really emerging in a significant way, not until the back half of 2021, we're talking about cards. And just given the amount of stimulus and payment relief and just support in the system, we haven't seen the delinquency buckets begin to fill up, and we charge 180 days past due in cards. So that is primarily just a timing issue as it relates to cards. We could see increases in charge-offs in the next few quarters on the wholesale side or maybe here and there on the consumer side. It's just that the meaningful change in charge-offs, we don't expect until the second half of 2021.\nJamie Dimon: Yes. And, Mike, about policy, first of all, I wouldn't say that policy is determinative here because this is unprecedented times. And what we're saying is that policy will matter and will skew the odds [indiscernible] better outcome. So, I think the policy \u2013 obviously, the Fed is doing what it can to keep markets open, but the policy on the fiscal side is just some kind of continuation of unemployment insurance and PPP. So, those are the two most vulnerable areas to just maximize the chance that we'll have better outcomes and I do think that over time, intelligent return to work. I caution people \u2013 remember, 100 million people go to work every day. So the complete focus is on the 50 million who don't go to work. But the 100 million who go to work, it's rather safe. There's a lot of examples where you do the social distancing and the cleaning and all the various things like that, that it may be safer than being home in your community. And so \u2013 but the getting back to work is a little bit important because you look at cities and travel and a whole bunch of stuff. There are a lot of people who are under a lot of stress and strain who won't be able to survive another year of complete closedown. So, the other policy is numerous, rational, thoughtful return to the office, done properly, which will help all those businesses support the big office towers and buildings and stuff like that. And those two things will maximize the chance of good outcome. They don't guarantee the chance of a good outcome.\nMike Mayo: And I know this is a tough question, but you're in the middle of the stress test part two. When all is said and done, Jamie or Jen, where do you think these charge-offs go as a percentage of the global financial crisis? You have to have \u2013 I know you have scenarios, but where should we think \u2013 is it like half the GFC level, same as GFC level, twice the GFC level? What are you guys thinking at the back of your mind?\nJennifer Piepszak: It's a very difficult question to answer. It's very different, of course, because the GFC was heavily mortgage-related, and this will probably be less so. We also \u2013 our portfolios are in significantly better shape coming into this, whether it's mortgage or card. But just given the amount of uncertainty about where this could go, we still have 12 million people unemployed, I think it's very difficult. I don't know, Jamie, whether you would add.\nJamie Dimon: It's very hard \u2013 I agree with you, Jen. It's very hard to say. And, Mike, it depends on the outcome. Again, we look at the good case, the medium case, the relative adverse case and the extreme adverse case. And there, the answers are completely different, and we don't know the future. So it's hard to predict what it's going to be. But our reserves are prepared for relative to the adverse case, which is equal to the \u2013 roughly equivalent to CCAR extreme adverse case that we just got, roughly. Again, it\u2019s very hard to compare apples-to-apples in these things.\nOperator: Our next question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.\nErika Najarian: Hi. Good morning. I'm going to ask the two questions that I often get from investors that are hesitant to dip their toe back into bank stocks. And the first is \u2013 and Jen, this goes back to your earlier comment. The one question I get on credit quality is did stimulus and policy redefine cumulative credit losses lower for this cycle? In other words, I think Jamie said changed the outcome or do you think it just delayed the realization of these losses?\nJennifer Piepszak: So, I think it's difficult to know. I think the purpose of it was to change the outcome, not just delay the losses. But it's difficult to know. People sort of described it as a bridge, and the question is whether the bridge will be long enough and strong enough to bridge people back to employment and bridge small businesses back to normalcy. So, I think it remains to be seen. As Jamie said, we're obviously preparing for it to not necessarily change the outcome, obviously, because we built significant reserves. So, we're prepared for it to be a delay rather than change the outcome.\nErika Najarian: Got it. And my follow-up question, and perhaps if I could direct this to Jamie. This is a bit of a follow-up to Matt's earlier question, but investors are essentially worried on the other side of the credit recovery about what the interest rate environment may imply for \"normalized ROTCE.\" And as you think about what you mentioned to be \"weather considerations,\" what prevents JP Morgan from going back to that 17%, 19% ROTCE that you posted in [2018 and 2019]?\nJamie Dimon: Well, you guys know that's a forecast of the future. It's hard to tell. I think negative interest rates are a bad idea and will probably force, over time, the banking industry to strength, which means they'd be buying back stock and doing other things with their capital. But we're able to handle low rates, and we can have decent returns at low rates. I think it's a bad long-term strategy. I also think it's a bad idea for you all to assume they're going to continue like that forever. I mean we had massive global QE in the last go around, and we didn't have inflation. So, I remind people, a lot of that QE was around Fed. The Fed and the central banks support securities so that would create deposits to banks. The banks support to put deposits in the central banks. So it was not new inflationary fiscal stimulus. Fiscal stimulus, which has been extraordinary around the world is by its nature, inflationary. And so we don't really know the outcome of that. But my view, and what I tell investors, we're going to build our businesses day in and day out regardless of interest rate environments, etc., and we have plans to adjust interest rate environments. We cannot do certain things. We can charge for certain things. We can do a whole bunch of different stuff. But the services is still required, moving money around the world, trading for people, underwriting securities, helping manage their money, and we'll be Okay. We'll work through it.\nOperator: Our next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. Good morning. Can you hear me?\nJennifer Piepszak: Yes. Hi, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. I had two questions. One was be interested in understanding how you are threading the needle between your outlook here for reserve and the potential to buy back stock. You've got the reserve level high with a base case outlook for unemployment that's above where we are today for the next six months, it looks like, or even longer. And your capital build is obviously continuing to increase here. So, how should we think about that? Could we imagine that your buyback could kick off before reserve release happens? And would you release reserves before the net charge-offs start to come through, like you mentioned, in second half 2021?\nJennifer Piepszak: Sure. So as we \u2013 first of all, on stock buybacks, obviously, we are restricted here in the fourth quarter. We are hopeful that the Fed will see what they need and get what they need in the resubmission to give them the confidence to revert to a more normal distribution framework under SCB in the first quarter. So, that's obviously the most important hurdle for us. And then if we have excess capital \u2013 and the reserve decision and the buyback decision are not related to one another, we are always going to make sure that we have our best estimate of losses that we're facing considering the uncertainty as well. And then, of course, our capital hierarchy would always look to grow our businesses, first and foremost. But if we have excess capital and if we do not have regulatory restrictions, you could see us buy back stock as early as the first quarter. And like I said, that wouldn't necessarily be related to a reserve release. The other thing on potential reserve releases, we obviously need to see the economy continue to deliver on the base case to give us the confidence that, that is what we're dealing with. But I would just say that, remember there was a capital release \u2013 a partial capital release on CECL builds. So, when you release reserves, only about half of that actually falls through to capital.\nBetsy Graseck: And could you talk a little \u2013 Jen, could you talk a little bit about the Slide 3 where you've got the base case outlook for unemployment? And just give us a sense as to what's driving this base case outlook for unemployment in 4Q 2020 at 9.5% and then 2Q 2021 at 8.5%? They're obviously above where we are today. And could you help us understand how you're thinking about flexing that going forward? What would change those assumptions?\nJennifer Piepszak: Yes. That's like largely, Betsy, a timing issue with when we actually run the models for the reserve. That's not necessarily, as you rightly point out, reflective of our autonomous latest outlook. So, we would, as we progress through the fourth quarter, use the latest outlook for the base case. But then again, as Jamie said, we look at a number of different scenarios. And depending upon what we think we're dealing with in terms of the uncertainty, we may continue to heavily weight the downside scenarios or maybe even more heavily weight the downside scenarios. We have to see. So, if you look at the weighted outcome of all of the scenarios that we use to derive the reserves, it is \u2013 we are prepared for a double-digit unemployment, peak unemployment level. But it would now start with the revised base case, shall I say, from our comments.\nJamie Dimon: Yes. Kind of just put into perspective just a little bit, the capital. I mean we have extraordinary amounts of capital, $200 billion. We've got 1.3 trillion of liquid assets and securities. And the way you should look at it is the 200 billion in just next eight quarters will earn PPNR like pre-tax, pre-provision earnings of roughly $80 billion, give or take. We don't know exactly what that's going to be. So with that 80 billion, if things get better, it will be more than that, and we take down reserves. If it didn't get worse, it may be about that. All the worse than that, we have to put up 20 billion. Even if you put up the 20 billion, in my view, that won't emerge in a quarter. That will emerge over several quarters, which also means you can buy \u2013 pay the dividend, buy back stock, have plenty of capital and still be very conservatively capitalized. And that's the reality of it. Okay. [Forget] all the other stuff you read. And we're conservative. We like to be conservative regarding loan loss reserves and capital. So, we'll be patient, but we have tremendous amount of wherewithal to do both when the time comes. And I hope we're allowed to do it too before the stock is much higher.\nJennifer Piepszak: And the 20 billion that Jamie referenced, as we talked about the extreme adverse scenario last quarter. So, you can think that that's the 20 billion that Jamie is referencing, if that is what\u2026\nJamie Dimon: Yes. And that 20 billion is unemployment of 12%, 13% that goes off into the better part of six quarters. I mean it's really extremely adverse. It's far worse than the CCAR case we just got.\nOperator: Our next question is from John McDonald of Autonomous Research.\nJohn McDonald: Good morning. Jen, you mentioned that next year, you have some tough revenue comps. Can you talk about the notion of expense flexibility at JP Morgan? Underneath the surface of flattish expenses, where are you on saving money from digitization and structural change? And how does that give you flexibility against where you'd like to be investing?\nJennifer Piepszak: Sure. So, first of all, it's early. We're still working through next year. So, I will certainly refine the guidance in the first quarter. But as it relates to expenses, we will \u2013 and you mentioned digital, that's one. We will continue to deliver on our structural expense efficiencies as we have been for the last several years. There will \u2013 as we do expect the world to normalize a bit, there will be opportunity in volume and revenue-related expenses, but we're going to continue to invest. And so there will be puts and takes, and we'll just provide you more detailed guidance in the first quarter.\nJohn McDonald: Okay. And as a follow-up, on capital, can you talk about the notion of reducing your SCB and maybe your GSIB surcharge footprint over time? I think you\u2019ve commented that there's potential to do that. What is the path and the route to doing that? And how do you feel about the prospects for those two things getting better over time?\nJennifer Piepszak: Sure. So, I'll start with GSIB, which is that we do expect to be in the 4% bucket at the end of this year, but it is not effective immediately. And so we will have 2021 to manage that back down. What I would say there is that with the Fed balance sheet at these levels possibly expanding that makes managing the GSIB back down quite challenging. So, in the absence of recalibration, which we remain hopeful about, managing that back down will certainly be challenging, but not impossible, but we'll really certainly think about any impact on our client franchise before we do anything. So, we have some time there. We could see recalibration that would help, but no doubt that, that's a challenge. On SCB, I'd start by saying it's scenario-dependent, of course. So, all else equal, we do think that we have opportunities to manage down the SCB, and so that can include transferring securities from AFS to held to maturity and then some other mechanical issues on our side that we're confident will now, all things equal, reduce our SCB. But again, it's scenario-dependent. So all that being said, John, I would just say that our expectation at this point over time is that our target capital level of 11.5% to 12% should be unchanged over time.\nJohn McDonald: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.\nKen Usdin: Thanks. Good morning. Jen, Jamie mentioned earlier that you've got 1.3 trillion of cash and securities. It didn't look like you really changed the size of the investments portfolio this quarter, but you did make a bunch of moves into held to maturity from available for sale. And I'm just wondering, you guys have talked about expectation that deposits might settle down, but they're continuing to grow. And so what can you do at this point and going forward with the move \u2013 starting to move some of that cash into things that might at least earn some more to protect the NII going forward? Thanks.\nJennifer Piepszak: Sure. So, I'll talk\u2026\nJamie Dimon: So, Jen, I just want to say that we're not going to do anything to protect the NII. We have $300 billion of cash we can invest today, and that becomes 400 billion. We're not going to invest it in stuff making 50, 60 or 70 basis points, so we get to see a teeny little bit more of NII. But we're going to make long-term decisions for the company. And if your NII gets squeezed a little bit, so be it. But we don't want to be in a position where we lose a lot of money because you may invest in some 5-year or 10-year securities, which you'll lose a lot if rates go up. So, we're not protecting NII.\nJennifer Piepszak: Yes. So, as a principal matter, it's important to remember that we manage the portfolio across multiple dimensions, not just optimizing NII, as Jamie said. And we're thinking about capital protection at these levels. But just in terms of the activity that you saw in the securities portfolio, we've been very active. We added about 160 billion through now the end of Q2. In Q3, we were active buyers and sellers because in Q3, we saw attractive selling opportunities, which made economic sense for us. So, just to Jamie's point, so you give up some NII, but it just made economic sense for us, but we have \u2013 we were also buying in the third quarter. We also focused on optimizing liabilities with the excess liquidity. So, you'll see that our debt is down nearly 40 billion from last quarter. So then just in terms of the transfer to held to maturity with the significant growth in securities portfolio, it just made sense from a capital protection perspective. And it's also helpful for SCB as I mentioned, and these were high-quality core holdings.\nKen Usdin: Yes. I fully agree on that duration point, Jamie. A follow-up just on \u2013 if you think about the fee businesses and some of the\u2026\nJamie Dimon: You guys should also be raising the question about why moving some of the held to maturity, reducing SCB? Like that is a rational thing, which I don't think it is. But that's what it is and that's what we're going to deal with. It's why we can drive down SCB.\nKen Usdin: Yes.\nJennifer Piepszak: On duration, with the 10-year has backed up a bit over the last couple of weeks, and so we have been \u2013 we'll remain opportunistic, but we have added at these levels.\nKen Usdin: Great. And then just one follow-up on just fees in general, you've got the consumer fee businesses that are still trying to get back to where they were a year ago. And then last quarter, Jamie had made the comment about cut it in half and trading, and it wasn't anywhere close to that, which was positive. It's still quite, quite good. And how you think through just the pushes and pulls between fees as you look forward, right, in terms of how much better do you think the consumer can get from where it is? So, how much, if any, are the institutional businesses over-earning relative to where they posted in the first half? Thanks.\nJennifer Piepszak: Sure. So on consumer fees, you'll see that consumer fees recovered a bit in the third quarter. The decline there was both release actions that we took, but also because of the higher cash buffers that consumers are experiencing that also impacts fees. And so \u2013 and that's a good thing, so we'll take that. So that did recover a bit in the third quarter, but that will take time to get back to what you might consider normalized levels. And then on the institutional side, we did expect to see markets normalize in the third quarter. We did see that a bit, but not as much as we had thought when we were at second quarter earnings. And IB fees also continued to be very strong in the third quarter, exceeding our expectations for what we might have thought in the second quarter. Looking forward, though, the fourth quarter is a tough compare. So, we do \u2013 and we do expect markets to continue to normalize. And then on the IB fee side, our pipeline is flattish to what it was last year. It's just still down a bit in M&A, but we did see M&A recover in the third quarter, and it's up in ECM. So, as I said, flattish in the fourth quarter feels about right at this point.\nOperator: Our next question is from Steve Chubak of Wolfe Research.\nSteve Chubak: Hi. Good morning. So, Jen, I was hoping you could speak to the expectations for loan growth across both the institutional and consumer channels. When do you anticipate we could begin to see balances quite positively? And separately, just what level of loan growth is contemplated in the 53 billion NII guide that you provided for 2021?\nJennifer Piepszak: Sure. So loan growth will be challenged, I think, for \u2013 in the short-term. On the wholesale side, I think we'll probably tread water at these levels, but increasing CEO confidence with M&A activity and capital investment should be supportive of more normalized loan growth, but that may take some time. On the consumer side, we are seeing cards continue to revert to more normal levels. And so that will continue into 2021, but that could be offset by continued prepays in the mortgage. So there will be puts and takes there. And then asset management, I think we'll continue to see solid growth. So net-net, not significant loan growth, but the mix will be helpful because of the card growth is supportive of a mix benefit on NII.\nSteve Chubak: Thanks for that and maybe a question for you, Jamie. You had alluded to potential for charging for additional products and services to offset rate pressures. And I was hoping you could speak to some of the areas where you might look to potentially charge clients. So just philosophically, how you're handicapping the risk of client attrition if competitors ultimately don't follow suit.\nJamie Dimon: There is \u2013 first of all, I don't think it's going to happen, so I don't spend too much time worrying about it. But we have, as a company matter, gone through everything we do and how we do it and how we respond to negative rates. I'm not going through account by account. But like I said, while these are necessary services, all the competitors \u2013 it's a competitive world, I agree with you. If competitors don't do stuff, you have a hard time doing it. But I think that you will see a lot of competitors respond to negative rates in a lot of different ways. So there will be an opportunity and something like that.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jim Mitchell of Seaport Global.\nJim Mitchell: Hey. Good morning. Maybe just a question on deposit growth, I think we've all been surprised at the continued growth. Can you just kind of talk to what you're seeing? It looked like we had further growth in September. Are you expecting this to continue? Is it sort of moving out of money markets into deposits? What do you think is driving the growth? And do you expect it to continue?\nJennifer Piepszak: Sure. So, there's no doubt that with the Fed being this active that there is significant excess liquidity in the system. We did think that we would see deposits normalized in the third quarter, both on consumer spending on the consumer side and then on just the wholesale side in places like security services, with asset managers holding cash on the sidelines. We didn't what we thought we would. So yes, we did continue to see deposit growth here in the third quarter. Going forward, I think that normalization is still just very much a part of our outlook except for that. Given that the normalization is a bit deferred here, it will likely be offset by the continued organic growth, perhaps more than offset by continued organic growth.\nJim Mitchell: Right. Makes sense. And then maybe a follow-up on credit. I mean I appreciate that we're not going to see charge-offs given where delinquencies are today. But what do you think \u2013 how do we think about delinquencies and what triggers you to either release or build reserves? I would imagine that we'll see it \u2013 you would be making those decisions before charge-offs. Where do we see delinquencies? You've had very good experience so far in your core book as well as the deferrals acting well. When do we \u2013 are we \u2013 I mean it just seems very surprising that we haven't seen delinquencies tick up yet in any material way. When do you expect that or is it really all dependent on sort of the goodwill of the government?\nJennifer Piepszak: Well, I think we \u2013 one of the reasons we haven't seen delinquencies tick up is because of the payment relief, but also the extraordinary support that has been provided through stimulus. So we'll probably see delinquencies tick up in the early part of 2021. We're not assuming further stimulus beyond the end of this year and how we think about reserves. So, we do think you'll start to see delinquencies tick up early 2021 and then charge-offs in the back half of 2021. I think future stimulus would give us more confidence in the economy delivering on the base case. There's just a lot of factors that we'll be looking at as we think about the right level of our reserves over the coming quarters, and delinquencies will be just one part of that.\nOperator: Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Good morning, Jennifer.\nJennifer Piepszak: Hi, Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy: I may have missed this, I had to jump off for a minute on the call, but can you give us some color as you've spoken very well about what's going on in the consumer credit area, but when you go into the commercial side of the business, can you share what the sectors that you're seeing the biggest challenges? And can you give us some color on the rerating process that you're going through on those credits that are in trouble today and what kind of deterioration you're seeing in those specific credits in terms of possibly write-downs or revaluations or if it's collateral, like in a commercial real estate loan?\nJennifer Piepszak: Sure. So, the sectors, I think, are ones that you would expect airlines, lodging, restaurants, other T&E, real estate, oil and gas. And those continue to be the sectors under the most pressure. When you look at downgrades here in the third quarter or \u2013 not here in the third quarter \u2013 in the third quarter, we saw downgrades slow a bit because in the second quarter, we saw significant downgrades just on the increased level of debt that companies were taking on. So we saw downgrades slow a bit in the third quarter, but we do expect downgrades to continue, particularly in real estate. And then elsewhere, in wholesale, I would say, CEO sentiment is guarded, but constructive.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And then as a follow-up, I know you \u2013 Jamie touched on interest rates and how you're very focused in growing your business in any rate environment. Could you give us some color, inflation, if it does pick up and if we get a steepening in the curve? Obviously, Chairman Powell has indicated he is not going to move on rates for quite some time, but if we're looking in your third quarter of, let's say, 2021 and then 10-year government bond yield is, let's say, the 125 basis points, can you just give us some color? I know that's not your prediction, but what would that do for the margin in revenues if we were fortunate enough now to see a steeper curve due to higher inflation?\nJennifer Piepszak: It's a great number. I don't have the sensitivity to hand if it would be \u2013 go ahead, Jamie.\nJamie Dimon: Yes. I'd tell you, there's a disclosure we make in the 10-Q, it shows what would happen if rates go up 100 basis points. I forgot the number, Jen, isn't like, I'm going to say, $2.5 billion a year, with the rolls and as a piece of that, but the smaller piece. The rolls \u2013 and that rolls in and compounds over time. But that's not the right way to look at it. You have to ask the why. If you have an active environment, rates are going up; we're going to have more volume and more NII. If you have stagflation, by a big chance, that's a really bad idea. So, the why is more important than just the what here.\nOperator: Our next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS. Saul, your line is open. Please proceed.\nSaul Martinez: Hello? Sorry about that, I was on mute. I wanted to follow-up on an earlier question, I think it was from Ken on \u2013 probably sales and trading. But you're tracking this year in sales and trading to a revenue of close to $30 billion, and if we go back to, say, 2010, shortly after the crisis, it's been pretty consistently the annual revenues in, say, the $18 billion to $21 billion range. There was obviously a lot of volatility on a quarterly basis, but it's generally been in that range. So, how do we think about, or frame the range of outcomes as market conditions normalize? Do you feel like there have been changes in terms of either share or market structure that maybe allow you to have a larger revenue base than the \u2013 and more revenues from those businesses than you have had historically even as market conditions normalize or is it just kind of too hard to tell? I'm just trying to think through because it obviously has a pretty big impact on your overall PPNR and revenue forecast going forward.\nJennifer Piepszak: I think that \u2013 I mean as you know, we're on pace for a record year. So, I think any compares are going to be challenging, and we do expect the market to continue to normalize. And that could be partially offset by share gains as you mentioned, but it is never a good idea to try to forecast market even early in the quarter, never mind the year before. I don't know, Jamie, do you want to add anything?\nJamie Dimon: I'd say, look, this is a ground working. We got a lot of tough competitors, and we're all building systems and stuff like that. They can do a better job to that. Almost impossible to forecast short-term numbers in that.\nSaul Martinez: Yes. No \u2013 and I understand that. I totally get that and appreciate that. It's just that you're kind of tracking to a revenue that's about 50% higher than what you've done in the post \u2013 any year in the post-crisis environment or to that, somewhere to that effect. So just that delta between the current run rate and what has been a more normalized run rate is pretty sizable. So, I'm just trying to get any color in terms of kind of thinking through kind of a range of outcomes for just where that could settle in, and not necessarily in a given quarter, per se, but just more on a normalized base as you think about the business as a whole.\nJamie Dimon: Yes. So, I'd say our trader did \u2013 have done an exceptional job, but I would say the second quarter will not be typical and the third quarter probably won't. Hopefully, it might be better than what it's been in the past couple of years, but we don't know. But remember, the market itself, total bonds, total assets under management, total credit cards, total mortgage products, total global products, that's growing over time. So there is an underlying growth as we spread, we sell them around, our competition moves around.\nOperator: Our next question is from Andrew Lim of Societe Generale.\nAndrew Lim: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So, the first one, you've got 33.8 billion of reserves. I guess that's in line with an extreme adverse scenario. I know you can't tell what's going to happen going forward given these many different variables, but we've already seen some of that being released. So, I was wondering if we had the base case scenario pan out over the coming years, how much of that 33.8 billion should we expect to be released back through the P&L and over what time period?\nJennifer Piepszak: So I'll start by saying we're not reserved for the extreme adverse scenario. So, we are reserved for something worse than the base case because we have put heavy weight on scenarios that are worse than the base case, but we are not reserved for the extreme adverse scenario. And the release this quarter was, first of all, very small in the grand scheme of things and was almost exclusively related to portfolio runoff or the exposure changes, and not anything to do with the change in our outlook. And then if the economy delivers the base case, you will see reserve releases from us in coming quarters, but it is very, very difficult to try to tell you how much and when.\nAndrew Lim: I mean surely, you've got like \u2013 you can make like an estimate of your reserves if you did assume the base case going forward. And I guess, it's the difference between what you are \u2026\nJamie Dimon: I've already said that the base case \u2013 if the Fed base case happens, there's probably something like $10 billion of reserve.\nAndrew Lim: $10 billion over reserved?\nJamie Dimon: Over reserved, if that happens.\nAndrew Lim: [Indiscernible] \nJamie Dimon: No, no. $10 billion over reserved.\nAndrew Lim: Got it. Understood.\nJennifer Piepszak: And I mentioned it earlier, it's just important to remember that there were capital modifications to CECL. So, only about half of that ends up in capital, because as you release your reserves \u2026\nAndrew Lim: Yes, of course.\nJennifer Piepszak: Yes.\nAndrew Lim: Got it. Understood. Thanks for that. And then just a follow-up question on your CET1 ratio, you had a nice pickup there this quarter. Obviously, you've had strong earnings, but you've also had a near 2% reduction in risk-weighted assets. I'm just wondering if you could give a bit more color on the moving parts there and how you expect that to pan out in the coming quarters.\nJennifer Piepszak: That's largely \u2013 the RWA reduction was largely on revolver pay downs. So, I wouldn't expect that kind of pace to continue. We will continue to bill if we're not allowed to buy back stock, but we will continue to build capital on earnings, so probably less so on RWA reduction.\nOperator: Our next question is from Charles Peabody of Portales Partners.\nCharles Peabody: Yes. Good morning. A question about your rate sensitivity to the long-end, if I look at a time series going back to the second quarter of last year, your rate sensitivity has increased every single quarter to a steepening yield curve. In other words, your NII would improve for more than the yield curve steepened at the long-end. So my question is, was that an intended action or residual effect? Because I did notice that you've been adding fairly significantly to your MBS portfolio.\nJennifer Piepszak: Yes. So Charles, I don't know precisely the answer to that, but it's largely going to be, I'm assuming, on the growth in our deposit base, which then has supported the growth in the securities portfolio.\nCharles Peabody: Okay. It's substantial. I mean, if you go back to the second quarter of last year, you had a $600 million potential increase, and second quarter of this year was $1.7 billion. Anyway, my second question is related to the legacy impairment charge, can you give us some color around that, what sort of asset class that was in? And is it over half a billion, under half a billion?\nJennifer Piepszak: So, under half a billion of what remains, and it was a legacy investment that we took an impairment on, and it's not meaningful in the grand scheme of things.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW.\nBrian Kleinhanzl: Okay. Thanks. Just a quick question to start with, maybe as you think about kind of what you've been doing for a customer accommodation. As it relates to the pandemic, I know there would have been fee waivers first quarter, second quarter of this year. But what kind of customer accommodation was happening in the third quarter? Is it kind of a clean number from a fees perspective in the third quarter or is there still a certain level of accommodation going on?\nJennifer Piepszak: There is probably \u2013 I don't actually know. Jason and team can get you the detail. It's less than what it was in the second quarter, and it's more \u2013 the \u2013 what we mean in terms of the reduction in fees is more a function of cash buffers.\nBrian Kleinhanzl: Okay. And then is there a way that you can give an update on the IB pipeline, but on a geographic basis? I mean as we've seen negative highlights around COVID kind of around the world, is there different pipelines building in different regions? Thanks.\nJennifer Piepszak: There's less of a regional story. But from a product perspective, overall, we're flattish to last year, but M&A is a little bit lower. Importantly though, we're covered quite nicely in the third quarter, and ECM is a little bit higher, but overall flattish.\nOperator: And we have no further questions at this time.\nJennifer Piepszak: Okay. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jennifer Piepszak",
            "content": "Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'll take you through the presentation, which as always, is available on our website. And we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $9.4 billion, EPS of $2.92, and revenue of $29.9 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 19%. Included in these results are $524 million of legal expenses, primarily related to the resolution of legal matters announced last month. Overall for the quarter, while we're still in a very uncertain environment, our underlying business fundamentals performed quite well. So, I'll just touch on a few highlights here before getting into the line-of-business results. The CIB continued its strong performance with IB fees of 9% and markets revenue up 30% year-on-year and we had record revenue in AWM, up 5% year-on-year. On deposits, while we expected to see some normalization in our balances, instead, we saw another quarter of growth, with average deposits up 5% sequentially. And notably, we moved into the Number 1 spot in U.S. retail deposits with 9.8% market share, gaining 50 basis points of share year-on-year. On the other hand, average loans were down 4% quarter-on-quarter, primarily on revolver pay downs from our Wholesale clients. With that, let's turn to Page 2 for more detail on the third-quarter results. We reported revenue of $29.9 billion, which was flat year-on-year. Net interest income was down approximately $1.2 billion or 9% on lower rates, partly offset by higher market NII and balance sheet growth. And noninterest revenue was up 1.2 billion or 7%, primarily driven by CIB, including higher banking and markets revenues, as well as net securities gains in corporate.  Expenses of 16.9 billion were up approximately 500 million or 3% year-on-year on the higher legal expenses that I already mentioned. This quarter, credit costs of approximately 600 million were down 900 million year-on-year, primarily driven by modest reserve releases, which you can see in more detail on Page 3. We released approximately 600 million of reserves this quarter, primarily on run-off in Home Lending and changes in Wholesale loan exposure. Charge-offs across our portfolios remain relatively low and, in fact, were down slightly year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. While we could see an uptick in charge-offs over the next few quarters, given payment relief and government stimulus already provided, and we don't expect any meaningful increases in charge-offs until the second half of 2021. As you can see at the bottom of the page, our updated base case reflects some improvement from last quarter. However, the medium-to-longer term is still highly uncertain in particular as it relates to future stimulus. And so we remain heavily weighted to our downsize scenarios, and with reserves of 33.8 billion, we're prepared for something worse than the base case. And now turning to Page 4, I'll provide a quick update on what we're seeing in our customer assistance programs. You can see here that the vast majority of Card & Auto customers have exited relief, and so what's left in deferral is primarily in Home Lending, including 11 billion of owned loans and 17 billion in our service portfolio. And in terms of what we're seeing with our customers that have exited relief, approximately 90% of accounts remain current. Now, turning to balance sheet and capital on Page 5. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13%, up 60 basis points versus last quarter on earnings generation and lower RWA, partially offset by dividends of $2.8 billion. And it's worth noting that we have over 1.3 trillion of liquidity sources available to us across HQLA and unencumbered securities. Now let's go to our businesses, starting with Consumer & Community Banking on Page 6. CCB reported net income of $3.9 billion and an ROE of 29%. Revenue of 12.8 billion was down 9% year-on-year driven by deposit margins compression and lower Card NII on lower balances, partially offset by deposit growth and strong Home Lending production margins. Deposit growth was 28% year-on-year, up over 190 billion, largely on lower spending and higher cash buffers across both our consumer and small business customers, as well as organic growth. Client investment assets were up 11% year-on-year driven by both net inflows and market performance. Overall, consumer customers are holding up well. They have built savings relative to pre-COVID levels and at the same time, lower debt balances. With regard to digital adoption, early signs suggest the increased customer migration to digital will persist. In fact, nearly 69% of our customers are digitally active, and that's up 3 percentage points year-on-year and accelerating. And quick deposit now represents more than 40% of all check deposits versus 30% pre-COVID. Moving on to consumer lending. Starting with Home Lending, total originations were down 10% year-on-year driven by correspondent. However, consumer volumes were up 46% year-on-year. And notably, more than half of consumer applications were completed digitally, twice the level of the first quarter. In Cards, while our net sales were down 8% year-on-year, spend continued to improve throughout the quarter. And in the month of September, sales were down only 3% year-on-year, reflecting the lowest decline since March. Retail, which is a significant portion of overall spend, was a bright spot, reaching double-digit year-on-year growth in the third quarter, largely driven by card-not-present transactions. And then in Auto, record originations for the quarter of 11.4 billion were up 25% year-on-year. Total CCB loans were down 7% year-on-year, with Home Lending down 15% due to portfolio run-off and Cards down 11% on lower spend, offset by Business Banking, up 83% due PPP loans. Expenses of 6.8 billion were down 4% predominantly due to lower marketing investments. And lastly, credit cost of 794 million included a $300 million reserve release in Home Lending and net charge-offs of 1.1 billion driven by Cards. Now turning to the Corporate & Investment Bank on Page 7. CIB reported net income of $4.3 billion and an ROE of 21% on revenue of 11.5 billion. Investment Banking revenue of 2.1 billion was up 12% year-on-year and down sequentially off an all-time record quarter, and we maintained our Number 1 rank in IB fees year to date. The quarter's performance was largely driven by our equity capital markets business, which saw an uptick in IPO issuance driven by a strong equity backdrop with stocks trading at or near all-time highs. In advisory, we were down 15% year-on-year, largely impacted by the muted M&A announced volumes in the first half of the year. However, we saw a surge in M&A activity this quarter with announced volumes returning to pre-COVID levels as companies began to shift their focus from day-to-day operations to more strategic and opportunistic thinking.  Debt underwriting fees were also up 5% year-on-year, but down 21% sequentially as we saw investment-grade activity return to more normalized levels from the record volumes we saw in the second quarter. The leveraged finance market continued to recover with high-yield spreads approaching pre-COVID levels and some notable acquisition financing deals closing. We maintained our Number 1 rank in overall wallet, and we're the leaders in lead left across leveraged finance. In equity underwriting, fees were up 42% year-on-year, resulting in the best third quarter ever, primarily driven by our strong performance in IPOs and follow-on's. In terms of the outlook, we expect fourth quarter IB fees to be roughly flat versus a strong quarter last year and down sequentially. However, if valuations remain elevated, we could continue to see momentum in capital markets. Moving to markets, total revenue was 6.6 billion, up 30% year-on-year. While activity continued to normalize, with spread, volume and volatility reducing from the elevated levels of the first half of the year, the performance was strong throughout the quarter and across products, reflecting the resilience in earnings power of this franchise through a broad range of market conditions. Fixed income was up 29% year-on-year against a strong third quarter last year driven by a favorable trading environment across products, notably in commodities, as well as elevated client activity in credit and securitized products. Equities was up 32% year-on-year on continued robust client activity in equity derivatives, as well as a recovery in prime balances and a solid performance in cash. Looking forward, it's important to remember that 4Q 2019 performance was very strong, making for a difficult year-on-year comparison. And obviously, forecasting market's performance remains challenging in this environment. Wholesale Payments revenue of 1.3 billion was down 5% year-on-year driven by deposit margin compression, largely offset by balance growth, as well as a reporting reclassification in merchant services. Securities Services revenue of $1 billion was flat year-on-year, where higher deposit balances were offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of 5.8 billion were up 5%, compared to the prior year, largely due to higher legal expense, partially offset by lower structural and volume and revenue-related expenses. Now moving on to Commercial Banking on Page 8. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.1 billion and an ROE of 19%. Revenue of 2.3 billion was flat year-on-year driven by deposit margin compression, offset by higher balances and fees and higher lending revenue. Gross Investment Banking revenue of 840 million was up 20% year-on-year on increased debt and equity underwriting activity. Expenses of 966 million were up 3% year-on-year. Average loans were up 5% year-on-year, but down 7% quarter-on-quarter due to declines in revolver utilization by C&I clients and lower origination volume in CRE. Deposits of 248 billion were up 44% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on-quarter as client balances remain elevated. Finally, our credit costs were a net benefit of 147 million, including a $207 million reserve release and net charge-offs of 60 million. Now on to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 9. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of 877 million with pre-tax margin of 31% and ROE of 32%. Record revenue of 3.7 billion for the quarter was up 5% year-on-year as growth in deposit and loan balances, along with higher management fees and brokerage activity, were largely offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of 2.6 billion were flat year-on-year, and credit costs were a net benefit of 51 million, primarily due to reserve releases.  For the quarter, net long-term inflows of 34 billion were positive across all channels and driven by fixed income and equity. At the same time, we saw net liquidity outflows of 33 billion. AUM of 2.6 trillion and overall client assets of 3.5 trillion, up 16% and 15% year-on-year, respectively, were driven by net inflows into liquidity and long-term products, as well as higher market levels. And finally, deposits were up 23% year-on-year, and loans were up 13% with strength in both wholesale and mortgage lending. Now on to corporate on Page 10. Corporate reported a net loss of approximately 700 million. Revenue was a loss of 339 million, down $1 billion year-over-year, driven by lower net interest income on lower rates, including the impact of faster prepays on mortgage securities, partially offset by 466 million of net securities gains in the quarter. Expenses of 719 million were up 438 million year-on-year, primarily due to an impairment on a legacy investment.  Now let's turn to Page 11 for the outlook. You'll see here that our full year outlook for 2020 remains in-line with what I said at Barclays. We expect net interest income to be approximately 55 billion and adjusted expenses to be approximately 66 billion. And while we don't have anything on the page for 2021 and we're not planning to do Investor Day, we'll share more color with you on the outlook in the first quarter of next year.  So, to wrap up, even though recent economic data has been more constructive than we would have expected earlier this year, there remains a significant amount of uncertainty. And so we continue to prepare for a broad range of outcomes while focusing on serving our customers, clients and communities through this time. With that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. Sure. So, in terms of how we think about the revenue outlook for 2021, first of all, it's early and we'll come back to you in the first quarter with more details, but it is true that if we think about the NII outlook that that will be under pressure relative to 2020 and I can't give more detail on that. But also, we are on pace for record revenue in markets and investment banking, and so that will be a tough compare. Having said that, we're not going to change the way we run the company because of what might be temporary rate headwinds, and we see significant franchise value in the growth that we're seeing in the deposit base. And with that branch expansion \u2013 we are continuing on our plans in branch expansion. We have, I think, almost a 120 branches open in our expansion markets. We'll do more than another 150 so far this year. We got approval to enter 10 additional states, which we'll ultimately put us in all lower 48. So, we continue with the branch expansion and remain very excited about it with those new branches, in most cases, performing well above the original business case. Sure. So there, I had said at Barclays that the current run rate was a good place to start. So 13 billion is a good place to start and for 2021 reflects the impact of the rate environment and some normalization in market's NII. But from there, balance sheet growth and mix should be supportive throughout the year. And so for the full-year of 2021, my best view at this point would be 53 billion, plus or minus. But yes, we'll sharpen our pencils on that and continue to provide updates. But right now, full year, 53 billion. Hi, Glenn. Sure. So, the reserve release, as you said, was largely on portfolio run-off and changes in exposure in Wholesale, so not a reflection of a change in our outlook. And then the increase in nonaccrual loans is \u2013 on the consumer side is mortgage, and it represents the customers that have come out of forbearance and are not paying. And so as you saw on that slide, the payment deferral slide, about 90% are still current. The other 10% has now been reflected in the nonaccrual exposure. So that is all mortgage. And then the increase in nonaccrual on the wholesale side was just a few name-specific downgrades, which are in sectors you would expect, as you just said, retail-related real estate and oil and gas.  And then more broadly on commercial real estate, I'll just share that we feel adequate reserve for what we're facing. But if you look at rent collection as an example overall, with the exception of retail, between 85% and 95%. And then even retail in the month of September was about 80% \u2013 has recovered to about 80%. So still a lot of uncertainty there, but we feel adequately reserved. Okay. So I'll just start, Mike, with, first of all, the increase in nonaccrual was on mortgage. And when you look at the LTV on those \u2013 the loan to value on those loans, that's what is embedded into how we're thinking about the \u2013 what charge-offs will look like in the near term. There's still very healthy LTVs on those loans. So really, when we talk about losses really emerging in a significant way, not until the back half of 2021, we're talking about cards. And just given the amount of stimulus and payment relief and just support in the system, we haven't seen the delinquency buckets begin to fill up, and we charge 180 days past due in cards. So that is primarily just a timing issue as it relates to cards. We could see increases in charge-offs in the next few quarters on the wholesale side or maybe here and there on the consumer side. It's just that the meaningful change in charge-offs, we don't expect until the second half of 2021. It's a very difficult question to answer. It's very different, of course, because the GFC was heavily mortgage-related, and this will probably be less so. We also \u2013 our portfolios are in significantly better shape coming into this, whether it's mortgage or card. But just given the amount of uncertainty about where this could go, we still have 12 million people unemployed, I think it's very difficult. I don't know, Jamie, whether you would add. So, I think it's difficult to know. I think the purpose of it was to change the outcome, not just delay the losses. But it's difficult to know. People sort of described it as a bridge, and the question is whether the bridge will be long enough and strong enough to bridge people back to employment and bridge small businesses back to normalcy. So, I think it remains to be seen. As Jamie said, we're obviously preparing for it to not necessarily change the outcome, obviously, because we built significant reserves. So, we're prepared for it to be a delay rather than change the outcome. Yes. Hi, Betsy. Sure. So as we \u2013 first of all, on stock buybacks, obviously, we are restricted here in the fourth quarter. We are hopeful that the Fed will see what they need and get what they need in the resubmission to give them the confidence to revert to a more normal distribution framework under SCB in the first quarter. So, that's obviously the most important hurdle for us. And then if we have excess capital \u2013 and the reserve decision and the buyback decision are not related to one another, we are always going to make sure that we have our best estimate of losses that we're facing considering the uncertainty as well. And then, of course, our capital hierarchy would always look to grow our businesses, first and foremost. But if we have excess capital and if we do not have regulatory restrictions, you could see us buy back stock as early as the first quarter. And like I said, that wouldn't necessarily be related to a reserve release. The other thing on potential reserve releases, we obviously need to see the economy continue to deliver on the base case to give us the confidence that, that is what we're dealing with. But I would just say that, remember there was a capital release \u2013 a partial capital release on CECL builds. So, when you release reserves, only about half of that actually falls through to capital. Yes. That's like largely, Betsy, a timing issue with when we actually run the models for the reserve. That's not necessarily, as you rightly point out, reflective of our autonomous latest outlook. So, we would, as we progress through the fourth quarter, use the latest outlook for the base case. But then again, as Jamie said, we look at a number of different scenarios. And depending upon what we think we're dealing with in terms of the uncertainty, we may continue to heavily weight the downside scenarios or maybe even more heavily weight the downside scenarios. We have to see. So, if you look at the weighted outcome of all of the scenarios that we use to derive the reserves, it is \u2013 we are prepared for a double-digit unemployment, peak unemployment level. But it would now start with the revised base case, shall I say, from our comments. And the 20 billion that Jamie referenced, as we talked about the extreme adverse scenario last quarter. So, you can think that that's the 20 billion that Jamie is referencing, if that is what... Sure. So, first of all, it's early. We're still working through next year. So, I will certainly refine the guidance in the first quarter. But as it relates to expenses, we will \u2013 and you mentioned digital, that's one. We will continue to deliver on our structural expense efficiencies as we have been for the last several years. There will \u2013 as we do expect the world to normalize a bit, there will be opportunity in volume and revenue-related expenses, but we're going to continue to invest. And so there will be puts and takes, and we'll just provide you more detailed guidance in the first quarter. Sure. So, I'll start with GSIB, which is that we do expect to be in the 4% bucket at the end of this year, but it is not effective immediately. And so we will have 2021 to manage that back down. What I would say there is that with the Fed balance sheet at these levels possibly expanding that makes managing the GSIB back down quite challenging. So, in the absence of recalibration, which we remain hopeful about, managing that back down will certainly be challenging, but not impossible, but we'll really certainly think about any impact on our client franchise before we do anything. So, we have some time there. We could see recalibration that would help, but no doubt that, that's a challenge. On SCB, I'd start by saying it's scenario-dependent, of course. So, all else equal, we do think that we have opportunities to manage down the SCB, and so that can include transferring securities from AFS to held to maturity and then some other mechanical issues on our side that we're confident will now, all things equal, reduce our SCB. But again, it's scenario-dependent. So all that being said, John, I would just say that our expectation at this point over time is that our target capital level of 11.5% to 12% should be unchanged over time. Sure. So, I'll talk... Yes. So, as a principal matter, it's important to remember that we manage the portfolio across multiple dimensions, not just optimizing NII, as Jamie said. And we're thinking about capital protection at these levels. But just in terms of the activity that you saw in the securities portfolio, we've been very active. We added about 160 billion through now the end of Q2. In Q3, we were active buyers and sellers because in Q3, we saw attractive selling opportunities, which made economic sense for us. So, just to Jamie's point, so you give up some NII, but it just made economic sense for us, but we have \u2013 we were also buying in the third quarter. We also focused on optimizing liabilities with the excess liquidity. So, you'll see that our debt is down nearly 40 billion from last quarter. So then just in terms of the transfer to held to maturity with the significant growth in securities portfolio, it just made sense from a capital protection perspective. And it's also helpful for SCB as I mentioned, and these were high-quality core holdings. On duration, with the 10-year has backed up a bit over the last couple of weeks, and so we have been \u2013 we'll remain opportunistic, but we have added at these levels. Sure. So on consumer fees, you'll see that consumer fees recovered a bit in the third quarter. The decline there was both release actions that we took, but also because of the higher cash buffers that consumers are experiencing that also impacts fees. And so \u2013 and that's a good thing, so we'll take that. So that did recover a bit in the third quarter, but that will take time to get back to what you might consider normalized levels. And then on the institutional side, we did expect to see markets normalize in the third quarter. We did see that a bit, but not as much as we had thought when we were at second quarter earnings. And IB fees also continued to be very strong in the third quarter, exceeding our expectations for what we might have thought in the second quarter. Looking forward, though, the fourth quarter is a tough compare. So, we do \u2013 and we do expect markets to continue to normalize. And then on the IB fee side, our pipeline is flattish to what it was last year. It's just still down a bit in M&A, but we did see M&A recover in the third quarter, and it's up in ECM. So, as I said, flattish in the fourth quarter feels about right at this point. Sure. So loan growth will be challenged, I think, for \u2013 in the short-term. On the wholesale side, I think we'll probably tread water at these levels, but increasing CEO confidence with M&A activity and capital investment should be supportive of more normalized loan growth, but that may take some time. On the consumer side, we are seeing cards continue to revert to more normal levels. And so that will continue into 2021, but that could be offset by continued prepays in the mortgage. So there will be puts and takes there. And then asset management, I think we'll continue to see solid growth. So net-net, not significant loan growth, but the mix will be helpful because of the card growth is supportive of a mix benefit on NII. Sure. So, there's no doubt that with the Fed being this active that there is significant excess liquidity in the system. We did think that we would see deposits normalized in the third quarter, both on consumer spending on the consumer side and then on just the wholesale side in places like security services, with asset managers holding cash on the sidelines. We didn't what we thought we would. So yes, we did continue to see deposit growth here in the third quarter. Going forward, I think that normalization is still just very much a part of our outlook except for that. Given that the normalization is a bit deferred here, it will likely be offset by the continued organic growth, perhaps more than offset by continued organic growth. Well, I think we \u2013 one of the reasons we haven't seen delinquencies tick up is because of the payment relief, but also the extraordinary support that has been provided through stimulus. So we'll probably see delinquencies tick up in the early part of 2021. We're not assuming further stimulus beyond the end of this year and how we think about reserves. So, we do think you'll start to see delinquencies tick up early 2021 and then charge-offs in the back half of 2021. I think future stimulus would give us more confidence in the economy delivering on the base case. There's just a lot of factors that we'll be looking at as we think about the right level of our reserves over the coming quarters, and delinquencies will be just one part of that. Hi, Gerard. Sure. So, the sectors, I think, are ones that you would expect airlines, lodging, restaurants, other T&E, real estate, oil and gas. And those continue to be the sectors under the most pressure. When you look at downgrades here in the third quarter or \u2013 not here in the third quarter \u2013 in the third quarter, we saw downgrades slow a bit because in the second quarter, we saw significant downgrades just on the increased level of debt that companies were taking on. So we saw downgrades slow a bit in the third quarter, but we do expect downgrades to continue, particularly in real estate. And then elsewhere, in wholesale, I would say, CEO sentiment is guarded, but constructive. It's a great number. I don't have the sensitivity to hand if it would be \u2013 go ahead, Jamie. I think that \u2013 I mean as you know, we're on pace for a record year. So, I think any compares are going to be challenging, and we do expect the market to continue to normalize. And that could be partially offset by share gains as you mentioned, but it is never a good idea to try to forecast market even early in the quarter, never mind the year before. I don't know, Jamie, do you want to add anything? So I'll start by saying we're not reserved for the extreme adverse scenario. So, we are reserved for something worse than the base case because we have put heavy weight on scenarios that are worse than the base case, but we are not reserved for the extreme adverse scenario. And the release this quarter was, first of all, very small in the grand scheme of things and was almost exclusively related to portfolio runoff or the exposure changes, and not anything to do with the change in our outlook. And then if the economy delivers the base case, you will see reserve releases from us in coming quarters, but it is very, very difficult to try to tell you how much and when. And I mentioned it earlier, it's just important to remember that there were capital modifications to CECL. So, only about half of that ends up in capital, because as you release your reserves ... Yes. That's largely \u2013 the RWA reduction was largely on revolver pay downs. So, I wouldn't expect that kind of pace to continue. We will continue to bill if we're not allowed to buy back stock, but we will continue to build capital on earnings, so probably less so on RWA reduction. Yes. So Charles, I don't know precisely the answer to that, but it's largely going to be, I'm assuming, on the growth in our deposit base, which then has supported the growth in the securities portfolio. So, under half a billion of what remains, and it was a legacy investment that we took an impairment on, and it's not meaningful in the grand scheme of things. There is probably \u2013 I don't actually know. Jason and team can get you the detail. It's less than what it was in the second quarter, and it's more \u2013 the \u2013 what we mean in terms of the reduction in fees is more a function of cash buffers. There's less of a regional story. But from a product perspective, overall, we're flattish to last year, but M&A is a little bit lower. Importantly though, we're covered quite nicely in the third quarter, and ECM is a little bit higher, but overall flattish. Okay. Thanks, everyone."

            "name": "Jamie Dimon",
            "content": "[Indiscernible] to give you a little bit of longer-term view. There's not one single business or not any bankers, countries, products, digital. We're growing securities services and cash management services. We're adding \u2013 we're growing the Chase wealth management business. We're adding private bankers. We're adding products in Asset Management. And we kind of look through all the things \u2013 I kind of call them the weather. We just keep on growing. The branch expansion is one example of that. We never stopped doing that. We never stopped gaining credit card products. We never stopped growing digital Home Lending products, and we'll be doing that for the next decade. And of course, you have all these ins and out from what I call the weather: NII spreads, margins, markets, etcetera, but the goal is always the same. You grow the business to serve your clients around the world. Well, since we have you all on the line, our doors and our telephone lines are wide open. We would be very interested, and we do think you will see consolidation in the business, but we're not going to be more specific than that. [Indiscernible] product-sensitive, the systems, the technology, the business projects, the ability to execute, there's lot \u2013 there are a lot of issues that will determine whether something makes sense for us in there. Yes. And, Mike, about policy, first of all, I wouldn't say that policy is determinative here because this is unprecedented times. And what we're saying is that policy will matter and will skew the odds [indiscernible] better outcome. So, I think the policy \u2013 obviously, the Fed is doing what it can to keep markets open, but the policy on the fiscal side is just some kind of continuation of unemployment insurance and PPP. So, those are the two most vulnerable areas to just maximize the chance that we'll have better outcomes and I do think that over time, intelligent return to work. I caution people \u2013 remember, 100 million people go to work every day. So the complete focus is on the 50 million who don't go to work. But the 100 million who go to work, it's rather safe. There's a lot of examples where you do the social distancing and the cleaning and all the various things like that, that it may be safer than being home in your community. And so \u2013 but the getting back to work is a little bit important because you look at cities and travel and a whole bunch of stuff. There are a lot of people who are under a lot of stress and strain who won't be able to survive another year of complete closedown. So, the other policy is numerous, rational, thoughtful return to the office, done properly, which will help all those businesses support the big office towers and buildings and stuff like that. And those two things will maximize the chance of good outcome. They don't guarantee the chance of a good outcome. It's very hard \u2013 I agree with you, Jen. It's very hard to say. And, Mike, it depends on the outcome. Again, we look at the good case, the medium case, the relative adverse case and the extreme adverse case. And there, the answers are completely different, and we don't know the future. So it's hard to predict what it's going to be. But our reserves are prepared for relative to the adverse case, which is equal to the \u2013 roughly equivalent to CCAR extreme adverse case that we just got, roughly. Again, it's very hard to compare apples-to-apples in these things. Well, you guys know that's a forecast of the future. It's hard to tell. I think negative interest rates are a bad idea and will probably force, over time, the banking industry to strength, which means they'd be buying back stock and doing other things with their capital. But we're able to handle low rates, and we can have decent returns at low rates. I think it's a bad long-term strategy. I also think it's a bad idea for you all to assume they're going to continue like that forever. I mean we had massive global QE in the last go around, and we didn't have inflation. So, I remind people, a lot of that QE was around Fed. The Fed and the central banks support securities so that would create deposits to banks. The banks support to put deposits in the central banks. So it was not new inflationary fiscal stimulus. Fiscal stimulus, which has been extraordinary around the world is by its nature, inflationary. And so we don't really know the outcome of that. But my view, and what I tell investors, we're going to build our businesses day in and day out regardless of interest rate environments, etc., and we have plans to adjust interest rate environments. We cannot do certain things. We can charge for certain things. We can do a whole bunch of different stuff. But the services is still required, moving money around the world, trading for people, underwriting securities, helping manage their money, and we'll be Okay. We'll work through it. Yes. Kind of just put into perspective just a little bit, the capital. I mean we have extraordinary amounts of capital, $200 billion. We've got 1.3 trillion of liquid assets and securities. And the way you should look at it is the 200 billion in just next eight quarters will earn PPNR like pre-tax, pre-provision earnings of roughly $80 billion, give or take. We don't know exactly what that's going to be. So with that 80 billion, if things get better, it will be more than that, and we take down reserves. If it didn't get worse, it may be about that. All the worse than that, we have to put up 20 billion. Even if you put up the 20 billion, in my view, that won't emerge in a quarter. That will emerge over several quarters, which also means you can buy \u2013 pay the dividend, buy back stock, have plenty of capital and still be very conservatively capitalized. And that's the reality of it. Okay. [Forget] all the other stuff you read. And we're conservative. We like to be conservative regarding loan loss reserves and capital. So, we'll be patient, but we have tremendous amount of wherewithal to do both when the time comes. And I hope we're allowed to do it too before the stock is much higher. Yes. And that 20 billion is unemployment of 12%, 13% that goes off into the better part of six quarters. I mean it's really extremely adverse. It's far worse than the CCAR case we just got. So, Jen, I just want to say that we're not going to do anything to protect the NII. We have $300 billion of cash we can invest today, and that becomes 400 billion. We're not going to invest it in stuff making 50, 60 or 70 basis points, so we get to see a teeny little bit more of NII. But we're going to make long-term decisions for the company. And if your NII gets squeezed a little bit, so be it. But we don't want to be in a position where we lose a lot of money because you may invest in some 5-year or 10-year securities, which you'll lose a lot if rates go up. So, we're not protecting NII. You guys should also be raising the question about why moving some of the held to maturity, reducing SCB? Like that is a rational thing, which I don't think it is. But that's what it is and that's what we're going to deal with. It's why we can drive down SCB. There is \u2013 first of all, I don't think it's going to happen, so I don't spend too much time worrying about it. But we have, as a company matter, gone through everything we do and how we do it and how we respond to negative rates. I'm not going through account by account. But like I said, while these are necessary services, all the competitors \u2013 it's a competitive world, I agree with you. If competitors don't do stuff, you have a hard time doing it. But I think that you will see a lot of competitors respond to negative rates in a lot of different ways. So there will be an opportunity and something like that. Yes. I'd tell you, there's a disclosure we make in the 10-Q, it shows what would happen if rates go up 100 basis points. I forgot the number, Jen, isn't like, I'm going to say, $2.5 billion a year, with the rolls and as a piece of that, but the smaller piece. The rolls \u2013 and that rolls in and compounds over time. But that's not the right way to look at it. You have to ask the why. If you have an active environment, rates are going up; we're going to have more volume and more NII. If you have stagflation, by a big chance, that's a really bad idea. So, the why is more important than just the what here. I'd say, look, this is a ground working. We got a lot of tough competitors, and we're all building systems and stuff like that. They can do a better job to that. Almost impossible to forecast short-term numbers in that. Yes. So, I'd say our trader did \u2013 have done an exceptional job, but I would say the second quarter will not be typical and the third quarter probably won't. Hopefully, it might be better than what it's been in the past couple of years, but we don't know. But remember, the market itself, total bonds, total assets under management, total credit cards, total mortgage products, total global products, that's growing over time. So there is an underlying growth as we spread, we sell them around, our competition moves around. I've already said that the base case \u2013 if the Fed base case happens, there's probably something like $10 billion of reserve. Over reserved, if that happens. No, no. $10 billion over reserved."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Piepszak. Ms. Piepszak, please go ahead.\nJennifer Piepszak: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll take you through the presentation, which as always, is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back. Starting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $4.7 billion, EPS of $1.38 and record revenue of $33.8 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 9%. Included in these results are a number of significant items. First, a credit reserve build of $8.9 billion, and then approximately $700 million of gain in our bridge book and $500 million of gains in credit adjustments and other, both of which represent reversals of some of the losses we took in the first quarter. As we continue to navigate this challenging and uncertain environment, this quarter's performance once again demonstrates the benefit of the diversification and scale of our platform. So, I'll just touch on a few highlights here. CIB reported its highest quarterly revenue on record with IB fees up 54% and markets revenue up 79% year-on-year, each representing record performances with strength across the board. We saw record consumer deposit growth of 20%, up over $130 billion year-on-year and firm-wide average deposits were $1.9 trillion, up about 25% year-on-year and 16% quarter-on-quarter. Average loans were up 4% year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, largely reflecting the COVID-related loan growth that we saw in March. However, on an end-of-period basis, loans were down 4% quarter-on-quarter due to revolver pay downs as well as lower balances in Card and Home Lending, partially offset by the impact of $28 billion of PPP loans. And lastly, we increased our CET1 ratio by approximately 90 basis points in the quarter after building approximately $9 billion of reserves and paying nearly $3 billion of common dividends. As you\u2019ll recall, we started the second quarter on the back of unprecedented levels of business activity in March. On the following pages, I'll give you an update on some of those key activity metrics we looked at last quarter and share what we're seeing today. So with that, let's turn to page two. Starting with wholesale on the top of the page, we saw record levels of debt and equity issuance in the quarter as clients bought to pay down the majority of the revolver draws for March and continued to shore up liquidity while market conditions were receptive, supported by extraordinary central bank actions. The surge in investment grade debt issuance seen in March continued throughout the second quarter. And as high yield markets reopened, U.S. issuance volumes increased by 90% compared to the first quarter. In ECM as markets rebounded to pre-COVID levels, May and June together were our two busiest months for equity issuance ever, driven by converts and follow-ons. Moving to consumer spending behavior on the bottom left. Debit and credit sales volume, while overall still down has consistently trended upward since the trough in the second week of April to down just 4% year-on-year in the last two weeks of June. T&E and restaurant spend continued to be down meaningfully but we have seen some improvement, especially on the back of higher levels of restaurant spend. The most significant improvement we saw was in retail with a strong recovery in card-present volume in the second half of the quarter, and consistently strong growth in card-not-present volume throughout the quarter. More recently, we\u2019ve seen the improvement in overall sales growth across the country flatten out, notably in both states with increasing cases and states with decreasing cases. We continued to see larger year-on-year declines in states that remain partially closed, particularly those in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. In terms of consumers\u2019 demand for credit, we observed similar recovery trends. In auto, April saw the lowest level of loan and lease origination since the financial crisis, but activity rebounded sharply in May and June, and in fact, June ended up the best month for auto originations in our history. And in Home Lending, retail purchase applications after reaching a low in April recovered to well above pre-COVID levels in June, due to a strong and broad market recovery. Continuing on the topic of consumer behavior, let's turn to page three for an update on what we're seeing around our customer assistance programs. Relative to the peak levels we observed at the beginning of April, we've seen a significant decline in new requests for assistance over the quarter. To date, we have provided customer assistance for nearly 1.7 million accounts, representing $79 billion of balances across both our owned and service portfolios, and of those accounts, a large percentage, having made at least one payment while in the forbearance period, just over 50% in both Card and Home Lending. In terms of early reenrollment trends, in cards, only a small portion of our customers have completed both the initial 90-day deferral period and reached the payment date, but the majority of those customers resumed payments with less than 20% of accounts requesting additional assistance. And then, in Home Lending, of those whose forbearance period expired in June, most have either been extended at a customer's request or auto-enrolled into new three-month forbearances with approximately 40% of the extensions still current. And so, while we're following this data closely, it's still too early to draw any conclusions. Now, moving on to page four for some more detail about our second quarter results. We recorded revenue of $33.8 billion, which was up $4.3 billion or 15% year-on-year. While net interest income was down approximately $600 million or 4% on lower rates, mostly offset by higher market NII and balance sheet growth, non-interest revenue was up $4.9 billion or 33%, predominantly driven by CIB markets and IB fees. Expenses of $16.9 billion were up approximately $700 million or 4% year-on-year on revenue related expenses, partially offset by continued reduction in structural expenses. This quarter, credit costs were $10.5 billion, including a net reserve build of $8.9 billion and net charge-off of $1.6 billion. Let's turn to page five for more detail on the reserve builds. Our net reserve build of $8.9 billion for the quarter consists of $4.6 billion in wholesale and $4.4 billion in consumer, predominantly card. The reserve increase in the first quarter was predicated on an acute but short-lived downturn with a solid recovery in the second half of the year. And while we have seen some positive momentum in the economy over recent weeks, there does continue to be significant uncertainty around the path of the recovery. At the bottom of the page, you can see our updated base case, but remember this is just one of five scenarios we use to derive our allowance for credit losses. Our build is based on the weighted outcome of these scenarios and assumes a more protracted downturn with a slower GDP recovery and an unemployment rate that remains in the double digits through the first half of 2021. In addition to the obvious impact on consumer, its protracted downturn is expected to have a much more broad-based impact across wholesale sectors that we\u2019ve seen in the first quarter. Given the increased uncertainty of the macroeconomic outlook, how customer payment behavior will play out and the future of government stimulus and its ultimate effectiveness as it relates to both, consumers and wholesale clients, we've put more meaningful weight on the downside scenario this quarter. And so therefore, we're prepared and have reserved for something worse than the base case. And given CECL covers life of loan, if our assumptions are realized, we wouldn't expect meaningful additional reserve builds going forward. Now, moving to balance sheet and capital on page six. WE ended the quarter with the CET1 ratio of 12.4%, which is over 100 basis points above our new SCB base minimum of 11.3%. And just to touch on SLR, while our reported ratio is 6.8%, it's worth noting that we're not going to rely on temporary relief and so without that our ratio is 5.7%. As we said in late June, unless things change meaningfully, the Board intends to maintain the $0.90 dividend in the third quarter. Given the wide range of potential outcomes going forward, I'd like to spend a few minutes on why we're comfortable saying that including the value of our strong and steady earnings stream as well as how we're managing our capital through this crisis. So, with that, let's go to page seven. It's an obvious point, but it's worth a reminder that since 2018, our average quarterly PPNR of over $13 billion has been generating over 60 basis points of new CET1 capacity per quarter, even after having made meaningful investments in our businesses. This powerful earning stream allows us to grow the franchise and serve our customers and clients when they need it most. And it provides us the capacity to absorb losses and quickly replenish capital in times of stress. While over the last two and a half years, we've paid out approximately 100% of cumulative earnings, distributing nearly $75 billion of excess capital, we're now building a significant amount of capital since we suspended our share repurchases. And we believe our capital base remains strong even in more severe scenarios, which you can see on page eight. Standing here today, we have $34 billion of reserves and $191 billion of CET1 capital, of which $16 billion is excess over and above our regulatory buffers. Our 3.3% SCB translates to $51 billion of capital that is available to free from stress at any time. And on top of that, our 3.5% GSIB surcharge translates to another $54 billion, all that so our $69 billion regulatory minimum is never touched. And as you know, we prepare for and manage our capital to a number of scenarios, and one of them is Extreme Adverse scenario that Jamie discussed in his shareholder letter earlier this year. We've updated this analysis and it now assumes an even deeper contraction to GDP, down nearly 14% at the end of 2020, versus 4Q19 and reported unemployment ending the year at nearly 22%. Even under this scenario, we estimate that we would end the year with a CET1 ratio above 10% and we would be bound by advanced. So, our regulatory minimum would be 10.5%. While we are not likely to voluntarily dip into any of our regulatory buffers, this scenario would require us to do so, but notably only to a small extent. It's also worth noting that based on the limited information provided from the Fed about their U and W scenarios, we believe that our Extreme Adverse scenario simulates an even worse path for the economy over the next 12-months. And even if we get this wrong and our losses are twice as high, we still wouldn't use the entire SCB.\nJamie Dimon: This is Jamie. I\u2019d just like to amply a couple of these points. So, we are showing this example, obviously it\u2019s predicated on a lot of assumptions, which we're not going to give you a lot of detail on, just simply to show that we could bear another $20 billion of loan loss reserves. That $20 billion brings us to an Extreme Adverse, which roughly may equate to U or W of the Fed, and we're going to do a lot more analysis on that because obviously we need to prepare for that. We dip into advanced CET1, that\u2019s because we're taking no actions. So, I\u2019ve always told you that advanced capital is very pro-cyclical. So, as things get downgraded, your RWA goes way up. The capital base doesn't change that much, but the RWA goes way up. And there\u2019d be lots of actions we would take that we could avoid that from taking place whatsoever. The other thing I want to point out is this Extreme Adverse probably can't happen in one quarter. It will happen in several quarters. Because we really know kind of what July looks like and August and stuff like that. So, even if the economy starts to head there, it will take us a couple of quarters before you make the determination that that has a 100% possibility. Remember, this is saying, we now believe it\u2019s 100%. Of course, things can be worse by the way, but we're just trying to show you that how much capital the Company does have. And the dividend -- now I\u2019m going to be -- it sounds like I\u2019m going to contradict myself. I am not. Okay? Today, we have all that PPNR, all of that earnings, all the things. So, it\u2019d be kind of foolish to get the future of Extreme Adverse and cut your dividend. Because we can easily get through very, very tough times and never cut the dividend. However, if you enter something like Extreme Adverse, all of a sudden, you have new scenarios which are even worse. You don't know. So, at one point, the Board will consider cutting the dividend because it will basically get even worse in Extreme Adverse and we want to be able to handle anything out there. The primary concern of the Company is to serve our clients, serve our community through thick and think, and no one should ever worry about JPMorgan Chase. So, there's no intent to do it. But if things get really bad, I mean, we use the word materially and significantly, that\u2019s something we should look at. The other thing, by the way is these loan losses are our best estimate of loan losses and not the CCAR type of stuff. You all are doing estimates that show DFAST and Fed adverse. We will not move that kind of money on credit. Okay? And on the next page, Jen\u2019s going to explain some stuff. I'm going to make a few slight additional comments. I also want you to -- she said that we're not going to use temporary buffers. I think, the temporary is a funny thing to go into a crisis that you could use it for a while but disappears on March 1st or February 1s. So, my view is, we shouldn't rely on anything like that.\nJennifer Piepszak: And I\u2019ll just add Jamie to the point on advanced RWA. If you look on the slide and you can see we traveled from 13.1% to 10.4%. About half of that is just the RWA increasing and the other half is the [indiscernible]. So, anyway, as Jamie said, moving on to page nine. All of this is against the backdrop of a capital framework that still has opportunity for recalibration. So, while we talked about this for years, it has perhaps never been more important. I'll start with CCAR and Jamie just made this point. But, it is not predictive of what we actually think would happen. And the best example of this might be the global market shock. It is a significant portion of the SCB, and we've obviously experienced a very different result here in the first half of 2020. So, we continue to believe that there are opportunities to rationalize the overall capital framework, including the points we've repeatedly made about GSIB. These changes will foster a higher pace of economic growth over time without compromising financial stability.\nJamie Dimon: Yes. Again, I just want to emphasize couple of things here. So, look, the point of CCAR was that banks can handle extreme stress and if everything goes wrong. CCAR itself is not a predictive forecast of what your results might be. So, all the CCAR tests roughly equate to global financial crisis and all the CCAR tests always have us losing somewhere between $25 billion and $30 billion over the ensuing nine quarters. But, in ensuing nine quarters at the Lehman, we made $30 billion. We never lost money in a quarter. We take action, we diversify, we've got to have streams of earnings. And we're not against CCAR, because that's protecting you from the worst of the worst of the worst. But that's not necessarily predictive. The global market shock, which I think they have $25 billion in counterparty losses. Again, just to be instructive of that, in \u201808 and \u201809, you had Fannie Mae go bankrupt, Freddie Mac go bankrupt, you had Bear Stearns effectively, you had Lehman Bros. effectively, you had AIG effectively, you had tons of financial institutions in Europe, tons of counterparty failures and our trading results in the worst two quarters combined was a loss of $4 billion, not $25 billion. And of course, it was quickly made back because as we pointed out, when things get bad in trading, spreads gap out, and then all of a sudden you're making more money trading because you -- and you have recoveries in position. So, the stress capital buffer of 3.3% is not indicative of what we would lose. And so, -- and I hope over time, we could drive that down by taking real actions to a number close to 2.5%. GSIB itself, I pointed out before, I'm not against the concept of big banks and the more capital. But GSIB is -- it's not the same CCAR. CCAR includes your diversification, your strength, your earnings, your PPNR, and things like that, GSIB does not. It\u2019s just a measure of size multiplied over and over and over. It doesn't include diversification. It doesn't include margins. It doesn't include actions. It doesn't include -- it's just really not representative of all, but I would say is risk of a company or something like that. And so, we have enough capital to handle a lot of stuff, which is we've always run the Company that way, so that we can handle at adverse times because in my short lifetime, I've seen crises over and over and over and over. We're not predicting them. We're just prepared for them. So, I stop there.\nJennifer Piepszak: Okay. Thank you. All right. So, let's go onto the businesses. So, we'll start on page 10 with Consumer & Community Banking. So, CCB reported a net loss of $176 million, including reserved builds of $4.6 billion. Revenue of $12.2 billion was down 9% year-on-year, driven by deposit margin compression, lower transaction activity, and customer relief, partially offset by strong deposit growth and Home Lending margin expansion. The deposit margin was down 108 basis points a year-on-year on a sharp decline in rates, but deposit growth was a record 20% year-on-year, up over $130 billion. We would estimate that approximately 50% of that growth is COVID-related due to government stimulus for consumers and small businesses, lower consumer spending and tax payment delays. Mobile users were up 10% year-on-year. And since the start of the pandemic, we\u2019ve seen increased levels of digital engagement. For example, quick deposit enrollment is up 2 times pre-COVID levels. As I noted earlier for consumer lending, the overall activity for the quarter reflected an environment that continued to evolve. Auto loan and lease originations were down 9% year-on-year due to the exit of the Mazda partnership. Excluding this impact, auto originations for up mid-single-digits. And while the Home Lending market was favorable, Home Lending total originations were down 1% year-on-year, driven by a decline in correspondent volume substantially offset by an increase in retail volume. Total CCB loans were down 7% year-on-year, driven by Home Lending down 14% due to prior loan sales and card down 7% and lower spend, offset by business banking up 59% due to PPP originations. Expenses of $6.6 billion we're down 3%, driven by lower travel-related benefit, structural and marketing expenses. And lastly credit costs included the $4.6 billion reserve builds I mentioned earlier and net charge-off of $1.3 billion, driven by card.  Now, turning to the Corporate & Investment Bank on page 11. CIB reported net income of $5.5 billion and an ROE of 27% on revenue of $15.4 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $3.4 billion was up 91% year-on-year, largely driven by our strong performance in capital markets, as well as the gains on our bridge book, which was primarily a function of improved market conditions. IB fees for the quarter were an all time record, up 54% year-on-year. We maintained our number one rank and grew market share to the 9.8% for the first half of the year. In advisory, we were up 15%, driven by the closing of a few notable transactions. That underwriting fees were up 55%. We maintained our number one rank in overall wallet and we\u2019re the leaders and the lead left across leveraged finance. In equity underwriting, fees were up 93% and we grew share by approximately 200 basis points relative to the first quarter. With regards to outlook, we expect third quarter IB fees to be down, both sequentially and year-on-year due to the usual seasonal decline and lower M&A announcements year-to-date. And if the economy begins to stabilize, we expect capital markets to revert to normal levels. However, any sustained period of instability could result in additional demand for liquidity, and therefore increase capital markets activity. Moving to markets, total revenue was $9.7 billion, up 79% year-on-year, an all-time record, driven by strong performance throughout the quarter, and it was only later in June that activity began to revert to more normal levels. We saw strength across products and regions for both flow training and large episodic transactions. While strong line activity was a continuation of the first quarter theme, our market-making activity this quarter benefited from improved market liquidity, and we were able to better monetize flows. Fixed income was up 99% year-on-year or 120%, adjusted for the gain from the IPO of Tradeweb last year, driven by very active primary and secondary markets across products, particularly in macro. Equity was up 38%, largely driven by strong client activity in equity derivatives and cash. Looking forward, we expect the slowdown that we started to see towards the end of June, to continue. In addition, the second half of last year was very strong, making any year-on-year comparison difficult. But obviously, the environment makes forecasting markets performance even more challenging than usual. Wholesale payments revenue of $1.4 billion was down 3% year-on-year, primarily driven by our reporting reclassification and merchant services. Security services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 5% year-on-year as continued elevated volatility in the second quarter drove increased transaction volume and higher average deposit balances. Credit adjustments and other was a gain of $510 million, as I mentioned upfront, driven by the tightening of funding spent on derivatives and was a partial reversal of the losses in the first quarter. Expenses of $6.8 billion were up 19% compared to the prior year due to revenue-related expenses. Finally, credit cost of $2 billion reflects the net reserve build I referred to earlier. Now moving on to Commercial Banking on page 12. Commercial Banking reported a net loss of $691 million, which included reserve build of approximately $2.4 billion. Revenue of $2.4 billion was up 5% year-on-year, driven by higher deposits and loans and equity investment gain and higher investment banking revenue, largely offset by lower deposit NII. Record gross investment banking revenues of $851 million were up 44% year-on-year, due to increased bonds and equity underwriting activity. Expenses of $899 million were down 3% year-on-year, driven by lower structural expenses. Deposits of $237 billion were up 41% year-on-year as the increase in balances from March has largely remained on our balance sheet as clients look to remain liquid in this environment. End of period loans were up 7% year-on-year but down 4% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were down 7% quarter-on-quarter as revolver utilization while still elevated has declined significantly from the all-time highs in March. However, this is partially offset by the impact of PPP loans. CRE loans were flat with generally lower originations in both commercial term lending and real estate banking. Credit costs for $2.4 billion included the reserve build mentioned earlier and $79 million of net charge-offs, roughly half of which were in oil and gas. Now on to Asset & Wealth Management on page 13. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $658 million with pretax margin and ROE of 24%. Revenue of $3.6 billion for the quarter was up 1% year-on-year as growth in average deposit and loan balances along with higher brokerage activity was largely offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $2.5 billion were down 3% year-on-year with lower structural as well as volume and revenue-related expenses, partially offset by continued investments in advisors. Credit costs were $223 million, driven by the reserve builds that I mentioned earlier. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $29 billion, positive across all channels and all regions, led by fixed income and equity. At the same time, we saw net liquidity inflows of $95 billion, making us the number one institutional money manager globally. AUM of $2.5 trillion and overall client assets of $3.4 trillion, up 15% and 12% year-on-year respectively, were driven by cumulative net inflows into liquidity and long-term products. And finally, deposits were up 20% year-on-year on growth in interest-bearing products and loans were up 12% with strength in both wholesale and mortgage lending. Now on to corporate on page 14. Corporate reported a net loss of $568 million. Revenue was a loss of $754 million, down $1.1 billion year-on-year, driven by lower interest income on lower rates, including the impact of faster prepays on mortgage securities. And expenses of $147 million were down $85 million year-on-year. Now, let's turn to page 15 for the outlook. You'll see here that despite the uncertain environment, our latest full year outlook remains largely in line with our previous guidance. Based on the latest insights, we expect net interest income to be approximately $56 billion and adjusted expenses to be approximately $65 billion, which is slightly higher than expected previously, reflecting the outperformance in the second quarter, and will ultimately be an outcome of our performance in the second half of the year. So, to wrap up, against the backdrop of an unprecedented environment, our second quarter performance highlighted the benefits of our diversification and scales and the resulting earnings power of our company. While the range of outcomes is broader than ever before, our priorities remain unchanged. We are focused on supporting our employees, customers, clients and communities around the globe, and on being good stewards of the capital entrusted to us by our shareholders. I'd like to end by thanking all of those who continue to serve on the frontlines of this crisis and our people here at JPMorgan Chase, who have demonstrated unwavering fortitude and dedication through these times. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John McDonald of Autonomous.\nJohn McDonald: Good morning, Jen and Jamie. Jen, I was wondering if you could give us some incremental color on your commercial exposures to heavily COVID impacted sectors across CRE and C&I, so thinking oil and gas, travel and retail, just to help us understand the types of areas where your incremental commercial reserve building was directed towards this quarter.\nJennifer Piepszak: Sure. So, I'll start by saying, the most impacted sectors, like the ones that you mentioned, represent about a third of our overall exposure. More than half of that is investment grade and two thirds of the non-investment grade is secured. And in terms of the second quarter downgrades, well, first I'd say, in the first quarter, when we were really looking at a deep but short-lived downturn, we were really very much focused on the most impacted sectors. And now that we're looking at a more protracted downturn, we're reserved for a much more broad-based impact across sectors. So, just to put that in context, the second quarter reserve build, about 40% of that is in the most impacted sectors versus two thirds of the builds in the first quarter, was the most impacted sectors. And then, in terms of the downgrades that we saw in the second quarter, less than a third of those were in the most impacted sectors.\nJohn McDonald: And just for your definition of most impacted sectors, what would you be including in that?\nJennifer Piepszak: Consumer and retail, oil and gas, real estate, retail and lodging, and sub-sectors, as you think about real estate.\nJohn McDonald: Okay. Just a quick follow-up question. You maintained the NII outlook for the year, despite a pretty big drop in net interest margin. Could you talk about the dynamics embedded in that second half outlook for NII and maybe how trading NII might play into the thinking?\nJennifer Piepszak: Yes. It's a great question. And you're spot on, which is markets help NII. So, the outperformance in markets helps NII, but can be a headwind on NIM, just given that the NIM is below the average. So, yes, it was maintaining that outlook did have something to do with the outperformance of markets. You're right.\nOperator: Our next question is from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. Good morning. Thanks. Jennifer, just to kick off with a question, on page three, you went through a lot of detail around the forbearance that you've been given and the percentage that has been paying you at least once during the deferral period. Could you give us a sense on these different asset classes that you've outlined in your base case, what are you assuming those delinquencies end up becoming?\nJennifer Piepszak: So, I won't go into specific details, but I'll just say a couple of things, which is, it is still too early to really read a whole lot into what we're seeing. The visibility here remains low I would say given the amount of support that is out there. But, you are right that we are considering these customers to be higher risk, given that they are in forbearance program. So, we did account for that as we thought about our reserves.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. Because I'm thinking, all right, you've got the inverse of the right hand column could be construed as what should be expected to become delinquencies over time. And I'm wondering, as a follow-up question, you mentioned during the prepared remarks that if your assumptions are realized that you could be basically close to fully reserved for the cycle. Maybe if you can give us a sense as to which assumptions you are talking about because I know you're expecting an outcome that's worse than your base. So, I was just a little confused about what I should assume your base cases and what assumptions you're pointing to that if realized, you're done on the reserving.\nJennifer Piepszak: Sure. So, first of all, there are a lot of assumptions, given as I said, the visibility is still quite low. So, assumptions around the economic outlook and I'll come back to that; assumptions around consumer payment behavior; and then assumptions around stimulus. So, going back to the economic outlook, we have five different scenarios. We did lean in more heavily to the downside scenarios, relative to what we would have otherwise done. Even the Fed has put equal weight on downside scenarios and their base case. So, we certainly thought having a conservative bias there was the prudent thing to do. And so, as you look at that slide five, that is just the base case. So, you can see there, exiting this year just under 11%. When you then look at the weighted outcome of unemployment across the five scenarios, we end up with double-digit unemployment through the first half of 2021 versus what you see on page five, there is just the base case, which shows some improvements relative to the fourth quarter getting down to just under 8% by the end of 2021.\nJamie Dimon: Betsy, as I just clarify, the base case, if you took Morgan Stanley's estimates or Mike Feroli or JP Morgan or the Fed estimates for their base case, that is basically the base case. Embedded in that are all these assumptions about that stimulus and P2P and all these are things. So, that is the base case, and we're reserved more than that. So, therefore, if the base case happens, we may be over-reserved. I hope the base case happens.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jim Mitchell of Seaport.\nJim Mitchell: Maybe just a quick follow-up on the consumer and delinquencies. Obviously, you had an impact from deferral programs and delinquencies -- actually 30-day delinquencies were actually down. Can you talk to what you're seeing in the non-deferral programs? It doesn't seem like we're seeing much stress at all, even in the early stage delinquencies. What would you attribute that to? What are you seeing is your non-deferral programs?\nJennifer Piepszak: I mean, simply I would attribute it to the amount of support that is out there in the form of stimulus. And so, as I said, the visibility on what we're dealing with is very, very low, because we're not seeing right now what you would typically expect to see, given a recession. And so, the way we have to think about reserving is all about the outlook, because we're not actually seeing it today. And so, Jamie has said this many times, May and June will prove to be the easy bumps in terms of its recovery. And now we're really hitting the moment of truth, I think in the months ahead.\nJamie Dimon: Yes. And just to amplify, in the normal recession, unemployment goes up, delinquencies go up, charges go up, home prices go down. None of that's true here. Incomes go down, savings go down. Savings are up, incomes are up, home prices are up. So, you will see the effect of this recession. You're not going to see it right away because of all the stimulus and the fact, 60% or 70% of the unemployed are making more money than they were making when they were working. So, it\u2019s just very peculiar times.\nJim Mitchell: Maybe a follow-up on DFAST. Jamie, you made comments about the market shock. We kind of went through a market shock and everyone's trading held up quite well. Do you see that changing the Fed's view over time in terms of how they think about stress losses in the trading book, or is it -- or you don\u2019t think that's too optimistic?\nJamie Dimon: I don't expect any change. And like I said, they're not -- what they're looking at is they are making sure a bank can withstand the bad -- as if they were all the worst bank. They're not giving credit to banks for things happy and good. So I'm not against that concept. I just want to say, if it goes really bad and you do everything totally wrong, what happens to your trading or something like that? And they do the same assumptions like outflows. The outflows they have on liquidity are worse than the outflows of the worst bank in the worst crisis. But, they just want to make sure that every bank can withstand that.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW.\nBrian Kleinhanzl: Sure. Thanks. Quick question on the balance sheet. I mean, obviously, there's tremendous balance sheet growth as liquidity built up in the quarter. But, how are we thinking about that on a go forward basis? Is that expected to roll off over the next couple quarters? Is that kind of persistent and expected to stick around, and you\u2019re just going to be operating with a much larger balance sheet in near term?\nJennifer Piepszak: So, I'll start with deposits. I mean, in the first quarter, it was very much a wholesale story. And we said we expected to normalize, and we have seen that. We started to see that. So, looking ahead on wholesale, I think there are puts and takes. We'll continue to see revolvers pay down, security services will likely continue to normalize. I think, tailwinds for deposits Fed balance sheet expansion will be slower but will continue. And we do think we'll continue to see organic growth. On the consumer side, probably down from here on tax payments as well as the pickup in consumer spending. But, in both cases, I think we'll continue to see very, very strong year-on-year growth, both for wholesale and consumer in the latter part of this year. And then, in terms of balance sheet management, I mean, we managed the balance sheet across multiple dimensions, NII, liquidity, capital and interest rate risk. And so, we have had $400 billion of deposit growth since the end of last year. And when you consider, as you know that some of that growth is likely to be transitory and deployment opportunities have been diminished, given the rate environment, we have held a decent amount of that in cash. However, we did add about $88 billion in securities here in the second quarter and on the deposit side, we've been very-disciplined on a pay rates.\nBrian Kleinhanzl: So, if those deposits have grown, we should expect more to migrate from deposits on the asset side into securities? Are you looking to fund loans on those?\nJamie Dimon: As the Fed grows the balance sheet, it\u2019s going to end up in deposits. And for the most part, a lot of deposits is going to be securities. Because the loan growth usually go to recession doesn't go up that much.\nJennifer Piepszak: We should see -- as consumer spending recovers, we should see some growth in cards, which will help but will have PPP starting to pay down, and as Jamie said, loan growth, but slightly slower.\nJamie Dimon: I should point out that look at the big numbers. We have over $1 trillion between cash held at the central banks, which is close to $400 billion or $500 billion; treasuries, which is close to $700 billion; and other very liquid assets, mostly in good securities, that's $1 trillion. People look at the safety and soundness of institution like this. That is a tremendous sum of money. Some is required -- we are required to hold a lot of liquidity, but of some it just because we're investing conservatively.\nBrian Kleinhanzl: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O'Connor: Good morning. I was just wondering if you could talk a bit about the expected timing of starting to see some charge-off. Obviously there's a lot of unknowns with the stimulus and the forbearance, but what are your assumptions in terms of when charge-offs start growing up, maybe where they peak and how long they at that level?\nJennifer Piepszak: It's really difficult to know. I mean, first, we have to start seeing delinquencies. And so later this year -- but next year will be much heavier on charge-off, as you think about realizing the assumptions that we've made in the reserves. It's very -- it\u2019s difficult to know. The good thing is CECL is life of loan. So, we feel well covered for the scenarios that we're looking at.\nMatt O'Connor: And then, remind us, you are seeing some creep in the nonperforming assets. Obviously, it's off low levels, but they are starting to go up. And remind us why that's not starting to feed into net charge-offs, or if this is just a timing issue and will in the next quarter or two?\nJennifer Piepszak: Yes. When you look at that non-accrual increase in wholesale, half of that is one client. So, it's really -- I wouldn't draw any conclusions from that. And as you say, it's creeping up off a very low level. So again, we still aren't seeing what you would expect to see in terms of recessionary indicators.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo.\nMike Mayo: Hi. Just more on the reserve question. So, if the Fed\u2019s base case is achieved, then you are over reserved. If your base case assumptions....\nJamie Dimon: We hope we\u2019re over-reserved\u2026\nMike Mayo: And if your base case assumptions, which are more conservative, are realized, then okay, you're done with the reserve building. And if it's worse, then you'll have to add more reserves. But since the end of the quarter, we're seeing an increase in COVID cases in Florida and Texas and California and elsewhere. And isn't there a link between increasing COVID cases with deaths with economic activity, or how do you think about that? And I'm staring at slide two, and I can't get my eyes off that debit and credit card sales volume. And it seems like it's flattening off here in June. So, since the end of the quarter, A, if you were to kind of mark-to-market your thinking as of this second with what's happening, do you feel better, worse or the same versus the end of the quarter, as it relates to your assumptions?\nJamie Dimon: We feel exactly the same today that we did at the end of the quarter that's sort of mark to market. And Mike, we are very clear. We cannot forecast the future. We don't know. We\u2019re also very clear that -- I know at least I think you're going to have a much murkier economic environment going forward than you had in May and June and that -- you have to be prepared. You're going to have a lot of ins and outs. People get scared about COVID. They\u2019re going to get scared about the economy, small businesses, the companies, bankruptcies, emerging markets. So, it is just going to be murky, which is why, if you look at the base case, adverse and extreme adverse case, they're all possible. And we're just guessing the probabilities of those things. That's what we're doing. We are prepared for the worst case. We simply don't know. I don't think anyone knows. And this -- the word unprecedented rarely is used properly. This time, it\u2019s been used properly. It's unprecedented what's going on around the world. Obviously, COVID itself is a main attribute. So, the Fed\u2019s W case, they made it very clear. Their W case is that COVID comes back in a big way in the fall, and you have to shut down the economy again. And obviously, we\u2019ve got to be careful. We don't know the probability of that. We simply don't know, by the way we\u2019re wasting time guessing.\nJennifer Piepszak: And then, I would just add Mike, just to clarify that we are reserved for something worse than the base case. And for all the reasons you said, they informed our decision to lean in a bit more on the downside scenarios. And so, while there is a bit of a -- we hope, a conservative bias here, this does represent our best estimate based upon everything we know, which does include the sort of slowdown that you referenced in terms of more recent activities.\nMike Mayo: And my follow-up would be kind of the flip side, during this very difficult time, you've grown deposits over the past year equal to the fifth largest bank. I mean, the deposit growth is kind of off the charts here. So, you said half of that is due to COVID. But is the other half due to share gains, so I guess there's several questions in that. But, how much of that is related to digital banking and how much of that do you expect to go away once this crisis has passed?\nJennifer Piepszak: So, I talked a little bit about kind of how we're thinking about deposits looking forward. Also I do clarify, like when we said 50% COVID-related. That was on the consumer side. And so, that we do think some of that will lead with tax payments and consumer spending coming back. And then, in terms of how much of this is share gain, it's difficult to know. At this point, historically, we have performed well in lower rate environments. And I think you're right, I think it is because of our digital capabilities and our branch footprint and our people and all the things that we offer that differentiate us in a time like this.\nOperator: Our next question is from Erika Najarian from Bank of America.\nErika Najarian: The first question is for Jamie. A lot of investor feedback has indicated that they are encouraged by the fact that banks can remain profitable while absorbing pretty significant provisions, which you've proven today, but are hesitant about bank stocks, given the overhang of DFAST resubmissions in the fourth quarter, and what that could imply for the dividend. And I guess, I just -- I know you alluded to this in your prepared remarks, but I'm wondering, under the scenario that you see, playing out and relative to that 60 basis points of CTE1 generation per quarter, what is your view on dividend sustainability outside of that Extreme Adverse case?\nJamie Dimon: That's completely sustainable. And if we enter the Extreme Adverse case, the Board should and will consider reducing it. As I pointed out, the Extreme Adverse case itself is completely sustainable with the dividend. The reason they would consider reducing it, is because once you enter like 14% or 15% unemployment, you don't know the future. So, now you're going to have another Extreme Adverse case, which is going to be 20% unemployment. And therefore, you protect yourself from that and cutting the dividend is cheap equity. And so, the goal is to sustain the dividends. You can look at the numbers. It\u2019s completely miniscule relative quarter-by-quarter. So, this decision could be made, as you enter these things. And we're all hoping the base case happens.\nErika Najarian: And just as a quick follow-up, we also got this question from investors, in the Extreme Adverse case, is there a preference towards cutting the dividend or a temporary suspension or is there a difference between the two?\nJamie Dimon: There's no difference between the two. You cut your dividend. You got to hopefully put it back when the time comes. And so, the temporary suspension just sounds peculiar. It's a suspension. And I've done that twice in my life. It's a prudent thing to do. And if you might need that capital going forward, you could think you're going to get that terrible, something like that. So, then the other thing, you can ask the other question. If the base case happens, we're going to end up with far too much capital generation. And we'll start buying back stock again, which I hope we can do before it goes way up.\nOperator: Our next question\u2026\nJamie Dimon: We don't expect that this year. But, I wouldn't completely rule it out in the fourth quarter.\nOperator: And our next question is from Glenn Schorr of Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr: Hello, there. Question for you. So, we had this big market rebound in the overall markets and that's led to a lot of revenue. But, given this outlook on the uncertain past that we've been talking through this whole time, I'm curious on ways you think about potentially derisking on balance sheet. Now, some of it is just this huge liquidity buildup is a derisked balance sheet. I get that. But, are there proactive things you can do to reduce the high leverage RWA in a more stressed environment? Have you been selling into this recovery is I guess my question?\nJennifer Piepszak: I guess, there is two components to it, which is the Investment Securities portfolio and then proactive things we could do on RWA, if that answers your question. Glenn, I'll start with Investment Securities. We are being cautious. And we have opportunistically looked to reduce credit exposure there over the second quarter. And then, on RWA, we are -- because we're preparing for a range of outcomes, we are spending a lot of time thinking about if we needed to, what could we do? But, it is sort of a last resort because we certainly don't want to have any impact on clients and customers. And so, we're ready -- we're looking at it. But we haven't done anything I would say proactively at this point. We're very much focused on helping clients and customers get through this crisis.\nJamie Dimon: So, let me answer this way. On the consumer side, we, like other banks have seen, are kind of prudent tightening with how you do credit. That's already happened. And obviously, you could do some more. But Jen, you had some great numbers about how good credit is. I think, the -- give those FICO\u2019s numbers you gave me the other day. Well, how much better Home Lending is\u2026\nJennifer Piepszak: Oh! That was -- that on the LTV, the weighted average LTV. I mean, it's really extraordinary. And I was in mortgage, so I should have remembered, but I did have to ask. And in 2010, our weighted average LTV on the portfolio in Home Lending was 90% and it\u2019s now 56%.\nJamie Dimon: And you can assume it's better in credit cards, it's better and auto. We have less subprime. That's a consumer side. On the lending -- on the business side, we've always been prudent. We're always very tight and careful and stuff like that. Usually what happens in downturns like this, you get a little -- more serious about security and the management team and responsiveness and raising capital. So, a lot of these companies have been raising a lot of capital. On the investment side, and this is a kind of a peculiarity of accounting again, we can actually make it more conservative, putting securities into help maturity, which we\u2019ve done very little and I'm going to consider -- I don't personally understand why that reduces risk, but it does reduce your SCB. And, maybe we'll do that over time. But, the security portfolios are pretty prudent. There are -- and in trading it's every day. So trading is -- just think of trading is that Daniel, and Troy Rohrbaugh and Jason Sippel and the whole team, they are every single day managing those risks and those exposures. And you could assume that they're managing very, very well and tightly today. And we certainly are not punting for fences or anything like that. We're trying to be very cautious and serve our clients. And so, yes, you are more conservative. And reducing RWA, yes, we can, if we wanted, we could start doing that by all these various things.\nGlenn Schorr: Thanks. One quickie on the consumer side. I'm curious if you have -- we\u2019re now four months into the bulk of the lockdown in the United States and some of your branches have been either closed or drive-up only, and we're watching your deposits grow like a weed. So, I'm curious if you've learned any lessons that might change your thoughts on the branch network, on your organic growth efforts as we go forward and come out of this someday?\nJamie Dimon: Yes. So, deposit number -- deposits went up with the PPP. Deposits went up because of the payroll checks that people got. Deposits went up -- the revolvers are taken down by $50 billion, something like that. And of course all of that\u2019s already reversed and stuff like that. So, you have to look at both sides of that. But, you were going to say something, Jen?\nJennifer Piepszak: I was going to add on -- of course, we're learning a lot. I mean, I mentioned the quick deposit enrollment. But, we haven't learned enough to make any changes to our strategy around branch expansion. In fact, we just opened our hundredth branch in market expansion. So, we're really excited about that. We think we\u2019ll open probably another 75 this year. So, we'll be nearly halfway to the 400 branches that we talked about in market expansion. And so, we'll see -- we do have -- still have about a 1,000 branches that are closed. And it's possible that we learn something that helps us think about accelerating de-densification or consolidation, but it'll be at the margin. And we're not going to make any big changes quickly because we want to make sure that we have the benefit over time of watching our customer behavior. So, they can really be the ones that inform our strategy.\nOperator: Our next question is from Charles Peabody of Portales Partners. \nCharles Peabody: Yes. Good morning. Two questions, one on page six, you give the SLR ratio as adjusted for the temporary relief programs on the capital. I wonder if you had a similar ratio for CET1. And part of that question would also be, which would be the more confined ratio starting next March?\nJamie Dimon: There is no temporary relief in CET1. \nJennifer Piepszak: Well, CET1, the only -- and I'm not even trying to call it relief. There's a phase in on CET1, but it\u2019s over many years. And so, I don't necessarily think about that as temporary, like SLR. SLR at this point, it is temporary, it is due to expire in the first quarter of next year, which is why we're very-focused on managing that without the exclusions.\nJamie Dimon: And they\u2019re both. We manage them both. So, I wouldn't say one is more than the other. We manage something like 20 different capital liquidity ratios.\nCharles Peabody: And Jamie, FSOC is meeting today behind closed doors. If I understand, there are two topics. One that has to do with secondary mortgage market liquidity and the other with the COVID stress test overlay. Do you have any thoughts or insights as to what they may be discussing on either of those?\nJamie Dimon: I don't. The COVID, you could be -- obviously we have some insights. The COVID, obviously we're going to run a new stress test, we\u2019re going to look at all step cases, UW and stuff like that because they laid it out, perfectly reasonable that people would refer to that kind of stress test. I think the mortgage markets is a different issue. Okay? And we've been very consistent that mortgages, believe it or not are more -- far more costly than they should be. Normally, you\u2019d be looking at -- if you looked at the 10-year rate, which is 60 basis points, the mortgage is basically 1.6% or 1.8%, instead of 3.3%. The cost of the reason for that is because the cost of servicing and origination is so high, it's obviously got to be passed through. It\u2019s high because there's enormous amount of rules and regulations put in place that a lot do not create safety and soundness. Safety and soundness is basically 80% LTV, verified people's incomes, make sure you\u2019re doing the right kind of stuff. And the second one is because it's very no securitization market. The securitization market is important because it reduces your risk-weighted asset and puts more incentive for banks to put on your balance sheet. And the securitization market is a real transfer of risk to somebody else. So, I think they should change that. They should change it immediately. The beneficiary of that will be non-agency mortgages, which are even more -- a lot more expensive than agency mortgages. So, once you have a securitization market that people believe in and you have to change Reg A, B a little bit that, you have a much better market, the cost of mortgage will come down, and will particularly come down for people that are at the lower end. I mean, so this should be phased and it should be phased right away.\nOperator: Our next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS.\nSaul Martinez: I have a broader question, and I just want to get your perspectives on public policy and banks and a little bit more broadly than the discussion about capital planning and stress testing. And I know banks are working hard to be part of solution this time and not part of the problem. But, we're also having more open discussions about things like inequality and social justice, which, in my opinion, are long overdue. But, I worry that fair or not, banks are sort of being depicted as being on the wrong side of some of those issues. And I think you see that in things like the mainstream press\u2019s depiction of big banks in PPP and stuff like that. And I'm just curious if you are concerned at all about populist anti-bank policies gaining traction, however you want to define them, whether it's breaking up the banks, directed lending, rate capture, or whatever, in a pretty polarized political environment, or do you think I'm being too alarmist or overly concerned about stuff that is pretty unlikely in our country? So, just kind of want to get your perspective just generally and how banks fit into the overall policy and political backdrop.\nJamie Dimon: Then thing you got to do every single day when you go to work is to do the right thing for the right reason, serve your customers, and we try to do this. We try very hard to take care of our employees, to train people, we try very hard to advance black lead into the company and finance and others. And of course, we make mistakes. And so, I understand some of the angst out there. But, we try to do the best we can. We get involved in policy, like this mortgage thing, that would be better for Americans. And we understand that people want banks to help America and we do. The most important thing that we can do is be healthy and vibrant bank through this crisis and continue to serve our clients. And remember, responsible lending is good lending. Irresponsible lending is bad lending. So, very often, we hear that banks should do more of that. No, irresponsible stuff is irresponsible. It will lead to bad outcomes. And that's kind of what happened last time around. So, we try to do it right and we try to listen very carefully when there's criticism and sometimes -- and often legitimate about what we could have done better or should do better or try to do better in the future.\nSaul Martinez: Okay. That's helpful. I guess as broad as that question was, I am going to ask a very narrow question for Jen and on your NII guidance. I presume that includes gains on PPP fees for unforgiven loans. And have you quantified that or sized that up in terms of where you think the magnitude of those figures could be?\nJennifer Piepszak: So, we've been really clear on PPP, which is that we don't intend to profit from PPP. That doesn't mean that you won't have some geography issues. So you'll have some revenue and then you'll have expenses and the profit will be near zero. It is immaterial amount this quarter, given these fees are recognized over the lives of the loans. So, it's very little this quarter, both revenue and expenses. And looking out, you'll see -- we'll see more of that probably in the third and fourth quarter. Again, it will still be zero on the bottom line. And even the gross numbers won't be meaningful in the grand scheme of things.\nOperator: Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Can you share with us the reclassification of the wholesale portfolio that you talked about? How often do you go through that process where you have to look to reclassify the corporate loans? And second, you touched on earlier in a question about some of the COVID-related sectors that are being impacted because of what we're going through. Can you highlight for us what is the most stressed within that COVID group that you mentioned?\nJennifer Piepszak: So, first on that reclassification, we mentioned it was a geography issue in Merchant Services. But, it didn't have to\u2026\nJamie Dimon: There was no reclassification of wholesale loans.\nJennifer Piepszak: Yes. And then, in terms of the most impacted, I mean, they are the ones that you would expect to see around travel, oil and gas, and real estate and retail. So, it's the sectors that you would expect to see. Although, as I said earlier, and it's important to note that for the downgrades that we experienced in the second quarter, less than a third of them were in the most impacted industry. So, really this is -- we're seeing this as being much more broad-based.\nGerard Cassidy: Okay. Thank you. And then second, I may have missed this, so I apologize. But, in your slide 3, you gave a very good detail on the forbearance on the consumer portfolio. Do you have any numbers on the commercial and corporate portfolios that loans that might be in forbearance? And is it more commercial real estate or C&I?\nJennifer Piepszak: They're just not meaningful numbers. We would have included them, had they been? So, I'll just go back to what we said, which is we're just not seeing what you would typically see.\nJamie Dimon: But they end up in non-performing.\nJennifer Piepszak: They end up in non-performing.\nJamie Dimon: We don't have a category in wholesale or commercial, the same way you have a category in consumer.\nOperator: And our next question is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.\nKen Usdin: Thanks. Good morning. Just a question on the points in slides you made about capital and long-term opportunities for recalibration. First, I guess, will you have any dialogue with the Fed about the 3.3 SCB as some other banks have mentioned? And then, secondly, where do you think we stand on the GSIB recalibration to your points about systemic risk, not that shouldn't impact a bank's balance sheet?\nJamie Dimon: We're not going to go back to the Fed and the 3.3%, but obviously we're looking at why 3.3% and we can try to adjust our plans going forward to try to reduce that number a little bit. Because we have another CCAR coming up in a couple of months, so there's no reason for us to go through extensive work as opposed to fix what's already there. And GSIB, look, I've always thought GSIB needed a lot of recalibration. But, there are things they should have recalibrated for already, which is America gold plated, which I think is wholly unnecessary. They should have taken cash and treasury and a whole bunch of stuff out of the calculation. Because obviously it goes way up when the Fed does things like they\u2019re doing recently and they never adjusted it for growth in the economy or growth in the shadow banking system, which they were supposed to do. So, I'm just hoping they go about and do that at one point. But these things get so wrapped up in political. People politicize very complicated calculations, which I thought kind of peculiar and funny. But my view is that they do the numbers, they should do them right. And they're just not right anymore.\nKen Usdin: Yes. And the second question is just going back to slide three. You lay out the percent of accounts on this page. Auto seems to be the biggest. And then, in the supplement on page 13, the balances seem to imply a bigger percent on deferral. Just can you talk a little bit about the differences there and then why do you think you're seeing more accounts in auto deferring versus other asset classes? Thank you.\nJennifer Piepszak: Okay. I don't actually know the answer to reconciling the supplement to slide 3. So, Jason and team can follow up with you on that one.\nKen Usdin: Maybe then, just a comment about auto on deferrals and why do you -- what do you think you're seeing in that customer base versus others? And do you think that means anything different for forward credit trends?\nJamie Dimon: No.\nJennifer Piepszak: No, yes.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer.\nChris Kotowski: Good morning. Thank you. I guess, I just think it was such an extraordinary quarter for capital raising. Dealogic shows over $2 trillion of debt and equity raised in the quarter. And I guess, a two-part question around that. One is, as you look at that, was a good portion of that in kind of the stressed areas, and presumably capital that\u2019s junior to your bank debt? And to what extent has all that helped raise the quality of bank loans? And then, secondly, looking forward, I mean, did all the companies that needed to and could raise capital do so in the second quarter and therefore, we're looking at kind of the flat spot going forward, or do you see this kind of -- like there's an ongoing need for a lot of these companies continue to raise capital?\nJamie Dimon: I think -- first of all, it is across the board. I mean, you saw strong companies, weaker companies, high-yield markets opened up. Converts, I put converts and equity in there too. People did a lot of capital raising. I think, it was wise. I think a lot of people said, they pre-funded a lot of the capital needs to make sure that can get through whatever this crisis means for their company and their industry and stuff like that. So, I don't think it would be like it was before, so it'll definitely come down, but I still think there's opportunity for some people to pre-fund some of that. But, it is pre-funding because this is not capital -- a lot of this capital's not being raised to go spend. It\u2019s being raised to sit in the balance sheet so that you're prepared for whatever comes next. And you've heard a lot of companies make statements and you guys got to go through yourself about, we\u2019ve got two years of cash, we\u2019ve got three years of cash, we\u2019ve got -- people want to be prepared. I think it's appropriate.\nChris Kotowski: Okay. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you.\nJamie Dimon: But just for your models, we don't expect revenues in Investment Banking, they will normalize or even come down below normal next quarter and the quarters out. At one point, we can't predict month by month exactly, and for trading because no one else, cut it in half, cut it in half. And that will probably be closer to the future than if you say it's going to still be double what it normally runs.\nOperator: And our next question is from Andrew Lim of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\nAndrew Lim: Thanks for taking my questions. And I think they are quite straightforward. I just wanted some clarity really on the nature of CECL provisioning. And obviously, you've made some very big provisions based on much more conservative assumptions. But, the nature of CECL provisioning obviously should meant that in the third quarter, if your assumptions do not change, then your provisions should fall down quite considerably versus the second quarter to a much more normal level. I just wanted to see how you thought about that for third quarter?\nJennifer Piepszak: Sure. So, I would start by saying where we are right now, while there is a conservative bias to where we are right now, it is our best estimate of what we're facing. We certainly hope that in the future we look back on this as a conservative moment, but this is our best estimate. And so, if our assumptions are realized, and again, our reserve reflects something worse than the base case. So, if that's realized, then we shouldn\u2019t see meaningful reserve builds in the third quarter, or if that continues to be -- in the third quarter.\nAndrew Lim: So, I mean, context, would it be similar to that we've seen 2019, for example?\nJennifer Piepszak: Yes. You have reserves for growth but not for the prices.\nAndrew Lim: Exactly. That\u2019s very clear. And then, on the CIB trading environment, obviously we saw June and we've seen a bit of July. Would you say that's normalized to the level consistent with what we've seen in 2019, or are you still seeing some pretty strong trading following through into the second quarter -- sorry, into the third quarter ?\nJamie Dimon: I just answered said that question. You should assume it's going to fall in half. We don't know, it\u2019s only a couple weeks into this thing. But we don't assume we have these unbelievable trading results going forward. And hopefully, we'll do better than that. And we simply don't know. I also said one point of reserving since it's probabilistic. You can actually change nothing in your assumptions, but the probabilities of potential outcomes and put up more reserves.\nOperator: We have no further questions at this time.\nJennifer Piepszak: Thank you.\nJamie Dimon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jamie Dimon",
            "content": "This is Jamie. I'd just like to amply a couple of these points. So, we are showing this example, obviously it's predicated on a lot of assumptions, which we're not going to give you a lot of detail on, just simply to show that we could bear another $20 billion of loan loss reserves. That $20 billion brings us to an Extreme Adverse, which roughly may equate to U or W of the Fed, and we're going to do a lot more analysis on that because obviously we need to prepare for that. We dip into advanced CET1, that's because we're taking no actions. So, I've always told you that advanced capital is very pro-cyclical. So, as things get downgraded, your RWA goes way up. The capital base doesn't change that much, but the RWA goes way up. And there'd be lots of actions we would take that we could avoid that from taking place whatsoever. The other thing I want to point out is this Extreme Adverse probably can't happen in one quarter. It will happen in several quarters. Because we really know kind of what July looks like and August and stuff like that. So, even if the economy starts to head there, it will take us a couple of quarters before you make the determination that that has a 100% possibility. Remember, this is saying, we now believe it's 100%. Of course, things can be worse by the way, but we're just trying to show you that how much capital the Company does have. And the dividend -- now I'm going to be -- it sounds like I'm going to contradict myself. I am not. Okay? Today, we have all that PPNR, all of that earnings, all the things. So, it'd be kind of foolish to get the future of Extreme Adverse and cut your dividend. Because we can easily get through very, very tough times and never cut the dividend. However, if you enter something like Extreme Adverse, all of a sudden, you have new scenarios which are even worse. You don't know. So, at one point, the Board will consider cutting the dividend because it will basically get even worse in Extreme Adverse and we want to be able to handle anything out there. The primary concern of the Company is to serve our clients, serve our community through thick and think, and no one should ever worry about JPMorgan Chase. So, there's no intent to do it. But if things get really bad, I mean, we use the word materially and significantly, that's something we should look at. The other thing, by the way is these loan losses are our best estimate of loan losses and not the CCAR type of stuff. You all are doing estimates that show DFAST and Fed adverse. We will not move that kind of money on credit. Okay? And on the next page, Jen's going to explain some stuff. I'm going to make a few slight additional comments. I also want you to -- she said that we're not going to use temporary buffers. I think, the temporary is a funny thing to go into a crisis that you could use it for a while but disappears on March 1st or February 1s. So, my view is, we shouldn't rely on anything like that. Yes. Again, I just want to emphasize couple of things here. So, look, the point of CCAR was that banks can handle extreme stress and if everything goes wrong. CCAR itself is not a predictive forecast of what your results might be. So, all the CCAR tests roughly equate to global financial crisis and all the CCAR tests always have us losing somewhere between $25 billion and $30 billion over the ensuing nine quarters. But, in ensuing nine quarters at the Lehman, we made $30 billion. We never lost money in a quarter. We take action, we diversify, we've got to have streams of earnings. And we're not against CCAR, because that's protecting you from the worst of the worst of the worst. But that's not necessarily predictive. The global market shock, which I think they have $25 billion in counterparty losses. Again, just to be instructive of that, in \u201808 and \u201809, you had Fannie Mae go bankrupt, Freddie Mac go bankrupt, you had Bear Stearns effectively, you had Lehman Bros. effectively, you had AIG effectively, you had tons of financial institutions in Europe, tons of counterparty failures and our trading results in the worst two quarters combined was a loss of $4 billion, not $25 billion. And of course, it was quickly made back because as we pointed out, when things get bad in trading, spreads gap out, and then all of a sudden you're making more money trading because you -- and you have recoveries in position. So, the stress capital buffer of 3.3% is not indicative of what we would lose. And so, -- and I hope over time, we could drive that down by taking real actions to a number close to 2.5%. GSIB itself, I pointed out before, I'm not against the concept of big banks and the more capital. But GSIB is -- it's not the same CCAR. CCAR includes your diversification, your strength, your earnings, your PPNR, and things like that, GSIB does not. It's just a measure of size multiplied over and over and over. It doesn't include diversification. It doesn't include margins. It doesn't include actions. It doesn't include -- it's just really not representative of all, but I would say is risk of a company or something like that. And so, we have enough capital to handle a lot of stuff, which is we've always run the Company that way, so that we can handle at adverse times because in my short lifetime, I've seen crises over and over and over and over. We're not predicting them. We're just prepared for them. So, I stop there. Betsy, as I just clarify, the base case, if you took Morgan Stanley's estimates or Mike Feroli or JP Morgan or the Fed estimates for their base case, that is basically the base case. Embedded in that are all these assumptions about that stimulus and P2P and all these are things. So, that is the base case, and we're reserved more than that. So, therefore, if the base case happens, we may be over-reserved. I hope the base case happens. Yes. And just to amplify, in the normal recession, unemployment goes up, delinquencies go up, charges go up, home prices go down. None of that's true here. Incomes go down, savings go down. Savings are up, incomes are up, home prices are up. So, you will see the effect of this recession. You're not going to see it right away because of all the stimulus and the fact, 60% or 70% of the unemployed are making more money than they were making when they were working. So, it's just very peculiar times. I don't expect any change. And like I said, they're not -- what they're looking at is they are making sure a bank can withstand the bad -- as if they were all the worst bank. They're not giving credit to banks for things happy and good. So I'm not against that concept. I just want to say, if it goes really bad and you do everything totally wrong, what happens to your trading or something like that? And they do the same assumptions like outflows. The outflows they have on liquidity are worse than the outflows of the worst bank in the worst crisis. But, they just want to make sure that every bank can withstand that. As the Fed grows the balance sheet, it's going to end up in deposits. And for the most part, a lot of deposits is going to be securities. Because the loan growth usually go to recession doesn't go up that much. I should point out that look at the big numbers. We have over $1 trillion between cash held at the central banks, which is close to $400 billion or $500 billion; treasuries, which is close to $700 billion; and other very liquid assets, mostly in good securities, that's $1 trillion. People look at the safety and soundness of institution like this. That is a tremendous sum of money. Some is required -- we are required to hold a lot of liquidity, but of some it just because we're investing conservatively. We hope we're over-reserved... We feel exactly the same today that we did at the end of the quarter that's sort of mark to market. And Mike, we are very clear. We cannot forecast the future. We don't know. We're also very clear that -- I know at least I think you're going to have a much murkier economic environment going forward than you had in May and June and that -- you have to be prepared. You're going to have a lot of ins and outs. People get scared about COVID. They're going to get scared about the economy, small businesses, the companies, bankruptcies, emerging markets. So, it is just going to be murky, which is why, if you look at the base case, adverse and extreme adverse case, they're all possible. And we're just guessing the probabilities of those things. That's what we're doing. We are prepared for the worst case. We simply don't know. I don't think anyone knows. And this -- the word unprecedented rarely is used properly. This time, it's been used properly. It's unprecedented what's going on around the world. Obviously, COVID itself is a main attribute. So, the Fed's W case, they made it very clear. Their W case is that COVID comes back in a big way in the fall, and you have to shut down the economy again. And obviously, we've got to be careful. We don't know the probability of that. We simply don't know, by the way we're wasting time guessing. That's completely sustainable. And if we enter the Extreme Adverse case, the Board should and will consider reducing it. As I pointed out, the Extreme Adverse case itself is completely sustainable with the dividend. The reason they would consider reducing it, is because once you enter like 14% or 15% unemployment, you don't know the future. So, now you're going to have another Extreme Adverse case, which is going to be 20% unemployment. And therefore, you protect yourself from that and cutting the dividend is cheap equity. And so, the goal is to sustain the dividends. You can look at the numbers. It's completely miniscule relative quarter-by-quarter. So, this decision could be made, as you enter these things. And we're all hoping the base case happens. There's no difference between the two. You cut your dividend. You got to hopefully put it back when the time comes. And so, the temporary suspension just sounds peculiar. It's a suspension. And I've done that twice in my life. It's a prudent thing to do. And if you might need that capital going forward, you could think you're going to get that terrible, something like that. So, then the other thing, you can ask the other question. If the base case happens, we're going to end up with far too much capital generation. And we'll start buying back stock again, which I hope we can do before it goes way up. We don't expect that this year. But, I wouldn't completely rule it out in the fourth quarter. So, let me answer this way. On the consumer side, we, like other banks have seen, are kind of prudent tightening with how you do credit. That's already happened. And obviously, you could do some more. But Jen, you had some great numbers about how good credit is. I think, the -- give those FICO's numbers you gave me the other day. Well, how much better Home Lending is... And you can assume it's better in credit cards, it's better and auto. We have less subprime. That's a consumer side. On the lending -- on the business side, we've always been prudent. We're always very tight and careful and stuff like that. Usually what happens in downturns like this, you get a little -- more serious about security and the management team and responsiveness and raising capital. So, a lot of these companies have been raising a lot of capital. On the investment side, and this is a kind of a peculiarity of accounting again, we can actually make it more conservative, putting securities into help maturity, which we've done very little and I'm going to consider -- I don't personally understand why that reduces risk, but it does reduce your SCB. And, maybe we'll do that over time. But, the security portfolios are pretty prudent. There are -- and in trading it's every day. So trading is -- just think of trading is that Daniel, and Troy Rohrbaugh and Jason Sippel and the whole team, they are every single day managing those risks and those exposures. And you could assume that they're managing very, very well and tightly today. And we certainly are not punting for fences or anything like that. We're trying to be very cautious and serve our clients. And so, yes, you are more conservative. And reducing RWA, yes, we can, if we wanted, we could start doing that by all these various things. Yes. So, deposit number -- deposits went up with the PPP. Deposits went up because of the payroll checks that people got. Deposits went up -- the revolvers are taken down by $50 billion, something like that. And of course all of that's already reversed and stuff like that. So, you have to look at both sides of that. But, you were going to say something, Jen? There is no temporary relief in CET1. And they're both. We manage them both. So, I wouldn't say one is more than the other. We manage something like 20 different capital liquidity ratios. I don't. The COVID, you could be -- obviously we have some insights. The COVID, obviously we're going to run a new stress test, we're going to look at all step cases, UW and stuff like that because they laid it out, perfectly reasonable that people would refer to that kind of stress test. I think the mortgage markets is a different issue. Okay? And we've been very consistent that mortgages, believe it or not are more -- far more costly than they should be. Normally, you'd be looking at -- if you looked at the 10-year rate, which is 60 basis points, the mortgage is basically 1.6% or 1.8%, instead of 3.3%. The cost of the reason for that is because the cost of servicing and origination is so high, it's obviously got to be passed through. It's high because there's enormous amount of rules and regulations put in place that a lot do not create safety and soundness. Safety and soundness is basically 80% LTV, verified people's incomes, make sure you're doing the right kind of stuff. And the second one is because it's very no securitization market. The securitization market is important because it reduces your risk-weighted asset and puts more incentive for banks to put on your balance sheet. And the securitization market is a real transfer of risk to somebody else. So, I think they should change that. They should change it immediately. The beneficiary of that will be non-agency mortgages, which are even more -- a lot more expensive than agency mortgages. So, once you have a securitization market that people believe in and you have to change Reg A, B a little bit that, you have a much better market, the cost of mortgage will come down, and will particularly come down for people that are at the lower end. I mean, so this should be phased and it should be phased right away. Then thing you got to do every single day when you go to work is to do the right thing for the right reason, serve your customers, and we try to do this. We try very hard to take care of our employees, to train people, we try very hard to advance black lead into the company and finance and others. And of course, we make mistakes. And so, I understand some of the angst out there. But, we try to do the best we can. We get involved in policy, like this mortgage thing, that would be better for Americans. And we understand that people want banks to help America and we do. The most important thing that we can do is be healthy and vibrant bank through this crisis and continue to serve our clients. And remember, responsible lending is good lending. Irresponsible lending is bad lending. So, very often, we hear that banks should do more of that. No, irresponsible stuff is irresponsible. It will lead to bad outcomes. And that's kind of what happened last time around. So, we try to do it right and we try to listen very carefully when there's criticism and sometimes -- and often legitimate about what we could have done better or should do better or try to do better in the future. There was no reclassification of wholesale loans. But they end up in non-performing. We don't have a category in wholesale or commercial, the same way you have a category in consumer. We're not going to go back to the Fed and the 3.3%, but obviously we're looking at why 3.3% and we can try to adjust our plans going forward to try to reduce that number a little bit. Because we have another CCAR coming up in a couple of months, so there's no reason for us to go through extensive work as opposed to fix what's already there. And GSIB, look, I've always thought GSIB needed a lot of recalibration. But, there are things they should have recalibrated for already, which is America gold plated, which I think is wholly unnecessary. They should have taken cash and treasury and a whole bunch of stuff out of the calculation. Because obviously it goes way up when the Fed does things like they're doing recently and they never adjusted it for growth in the economy or growth in the shadow banking system, which they were supposed to do. So, I'm just hoping they go about and do that at one point. But these things get so wrapped up in political. People politicize very complicated calculations, which I thought kind of peculiar and funny. But my view is that they do the numbers, they should do them right. And they're just not right anymore. No. I think -- first of all, it is across the board. I mean, you saw strong companies, weaker companies, high-yield markets opened up. Converts, I put converts and equity in there too. People did a lot of capital raising. I think, it was wise. I think a lot of people said, they pre-funded a lot of the capital needs to make sure that can get through whatever this crisis means for their company and their industry and stuff like that. So, I don't think it would be like it was before, so it'll definitely come down, but I still think there's opportunity for some people to pre-fund some of that. But, it is pre-funding because this is not capital -- a lot of this capital's not being raised to go spend. It's being raised to sit in the balance sheet so that you're prepared for whatever comes next. And you've heard a lot of companies make statements and you guys got to go through yourself about, we've got two years of cash, we've got three years of cash, we've got -- people want to be prepared. I think it's appropriate. But just for your models, we don't expect revenues in Investment Banking, they will normalize or even come down below normal next quarter and the quarters out. At one point, we can't predict month by month exactly, and for trading because no one else, cut it in half, cut it in half. And that will probably be closer to the future than if you say it's going to still be double what it normally runs. I just answered said that question. You should assume it's going to fall in half. We don't know, it's only a couple weeks into this thing. But we don't assume we have these unbelievable trading results going forward. And hopefully, we'll do better than that. And we simply don't know. I also said one point of reserving since it's probabilistic. You can actually change nothing in your assumptions, but the probabilities of potential outcomes and put up more reserves. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Piepszak. Ms. Piepszak, please go ahead.\nJennifer Piepszak: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. As you heard, Jamie is with me on the call. And I know I speak for the entire Company when I say, we\u2019re just thrilled that he is back. Before we get into the first quarter performance, we want to start by recognizing that this is an extremely challenging time for all of us and our thoughts are with those most affected by COVID-19, particularly those on the front lines of this crisis. The presentation this quarter is slightly longer to address a few key topics as we navigate this environment. And as always, it\u2019s available on our website and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back.  Starting on page 1, I\u2019d like to highlight some of the ways we\u2019re responding to COVID-19. As a firm, we are focused on being there for our employees, customers, clients, and communities in what is an unprecedented and uncertain environment. And while we don\u2019t know how this will play out, we will be transparent here about our assumptions and what we know today. Our number one priority is to continue to provide our services in an uninterrupted way, while also providing a safe work environment for our employees. We\u2019re incredibly proud of all that our firm has been able to do over the past few weeks. So, I\u2019ll just hit on a few examples here. We\u2019ve mobilized our workforce around the globe to work remotely where feasible, including operations and finance teams, portfolio and risk managers, bankers and traders, ensuring they have the right tools to work effectively. Currently, we have about 70% working from home across the Company and for many groups that number is well north of 90%. And for those who still need to go into the office or into a branch, we are taking extra precautions and being extremely mindful of their safety. And we\u2019re providing assistance in other ways too. For instance, we\u2019re offering free COVID-related medical treatment to U.S. employees and their dependents. On the consumer side, approximately three quarters of our 5,000 branches have been open all with heightened safety procedures and many with drive-thru options. And the vast majority of our over 16,000 ATMs remain accessible. And while our call center capacity has been challenged, we quickly activated resiliency plans to address customer calls seeking assistance, and we\u2019ve put in place new digital and self service solutions in record time. And while wait times have been extended, we\u2019re making good progress reducing them. For our customers who are struggling financially during this time, we\u2019re providing relief such as a 90-day grace period for mortgage, auto and card payments as well as waiving or refunding certain fees. We continue to support our customers and clients by providing liquidity and advice during this challenging market environment. And in the month of March, we extended more than $100 billion of new credit. In wholesale, clients drew more than $50 billion on their revolvers with us. And we approved over $25 billion of new credit extensions for clients most impacted. And for our small business clients, we\u2019re actively supporting the SBA\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program. The numbers you see on the slide are as of April 12th; and as of this morning, we have more than 300,000 in some stage of the application process, representing $37 billion in loans. And we funded $9.3 billion to businesses with over 700,000 employees. And to help the most vulnerable and hardest hit communities as an initial step, we\u2019ve announced $150 million loan program to give capital to underserved small businesses and nonprofits as well as a $50 million philanthropic investment. Now, turning to page 2 for highlights on our first quarter financial performance. For the quarter, the firm reported net income of $2.9 billion, EPS of $0.78 and revenue of $29.1 billion with the return on tangible common equity of 5%. While the underlying business fundamentals this quarter performed very well, we reported a number of significant items all due to impacts from COVID-19, which I\u2019ll discuss in more detail later. But at a high level, these items are, a credit reserve build $6.8 billion; approximately $950 million of losses in CIB, largely due to the widening of funding spreads on derivatives; and a $900 million markdown on our bridge book. It might be an obvious point, but the quarter was really a tale of two cities, January and February, and then March when the crisis started to unfold. And with that, I thought it would be helpful to talk through some key metrics that highlight this dynamic across our businesses. So, let\u2019s go to page 3. Starting with card sales volume on the top left. In March, we saw a rapid decline in spend initially in travel and entertainment, which then spread to restaurants and retail as social distancing protocols were implemented more broadly. While most spend categories were ultimately impacted, we did see an initial boost to supermarkets, wholesale clubs, and discount stores as people stocked up on provisions. But even that is now starting to normalize. And we saw similar trends in merchant services as highlighted in a significant decline in brick & mortar spend, excluding supermarkets, whereas e-commerce spend has held up well by comparison. In investment banking, in the middle of the page, there was a surge in debt issuance by investment grade clients as the market remained open, and clients\u2019 desire to shore up liquidity was top of mind. It was the largest quarter ever in terms of investment grade debt issuance, led by JPMorgan. And in markets, volatility drove elevated trading volumes across products, most notably across rates and commodities, which at their peak were more than triple our average January trading volumes. And on the far right, deposit growth accelerated meaningfully in March, most notably driven by wholesale clients as they secured liquidity and held those higher cash balances with us. At the same time, we saw accelerating loan growth, primarily driven by revolver draws. And finally, flows in AWM were meaningfully different in March compared to January and February. Long-term flows through February were strong, positive across all asset classes, but this was more than offset by outflows in March. On the flip side, we saw significant net liquidity inflows into our government funds during March, which more than offset prime money market outflows. Onto page four and some more detail about our first quarter results. Revenue of $29.1 billion was down $782 million or 3% year-on-year, as net interest income was flat to the prior year due to the impact of lower rates, offset by balance sheet growth and mix and higher CIB markets NII. And noninterest revenue was down 5% driven by the significant items I already mentioned, which were largely offset by higher CIB markets revenue. Expenses of $16.9 billion were up 3%, driven by higher volume and revenue related expenses, continued investments and higher legal expense, all of which were largely offset by structural expense efficiencies. This quarter, credit costs were $8.3 billion including a net reserve build of $6.8 billion, reflecting the impact of COVID-19 and net charge-offs of $1.5 billion, in line with prior expectations. Now, turning to page 5, we\u2019ll have some more detail on the reserve builds. Our net reserve build of $6.8 billion for the quarter consists of $4.4 billion in consumer, predominantly in card, and $2.4 billion and wholesale with builds primarily due to impact of COVID-19 as well as lower oil prices. This reserve increase assumes in the second quarter that U.S. GDP is down approximately 25% and the unemployment rate rises above 10%, followed by solid recovery over the second half of the year. In addition to these macro assumptions specific to each business, our consumer reserve build reflects our best estimate of the impact of payment relief that we are providing for our customers as well as the federal government stimulus programs. And in wholesale, the majority of the build is in sectors most directly impacted by COVID-19, such as in consumer and retail, and also in oil and gas. We expect other sectors to be impacted to a lesser extent if we avoid a prolonged downturn. We have also assumed that the stress in oil and gas continues with WTI remaining below $40 through the end of 2021. After we closed the books for the quarter, our economists updated their outlook, which now reflect a more significant deterioration in U.S. GDP and unemployment. If that scenario were to hold, we would be building in the second quarter and builds could be meaningfully higher in aggregate over the next several quarters relative to what we took in the first quarter. A primary unknown is the duration of the crisis, which will directly impact losses across our portfolio. But that being said, our consumer portfolio skews more prime than the industry average and the effectiveness of government support, customer relief and enhanced unemployment benefits while uncertain, undoubtedly will act as mitigants to the losses. And even though our losses will be material, we will be doing what we can to help our customers recover from this crisis, and help our clients stay in business. Now, moving to balance sheet and capital on page six. Our balance sheet capital and liquidity going into this crisis were incredibly strong, and importantly allowed us to facilitate client needs in a period of stress. And that combined with our earnings power is an extraordinary base to absorb the inevitable losses to come. For the quarter, we distributed $8.8 billion of capital to shareholders, which includes $6 billion in net share repurchases up to March 15th. Since then, we stopped our buybacks, which was both a prudent decision at the time and consistent with what we always say, which is that we would prefer to use our capital to serve our customers and clients. This capital distribution outweighed our earnings for the quarter. And this coupled with significant RWA growth resulted in a decline in our CET1 ratio to 11.5%. On RWA, which you can see on the bottom right of the page, the key drivers of growth were market volatility which should subside over time, and more importantly, an increase in lending at this critical time for our clients. Going forward, in order to leverage our balance sheet to serve our clients, we are prepared to use our internal buffers, which may mean our CET1 ratio falls below our target range and if necessary, we can also use regulatory buffers to go below our 10.5% minimum. It\u2019s worth noting here that in an environment like this it\u2019s precisely why we have the buffers in the first place. We currently also have capacity and intend to continue to pay the $0.90 dividend pending Board approval. And as you can see in the CET1 walk on the bottom left, it is a small claim on our capital base. And before we move on, just a moment on liquidity. Even with everything we facilitated, our liquidity position remains strong. And looking forward, it\u2019s helpful to remember that we have significant liquidity resources beyond HQLA, including the discount window, if need be. And now, turning to businesses starting with consumer and community banking on page 7. CCB reported net income of $191 million, including reserve builds of $4.5 billion. January and February showed a continuation of strength across the business but again, March showed a major shift in trends. And across our consumer segment, we saw a drastic deceleration in spend across all forms of payments, and a decline in origination volumes except in the mortgage refi market. And on the small business side, we saw significantly reduced inflows and merchant processing activities, early signs of pressure on payment and frequency rates as well as line utilization and increased demand for credit. Turning back to the results. Revenue of $13.2 billion was down 2% year-on-year. In consumer and business banking, revenue was down 9%, driven by deposit margin compression, partially offset by strong deposit growth of 8% that accelerated in the quarter. Deposit margin was down 56 basis points year-on-year and we expect it to decline further given the current rate environment. Home lending revenue was down 14%, driven by lower net servicing revenue and lower NII, partially offset by higher net production revenue. And in card and auto, revenue was up 8%, driven by higher card NII on loan growth and margin expansion. Average card loan growth was 8% with sales up 4% over the quarter, driven by January and February activity. Expenses of $7.2 billion were up 3%, driven by revenue related costs from higher volumes as well as continued investments in the business, partially offset by structural expense efficiencies. And lastly on this slide, credit costs included the $4.5 billion reserve builds I mentioned earlier and net charge-offs of $1.3 billion, driven by card and consistent with prior expectations. Now turning to the corporate and investment bank on page 8. CIB reported net income of $2 billion and an ROE of 9% on revenue of $9.9 billion. Investment banking in the first half of the quarter showed continued momentum from last year, but as the market environment shifted, we saw delays in M&A announcements and completions, postponements of new equity issuance and increased draws on existing lines of credit. At the same time, the investment grade debt market remained open and we helped our investment grade clients raise approximately $380 billion of debt in the quarter across a wide range of sectors. By contrast, the high yield market was effectively closed and high yield spreads widened significantly. As a result, our bridge book commitments were marked down by $820 million. And here, it\u2019s worth noting, our bridge book exposure is about a quarter of what it was, entering the 2008 crisis and is a higher quality portfolio. As a result of this backdrop, IB revenue of $886 million was down 49% year-on-year, largely driven by the bridge book markdown. IB fees were up 3% year-on-year and we maintained our number one rank with 9.1% wallet share. Advisory was down 22%, not only due to a tough compare but also reflecting delays in regulatory approvals, pushing out the closing of certain large deals. We did however complete more deals than any other banks this quarter. Equity underwriting was up 25% versus a challenged first quarter last year and we saw strong activity in January and February before the market effectively closed in March. And debt underwriting was up 15% and an all-time record. We maintained our number one rank with 9.5% share, up 90 basis points from 2019. Lending revenue was up 36% year-on-year, driven by the impact of spread widening on loan hedges. Looking forward, while a rapid recovery in the economy could produce the corresponding rebound in activity, we could also see significant downside risk to our forward-looking pipeline if the downturn is protracted. Now, moving to markets. Here, total revenue was $7.2 billion, up 32% year-on-year. It\u2019s worth noting that even before the crisis, as we said at Investor Day, markets performance was strong for the quarter. Then, the growing COVID-19 concerns triggered a major correction in equity markets, significant widening of spreads and a spike in volatility, leading to extraordinary government intervention and a substantial change in monetary policy followed by a sharp decline in treasury yields. Simultaneously, we also saw a drop in oil prices. This unique combination of events led to further increased client participation and record trading volumes in several products. Fixed income was up 34%, driven by strong client activity, most notably in rates and currencies and emerging markets. Equity markets was up 28% on strength in equity derivatives, driven by increased client activity. In terms of outlook, it goes without saying that it\u2019s too early to project this performance going forward. In fact, low rates and low economic activity may even be a headwind. However, we are in a strong position to continue playing essential role in ensuring the orderly functioning of markets and serving our clients\u2019 needs. And now, on to wholesale payments, the new business unit we\u2019re recording this quarter, comprised of treasury services, trade finance, and the merchant services business, which was previously part of CCB. Wholesale payments revenue of $1.4 billion was down 4% year-on-year driven by reporting re-classification in merchant services. As clients focused on preserving liquidity, we experienced higher deposit levels in wholesale payments throughout the quarter, offsetting revenue headwinds from lower rates and payments activity. In security services, revenue was $1.1 billion, up 6% year-on-year. Market volatility drove increased transaction volumes and deposit balances, which offset the impact of the market correction on asset balances. In wholesale payments and security services, tailwinds from this quarter, like elevated deposit balances, may be relatively short lived and more than offset by the impact of low rates and potentially lower transaction volumes if the crisis is elongated. Credit adjustments and other was a loss of $951 million, which was one of the significant items that I mentioned upfront. Credit costs were $1.4 billion, driven by the net reserve builds I referred to earlier. And finally, expenses of $5.9 billion were up 5%, driven by higher legal and volume-related expenses and continued investments. Now, moving onto commercial banking on page 9. Commercial banking reported net income of $147 million including reserve builds of approximately $900 million. Revenue of $2.2 billion was down 10% year-on-year with lower deposit NII on lower rates and the $76 million markdown on the bridge book, partially offset by higher deposit balances. Gross investment banking revenues were $686 million, down 16% year-on-year compared to a record prior year. While we remain confident in our long-term target, we expect some softness in our pipeline, specifically related to M&A and equity underwriting. Expenses of $988 million were up 5% year-on-year, consistent with the ongoing investments we discussed at Investor Day. Deposits were up 39% year-on-year on a spot basis and increased about $40 billion during the month of March with about half of that coming from clients drawing on their credit lines and holding their cash with us as they look to secure liquidity. End of period loans were up 14% year-on-year, mainly driven by increases in C&I loans in March. C&I loans were up 26% as revolver utilization increased to 44%, which is an all-time high. CRE loans were up 3%. And here, the story remains largely unchanged. Higher originations and commercial term lending driven by the low rate environment were partially offset by declines in real estate lending as we remain selective. Credit costs of $1 billion included the reserve builds I mentioned and $100 million of net charge-offs, largely driven by oil and gas. Now on to asset and wealth management on page 10. Asset and wealth management reported net income of $664 million with pretax margin of 24% and ROE of 25%. Revenue of $3.6 billion was up 3% year-on-year, driven by higher management fees on higher average market levels and net inflows over the past year. And then, in addition, we saw a record brokerage activity in March related to the recent market volatility. These increases were largely offset by lower investment valuations. Expenses of $2.7 billion were flat year-on-year with higher investments in the business as well as increased volume and revenue related expenses offset by lower structural expenses. Credit costs were $94 million, driven by reserve builds and the impact of COVID-19 as well as loan growth. Net long-term outflows were $2 billion as the strength we saw in January and February was more than offset in March. At the same time, we saw $75 billion of net liquidity inflows driven by significant inflows into our industry leading government funds in March, as I mentioned earlier. AUM of $2.2 trillion and overall client assets of $3 trillion, up 7% and 4% respectively were driven by cumulative net inflows, partially offset by lower market levels. Deposits were up 9% year-on-year on growth and interest bearing products. And finally, loan balances were up 11% with strength in both wholesale and mortgage lending. Now on to corporate page 11. Corporate reported a net loss of $125 million. Revenue was $166 million, a decline of $259 million year-on-year, primarily due to lower net interest income on lower rates, partially offset by higher net gains on investment securities. Expenses of $146 million were down $65 million year-on-year. And now, let\u2019s turn to page 12 for the outlook. At Investor Day, we showed you a path to 2020 where we expected net interest income to be slightly down from 2019. And obviously, since then, the backdrop has changed significantly. Based on the latest advice and what we know today, we expect to see further pressure from rates, partially offset by balance sheet growth in CIB markets and NII, which results in NII of about $55.5 billion for the full year. And to give you an idea for the second quarter, we expect NII to be $13.7 billion. On noninterest revenue, it\u2019s always difficult to provide meaningful guidance and even more so given the current heightened level of uncertainty. But based on our best estimates today, we do expect to see headwinds in 2020 compared to 2019. In addition to the two significant items in the first quarter, these headwinds include a $3.5 billion decrease in noninterest revenue, all else equal, which is also due to the impact of rates and is the offset to higher CIB markets NII and therefore revenue neutral. We also expect to see pressure on AWM and investment banking fees. And we now expect adjusted expenses for 2020 to be approximately $65 billion, largely due to lower volume and revenue-related expenses versus the outlook we provided at Investor Day. It goes without saying all of this is market dependent and we\u2019ll keep you updated at future earnings calls. So, to wrap up, the challenges we are all facing as the COVID-19 crisis continues to unfold around the globe are unprecedented. Although we don\u2019t quite know what the path will look like going forward, what we do know is that we will continue to be there for our employees, clients, customers and communities, as we always have been. And we have the talent, resources and operational resiliency to do so. Our employees have proven that being resilient is not just about maintaining operations, it\u2019s also about culture. And that feels stronger than ever with our teams work around the world working harder than ever to continue to serve our clients, customers and communities. We\u2019ve never been more proud of our people and we simply can\u2019t thank them enough. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.\nErika Najarian: Hi. Good morning. And Jamie, we\u2019re glad that you could join us and that you\u2019re well enough to join us. My first question is on the forbearance activity. Jen if you could give us a sense of by product, how many of your clients for example in card and auto, home lending, are in a forbearance state, so they started to defer the payments to the percentage of your clients? And how we should think about the significant government intervention relative to the severely adverse scenarios? I believe for total losses, it\u2019s 5.9% over nine quarters for the Fed and 4.1% for company-run.\nJennifer Piepszak: Sure. So, first of all, I\u2019ll start with that payment relief and forbearance there. I\u2019ll start by saying that we have already refunded millions of dollars in fees. We\u2019ve approved payment relief for hundreds of thousands of accounts across consumer lending. And we obviously expect that to be meaningfully higher through time. We\u2019ve paused foreclosures and auto repossessions. And importantly, we\u2019ve made the process easier for our customers through digital and self service options that we\u2019ve built in record time. But, in terms of what we\u2019re seeing, those are the numbers, they\u2019re still, as I said, relatively small compared to what we think we\u2019ll ultimately see. In mortgage, just to give you context outside of customers asking for forbearance, which is just a little over 4% of our service book at this time, the April 1st payments seems BAU. In card, we\u2019re seeing payment rates down a bit, but still strong. And we\u2019ve seen a slight uptick in late payments in auto. But the quality of these portfolios looks strong coming in as we\u2019ve done surgical risk management over the last few years. And that has made these portfolios more resilient. And then, in terms of how we think about significant government intervention, I mean, I think the ultimate effectiveness of these programs, which are extraordinary in terms of the direct payments or the enhanced unemployment insurance, the ultimate effectiveness is I think, the biggest unknown. The key obviously is being able to bridge people back to employment. And so, we have assumed, as we could, for our first quarter results, the impact of those programs as well as the ultimate impact on payment relief that we\u2019ll be providing for our customers. But that is for sure an unknown, and we certainly expect to learn a lot more about that in the second quarter.\nErika Najarian: Thank you. My second question, you mentioned that you\u2019re prepared to go below 10.5% CET1 to help your clients. Going below 10.5% is also when the automatic restrictions start kicking in from the Fed in terms of payout. So, if I understand it, it would be a 60% payout restriction on eligible net income. And I just wanted to understand your thoughts on balancing, servicing your clients and also thinking about your capital levels relative to those automatic restrictions from the regulators.\nJennifer Piepszak: Sure. So, as you probably know, Erika, that the Fed made some changes there recently, which, as you say, puts us in a 60% bucket as we go below 10.5%. And we have a reasonable amount of room below 10.5% to remain in the 60% bucket. I would say that that was very helpful clarification from the regulators in terms of how we should think about using regulatory buffers. So, that was particularly helpful. And right now, we are focused on serving our clients and customers. And we\u2019ve looked at a range of scenarios, so we can ensure that we\u2019re managing our capital quite carefully. Jamie talked about an extreme adverse scenario in his Chairman\u2019s letter that we\u2019ve looked at assuming large parts of the economy remaining in lockdown through the end of this year. And in that scenario, our CET1 drops to about 9.5%. And so, we think we have significant room to continue to serve our customers and clients through this crisis, but we are managing it quite carefully and looking at a range of scenarios. So, we make sure that we\u2019re prepared.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo.\nMike Mayo: Hi. And welcome back, Jamie. Questions for you. How do you thread the needle between supporting your customers and the country and doing all those things that you want to do while still protecting the resiliency of the balance sheet and not getting hit with unexpected litigation costs, as you mentioned in your CEO letter?\nJamie Dimon: Yes. No, it\u2019s a very important question. I think in times of need, banks have always been the lender of last resort to their customers. And obviously, you\u2019ve got to be a disciplined capital provider because undisciplined loans are bad. So, you take your calculated risks. We\u2019re making additional loans. We\u2019re adults. We know that if the economy gets worse, we\u2019ll bear additional loss, but we do forecast all of that so we know we can handle really, really adverse consequences. There will be a point -- and the last question brought it up was where you get below 10% CET1, even though we\u2019ll have almost $200 billion in capital and $1 trillion liquidity, all these other constraints start to kick in, like SLR and G-SIFI, advanced risk-weighted assets that may kind of constrain it. And so, -- and then obviously, then you\u2019ve got to look forward. So, we want to do our job. If we can help the country get through this, everybody\u2019s better off. If we lose a little bit more money in the meantime, so be it. But obviously, we\u2019re going to protect our company, our balance sheet,, our growth and we\u2019ll be having close conversations with regulators about what that is. I also think, you have to take in consideration the extraordinary measures the government has taken. That\u2019s the income to individuals, the PPP and all these Federal Reserve things.\nMike Mayo: So, also in your CEO letter, you talk about the economy coming back on, online. And I guess with your reserve build, you\u2019re assuming, what 10% unemployment, and then the economy improves in the second half of the year. So, what is your base case for how people come back to work that\u2019s behind those assumptions? And I know you have a lot of scenarios too but just a base case.\nJamie Dimon: Yes. I\u2019ll let Jen talk about the base case. But, I think the back to work, we shouldn\u2019t think of as a binary thing that after the CDC and we all get instructions from the government after there\u2019s enough capacity in the hospitals, after there is proper amount of testing. Remember, a lot of people are going to work today in farms, factories, food production, retail, pharmacies, hospitals. It isn\u2019t like no one\u2019s going to work and you can hope that you can turn it back on where it\u2019s very safe. There\u2019s plenty of capacity. You\u2019re not worried that you can\u2019t give every American who does get sick, the best possible medical advice. And the turn on will be regional by company, all following standards of best health practices. And in some ways you need to get that done because the bad economy has very adverse consequences, way beyond just the economy. In terms of mental health, domestic abuse, substance abuse, et cetera. So, a rational plan to get back to work is a good thing to do. And hopefully it\u2019ll be sooner rather than later, but it won\u2019t be May. We are talking about June, July, August, something like that. So, I don\u2019t know if that answers your whole question. And then, Jen, you give the base case.\nJennifer Piepszak: Sure. So, Mike, as we closed the books for the first quarter, just to give a context, we were looking at an economic outlook that had GDP down 25% in the second quarter and unemployment above 10%. It\u2019s just important to note that that kind of gives you a frame of how to think about it. But, there\u2019s a lot more that goes in to our reserving including management judgment of some like world class, risk management and finance people, and also other analytics. And so, that just kind of gives you a frame of reference. But there, we did think about a number of other scenarios that we should contemplate in reserving. And we also thought about the impacts, what\u2019s our best estimate of the impact of these extraordinary government programs as well as our own payment relief program. Since then, as I noted in my prepared remarks, our economists have updated their outlook and now have GDP down 40% in the second quarter and unemployment at 20%. That\u2019s obviously materially different. Both scenarios, though, do include a recovery in the back half of the year. And so, all else equal and of course, the one thing probably the only thing we know for sure, Mike is that all else won\u2019t be equal when we close the books for the second quarter. But all else equal, given the deteriorated macroeconomic outlook, we would expect to build reserves in the second quarter. But again, a lot will depend on the ultimate effect of these extraordinary programs and how effective they can be in bridging people back to employment. And we\u2019re going to still have a number of unknowns, I would say at the end of the second quarter, but we\u2019re going to learn a lot through these next few months that will inform our judgment for second quarter reserves.\nOperator: Our next question is from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: Hey. Good morning. And Jamie, nice to have you back. So, I wanted to ask a question on some of the remarks relating to capital. Carl [ph] has actually made some comments on Friday, alluding to efforts by the Fed to incorporate real life COVID stress in the upcoming CCAR cycle. We haven\u2019t gotten much color since then. I\u2019m wondering whether you received any guidance from the Fed on which changes if any they plan on contemplating for this year\u2019s test. And maybe just bigger picture, how are you thinking about the potential impact that could have on SCB and potentially raise some of your capital requirements?\nJennifer Piepszak: Sure. Thanks, Steven. So, we haven\u2019t gotten specific guidance, but it certainly makes sense that the Fed would want to look at a scenario like that. We have been, as you might imagine, staying very close to our regulators through this crisis. So, they can have a very good understanding of how we are managing things. And then, in terms of the potential impact, we\u2019ll learn more about that in June. We\u2019ve given our best estimates of SCB and the impact it will have on our minimums. And that is absolutely incorporated into our thinking about how we\u2019ll manage capital through a range of scenarios here, but we\u2019ll learn more from the Fed in June.\nJamie Dimon: I\u2019ve always tried [ph] the floor doing one stress test, which will not be the stress you go through. JPMorgan does 100 a week. And we\u2019re always looking at potential outcomes. And obviously we\u2019re doing our own COVID-related type of stress testing, including extreme, and we\u2019ll always be updating them, talking to regulars about it, because that\u2019s what we have to deal with this time, not what I would consider a traditional stress test.\nJennifer Piepszak: Yes. We look both at -- the range of outcomes probably has never been broader. And so, as Jamie said, we have -- CCAR has been a good place for us to start in terms of one scenario. But we have looked at a number of different scenarios at how this may play out. And obviously, Jamie articulated what we think could be an extreme adverse, and we\u2019re prepared for that too. So, I think, the most important thing is that we\u2019re prepared for a range of outcomes. And we\u2019ll learn more about SCB in June.\nSteven Chubak: Got it. And just a follow-up on the securities book. Just given some of the significant declines at the long end of the curve, Jen, I was hoping you could help us think about where reinvestment levels are today, just compared with the 2.48% yield on the blended securities book? And then just separately, given the larger impact of QE driven deposit growth, how you\u2019re deploying some of that excess liquidity in this environment?\nJennifer Piepszak: Sure. So, on the investment securities portfolio, managing the balance sheet in this rate environment is obviously a different dynamic. And with lower rates, as low as the deposit growth that [Technical Difficulty] with the Fed balance sheet expansion, you do see a large increase in our investment securities portfolio this quarter, which makes a lot of sense. Right now, in terms of balance sheet management, we are completely focused on supporting client activity. Our balance sheet is harder to predict right now, but we are prepared for a range of outcomes.\nSteven Chubak: Okay. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Saul Martinez of UBS.\nSaul Martinez: Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the CECL related question. Jen, you gave us a good amount of color on what the underlying economic assumptions that were used to build the reserves and in where Bruce Kasman and your economics team is now for the second quarter? But maybe thinking about it a little bit differently in terms of how to attribute them to CECL reserve build? I\u2019m not looking for specific numbers, more just directional. How do we think about it in terms of how much is attributed to sort of mechanistic model related changes, where you calibrate your model for new economic scenario versus actual signs of stress that you\u2019re seeing your book that maybe aren\u2019t showing up in credit measures, but that you do think will show up in a reasonably short time period, call it within the next few quarters, how much of its growth, how much of its mix, just if you can talk to that? And I guess, what I\u2019m trying to get at is, how much of it is more mechanistic, and how much of it is actual tangible signs that you\u2019re seeing that of financial stress in your borrower base that could emerge in a reasonably near future as credit losses?\nJennifer Piepszak: Sure. So, it\u2019s great question, Saul. So, I would start by saying that we haven\u2019t actually seen the stress emerge as of yet. So, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily use the term mechanistic. But I would say that what we took in the first quarter is our best estimate of future losses. It\u2019s also important to note that we don\u2019t reserve for future growth. And so, future growth with all else being equal the reserve build. So, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily think of this as materially different because of CECL. We didn\u2019t actually really think about the impact of CECL relative to the incurred model. I mean, the regulators have given their point of view on that, given the change in the capital rules where 25% is assumed to be the difference. But that\u2019s their view. And like I said, we did spend a lot of time thinking about it. And I would say that it is our best estimate of the losses that will inevitably emerge through this crisis. And it is life of loan, which of course is different under CECL. And so, again, all else equal, you can think hard was larger than it would have been under an incurred model. But we didn\u2019t really think about it that way. And it\u2019s impossible of course to know what judgment we would have applied under a different model.\nSaul Martinez: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And Jen, just on that point of growth, pivoting a little bit. What -- obviously, a lot of pressure in CET1 was because of risk-weighted asset growth and draw-downs on commitments. Where are we in terms -- where do you think we are in terms of those draw downs? I think, it\u2019s like $350 billion still in wholesale commitment -- unfunded commitments, but like, how do we think about that and how much room there is for that to continue to maybe pressure risk-weighted asset evolution?\nJennifer Piepszak: Yes. So, like so many other things, it is difficult to predict. I will say that early here in the second quarter, we have seen a pause on revolver draws. But, it could very well just be a pause. And so, we\u2019re assuming as we think about our own capital plans that we will see revolver draws continue in the second quarter, albeit at lower level than the first quarter. And then, of course the timing and the pace of the pay-downs will depend upon the ultimate path of the virus and the economic recovery.\nOperator: Our next question is from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI.\nGlenn Schorr: Thanks very much. I appreciate the limited sight we all have. Maybe we could, let\u2019s assume, hopefully sooner than later, we get past the bulk of the credit impact. On the other side of this, have you thought about lending spreads, underwriting criteria and how much terms need to tighten, given what we\u2019ve learned or on a scenario that we didn\u2019t capture under its previous underwriting? In other words, does lending spreads widen? And do you get paid enough for you balance sheet? I\u2019m just curious on how you\u2019re thinking about risk management on a go forward basis?\nJennifer Piepszak: Sure. So, there I would say that, our -- we always take a long-term franchise view on things like that. And so, our philosophy has not changed. It is true, however, that the marginal cost of new activity is higher for us right now. And so, that\u2019s a consideration. But, I would say, in terms of risk management, we do what we\u2019ve always done and what we always do, which is manage carefully within our risk appetite. And I think that has served us well coming into this crisis. And we\u2019ll continue to stay close to our clients and manage that carefully.\nJamie Dimon: I\u2019d just add, on the consumer side, the forward-looking view of risk, on the wholesale side, the revolvers are taken down, which is like $50 billion, our existing spreads. The bilateral stuff is being done by new credits. They\u2019re being done at slightly different spreads and stuff like that are higher. And then trading, obviously you\u2019re actually getting higher spreads and lot of things you do, and train your finance people and do things and stuff like that. And then you will see a tightening of credit in the market. Think of leverage lending, certain underwriting, sort of non-bank lenders who are no longer there. So, you will see an eventual tightening and eventual increase in spreads. What you won\u2019t see banks do is price gouge, which you see in other industries. Banks are very careful to support their clients in times like this.\nGlenn Schorr: Okay. And then one more impossible question, Jen, maybe. Could you help qualify? I know, you can\u2019t quantify, but exit rate revenues that you\u2019ve kind of alluded to in some of the things like underwriting falling off. So, a tale of two quarters, the quarter itself has learned for the ginormous credit issue that we\u2019re facing. It would have been like, revenues down a little bit, expense is up a drop, okay, but how much of the exit rate revenues are we looking at second quarter, third quarter versus the full first quarter? And that\u2019s a hard one.\nJennifer Piepszak: Glenn, I\u2019m glad you acknowledged that it\u2019s impossible question and a hard one. And so, there\u2019s a reason why we gave directional guidance here in terms of what could be headwind, but it is just impossible to predict right now, as you point out. So, but I will say, like -- if you think, there\u2019s obviously nothing that we can really say with confidence about exit rates in 2021. I will say, based upon the latest implies, if you look at NII, you could see growth in 2021 on balance sheet growth there. And then NIR is absolutely going to depend on the path of the virus and the economic recovery and when and how we all get back to work. And then, we\u2019ve given you expense guidance to think about. And then, from a credit perspective, as I said, we could see continued build over the next several quarters, but the way CECL works in theory, again, all else equal, is that that should be -- could be behind us by the end of the year, and we then have those reserves to absorb the losses that will inevitably emerge over the back half of this year and into 2021.\nOperator: Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Can you [Technical Difficulty] I know you gave us the color on the base case [Technical Difficulty] downturn in the second quarter. What\u2019s your outlook on that recovery in the second half of the year? Can you give us any color on what kind of recovery you\u2019re expecting in the second half of the year that\u2019s part of the CECL reserve building?\nJennifer Piepszak: Sure. So, it is -- I don\u2019t have the numbers to hand, Gerard, but they\u2019re public. It was -- I suppose you can say, it was based on our economists\u2019 outlook at the end of March, which did have a recovery. I just don\u2019t have the GDP numbers to hand, I think -- and the unemployment. I think what\u2019s most important to note, Gerard, is that what -- based upon what we\u2019re looking at, you do have a recovery in the back half of the year, but it is -- it still leaves you from a GDP perspective and unemployment, below your launch point on absolute levels of GDP and above your launch point on absolute levels of unemployment. So, it\u2019s a recovery, it is our latest outlook. And as I said earlier, it is probably the only thing we know for sure is that that is going to change through time. But it is a recovery in the back half of the year that doesn\u2019t get us back to where we started. And, importantly, as we said that we\u2019re prepared for a range of scenarios. So, while that may be the case that we based our reserve levels off, it is not being the only scenario that we\u2019re preparing for.\nGerard Cassidy: And then, just as a follow-up, on the bridge book, and I apologize if you addressed this and I missed it. I know you guys mentioned the losses in the bridge book. Could you share with us the size of the book, and then some more color on what triggered the losses in the bridge book?\nJennifer Piepszak: Sure. So there, I would just start by -- I said it in the prepared remarks, but it\u2019s worth repeating. Our bridge book is about a quarter of the size it was in the financial crisis. So, it\u2019s about $13 billion. It\u2019s slightly down from where we were at yea-end. Importantly, we don\u2019t have any imminent closing deadlines. And the market is actually performing a little bit better here in the second quarter. So, we\u2019ll see where we land at the end of the quarter. But so far\u2026\nGerard Cassidy: Just basically marking the positions to market\u2026 \nJennifer Piepszak: Yes. And the good news is we\u2019ve built in\u2026\nGerard Cassidy: Fees. [Ph]\nJennifer Piepszak: And with no imminent closing deadlines, it\u2019s not necessarily the case that we\u2019ll realize those losses. But as Jamie said, they\u2019re mark to market at the end of the quarter.\nJamie Dimon: And I would just also put this in perspective. We\u2019re adults. We know that we have a bridge loan book, because you\u2019re going to have quarters where things get bad and you might lose some money. We\u2019re the leader in leverage lending, we\u2019re the leader in high yield, the leader in loans, et cetera. And we intend to maintain that position. And every now and then you have not a particularly good quarter. So, we\u2019re not -- we don\u2019t worry about this very much. And like Jen said, so far if you look at spreads, it\u2019s probably a recovery this quarter.\nOperator: Our next question is from John McDonald of Autonomous Research.\nJohn McDonald: Hi, Jen. Regarding credit cards, just based on payment rates that you\u2019ve seen so far, and maybe the draws on revolves, how are you expecting card spending and card balances to trend over the next few quarters this year?\nJennifer Piepszak: Yes. Hi, John. So, based upon what we\u2019re looking at right now, spend was down. We talked about different categories, but spend in aggregate was down 13% in the month of March, year-over-year, and we\u2019re seeing trends like that continue here in April. And so, with that, I would say that we would, given what we know today, expect outstandings to trend down from here.\nJohn McDonald: And then, can you help us think about how you do the accounting for the consumer deferrals? You keep accruing. But, do you add some kind of haircut for NII in suppression in terms of what might not be collectible, even though technically you\u2019re allowed to accrue while you defer?\nJennifer Piepszak: Yes, you got it John. So, we do continue to accrue, but it is a lower yield over the life of the loan.\nOperator: Our next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. Good morning.\nJennifer Piepszak: Hi, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: I just want to -- I had add two questions. One, just thinking about the outlook for the next couple of quarters here. I know you mentioned that your economics team had updated their estimates. And maybe you could give us a sense as to the timing of when you clip your reserves versus those estimate changes? And part of the reason I\u2019m asking is because of the reserve ratio move between 4Q \u201819 and 1Q \u201820 for the various segments. When I look at the CIB and the commercial bank, the reserve ratios are down from where they were in 4Q \u201819. So, I\u2019m trying to understand how the next change in the reserving is likely to traject between the various asset classes? Is there -- as you move from an adverse case to a severely adverse case, are there different asset classes that potentially have a higher uptick in reserve ratio that we should be expecting here?\nJennifer Piepszak: Sure. So, on the wholesale side specifically, Betsy, the reason you see that dynamic is because of CECL. And it\u2019s in the presentation. So, you can see the numbers. So, we -- the CECL adoption impact in wholesale was a net release. And so, we\u2019ve now built that. And so, that\u2019s why you see that dynamic there. And then, in terms of the reserving, when we close the books, which was here in early April, we do have to of course kind of snap the chalk line at some point and close the books, which is why we want it to be very transparent about how we think about reserving going forward. Because like I said, all else equal, given the macroeconomic outlook that we\u2019re looking at that we would expect to have a bill in the second quarter and perhaps, beyond, because as I said, obviously everything is incredibly fluid. And we need to -- we really need to learn a lot about the ultimate impact of these programs because they are extraordinary and should have an extraordinary impact. But, we need some time to learn.\nJamie Dimon: And also just on the wholesale side, kind of at one point you have an overlay about what you expect in terms of migration downward and downgrades and stuff like that. It will also be name by name, company by company, name by name, reserve by reserve, so a real detailed review of that.\nBetsy Graseck: So, as we think through -- because effectively I think what we\u2019re saying is, there\u2019s the possibility of the severely adverse case coming, which we can look back at prior Fed stress tests to see what you anticipated that to mean for the credit losses. And maybe, Jamie, if you get an understanding as to how you\u2019re thinking about, what your economists are looking for versus prior severely adverse stress cases that you have run on your own bank. Is this fair to look at the severely adverse stress cases on a bank-run modeling basis that we have access to and it\u2019s in line with that kind of level or is this something that\u2019s even a little bit tougher, and specifically around like things like commercial real estate? I get the name by name on the corporate side, that that is obviously extraordinarily granular and you have access to that. But I\u2019m wondering on the commercial real estate side, is there anything we should be thinking about that\u2019s different from perhaps what a Fed stress test might have suggested in the past?\nJamie Dimon: I think commercial real estate, eventually it will be loan by loan and name by name too. So, you have reason to believe that a loan is bad, you\u2019re going to write it down and put a reserve against it or something like that. This is such a dramatic change of events. So, there are no models that have done -- dealt with GDP down 40%, unemployment growing this rapidly. And that\u2019s one part. There are also no models ever dealt with a government, which is doing a PPP program, which might be $350 billion and might be $550 billion. Unemployment, where -- it looks like 30% to 40% of people going [ph] on unemployment with higher income than before they went on unemployment. So, what does that mean for credit card or something like that or that the government is just going to make direct payments to people. So, this is all in the works right now. The Company is very good shape. We can serve our clients and we\u2019re going to give you more detail on this, but it\u2019s happening as we speak. And I think people are making too much of a mistake to model it. When we get to the end of the second quarter, we\u2019ll know exactly what happens in the second quarter. Like, you know -- you\u2019ve got to respect the credit card delinquencies and charges will go up that we\u2019ve seen very little bit so far. But, in the second quarter, you\u2019ll see more of it. And then, we\u2019ll also know if there\u2019s a fourth round of government stimulus, we\u2019ll know a whole bunch of stuff and we\u2019ll report that out. We hope for the best, which is, you have that recovery and plan for the worst, so you can handle it.\nJennifer Piepszak: And then, in terms of planning for the worst, Betsy, maybe it\u2019d be helpful. The extreme adverse scenario that Jamie referenced in his Chairman\u2019s letter had 2020 credit cost of more than $45 billion. So, clearly that is not our central case, but that\u2019s the kind of scenario that we are making sure that we\u2019re prepared for. And then, just coincidentally, if you look at our credit costs from the fourth quarter of \u201808 to the fourth quarter of \u201809 across those five quarters, we had credit cost of $47 billion.\nJamie Dimon: I\u2019ve got the number where reserves went from like $7 billion to $35 billion back to $14 billion. Reserve in itself is counter -- pro-cyclical and often wrong. And you\u2019re required to do it, but it certainly doesn\u2019t match revenues and expenses. And so, we\u2019d like to be conservative in reserving, but I have to point out the flaws of it.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW.\nBrian Kleinhanzl: Just a couple of questions, again one on CECL maybe to start with. Can you just maybe give a little bit more qualitative disclosure on how this payment relief factors in? I mean, are you assuming some amount of government programs get used and that\u2019s included or that\u2019s just payment relief that you\u2019re directly giving to consumers and corporate? Just trying to get a sense of how all these government programs going to flow through the model.\nJennifer Piepszak: Sure, Brian. So, you can think about the government stimulus as being incorporated in the macroeconomic variables; and then, the payment relief. Those are -- I\u2019m referring to our own programs there. And there, based upon our judgment and experience from the past, we applied some percentage of pull-through in the portfolio of people who will get payment relief, and then we think about the impact that that could have. Again, I would say, both, while estimated for the first quarter, we\u2019ll know a whole lot more about both of them for the second quarter.\nJamie Dimon: And Jen remind me, when we do the 10-Q for the quarter, we\u2019re going to lay out lots of these various assumptions about CECL. And one of the problems with CECL is this precisely. We\u2019re going to spend all day on CECL, which was $4 billion and it\u2019s kind of a drop in the bucket, but it\u2019s a lot of data. It\u2019s like all the data we did after the last crisis we give you on level three, and all these assumptions and stuff like that. No one ever looks it anymore.\nJennifer Piepszak: That\u2019s right.\nJamie Dimon: And every company does it differently. \nJennifer Piepszak: Yes. And we still have obviously several weeks and so -- before the Q. And so, we\u2019ll be able to give our best view on things then.\nBrian Kleinhanzl: And then, in the quarter -- I mean, you gave what the marks were on the bridge loan. But, is there a way to frame what the total marks were, I mean assuming credit spreads tighten kind of dramatically post quarter end? So, it seems like, it would be a reversal of some of those marks initially?\nJennifer Piepszak: Yes, there could be. But, that\u2019s only where we are at this point in the quarter. And so, it\u2019ll obviously all depend on the market from now until the end of the quarter. But right now, the market is performing a bit better and spreads have come in, as you mentioned.\nJamie Dimon: A couple of deals may be syndicated, but hopefully, might be syndicated at the end of the second or third quarter.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer.\nChris Kotowski: [Technical Difficulty] earnings are -- pre-provision earnings minus net charge-offs [Technical Difficulty].\nJamie Dimon: I don\u2019t know about you guys. I can\u2019t -- we can\u2019t understand a word you are saying.\nJennifer Piepszak: Yes. Chris, this is unfortunately part of our -- all of our new reality is we all work remotely. We couldn\u2019t hear you.\nChris Kotowski: Sorry. Is this better?\nJennifer Piepszak: Yes.\nChris Kotowski: Okay. So, my apologies. At Investor Day, Jamie said something like that the real economic earnings are pre provision earnings minus net charge-offs, which I agree with. And so, if you push aside all the CECL reserving noise, I\u2019m curious, does the customer relief, the 90-day grace period, does that change the -- alter the historic charge-off assumptions? Like for example, I mean, credit card was always pretty cookie cutter, 180 days after delinquency is charged off and maybe with auto, or will those customer relief periods push back the charge-off curve as well?\nJennifer Piepszak: It may, because as long as the customer is performing under the forbearance program, they are not delinquent. But of course, it will all depend on whether these programs ultimately are able to bridge people back to employment.\nChris Kotowski: Okay. So\u2026\nJamie Dimon: We\u2019ll clearly know a lot more in 90 days about how this effect is, what we would have expected?\nJennifer Piepszak: And to Jamie\u2019s point, what we may learn over the next 90 days is, of course whether programs have been effective or whether they just delayed losses. And, of course with CECL being life of loan, if it is just delayed losses, you can expect that that would -- we would be reserving for that.\nChris Kotowski: Okay. But, in terms of charge-offs [Technical Difficulty]. Am I getting that right?\nJennifer Piepszak: It may be. It may be. But again, it\u2019s going to just completely depend on whether people are able to remain performing under a payment relief or forbearance program. But, we don\u2019t really think about it that way. We think about what the ultimate losses will be and we reserve for that. And then importantly, in the first quarter, the charge-offs we\u2019re seeing, which is why I was clear to say it was consistent with prior expectations. Because the charge-offs in the first quarter of course don\u2019t at all reflect the ultimate impact of COVID-19. They were just normal BAU, I would say.\nOperator: Our next question is from Andrew Lim, SocGen.\nAndrew Lim: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So, firstly, on government guarantee loans. These are 0% risk-weighted. And I\u2019m wondering, to what extent you\u2019re using them to refinance existing loans on your portfolios. And if you are, to what extent risk-weighted assets have gone through, if you do this?\nJennifer Piepszak: Yes. And that\u2019s just specifically what program you\u2019re referring to. I would just say, broadly speaking, on the Fed facilities, there are obviously very large programs rolled out very quickly and just an extraordinary response to unprecedented market conditions. Here, we are happy to leverage facilities to intermediate these programs for our clients. But, we are only using them where it makes sense to ensure the credit and liquidity is flowing to where it\u2019s needed.\nAndrew Lim: So, I mean, just to maybe elaborate on that. Is there maybe some part where there\u2019s a bit of a capital uplift, if you use government guaranteed loans to represent risk-weighting where previously you\u2019ve...\nJamie Dimon: What uplift?\nAndrew Lim: A capital uplift, so, your risk-weighted assets go down, say for something like [Technical Difficulty] government guaranteed\u2026\nJamie Dimon: We\u2019ll incorporate all of that into how we run the company trying to serve client et cetera, et cetera. And there few things, like the PPP that you put on your balance sheet is zero RWA but it does affect a lot of other things, like SLR and G-SIFI and stuff like that. Because if you sell it to the government, those -- it all goes away. And we will manage through that as we learn how these programs are working and what want to do.\nOperator: And we have no further questions at this time.\nJennifer Piepszak: Thanks, everyone.\nJamie Dimon: Thank you for spending time with us.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jennifer Piepszak",
            "content": "Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. As you heard, Jamie is with me on the call. And I know I speak for the entire Company when I say, we're just thrilled that he is back. Before we get into the first quarter performance, we want to start by recognizing that this is an extremely challenging time for all of us and our thoughts are with those most affected by COVID-19, particularly those on the front lines of this crisis. The presentation this quarter is slightly longer to address a few key topics as we navigate this environment. And as always, it's available on our website and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back.  Starting on page 1, I'd like to highlight some of the ways we're responding to COVID-19. As a firm, we are focused on being there for our employees, customers, clients, and communities in what is an unprecedented and uncertain environment. And while we don't know how this will play out, we will be transparent here about our assumptions and what we know today. Our number one priority is to continue to provide our services in an uninterrupted way, while also providing a safe work environment for our employees. We're incredibly proud of all that our firm has been able to do over the past few weeks. So, I'll just hit on a few examples here. We've mobilized our workforce around the globe to work remotely where feasible, including operations and finance teams, portfolio and risk managers, bankers and traders, ensuring they have the right tools to work effectively. Currently, we have about 70% working from home across the Company and for many groups that number is well north of 90%. And for those who still need to go into the office or into a branch, we are taking extra precautions and being extremely mindful of their safety. And we're providing assistance in other ways too. For instance, we're offering free COVID-related medical treatment to U.S. employees and their dependents. On the consumer side, approximately three quarters of our 5,000 branches have been open all with heightened safety procedures and many with drive-thru options. And the vast majority of our over 16,000 ATMs remain accessible. And while our call center capacity has been challenged, we quickly activated resiliency plans to address customer calls seeking assistance, and we've put in place new digital and self service solutions in record time. And while wait times have been extended, we're making good progress reducing them. For our customers who are struggling financially during this time, we're providing relief such as a 90-day grace period for mortgage, auto and card payments as well as waiving or refunding certain fees. We continue to support our customers and clients by providing liquidity and advice during this challenging market environment. And in the month of March, we extended more than $100 billion of new credit. In wholesale, clients drew more than $50 billion on their revolvers with us. And we approved over $25 billion of new credit extensions for clients most impacted. And for our small business clients, we're actively supporting the SBA's Paycheck Protection Program. The numbers you see on the slide are as of April 12th; and as of this morning, we have more than 300,000 in some stage of the application process, representing $37 billion in loans. And we funded $9.3 billion to businesses with over 700,000 employees. And to help the most vulnerable and hardest hit communities as an initial step, we've announced $150 million loan program to give capital to underserved small businesses and nonprofits as well as a $50 million philanthropic investment. Now, turning to page 2 for highlights on our first quarter financial performance. For the quarter, the firm reported net income of $2.9 billion, EPS of $0.78 and revenue of $29.1 billion with the return on tangible common equity of 5%. While the underlying business fundamentals this quarter performed very well, we reported a number of significant items all due to impacts from COVID-19, which I'll discuss in more detail later. But at a high level, these items are, a credit reserve build $6.8 billion; approximately $950 million of losses in CIB, largely due to the widening of funding spreads on derivatives; and a $900 million markdown on our bridge book. It might be an obvious point, but the quarter was really a tale of two cities, January and February, and then March when the crisis started to unfold. And with that, I thought it would be helpful to talk through some key metrics that highlight this dynamic across our businesses. So, let's go to page 3. Starting with card sales volume on the top left. In March, we saw a rapid decline in spend initially in travel and entertainment, which then spread to restaurants and retail as social distancing protocols were implemented more broadly. While most spend categories were ultimately impacted, we did see an initial boost to supermarkets, wholesale clubs, and discount stores as people stocked up on provisions. But even that is now starting to normalize. And we saw similar trends in merchant services as highlighted in a significant decline in brick & mortar spend, excluding supermarkets, whereas e-commerce spend has held up well by comparison. In investment banking, in the middle of the page, there was a surge in debt issuance by investment grade clients as the market remained open, and clients' desire to shore up liquidity was top of mind. It was the largest quarter ever in terms of investment grade debt issuance, led by JPMorgan. And in markets, volatility drove elevated trading volumes across products, most notably across rates and commodities, which at their peak were more than triple our average January trading volumes. And on the far right, deposit growth accelerated meaningfully in March, most notably driven by wholesale clients as they secured liquidity and held those higher cash balances with us. At the same time, we saw accelerating loan growth, primarily driven by revolver draws. And finally, flows in AWM were meaningfully different in March compared to January and February. Long-term flows through February were strong, positive across all asset classes, but this was more than offset by outflows in March. On the flip side, we saw significant net liquidity inflows into our government funds during March, which more than offset prime money market outflows. Onto page four and some more detail about our first quarter results. Revenue of $29.1 billion was down $782 million or 3% year-on-year, as net interest income was flat to the prior year due to the impact of lower rates, offset by balance sheet growth and mix and higher CIB markets NII. And noninterest revenue was down 5% driven by the significant items I already mentioned, which were largely offset by higher CIB markets revenue. Expenses of $16.9 billion were up 3%, driven by higher volume and revenue related expenses, continued investments and higher legal expense, all of which were largely offset by structural expense efficiencies. This quarter, credit costs were $8.3 billion including a net reserve build of $6.8 billion, reflecting the impact of COVID-19 and net charge-offs of $1.5 billion, in line with prior expectations. Now, turning to page 5, we'll have some more detail on the reserve builds. Our net reserve build of $6.8 billion for the quarter consists of $4.4 billion in consumer, predominantly in card, and $2.4 billion and wholesale with builds primarily due to impact of COVID-19 as well as lower oil prices. This reserve increase assumes in the second quarter that U.S. GDP is down approximately 25% and the unemployment rate rises above 10%, followed by solid recovery over the second half of the year. In addition to these macro assumptions specific to each business, our consumer reserve build reflects our best estimate of the impact of payment relief that we are providing for our customers as well as the federal government stimulus programs. And in wholesale, the majority of the build is in sectors most directly impacted by COVID-19, such as in consumer and retail, and also in oil and gas. We expect other sectors to be impacted to a lesser extent if we avoid a prolonged downturn. We have also assumed that the stress in oil and gas continues with WTI remaining below $40 through the end of 2021. After we closed the books for the quarter, our economists updated their outlook, which now reflect a more significant deterioration in U.S. GDP and unemployment. If that scenario were to hold, we would be building in the second quarter and builds could be meaningfully higher in aggregate over the next several quarters relative to what we took in the first quarter. A primary unknown is the duration of the crisis, which will directly impact losses across our portfolio. But that being said, our consumer portfolio skews more prime than the industry average and the effectiveness of government support, customer relief and enhanced unemployment benefits while uncertain, undoubtedly will act as mitigants to the losses. And even though our losses will be material, we will be doing what we can to help our customers recover from this crisis, and help our clients stay in business. Now, moving to balance sheet and capital on page six. Our balance sheet capital and liquidity going into this crisis were incredibly strong, and importantly allowed us to facilitate client needs in a period of stress. And that combined with our earnings power is an extraordinary base to absorb the inevitable losses to come. For the quarter, we distributed $8.8 billion of capital to shareholders, which includes $6 billion in net share repurchases up to March 15th. Since then, we stopped our buybacks, which was both a prudent decision at the time and consistent with what we always say, which is that we would prefer to use our capital to serve our customers and clients. This capital distribution outweighed our earnings for the quarter. And this coupled with significant RWA growth resulted in a decline in our CET1 ratio to 11.5%. On RWA, which you can see on the bottom right of the page, the key drivers of growth were market volatility which should subside over time, and more importantly, an increase in lending at this critical time for our clients. Going forward, in order to leverage our balance sheet to serve our clients, we are prepared to use our internal buffers, which may mean our CET1 ratio falls below our target range and if necessary, we can also use regulatory buffers to go below our 10.5% minimum. It's worth noting here that in an environment like this it's precisely why we have the buffers in the first place. We currently also have capacity and intend to continue to pay the $0.90 dividend pending Board approval. And as you can see in the CET1 walk on the bottom left, it is a small claim on our capital base. And before we move on, just a moment on liquidity. Even with everything we facilitated, our liquidity position remains strong. And looking forward, it's helpful to remember that we have significant liquidity resources beyond HQLA, including the discount window, if need be. And now, turning to businesses starting with consumer and community banking on page 7. CCB reported net income of $191 million, including reserve builds of $4.5 billion. January and February showed a continuation of strength across the business but again, March showed a major shift in trends. And across our consumer segment, we saw a drastic deceleration in spend across all forms of payments, and a decline in origination volumes except in the mortgage refi market. And on the small business side, we saw significantly reduced inflows and merchant processing activities, early signs of pressure on payment and frequency rates as well as line utilization and increased demand for credit. Turning back to the results. Revenue of $13.2 billion was down 2% year-on-year. In consumer and business banking, revenue was down 9%, driven by deposit margin compression, partially offset by strong deposit growth of 8% that accelerated in the quarter. Deposit margin was down 56 basis points year-on-year and we expect it to decline further given the current rate environment. Home lending revenue was down 14%, driven by lower net servicing revenue and lower NII, partially offset by higher net production revenue. And in card and auto, revenue was up 8%, driven by higher card NII on loan growth and margin expansion. Average card loan growth was 8% with sales up 4% over the quarter, driven by January and February activity. Expenses of $7.2 billion were up 3%, driven by revenue related costs from higher volumes as well as continued investments in the business, partially offset by structural expense efficiencies. And lastly on this slide, credit costs included the $4.5 billion reserve builds I mentioned earlier and net charge-offs of $1.3 billion, driven by card and consistent with prior expectations. Now turning to the corporate and investment bank on page 8. CIB reported net income of $2 billion and an ROE of 9% on revenue of $9.9 billion. Investment banking in the first half of the quarter showed continued momentum from last year, but as the market environment shifted, we saw delays in M&A announcements and completions, postponements of new equity issuance and increased draws on existing lines of credit. At the same time, the investment grade debt market remained open and we helped our investment grade clients raise approximately $380 billion of debt in the quarter across a wide range of sectors. By contrast, the high yield market was effectively closed and high yield spreads widened significantly. As a result, our bridge book commitments were marked down by $820 million. And here, it's worth noting, our bridge book exposure is about a quarter of what it was, entering the 2008 crisis and is a higher quality portfolio. As a result of this backdrop, IB revenue of $886 million was down 49% year-on-year, largely driven by the bridge book markdown. IB fees were up 3% year-on-year and we maintained our number one rank with 9.1% wallet share. Advisory was down 22%, not only due to a tough compare but also reflecting delays in regulatory approvals, pushing out the closing of certain large deals. We did however complete more deals than any other banks this quarter. Equity underwriting was up 25% versus a challenged first quarter last year and we saw strong activity in January and February before the market effectively closed in March. And debt underwriting was up 15% and an all-time record. We maintained our number one rank with 9.5% share, up 90 basis points from 2019. Lending revenue was up 36% year-on-year, driven by the impact of spread widening on loan hedges. Looking forward, while a rapid recovery in the economy could produce the corresponding rebound in activity, we could also see significant downside risk to our forward-looking pipeline if the downturn is protracted. Now, moving to markets. Here, total revenue was $7.2 billion, up 32% year-on-year. It's worth noting that even before the crisis, as we said at Investor Day, markets performance was strong for the quarter. Then, the growing COVID-19 concerns triggered a major correction in equity markets, significant widening of spreads and a spike in volatility, leading to extraordinary government intervention and a substantial change in monetary policy followed by a sharp decline in treasury yields. Simultaneously, we also saw a drop in oil prices. This unique combination of events led to further increased client participation and record trading volumes in several products. Fixed income was up 34%, driven by strong client activity, most notably in rates and currencies and emerging markets. Equity markets was up 28% on strength in equity derivatives, driven by increased client activity. In terms of outlook, it goes without saying that it's too early to project this performance going forward. In fact, low rates and low economic activity may even be a headwind. However, we are in a strong position to continue playing essential role in ensuring the orderly functioning of markets and serving our clients' needs. And now, on to wholesale payments, the new business unit we're recording this quarter, comprised of treasury services, trade finance, and the merchant services business, which was previously part of CCB. Wholesale payments revenue of $1.4 billion was down 4% year-on-year driven by reporting re-classification in merchant services. As clients focused on preserving liquidity, we experienced higher deposit levels in wholesale payments throughout the quarter, offsetting revenue headwinds from lower rates and payments activity. In security services, revenue was $1.1 billion, up 6% year-on-year. Market volatility drove increased transaction volumes and deposit balances, which offset the impact of the market correction on asset balances. In wholesale payments and security services, tailwinds from this quarter, like elevated deposit balances, may be relatively short lived and more than offset by the impact of low rates and potentially lower transaction volumes if the crisis is elongated. Credit adjustments and other was a loss of $951 million, which was one of the significant items that I mentioned upfront. Credit costs were $1.4 billion, driven by the net reserve builds I referred to earlier. And finally, expenses of $5.9 billion were up 5%, driven by higher legal and volume-related expenses and continued investments. Now, moving onto commercial banking on page 9. Commercial banking reported net income of $147 million including reserve builds of approximately $900 million. Revenue of $2.2 billion was down 10% year-on-year with lower deposit NII on lower rates and the $76 million markdown on the bridge book, partially offset by higher deposit balances. Gross investment banking revenues were $686 million, down 16% year-on-year compared to a record prior year. While we remain confident in our long-term target, we expect some softness in our pipeline, specifically related to M&A and equity underwriting. Expenses of $988 million were up 5% year-on-year, consistent with the ongoing investments we discussed at Investor Day. Deposits were up 39% year-on-year on a spot basis and increased about $40 billion during the month of March with about half of that coming from clients drawing on their credit lines and holding their cash with us as they look to secure liquidity. End of period loans were up 14% year-on-year, mainly driven by increases in C&I loans in March. C&I loans were up 26% as revolver utilization increased to 44%, which is an all-time high. CRE loans were up 3%. And here, the story remains largely unchanged. Higher originations and commercial term lending driven by the low rate environment were partially offset by declines in real estate lending as we remain selective. Credit costs of $1 billion included the reserve builds I mentioned and $100 million of net charge-offs, largely driven by oil and gas. Now on to asset and wealth management on page 10. Asset and wealth management reported net income of $664 million with pretax margin of 24% and ROE of 25%. Revenue of $3.6 billion was up 3% year-on-year, driven by higher management fees on higher average market levels and net inflows over the past year. And then, in addition, we saw a record brokerage activity in March related to the recent market volatility. These increases were largely offset by lower investment valuations. Expenses of $2.7 billion were flat year-on-year with higher investments in the business as well as increased volume and revenue related expenses offset by lower structural expenses. Credit costs were $94 million, driven by reserve builds and the impact of COVID-19 as well as loan growth. Net long-term outflows were $2 billion as the strength we saw in January and February was more than offset in March. At the same time, we saw $75 billion of net liquidity inflows driven by significant inflows into our industry leading government funds in March, as I mentioned earlier. AUM of $2.2 trillion and overall client assets of $3 trillion, up 7% and 4% respectively were driven by cumulative net inflows, partially offset by lower market levels. Deposits were up 9% year-on-year on growth and interest bearing products. And finally, loan balances were up 11% with strength in both wholesale and mortgage lending. Now on to corporate page 11. Corporate reported a net loss of $125 million. Revenue was $166 million, a decline of $259 million year-on-year, primarily due to lower net interest income on lower rates, partially offset by higher net gains on investment securities. Expenses of $146 million were down $65 million year-on-year. And now, let's turn to page 12 for the outlook. At Investor Day, we showed you a path to 2020 where we expected net interest income to be slightly down from 2019. And obviously, since then, the backdrop has changed significantly. Based on the latest advice and what we know today, we expect to see further pressure from rates, partially offset by balance sheet growth in CIB markets and NII, which results in NII of about $55.5 billion for the full year. And to give you an idea for the second quarter, we expect NII to be $13.7 billion. On noninterest revenue, it's always difficult to provide meaningful guidance and even more so given the current heightened level of uncertainty. But based on our best estimates today, we do expect to see headwinds in 2020 compared to 2019. In addition to the two significant items in the first quarter, these headwinds include a $3.5 billion decrease in noninterest revenue, all else equal, which is also due to the impact of rates and is the offset to higher CIB markets NII and therefore revenue neutral. We also expect to see pressure on AWM and investment banking fees. And we now expect adjusted expenses for 2020 to be approximately $65 billion, largely due to lower volume and revenue-related expenses versus the outlook we provided at Investor Day. It goes without saying all of this is market dependent and we'll keep you updated at future earnings calls. So, to wrap up, the challenges we are all facing as the COVID-19 crisis continues to unfold around the globe are unprecedented. Although we don't quite know what the path will look like going forward, what we do know is that we will continue to be there for our employees, clients, customers and communities, as we always have been. And we have the talent, resources and operational resiliency to do so. Our employees have proven that being resilient is not just about maintaining operations, it's also about culture. And that feels stronger than ever with our teams work around the world working harder than ever to continue to serve our clients, customers and communities. We've never been more proud of our people and we simply can't thank them enough. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. Sure. So, first of all, I'll start with that payment relief and forbearance there. I'll start by saying that we have already refunded millions of dollars in fees. We've approved payment relief for hundreds of thousands of accounts across consumer lending. And we obviously expect that to be meaningfully higher through time. We've paused foreclosures and auto repossessions. And importantly, we've made the process easier for our customers through digital and self service options that we've built in record time. But, in terms of what we're seeing, those are the numbers, they're still, as I said, relatively small compared to what we think we'll ultimately see. In mortgage, just to give you context outside of customers asking for forbearance, which is just a little over 4% of our service book at this time, the April 1st payments seems BAU. In card, we're seeing payment rates down a bit, but still strong. And we've seen a slight uptick in late payments in auto. But the quality of these portfolios looks strong coming in as we've done surgical risk management over the last few years. And that has made these portfolios more resilient. And then, in terms of how we think about significant government intervention, I mean, I think the ultimate effectiveness of these programs, which are extraordinary in terms of the direct payments or the enhanced unemployment insurance, the ultimate effectiveness is I think, the biggest unknown. The key obviously is being able to bridge people back to employment. And so, we have assumed, as we could, for our first quarter results, the impact of those programs as well as the ultimate impact on payment relief that we'll be providing for our customers. But that is for sure an unknown, and we certainly expect to learn a lot more about that in the second quarter. Sure. So, as you probably know, Erika, that the Fed made some changes there recently, which, as you say, puts us in a 60% bucket as we go below 10.5%. And we have a reasonable amount of room below 10.5% to remain in the 60% bucket. I would say that that was very helpful clarification from the regulators in terms of how we should think about using regulatory buffers. So, that was particularly helpful. And right now, we are focused on serving our clients and customers. And we've looked at a range of scenarios, so we can ensure that we're managing our capital quite carefully. Jamie talked about an extreme adverse scenario in his Chairman's letter that we've looked at assuming large parts of the economy remaining in lockdown through the end of this year. And in that scenario, our CET1 drops to about 9.5%. And so, we think we have significant room to continue to serve our customers and clients through this crisis, but we are managing it quite carefully and looking at a range of scenarios. So, we make sure that we're prepared. Sure. So, Mike, as we closed the books for the first quarter, just to give a context, we were looking at an economic outlook that had GDP down 25% in the second quarter and unemployment above 10%. It's just important to note that that kind of gives you a frame of how to think about it. But, there's a lot more that goes in to our reserving including management judgment of some like world class, risk management and finance people, and also other analytics. And so, that just kind of gives you a frame of reference. But there, we did think about a number of other scenarios that we should contemplate in reserving. And we also thought about the impacts, what's our best estimate of the impact of these extraordinary government programs as well as our own payment relief program. Since then, as I noted in my prepared remarks, our economists have updated their outlook and now have GDP down 40% in the second quarter and unemployment at 20%. That's obviously materially different. Both scenarios, though, do include a recovery in the back half of the year. And so, all else equal and of course, the one thing probably the only thing we know for sure, Mike is that all else won't be equal when we close the books for the second quarter. But all else equal, given the deteriorated macroeconomic outlook, we would expect to build reserves in the second quarter. But again, a lot will depend on the ultimate effect of these extraordinary programs and how effective they can be in bridging people back to employment. And we're going to still have a number of unknowns, I would say at the end of the second quarter, but we're going to learn a lot through these next few months that will inform our judgment for second quarter reserves. Sure. Thanks, Steven. So, we haven't gotten specific guidance, but it certainly makes sense that the Fed would want to look at a scenario like that. We have been, as you might imagine, staying very close to our regulators through this crisis. So, they can have a very good understanding of how we are managing things. And then, in terms of the potential impact, we'll learn more about that in June. We've given our best estimates of SCB and the impact it will have on our minimums. And that is absolutely incorporated into our thinking about how we'll manage capital through a range of scenarios here, but we'll learn more from the Fed in June. Yes. We look both at -- the range of outcomes probably has never been broader. And so, as Jamie said, we have -- CCAR has been a good place for us to start in terms of one scenario. But we have looked at a number of different scenarios at how this may play out. And obviously, Jamie articulated what we think could be an extreme adverse, and we're prepared for that too. So, I think, the most important thing is that we're prepared for a range of outcomes. And we'll learn more about SCB in June. Sure. So, on the investment securities portfolio, managing the balance sheet in this rate environment is obviously a different dynamic. And with lower rates, as low as the deposit growth that [Technical Difficulty] with the Fed balance sheet expansion, you do see a large increase in our investment securities portfolio this quarter, which makes a lot of sense. Right now, in terms of balance sheet management, we are completely focused on supporting client activity. Our balance sheet is harder to predict right now, but we are prepared for a range of outcomes. Sure. So, it's great question, Saul. So, I would start by saying that we haven't actually seen the stress emerge as of yet. So, I wouldn't necessarily use the term mechanistic. But I would say that what we took in the first quarter is our best estimate of future losses. It's also important to note that we don't reserve for future growth. And so, future growth with all else being equal the reserve build. So, I wouldn't necessarily think of this as materially different because of CECL. We didn't actually really think about the impact of CECL relative to the incurred model. I mean, the regulators have given their point of view on that, given the change in the capital rules where 25% is assumed to be the difference. But that's their view. And like I said, we did spend a lot of time thinking about it. And I would say that it is our best estimate of the losses that will inevitably emerge through this crisis. And it is life of loan, which of course is different under CECL. And so, again, all else equal, you can think hard was larger than it would have been under an incurred model. But we didn't really think about it that way. And it's impossible of course to know what judgment we would have applied under a different model. Yes. So, like so many other things, it is difficult to predict. I will say that early here in the second quarter, we have seen a pause on revolver draws. But, it could very well just be a pause. And so, we're assuming as we think about our own capital plans that we will see revolver draws continue in the second quarter, albeit at lower level than the first quarter. And then, of course the timing and the pace of the pay-downs will depend upon the ultimate path of the virus and the economic recovery. Sure. So, there I would say that, our -- we always take a long-term franchise view on things like that. And so, our philosophy has not changed. It is true, however, that the marginal cost of new activity is higher for us right now. And so, that's a consideration. But, I would say, in terms of risk management, we do what we've always done and what we always do, which is manage carefully within our risk appetite. And I think that has served us well coming into this crisis. And we'll continue to stay close to our clients and manage that carefully. Glenn, I'm glad you acknowledged that it's impossible question and a hard one. And so, there's a reason why we gave directional guidance here in terms of what could be headwind, but it is just impossible to predict right now, as you point out. So, but I will say, like -- if you think, there's obviously nothing that we can really say with confidence about exit rates in 2021. I will say, based upon the latest implies, if you look at NII, you could see growth in 2021 on balance sheet growth there. And then NIR is absolutely going to depend on the path of the virus and the economic recovery and when and how we all get back to work. And then, we've given you expense guidance to think about. And then, from a credit perspective, as I said, we could see continued build over the next several quarters, but the way CECL works in theory, again, all else equal, is that that should be -- could be behind us by the end of the year, and we then have those reserves to absorb the losses that will inevitably emerge over the back half of this year and into 2021. Sure. So, it is -- I don't have the numbers to hand, Gerard, but they're public. It was -- I suppose you can say, it was based on our economists' outlook at the end of March, which did have a recovery. I just don't have the GDP numbers to hand, I think -- and the unemployment. I think what's most important to note, Gerard, is that what -- based upon what we're looking at, you do have a recovery in the back half of the year, but it is -- it still leaves you from a GDP perspective and unemployment, below your launch point on absolute levels of GDP and above your launch point on absolute levels of unemployment. So, it's a recovery, it is our latest outlook. And as I said earlier, it is probably the only thing we know for sure is that that is going to change through time. But it is a recovery in the back half of the year that doesn't get us back to where we started. And, importantly, as we said that we're prepared for a range of scenarios. So, while that may be the case that we based our reserve levels off, it is not being the only scenario that we're preparing for. Sure. So there, I would just start by -- I said it in the prepared remarks, but it's worth repeating. Our bridge book is about a quarter of the size it was in the financial crisis. So, it's about $13 billion. It's slightly down from where we were at yea-end. Importantly, we don't have any imminent closing deadlines. And the market is actually performing a little bit better here in the second quarter. So, we'll see where we land at the end of the quarter. But so far... Yes. And the good news is we've built in... And with no imminent closing deadlines, it's not necessarily the case that we'll realize those losses. But as Jamie said, they're mark to market at the end of the quarter. Yes. Hi, John. So, based upon what we're looking at right now, spend was down. We talked about different categories, but spend in aggregate was down 13% in the month of March, year-over-year, and we're seeing trends like that continue here in April. And so, with that, I would say that we would, given what we know today, expect outstandings to trend down from here. Yes, you got it John. So, we do continue to accrue, but it is a lower yield over the life of the loan. Hi, Betsy. Sure. So, on the wholesale side specifically, Betsy, the reason you see that dynamic is because of CECL. And it's in the presentation. So, you can see the numbers. So, we -- the CECL adoption impact in wholesale was a net release. And so, we've now built that. And so, that's why you see that dynamic there. And then, in terms of the reserving, when we close the books, which was here in early April, we do have to of course kind of snap the chalk line at some point and close the books, which is why we want it to be very transparent about how we think about reserving going forward. Because like I said, all else equal, given the macroeconomic outlook that we're looking at that we would expect to have a bill in the second quarter and perhaps, beyond, because as I said, obviously everything is incredibly fluid. And we need to -- we really need to learn a lot about the ultimate impact of these programs because they are extraordinary and should have an extraordinary impact. But, we need some time to learn. And then, in terms of planning for the worst, Betsy, maybe it'd be helpful. The extreme adverse scenario that Jamie referenced in his Chairman's letter had 2020 credit cost of more than $45 billion. So, clearly that is not our central case, but that's the kind of scenario that we are making sure that we're prepared for. And then, just coincidentally, if you look at our credit costs from the fourth quarter of \u201808 to the fourth quarter of \u201809 across those five quarters, we had credit cost of $47 billion. Sure, Brian. So, you can think about the government stimulus as being incorporated in the macroeconomic variables; and then, the payment relief. Those are -- I'm referring to our own programs there. And there, based upon our judgment and experience from the past, we applied some percentage of pull-through in the portfolio of people who will get payment relief, and then we think about the impact that that could have. Again, I would say, both, while estimated for the first quarter, we'll know a whole lot more about both of them for the second quarter. That's right. Yes. And we still have obviously several weeks and so -- before the Q. And so, we'll be able to give our best view on things then. Yes, there could be. But, that's only where we are at this point in the quarter. And so, it'll obviously all depend on the market from now until the end of the quarter. But right now, the market is performing a bit better and spreads have come in, as you mentioned. Yes. Chris, this is unfortunately part of our -- all of our new reality is we all work remotely. We couldn't hear you. Yes. It may, because as long as the customer is performing under the forbearance program, they are not delinquent. But of course, it will all depend on whether these programs ultimately are able to bridge people back to employment. And to Jamie's point, what we may learn over the next 90 days is, of course whether programs have been effective or whether they just delayed losses. And, of course with CECL being life of loan, if it is just delayed losses, you can expect that that would -- we would be reserving for that. It may be. It may be. But again, it's going to just completely depend on whether people are able to remain performing under a payment relief or forbearance program. But, we don't really think about it that way. We think about what the ultimate losses will be and we reserve for that. And then importantly, in the first quarter, the charge-offs we're seeing, which is why I was clear to say it was consistent with prior expectations. Because the charge-offs in the first quarter of course don't at all reflect the ultimate impact of COVID-19. They were just normal BAU, I would say. Yes. And that's just specifically what program you're referring to. I would just say, broadly speaking, on the Fed facilities, there are obviously very large programs rolled out very quickly and just an extraordinary response to unprecedented market conditions. Here, we are happy to leverage facilities to intermediate these programs for our clients. But, we are only using them where it makes sense to ensure the credit and liquidity is flowing to where it's needed. Thanks, everyone."

            "name": "Jamie Dimon",
            "content": "Yes. No, it's a very important question. I think in times of need, banks have always been the lender of last resort to their customers. And obviously, you've got to be a disciplined capital provider because undisciplined loans are bad. So, you take your calculated risks. We're making additional loans. We're adults. We know that if the economy gets worse, we'll bear additional loss, but we do forecast all of that so we know we can handle really, really adverse consequences. There will be a point -- and the last question brought it up was where you get below 10% CET1, even though we'll have almost $200 billion in capital and $1 trillion liquidity, all these other constraints start to kick in, like SLR and G-SIFI, advanced risk-weighted assets that may kind of constrain it. And so, -- and then obviously, then you've got to look forward. So, we want to do our job. If we can help the country get through this, everybody's better off. If we lose a little bit more money in the meantime, so be it. But obviously, we're going to protect our company, our balance sheet,, our growth and we'll be having close conversations with regulators about what that is. I also think, you have to take in consideration the extraordinary measures the government has taken. That's the income to individuals, the PPP and all these Federal Reserve things. Yes. I'll let Jen talk about the base case. But, I think the back to work, we shouldn't think of as a binary thing that after the CDC and we all get instructions from the government after there's enough capacity in the hospitals, after there is proper amount of testing. Remember, a lot of people are going to work today in farms, factories, food production, retail, pharmacies, hospitals. It isn't like no one's going to work and you can hope that you can turn it back on where it's very safe. There's plenty of capacity. You're not worried that you can't give every American who does get sick, the best possible medical advice. And the turn on will be regional by company, all following standards of best health practices. And in some ways you need to get that done because the bad economy has very adverse consequences, way beyond just the economy. In terms of mental health, domestic abuse, substance abuse, et cetera. So, a rational plan to get back to work is a good thing to do. And hopefully it'll be sooner rather than later, but it won't be May. We are talking about June, July, August, something like that. So, I don't know if that answers your whole question. And then, Jen, you give the base case. I've always tried [ph] the floor doing one stress test, which will not be the stress you go through. JPMorgan does 100 a week. And we're always looking at potential outcomes. And obviously we're doing our own COVID-related type of stress testing, including extreme, and we'll always be updating them, talking to regulars about it, because that's what we have to deal with this time, not what I would consider a traditional stress test. I'd just add, on the consumer side, the forward-looking view of risk, on the wholesale side, the revolvers are taken down, which is like $50 billion, our existing spreads. The bilateral stuff is being done by new credits. They're being done at slightly different spreads and stuff like that are higher. And then trading, obviously you're actually getting higher spreads and lot of things you do, and train your finance people and do things and stuff like that. And then you will see a tightening of credit in the market. Think of leverage lending, certain underwriting, sort of non-bank lenders who are no longer there. So, you will see an eventual tightening and eventual increase in spreads. What you won't see banks do is price gouge, which you see in other industries. Banks are very careful to support their clients in times like this. And I would just also put this in perspective. We're adults. We know that we have a bridge loan book, because you're going to have quarters where things get bad and you might lose some money. We're the leader in leverage lending, we're the leader in high yield, the leader in loans, et cetera. And we intend to maintain that position. And every now and then you have not a particularly good quarter. So, we're not -- we don't worry about this very much. And like Jen said, so far if you look at spreads, it's probably a recovery this quarter. And also just on the wholesale side, kind of at one point you have an overlay about what you expect in terms of migration downward and downgrades and stuff like that. It will also be name by name, company by company, name by name, reserve by reserve, so a real detailed review of that. I think commercial real estate, eventually it will be loan by loan and name by name too. So, you have reason to believe that a loan is bad, you're going to write it down and put a reserve against it or something like that. This is such a dramatic change of events. So, there are no models that have done -- dealt with GDP down 40%, unemployment growing this rapidly. And that's one part. There are also no models ever dealt with a government, which is doing a PPP program, which might be $350 billion and might be $550 billion. Unemployment, where -- it looks like 30% to 40% of people going [ph] on unemployment with higher income than before they went on unemployment. So, what does that mean for credit card or something like that or that the government is just going to make direct payments to people. So, this is all in the works right now. The Company is very good shape. We can serve our clients and we're going to give you more detail on this, but it's happening as we speak. And I think people are making too much of a mistake to model it. When we get to the end of the second quarter, we'll know exactly what happens in the second quarter. Like, you know -- you've got to respect the credit card delinquencies and charges will go up that we've seen very little bit so far. But, in the second quarter, you'll see more of it. And then, we'll also know if there's a fourth round of government stimulus, we'll know a whole bunch of stuff and we'll report that out. We hope for the best, which is, you have that recovery and plan for the worst, so you can handle it. I've got the number where reserves went from like $7 billion to $35 billion back to $14 billion. Reserve in itself is counter -- pro-cyclical and often wrong. And you're required to do it, but it certainly doesn't match revenues and expenses. And so, we'd like to be conservative in reserving, but I have to point out the flaws of it. And Jen remind me, when we do the 10-Q for the quarter, we're going to lay out lots of these various assumptions about CECL. And one of the problems with CECL is this precisely. We're going to spend all day on CECL, which was $4 billion and it's kind of a drop in the bucket, but it's a lot of data. It's like all the data we did after the last crisis we give you on level three, and all these assumptions and stuff like that. No one ever looks it anymore. And every company does it differently. A couple of deals may be syndicated, but hopefully, might be syndicated at the end of the second or third quarter. I don't know about you guys. I can't -- we can't understand a word you are saying. We'll clearly know a lot more in 90 days about how this effect is, what we would have expected? What uplift? We'll incorporate all of that into how we run the company trying to serve client et cetera, et cetera. And there few things, like the PPP that you put on your balance sheet is zero RWA but it does affect a lot of other things, like SLR and G-SIFI and stuff like that. Because if you sell it to the government, those -- it all goes away. And we will manage through that as we learn how these programs are working and what want to do. Thank you for spending time with us."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\u2019 Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your lines will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please standby. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.\nJeremy Barnum: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. It\u2019s slightly longer this quarter to cover both our fourth quarter and full year results, as well as spend some time talking about the outlook for next year. Starting with the fourth quarter on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $10.4 billion, EPS of $3.33 on revenue of $30.3 billion, and delivered an ROTCE of 19%. These results included a $1.8 billion net credit reserve release, which I\u2019ll cover in more detail shortly. Adjusting for this, we delivered a 17% ROTCE this quarter. Touching on a few highlights, as we suggested last quarter, we have started to see a pickup in loan growth, 8% year-on-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter ex-PPP, with a significant portion of this growth coming from AWM and Markets. But we\u2019re also seeing positive indicators in card, as well as increasing revolver utilization and C&I. And it was an exceptionally strong quarter for Investment Banking, particularly M&A, as well as another good quarter in AWM. On page 2, we have some more detail on the fourth quarter. Revenue of $30.3 billion was up 1% year-on-year. Net interest income was up 3%, primarily driven by balance sheet growth, partially offset by lower CIB Markets NII, and NIR was down 1%, largely driven by normalization in CIB Markets and lower production revenue in home lending, mostly offset by higher IB fees on strong advisory. You\u2019ll notice that we\u2019ve added some memo lines to this page this quarter to show NII and NIR, excluding Markets, as well as the third line of standalone Markets total revenue, which as we said before, is more consistent with the way we run the Company. We\u2019ll be keeping this format going forward and you\u2019ll see later that this is how we will talk about the outlook. If you look at things on this basis, the drivers are the same, but the numbers are a little different. NII, excluding Markets, is up 4%; NIR, excluding Markets, is up 3%; and Markets is down 11% on normalization. Expenses of $17.9 billion were up $1.8 billion or 11%, largely on higher compensation and credit costs were a net benefit of $1.3 billion, reflecting reserve releases. Looking at the full year results on page 3, the Firm reported net income of $48.3 billion, EPS of $15.36, and record revenue of $125.3 billion. We delivered a return on tangible common equity of 23% or 18%, excluding the reserve releases. And then, onto reserves on page 4. We released $1.8 billion this quarter, reflecting a more balanced outlook due to the continued resilience in the macroeconomic environment. Our outlook remains constructive, but our reserve balances still account for various sources of uncertainty and potential downside as a result of the remaining abnormal features of the economic environment. On the balance sheet and capital on page 5, we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13%, up slightly, and reflecting nearly $5 billion of capital distributions to shareholders, including $1.9 billion of net repurchases. With that, let\u2019s go to our businesses, starting with consumer and community banking on page 6. CCB reported net income of $4.2 billion, including reserves releases of $1.6 billion. Revenue of $12.3 billion was down 4% year-on-year and reflects lower production margins in home lending and higher acquisition costs in card, partially offset by higher asset management fees in consumer and business banking. Many of the key balance sheet drivers are in line with the prior quarter. Deposits were up 20% year-on-year and 4%, sequentially, and client investment assets were up 22% year-on-year, about evenly split between market performance and flows. Combined credit and debit spend was up 27% versus the fourth quarter of \u201819 with each quarter in 2021 showing sequential growth compared to 2019. Within that, travel and entertainment spend was up 13% versus 4Q \u201819, but we have seen some softening in recent weeks contemporaneously with the Omicron wave. Card outstandings were up 5% year-on-year, but remain down 8% versus 4Q \u201819. However, it\u2019s promising to see that while revolving balances bottomed in May of 2021, since then, they\u2019ve kept pace with 2019 growth rates. In home lending, loans were down 1% year-on-year, but up 1% quarter-on-quarter as prepayments have slowed. And it was another strong quarter for originations, totaling $42.2 billion, up 30% year-on-year. In fact, it was the highest fourth quarter since 2012, driven by increase in both purchase and refi volumes. In auto, average loans were up 7% year-on-year and up 1% quarter-on-quarter. After several strong quarters, the lack of vehicle supply resulted in a decline in originations to $8.5 billion, down 23% year-on-year. So overall, loans ex-PPP, were up 2% year-on-year and sequentially, driven by card and auto, and expenses of $7.8 billion were up 10% year-on-year on higher compensation, as well as continued investments in technology and marketing. Next, the CIB on page 7. CIB reported net income of $4.8 billion on revenue of $11.5 billion for the fourth quarter. And for the full year, net income was $21 billion on record revenue of $52 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $3.2 billion was up 28% versus the prior year and up 6% sequentially. IB fees were up 37% year-on-year, primarily driven by a strong performance in advisory. And we maintained our number one rank with a full year wallet share of 9.5%. In advisory, we were up 86% and it was the third consecutive all time record quarter, benefiting from elevated M&A volumes that continued throughout 2021, specifically for midsized deals. Debt underwriting fees were up 14%, driven by an active leverage loan market, primarily linked to acquisition financing. And in equity underwriting, fees were up 12%, primarily driven by our strong performance in IPOs. Moving to Markets, total revenue was $5.3 billion, down 11% against a record fourth quarter last year. Compared to 2019, we were up 7%, driven by a strong performance in equities. Fixed income was down 16% year-on-year, reflecting a more difficult trading environment early in the quarter, especially in rates, as well as continued normalization from the favorable trading performance last year in currencies, emerging markets, credit and commodities. Equity markets were down 2% on $2 billion of revenue, as continued strength in Prime was more than offset by modest weakness in derivatives. For the full year, equities revenue was $10.5 billion, up 22% at an all-time record. It was a particularly strong year for both Investment Banking and Markets. And looking ahead, we do expect some modest normalization of the wallet in 2022. However, for purposes of the first quarter in Investment Banking, the overall pipeline remains quite robust. Payments revenue was $1.8 billion, up 26% year-on-year or up 7% excluding net gains on equity investments. And the year-on-year growth was from higher fees and deposits, largely offset by deposit margin compression. Security services revenue of $1.1 billion was flat year-on-year. Expenses of $5.8 billion were up 18% year-on-year, predominantly due to higher compensation as well as volume related and legal expenses. And credit costs were not benefit of $126 million, driven by the reserve release, I mentioned upfront. Moving to Commercial Banking on page 8. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.3 billion and an ROE of 20%. Revenue of $2.6 billion was up 6% year-on-year on record Investment Banking revenue, driven by continued strength in M&A and acquisition related financing. Expenses of $1.1 billion were up 11% year-on-year, largely due to investments and higher volume and revenue related expenses. Deposits were up 8% sequentially on seasonality. Loans were down 1% year-on-year and up 2% sequentially, excluding PPP. C&I loans were up 4% ex-PPP, primarily driven by higher revolver utilization and originations in middle markets and increased short-term financing and corporate client banking. CRE loans were up 1% with higher new loan originations, offset by net payoff activity. And credit costs were a net benefit of $89 million, driven by reserve releases with net charge-offs of 2 basis points. And then, to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 9. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.1 billion with a pretax margin of 34%. Revenue of $4.5 billion was up 16% year-on-year, as higher management fees and growth in deposits and loans were partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $3 billion were up 9% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher performance related compensation and distribution fees. For the quarter, net long-term term inflows were $34 billion and for the full year were positive across all channels, asset classes and regions, totaling a record of $164 billion. AUM of $3.1 trillion and overall client assets of $4.3 trillion, up 15% and 18% year-on-year, respectively, were driven by strong net inflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 4% quarter-on-quarter with continued strength in custom lending, mortgages and securities-based lending while deposits were up 15% sequentially. Turning to corporate on page 10. Corporate reported a net loss of $1.1 billion. Revenue was a loss of $545 million, down $296 million year-on-year. NII was up $160 million, primarily on higher rates, mostly offset by continued deposit growth. And NIR was down $456 million, primarily due to lower net gains on legacy equity investments. Expenses of $251 million were down $110 million year-on-year. So with that, as we close the books on 2021, we think it\u2019s important to take a step back and look at the performance over the last few years through the volatility of the COVID period, and then pivot to discussing the 2022 and medium-term outlook. So, turning to page 11, what stands out is the stability of both revenues and returns through a very volatile period, especially when you strip out the reserve builds and subsequent releases in 2020 and 2021. If you look at the revenue drivers on the bottom left-hand side of the page, you see overall revenue growth with some significant diversification benefits. NII, ex-Markets, was down nearly 20% on the headwinds of lower rates and card revolve that we\u2019ve discussed throughout the year. This was partially offset by significant NIR growth ex-Markets, largely from higher IB fees and AWM management and performance fees. And we also saw strength across products and regions in CIB Markets, as the extraordinary market environment in 2020 did not normalize as much as we expected in 2021. So, when you look across the Company, we saw consistent modest revenue growth, as well as good performance in the areas that we control, notably, staying in front of our clients to serve them well and managing our risks effectively, resulting in quite stable returns, once again proving the power of the JPMorgan Chase platform. So, turning to the next page. The strong revenue performance and consistent returns have further bolstered our confidence in forging ahead with an investment strategy designed to ensure that we\u2019re prepared for the long-term. On the left hand side of the page, you can see the expense drivers from 2019 to 2021. The first bar is structural. And while the growth of 2% is modest over the two-year period, that includes some COVID-related effects that we would see as temporary including, for example, lower T&E spend and elevated employee attrition. And we do expect some catch-up in those effects as we look forward. Then, the middle bar is $3.4 billion of growth in volume and revenue-related expenses. Some significant portion of that is driven by increases in incentive compensation, primarily from Investment Banking, Markets and Asset & Wealth Management, the major areas where we have seen exceptionally strong results and where changes in compensation are more closely linked to changes in performance. And remember, we\u2019ve seen a lot of market appreciation and strong flows in AWM and CCB. So, don\u2019t assume all of this is CIB as you look forward because there are some versions of the world where the markets in fee wallet goes one way and AUM goes the opposite way. And then, this bar also includes volume-related non-comp expenses such as brokerage and distribution fees, some of which are true expenses and some of which are bottom line neutral because they\u2019re offset with revenue gross-ups. Then, the last bar of $1.7 billion, as previewed with you this time last year, is a result of our investment agenda, which we\u2019ve been executing largely according to our plans and consistent with our longstanding priorities. You can see the breakdown of the total investment spend on the right hand side of the page, $9.6 billion growing to $11.3 billion across the categories that we\u2019ve often discussed. We\u2019re continuing to broaden our footprint and expand our distribution network. Then marketing, where the significant increase in spend as part of the reopening in the second half of last year resulted in a full year spend comparable to 2019. And tech, which we\u2019ve broadened to include tech adjacent spend, reflecting our recognition, the tech means more than just software development and encompasses data and analytics, AI as well as the physical aspects of modernization such as data centers. And what\u2019s really powerful to note here is our ability to make these investments, which are quite significant in dollar terms and are designed to secure our future while still delivering excellent current returns. So, over the next few pages, let\u2019s double click into some of these investment areas to see what we\u2019re doing, starting with examples of marketing and distribution on page 13. We\u2019ve expanded our reach across the U.S. and are thrilled to be the first bank in all contiguous 48 states, an important milestone in our branch market expansion plans. We also continue to expand internationally, including 13 international markets as part of our Commercial Bank expansion, China in both our CIB and AWM businesses, and in the UK with Chase UK, where we\u2019ve seen exciting progress since we launched in September, although we expect this to be a multiyear journey before having a measurable impact on the firm overall. We continue to hire bankers and advisors in investment banking, private banking and wealth management, really across all of the wholesale and consumer footprint where we believe we have opportunities to better penetrate geographies and sectors to continue to grow share. And as I just said, the point of our investment strategy is to secure the future of the Company. So, we\u2019re not making short-term claims about share outcome causality. But as you can see at the bottom of the page, our market shares are robust and growing broadly across the Company. Turning to page 14. In addition to all of our distribution-related investments, a critical foundational component of our strategy is technology where we spend over $12 billion annually with about half of that being investments or as we sometimes call it, change the bank spend. It\u2019s important to understand what\u2019s in the investment category. About half of that is foundational and mandatory, which includes regulatory-related investments, modernization and the retirement of technical debt in addition to other key strategic initiatives to help us face the future. On the left hand side, you can see some more detail around this. Modernization, which includes migrations to the cloud as well as upgrading legacy infrastructure and architecture, data strategy that enables us to extract the value that exists in our proprietary data set by cleaning it and staging it in the right ways and then deploying modern techniques against it, attracting and acquiring top talent with modern skills, and a product operating model, which is obviously a popular buzzword these days. But if you look through all that, it reflects the simple reality that the best products get delivered when developers and business owners are working together iteratively with end-to-end ownership. Underpinning all of this is our continued emphasis on cybersecurity to protect the Firm and our clients and customers as well as maintaining a sound control environment. Moving to the right hand side. The other half of the investment spend is to drive innovation across our businesses and with our client-facing products. We believe it\u2019s critical to identify and resolve customer pain points and improve the user experience. And we\u2019re attacking the problem with a combination of building, partnering and buying. And so, a few examples of that. On the retail side, we\u2019ve been able to digitalize existing product offerings with applications like Chase MyHome and launch a cloud native digital bank with our recent Chase UK launch. On the wholesale side, we continue to innovate on our Execute trading platform, commercialized blockchain through Onyx and are building out real-time payments capabilities. In addition, our modernization allows us to more efficiently partner with or acquire more digitally centered companies. And you can see several examples of this on the page. So, taken together, our strategy and investments are critical to ensuring that we can compete with the most innovative players out there, whether we\u2019re the ones pushing the envelope of innovation or responding quickly to the creativity of our competitors but doing so at scale. With that, let\u2019s talk about the outlook and the year ahead, starting on page 15. As you\u2019ll remember from Daniel\u2019s comments in December, the 17% that we have talked about as a medium-term ROTCE target is not realistic for 2022. We do expect to see some tailwinds to NII, including the benefit of the latest implied and the expectation that card revolve rates will increase. But the headwinds likely exceed the tailwinds as capital markets normalize off an elevated wallet, and we continue to make additional investments as well as the impact of inflationary pressures. However, despite these potential challenges for the near-term outlook, we do continue to believe in 17% ROTCE as our central case for the medium term as rates continue to move higher and we realized business growth, driven by our investments. So, let us try to give you more detail around forward-looking drivers that could be headwinds or tailwinds. So first, the rate curve. Our central case does not require a return to a 2.5% Fed funds target rate as the current forward curve only prices in 625 basis-point hikes over the next three years. Assuming we realize the forward curve, from there, we see the outcomes as being relatively symmetric with plus or minus 175 basis points of ROTCE impact as a reasonable range relative to our central case. And of course, there are obviously any number of rate paths to get there, which could produce different outcomes over the near term. In this illustration, the downside assumes that rates stay relatively constant to current spot rates whereas upside would be driven by a combination of a steeper yield curve, more hikes together with a more favorable deposit reprice experience. And of course, what we are evaluating here is the impact of rates in isolation on NII, but for the performance of the Company as a whole, credit matters a lot. And the reason why rates are higher will have an impact on that. In markets and banking, we feel good about the share we\u2019ve taken, and there are reasons why the beginning of a rate hiking cycle could be quite healthy for fixed income revenues in particular, at least in the sense that it might provide a partial offset to what we would otherwise expect in terms of post-COVID revenue normalization. In our central case, markets and banking normalized somewhat in 2022 relative to their respective record years in 2020 and 2021, and resume modest growth thereafter. The downside case assumes a return to 2019 trend line levels with sub-GDP growth rates, whereas the upside case assumes continued growth from current elevated levels. As we\u2019ve been discussing in consumer, the big surprise as we emerge from the worst moment of the pandemic was the lower level of card revolve, even as spend has started to return. In our central case, we assume healthy sales growth from the back of continued economic recovery and strong account acquisitions. And that, combined with relatively constant revolve rates, generates a strong recovery in revolving balances. But there are those who worry about a permanent structural shift in consumer behavior, which could be a source of downside. And in that scenario, revolving balances could stay depressed relative to the long-term pre-pandemic averages, resulting in approximately 50 basis points of downside relative to our central case. Of course, there could be an upside case where revolving balances recover much faster but we believe the risks here are more likely to be skewed to the downside. And then, let\u2019s touch on inflation for a second, which is obviously increasingly relevant. On balance, modest inflation that leads to higher rates is good for us. But under some scenarios, elevated inflationary pressures on expenses could more than offset the rates benefit, which could represent around 75 basis points of downside. And while it\u2019s not on the page, another key driver is capital, where even though we remain hopeful, our central case assumes no recalibration of the rules and that we will operate at a higher CET1, reflecting that we finished the year in the 4.5% GSIB bucket which equates to a 1% increase from GSIB in the central case. Although as a reminder, that does not become binding until 2024. This is a good opportunity to point out that QE deposit growth and growth of the overall financial system proxy by GDP growth of the factors in the original 2015 rule release combined represent two full GSIB buckets. So, in the absence of those, we would still be in the 3.5% bucket. With that in mind, any recalibration could be a tailwind. And each 1% change in the CET1 level is worth about 150 basis points of ROTCE. And to be clear, for simplicity, we\u2019ve assumed a normal credit environment in the analysis on the page. So, when we take a step back, 17% remains our central case in the medium term. But over the next one to two years, we expect to earn modestly below that target. In light of all that, let\u2019s talk about near-term guidance on page 16. We expect NII, excluding Markets, to be roughly $50 billion in 2022, up approximately $5.5 billion from 2021. As I mentioned upfront, this is a change relative to how we\u2019ve previously guided as we feel that the ups and downs of Markets\u2019 NII can be a distraction when the vast majority of that variation is likely to be bottom line neutral. Looking at the key drivers of that for 2022, there are a few major factors. Rates, with the market implied suggesting approximately three hikes later this year and the reason steepening of the yield curve, we would expect to see about $2.5 billion more NII from that effect. You can see at the bottom right, we\u2019ve shown you the third quarter earnings at risk and an estimate of what we would expect to disclose in the 10-K, reflecting the year-end rate curve and changes in the portfolio composition. And as we note in our quarterly filings, there are lots of reasons to be careful in trying to use EAR to predict NII changes under real-world conditions. But at a high level, if you look at the numbers on the bottom right and what\u2019s happening to the yield curve recently, you should find the $2.5 billion increase relatively intuitive. Then, balance sheet growth and mix, where we are expecting higher spend and new originations to drive revolving balances back to 2019 levels, and also benefiting from securities deployment towards the end of 2021 and into 2022. And partially offsetting both of those factors is the roll-off of PPP. So, while we do expect NII to increase year-on-year, depending on the path of rates, it may take a couple of years to return to the full NII generating capacity of the Company. Turning to page 17. As we said at the outset of this section, we are in for a couple of years of sub-target returns. Despite this, we are going to continue to invest and we\u2019re not going to let temporary headwinds distract us from critical strategic ambitions. And so, looking at adjusted expenses, we expect roughly $77 billion in 2022, an increase of about $6 billion year-on-year or 8%. And before we go into the breakdown, it\u2019s worth noting, while the year-on-year increase is eye-catching, a meaningful portion of it is actually the annualization of post reopening trends from the second half of 2021 across various categories. So starting with the first bucket on the page, which is the structural expense increase. As I alluded to earlier, we are seeing some catch-up this year, both from the impact of inflation and our compensation expenses as well as higher non-comp expense with the resumption of T&E. Then, volume and revenue-related expenses. Remember that this is both comp and non-comp. From a comp perspective, to the extent we are assuming some normalization of capital markets revenues, there should be a tailwind here. But keep in mind a couple of points. The normalization assumption for Markets and IB fees at this point is pretty modest. And our assumption for AUM is for modest increases. At the same time, we have the impact of volume growth on non-comp, both in wholesale and in consumer, which is offset by lower auto lease depreciation. And most importantly, we are adding another $3.5 billion of investments, which I would note includes the run rate impact of our acquisitions as well as some of the run rate effects that I just mentioned and reflects similar themes to the ones I discussed earlier. As I wrap up, it\u2019s another good moment to stop and note how privileged we are to have the financial strength and the earnings generating capacity to absorb these inflationary pressures while also making critical investments to secure the future of the Company. So, in closing, on page 18, we\u2019re happy with what we\u2019ve been able to achieve over the last two years. Not only the business results, some of which are highlighted here on the page, but also continuing to serve our customers, clients and communities, and importantly, executing on our strategic priorities. As we look ahead, we will continue to invest and innovate to build and strengthen this franchise for the long term. And while there may be headwinds in the near term as we continue to work through the consequences of the pandemic, we\u2019ve never felt better about the Company and our position in this very competitive dynamic landscape. So, with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is coming from the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. Please proceed.\nErika Najarian: Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, my first question is for you, and it\u2019s on page 16. And it\u2019s a two-part question on this guidance. The first is, could you help us size the timing and magnitude of deposit beta that you presume in this $50 billion number as well as the size of securities deployment? And the second part to that question is, clearly, we\u2019re missing that white box, right, in terms of CIB markets contribution. And if you could give us sort of rails to think about CIB markets in light of your comments about more modest normalization versus the idea that this business is naturally liability sensitive?\nJeremy Barnum: Right. Okay. So, three questions in there. Let me take them one at a time. So beta, at the end of the day, the reprice experience is going to be a function of the competitive environment. But for the purposes of working through the guidance, I can tell you that we\u2019re assuming that this hiking cycle is going to be generally similar to the prior hiking cycle, all else equal. The environment is a little bit different in some important respects. So, I think the system this time around is flushed with deposits, is flushed with liquidity in a way that it wasn\u2019t before. So, that could at the margin make the reprice a little bit slower. On the other hand, the competitive environment is different, especially with some of the neo bank entrants and that could go in the other direction. So, it will be what it will be. But for the purposes of the guidance, we\u2019re assuming a reprice experience that\u2019s similar to what we experienced in the prior cycle. In terms of deployment, obviously, deployment is going to be a situational decision. But, if you\u2019re looking at the $4 billion bar on page 16, securities deployment is a modest contributor to that $4 billion number. The bulk of it is the loan growth narrative, particularly in card. And then, in terms of Markets NII, the whole point of not guiding explicitly to Markets NII is to avoid getting distracted by the noise there, which can come from a lot of really kind of relevant places, like interest rate hikes in Brazil and cash versus future positions, which is the example I\u2019d like to give. But big picture, if you need something for your model or whatever, there\u2019s a couple of things we could suggest. So, if you look at the supplement, we\u2019ve actually been disclosing the Markets NII number for some time in the supplement. So, you actually have a pretty decent time series of that number over time. If you address that thing against the Fed funds rate, you\u2019ll actually see that there\u2019s a pretty clear negative correlation there. And so, you can draw some conclusions from that. But I just will point out that like in any given moment, relatively small changes to the mix of the Markets balance sheet can really change the NII quite significantly, even in an environment of no policy rate changes. So, it\u2019s sort of like a health warning against putting too much emphasis on that projection.\nErika Najarian: Very clear. Thank you. My second compound question is on capital. If you could give us an update -- I know that January 1st is the adoption date for SA-CCR, if you could give us an estimate on the impact of CET1? And just to clarify, that 17% medium-term ROTCE does take into account that your GSIB surcharge is 4.5%?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. So, let me do the second one first. So in short, yes. So, as I said in the script, we are not assuming any recalibration in that 17% target. So, that does mean 4.5% GSIB in the equity component of that number. In terms of SA-CCR, the impact of SA-CCR adoption was about $40 million of standardized RWA. So, I think if you do the math, that\u2019s like 10 basis points of CET1.\nErika Najarian: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from John McDonald from Autonomous Research. Please proceed.\nJohn McDonald: Hey Jeremy, I want to follow up on that. Maybe a broader discussion on how you\u2019re managing the capital constraints, the SLR and the rising GSIB. And what does it mean for balancing share buybacks, which obviously reduced this quarter, preferred issuance and other levers that you have?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. So, as you know, John, in terms of share buybacks, that\u2019s at the bottom of our capital stack. So, to the extent that we\u2019re seeing robust loan growth, other opportunities to invest in the business as well as potential M&A opportunities, those are all going to come ahead of buybacks. And so, I don\u2019t want to sort of guide on our buyback plans for next year, which under SCB, as you know, are really quite flexible as a function of the earnings generation outcomes, the capital build. But you can kind of draw your own conclusions in terms of the growth and the minimums that we see in the future as well as the loan growth as well as some of the investments that we\u2019re making. And frankly, we\u2019re kind of happy about that. That\u2019s just -- we want the capital to be used that way rather than being used for buybacks.\nJohn McDonald: Okay. And then, as the follow-up, maybe compound follow-up. The new CET1 target or where you expect to kind of run this year, if you could clarify that. And also, any color on the modest normalization of the FICC and equities wallets that you could flush out?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. So, in terms of the target, I mean, I said previously that 12% was not off the table. And that remains true. Depending on the outcome of the rule side, depending on the Basel III endgame, depending on all the various components, you can see a world where 12% remains the minimum. But as you can see, and as I said in response to Erika a second ago, the 17% target assumes something closer to 13% as a function of the expected increases in GSIB and some other factors. So, we\u2019re kind of going to operate in that type of range throughout the year with obviously the flexibility that we have. And then, sorry, you also asked about normalization of markets and IB fees. I mean, I would say, if you\u2019d ask me in the middle of the year, we were talking a little bit about thinking that a reversion to 2019 run rate was a thing that like could happen in theory. The way we feel right now, our central case is obviously that we will see some normalization from exceptionally strong performance, both in IB fees and in Markets. But I think we\u2019re expecting that normalization to be a little bit less, like we\u2019re near all the way down to the 2019 levels, partially because the banking pipeline is really very robust. We feel good about the kind of organic growth in equities and some of the share gains there. And then in fixed income, we\u2019ve already seen a decent amount of normalization there actually. And as the monetary policy environment evolves next year, that could actually create some tailwinds for that business.\nJohn McDonald: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Next up, we have Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thank you very much. I wonder if I could ask a little follow-up on the expense side. Slide 17 breaks a lot out. First, I\u2019m curious on -- if I overgeneralize and say, 40% used called structural comp normalization, a 60% investment. And thank you, I just saw a further breakout in the bottom of the slide. But the question I have is how much of that 60%, the higher volume, the investments, has investments made? In other words, you made 11 either M&A deals or investments over the last like 15 months. How much of that is related to that coming through the P&L, or straight up brand-new investments for \u201822 entering for all those items that you listed below?\nJeremy Barnum: Right. Okay. I think I get your question, Glenn. So, number one, to the extent that we\u2019ve done some M&A over the last 15 months, as you allude to, and that that has introduced some expenses into the run rate, the run rate impact of that is in the $3.5 billion. It\u2019s a relatively modest contribution. On the top of my head, I want to say it\u2019s probably like $300 million or something like that. So, it could be a little bit more, depending on some factors. So, that\u2019s one point. The other point is that there are different types of investments here. So, if you look at, for example, the change in the marketing expense and the marketing investments that come through marketing expense in card, a lot of the decisioning of that actually happened as part of the reopening in the middle of the year. So, that\u2019s actually already in the run rate. Whereas other aspects of the investment agenda are obviously thinks that we\u2019re executing now, expanding in places, hiring people, hiring technologists to do things that we need to do. So hopefully that answers your question.\nGlenn Schorr: And maybe if I could just ask a very general question, I think people get normalizing capital markets and a higher investment spend when it adds up to falling short of the 17% over time target. The question -- the simple question I have is the fact that you\u2019ve mentioned multiyear shortfall, is that a function of timing of NII going full run rate with the timing of capital markets short off and the high denominator, as you just answered with John\u2019s question?\nJeremy Barnum: Your line is breaking up a tiny bit, but I think I basically hear your question, and I think the simple answer is yes. So, in other words, we\u2019re sort of saying that as we -- as the environment continues to normalize in a variety of ways, so that includes policy rate normalization, rate curve formalization as well as run rate normalization and Markets revenues with the sort of some background expectation of growth in our Markets and Investment Banking revenues with the background expectation of growth, and when all of that plays out and is finished playing out, we believe we should be back to 17%, all else equal. So, you can kind of see -- it\u2019s not that long, if you know what I mean, in terms of like what the current forwards imply about when you get back to a sort of more normalized policy rate environment.\nJamie Dimon: Glenn, I would just like to add, we don\u2019t really know about 2023, and I\u2019d be very cautious in that. Plus, I expect more interest rates increases is in the implied curve. And obviously, the world is very competitive. I also want to point out that a 17% return on tangible equity, if you can get that to the rest of our lives would be exceptional. So, reconfirming that that\u2019s kind of what we do, we can do is pretty good. By the way, I would say 15% on tangible for the rest of my life, if I can guarantee that.\nOperator: Next question from Ken Usdin from Jefferies.\nKen Usdin: I wanted to ask you just a couple of more questions on loans. You mentioned that you\u2019re starting to see some better activity. I wanted to just ask if you can kind of just flesh out what you\u2019re seeing across corporate lending, commercial lending, noticing that the wholesale-related commitments were actually down 3% sequentially. So, can you kind of just talk us through what clients are saying and doing? And just how strong can that rebound on the corporate and commercial side could we see as we go forward?\nJeremy Barnum: Sure. Yes. So, in terms of C&I loan growth, as I said in the script, we are seeing an uptick in revolver utilization rates, especially in the commercial bank. And it remains sort of skewed to the smaller clients. But, we are starting to see an uptick in that actually even in the bigger clients. So, that gets an encouraging sign. One of the things I\u2019ve heard from the folks who run those businesses is that one driver of that is CEOs and management teams who\u2019ve been burned by low inventory levels as a result of the supply chain problems, wanting to run higher inventories, and that is maybe driving higher utilization there which, as a result, while it would, I guess, theoretically be a relatively permanent increase in utilization is not a thing that you can sort of project forward in terms of compounding the growth. But at the same time, we\u2019re also hearing really quite a bit of confidence in the C-suites and all else equal, that should be positive for C&I loan growth. But clearly, the levels there are modest still in a world where capital markets have been exceptionally receptive to investment-grade issuance, in particular, and more recently, the high-yield issuance throughout the sort of pandemic period. And so, people are well funded from capital markets issuance.\nKen Usdin: Okay. Second question is just on fees. There are a couple of zigs and zags in mortgage banking, security servicing, which were both down a little bit more than expected. And card did get a little bit better. Can you just kind of give us a little bit of color on the drivers of each of those, please? Thank you.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, sure. So, there\u2019s a lot of stuff in there. So, let me do mortgage and cards. So, in mortgage, you\u2019ll see that if you sort of try to do a margin calculation by taking the production revenue and dividing it and so on, you do see an apparently significant drop in margin there. So, there\u2019s a few drivers of that. One is the margins were actually slightly elevated in the prior quarter as a result of the timing of the flow-through of the loan-specific pricing adjustments. So, that\u2019s one factor. In addition, you actually -- we did -- despite the fact that it was an exceptionally strong overall quarter of originations and for funded loans, as we started to see higher rates towards the end of the quarter, we did see the dynamic that you would expect in terms of drop in saleable new lock volume and so on. So, that\u2019s a little of a factor. And then there\u2019s the sort of the normal organic dynamics where you tend to see margin compression in mortgage with rates selling off a little bit. So, you have a bunch of factors driving a slightly lower number there, but the overall mortgage environment is quite healthy. And though obviously with higher rates we expect things to be weaker next year, we\u2019re still predicting a $3 trillion mortgage market next year, which by historical standards is very robust. So, that\u2019s that part. And then, in card, I imagine that you\u2019re looking at the card income line where we had a significant drop last quarter. And this quarter, the number is also sort of relatively depressed relative to what we had two quarters ago when it was quite high. So you\u2019ll remember that for card income, we had a sort of one-off item last quarter, depressing the number. This quarter, we have another sort of one-offish type item, which is the impact of the Southwest co-brand renegotiation, which is public. So, that\u2019s contributing to the card income line, the revenue rate a little bit. But it\u2019s important to note that in the background of all this is the impact of the customer acquisition amortization comfort revenue expense, which, as you know, amortizes over 12 months. And so, as I mentioned earlier, as part of the big sort of increase in customer engagement, as part of the reopening in the middle of the year, we ramped that up quite significantly, 100,000 point offers in the market and stuff like that. And so, that\u2019s coming through the numbers. So, as a result, when you look at the sort of full year revenue rate for card of around 10%, we actually see that as a reasonable central case for next year with the sort of elevated marketing and customer acquisition amortization being offset, obviously, by expected growth in NII with the revolve narrative that we\u2019ve laid out.\nOperator: So, that question is from Jim Mitchell coming from Seaport Research.\nJim Mitchell: Just you guys are doubling the investment spend. So clearly seeing success in the prior efforts. So, could you just give us a little bit big picture discussion on what you\u2019re seeing from a return on investment standpoint and what time frame? Because I think you kind of alluded to 2023 still being a little bit subpar in return. So, does that mean the payback is a little longer and you still expect significant growth in investment spend in \u201823?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, sure. So, I mean, at some level, the question that you\u2019re asking is this perennial question of how can we be sure that the investments that we\u2019re making are paying back and on what time line and how do we measure that? And it\u2019s interesting. We were just talking about card marketing. I think of that as a continuum. You have a continuum of investments that start with card marketing where every dollar that we put into card marketing investment as part of a very sophisticated, extremely data-driven, highly measurable set of decisioning to ensure that all of those are accretive and when we have sort of measurable outcomes in the short term. So, there\u2019s a lot of signs there, and it\u2019s pretty precise and you get feedback pretty quickly. At the other end of the continuum is tech modernization type stuff, which is a big part of the theme right now. And those things are things that are just we obviously need to do them. If we don\u2019t do them, we\u2019ll be clunky and inefficient and hamstrung in the future when we\u2019re trying to compete. And it\u2019s impossible to prove in some narrow financial sense that there is a tangible return payback from that, but we know that they\u2019re absolutely mandatory. So, when we think a little bit about the revenue outlook in our kind of normalized run rate, we are certainly assuming that many of the investments that we\u2019re making now and that we\u2019ve made over the last couple of years will produce the revenues that we expect in that time horizon. But, a lot of what we\u2019re doing is not of that nature. And in some sense, those are actually the most important investments because they\u2019re the hardest decisions to make.\nJamie Dimon: And some are very basic. Opening 400 branches, $800 million a year, obviously, the payback comes over time, adding thousand of sales people kind of know pretty much what the payback is, but obviously, it comes over time. And so it\u2019s a whole mix. And just think about it as expenses you should expect to go up a little bit in 2023.\nJim Mitchell: All right. That\u2019s helpful. And then, just a follow-up on -- just on the NII. I think futures markets are now pricing in four hikes. I think you have three in your assumptions. If we do get a four hikes starting in March, is that a material change to the NII outlook for this year in your models?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. So, if you look at the bottom left-hand side of page 16, footnote 3, an extremely small print, you will note that the implied curve that we use is from January 5th. So, you can take that curve and whatever the current curve is and use the table on the bottom right and add a long list of caveat that I won\u2019t give you and draw your own conclusions. But I mean, it should be a modest increase, modest additional tailwind, very modest. While we wait for the next question, I said something inaccurate before. I realized I wasn\u2019t that confident when I said that. The $40 billion standardized RWA increase in SA-CCR, if you do the math, is obviously not 10 basis points of CET1. It\u2019s 30 basis points of CET1. So, correction coming through there.\nOperator: We have a question from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. So, a couple of questions. First, on the NII outlook. Could you give us a sense as to what\u2019s embedded in that with regard to your thoughts on how balance sheet shrinkage at the Fed, right, the QT is going to impact the liquidity pool? And then, how much of that liquidity pool you currently are assuming is going to get redeployed into more duration in your forward look?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, sure. So, I mean, I forget exactly what the market is assuming about the start of QT at this point, QT2 as they\u2019re now calling it. But from us, I look closely, there was expected to be a pretty long lag between sort of the end of the hiking cycle and the beginning of QT2. Maybe people are now starting to accelerate that. But in any case, the important point is that as a result of the acceleration of tapering, the amount of balance sheet growth is ending pretty quickly. And therefore, the impact on system-wide deposit growth should be quite modest this year. And that -- and our assumptions are consistent with that. In other words, we\u2019re not assuming lots of deposit growth next year because ultimately that\u2019s going to be primarily a function of the Fed balance sheet size. But obviously, we are still assuming modest growth rather than reduction as a function of QT, if you know what I\u2019m saying. And so, then, in terms of deployment, you can see in the supplement that we already did some deployment this quarter. It was primarily in the front of the curve. So, we\u2019re still being quite cautious about really buying duration. And if you look at again page 16, you noticed that we call out securities deployment as a modest driver of that $4 billion increase that\u2019s tied as balance sheet growth and mix. So, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that we might be -- we might do a little bit of duration buying if the rate curve develops as the forwards predict, but it shouldn\u2019t be too dramatic.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. Thanks. And then, my second question is just on the investments, the $3.5 billion that you\u2019ve got incremental here. And I assume that this is built up, bottoms off from business unit leaders\u2019 requests to do everything that you mentioned in the call. And my question here is what percentage roughly like just got numbers, but what percentage are you giving them this year? In other words, do they ask for 7, you\u2019re giving them 3.5 and we should expect another uptick materially in 2023? I know, Jamie, you mentioned 77 is a run rate that we should grow from next year. But I\u2019m kind of asking a slightly different question, which is how much of what they need are you giving them this year? And a subset question is, at what point -- does this fully fund your ability to get into the cloud for U.S. consumer?\nJamie Dimon: I answer that question. We do not sit at the table and tell people you can only do X. We sit at a table and ask people what do you want to do? So, think of it\u2019s 100% within our capability because some things you just simply can\u2019t do. You can\u2019t attack 14 funds at the same time or something like that. And that\u2019s number one. So, we want to make those kind of investments. Each one goes through kind of rigorous process as is necessary. Some of them are table stakes. I do remember sitting around the table one day and people talking about digital account opening and do NPV. I was like just don\u2019t do an NPV. Just get it done. That\u2019s just serving your client properly and stuff like that. And so -- and like as I said, a lot -- I mean, Jeremy mentioned it\u2019s 400 branch in the United States. It\u2019s 13 sites overseas. It\u2019s more countries, more products. It\u2019s all the things we should be doing that you\u2019d want to do if you owned 100% of the Company. So, it may not be what you do if you have to meet NII next quarter of X, Y or Z or something like that. And the second part of your question wasn\u2019t that, it was -- the consumer digital and stuff like that. We\u2019re not going to start giving you real numbers and all that, but that is a march. That\u2019s a journey, and it\u2019s hard. And we want to get there as soon as possible. Pieces and pockets have already gotten there. So certain applications and certain datasets already running on the private cloud, somewhere in the public cloud, some parts of the company ahead of other parts of the companies, that\u2019s a lot of work. And there is -- you guys have pointed a little bit call it bubbles expression there. We\u2019re not going to disclose that either because then we just got a doctor closing 84 other bubble expenses. Those are our responsibility. And to the extent we have opportunities to do more, we will do more. We have extraordinary capability. And I think I also want to point out, Jeremy, you mentioned the assumptions around capital. I mean, SLR, G-SIFI, and most of these other companies should be recalibrated, okay? Even the regular these things should be recalibrated for the global side, the global economy. If you put capital against treasuries and capital Fed deposits and let\u2019s see what happens. So, we -- on that, we\u2019re kind of conservative. We\u2019re not going to be expecting a lot of relief. But, even some of the folks yesterday we mentioned that were being questioned Fed prospects were being questioned about SLR and acknowledge that there are issues around SLR that are not good for the markets.\nJeremy Barnum: And Betsy, the only thing I want to add to that, which I was going to basically say the same thing, this whole like ask for 10 and hope to get 5. I mean, we would -- we aim to manage the Company much better than that. So, I certainly don\u2019t have that type of authority. That\u2019s not the way it works. And I think the important point is that what actually happens is a ton of scrutiny of the investment agenda, two or three levels down in the organization with a lot of discipline there. So that\u2019s where the conversations happen about whether this makes sense to do now, whether it\u2019s the right priority now, whether we have the capacity to do it, whether in the case of where the returns are measurable, where it\u2019s producing the right returns. And that\u2019s really part of how we operate the Company and part of the discipline of the day to day.\nJamie Dimon: I\u2019d like to give you another example. If we can spend $2 billion more and get to the cloud tomorrow, I would do that in a second.\nBetsy Graseck: But, the step function that we see this year -- I mean, given the pace of competition and the impact of everything that\u2019s going on, it\u2019s possible we could see this type of step function again.\nJamie Dimon: It\u2019s possible. But if it happens, it will be for a good reason. And I read about the competition, the global competition, the nonbank competition, direct fiber lending competition, there\u2019s Jane Street [ph] competition, the [indiscernible] competition, there\u2019s fintech competition, there\u2019s PayPal competition, there\u2019s direct competition, it\u2019s a lot of competition, and we intend to win. And sometimes you guys spend a few bucks.\nBetsy Graseck: All right. I got it. Thanks.\nJamie Dimon: And I want to emphasize, too, embedded upon that, as we\u2019ve always said, we\u2019re going to -- we want to be very, very competitive and pay. There\u2019s a $1 billion in merit increase. There\u2019s a lot more compensation for our top bankers and traders and managers who actually say, by the way, did an extraordinary job in the last couple of years delivering this stuff. And we will be competitive and pay. And that squeezes margin a little bit for shareholders, so be it.\nOperator: Next up, we have Steve Chubak from Wolfe Research.\nSteve Chubak: So, I want to start off with a question on capital. Carlos highlighted in his one-song speech, the potential for Basel IV implementation, increasing capital requirements as much as 20% for select banks. While we haven\u2019t seen a formal proposal from the Fed, I was just hoping you could provide just some preliminary thoughts how you\u2019re handicapping the risk of higher RWA inflation ahead of Basel IV adoption? And to what extent is that contemplated in the updated ROTCE guidance?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. So Steve...\nJamie Dimon: Don\u2019t give too much...\nJeremy Barnum: This is fine. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable question. So, okay. So, here you go. So, when you look at the current state of the so-called Basel III endgame or Basel IV proposals, and you look at the RWA components of them in isolation, you\u2019ve got the change in the credit conversion factors, which all else equal is a tailwind. You\u2019ve got the fundamental review of the trading book, which is quite complicated and it\u2019s going to depend institution by institution, but it\u2019s potentially for some folks a headwind. And then, you\u2019ve got the introduction of operational risk capital into standardized RWA. And if you look at sort of central case estimates of all those things in a simple way, you will conclude that there\u2019s a bunch of RWA inflation. But, a couple of things. First, there\u2019s all things plays in the context of the global regulatory community or at least in the U.S. saying that the system has enough capital. And it doesn\u2019t actually need more capital. And it\u2019s important to realize\u2026\nJamie Dimon: Which by the way, anyone does any real analysis at all would come to that conclusion.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. And so, it is important to realize, Steve, that as you know, obviously, there are additional tools. So the most important one of which is how standardized output floors interact with the introduction of operational risk capital into standardized RWA, and then in turn, how that interacts potentially with the Collins Floor as well as more generally the fact that there are opportunities to tweak, potential double counting and the stress capital buffer against FRTB and so on and so forth. So, the point of all this is that there are more levers and tools here than just the overall RWA inflation. And the way we see the world, we don\u2019t expect the Basel III endgame in and of itself to increase the dollars of capital that we need to carry as a company.\nJamie Dimon: And you were conservative in saying, it\u2019s the 4.5% G-SIFI.\nJeremy Barnum: Exactly. And we are allowing the G-SIFI increases to flow through to the medium-term ROTCE assumptions.\nSteve Chubak: Thanks for clarifying that and for now punting on the topic, Basel IV. Just for my follow-up here...\nJamie Dimon: We will very, very aggressively manage those things when we know the actual numbers, like very aggressively manage them.\nSteve Chubak: Fair enough, Jamie. You certainly have the track record that supports that. Just for my follow-up on card payment normalization. How are you thinking about the trajectory for card payment rates? And just maybe to speak to your confidence level that we see card payment rates return to pre-pandemic levels, just given the emerging threats from BNPL that you cited and still elevated personal savings rates?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, sure. So, I still, to be honest, get a little bit confused between payment rates and revolve rates and all these various ratios. But I think it\u2019s a little bit simpler. If you just take a step back, you look at the revolve rate and you look at the overall level of revolving balances and what we sort of expect for that. So, there\u2019s a few things to note. So, the revolve rate having dropped quite a bit has more or less stabilized. There\u2019s a little bit of a blip in the fourth quarter as a function of holiday spend and maybe some Omicron stuff. But broadly, it\u2019s stabilized. In the meantime, the growth in overall Card loans has now, for several quarters in a row, produced modest growth in revolving card balances. And our central case for next year basically assumes that that trend stays in place. So, what\u2019s important about that is that we\u2019re not assuming some sort of aggressive return of the revolving rate to the pre-pandemic levels. We\u2019re simply assuming that it stabilizes and that overall card loan growth therefore contributes its fair share of revolving loan growth. And so, the kind of central case that we put on the page for the balance sheet contribution to NII growth in 2022 has, very roughly speaking, revolving balances getting back to the pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2022, roughly. And then, sorry, Steve, I think you had another -- was there another part of that question that I forgot?\nSteve Chubak: No, no. That\u2019s sufficient. That\u2019s perfect.\nOperator: Next, we have Matt O\u2019Connor from Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. As we think about the 17% medium-term target, can you help frame what you think or what\u2019s being assumed on the efficiency ratio, and then maybe on credit costs as well, please?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, sure. So, in terms of credit cost, as I said, we\u2019re assuming a roughly normal credit environment at that point. So that would mean card charge-off rates back into the sort of low to mid-3s type of thing. As we said, pre-pandemic, we were assuming we would get to, especially as we underwrite some slightly higher loss vintages over time.\nJamie Dimon: And building reserves as the loan books grow.\nJeremy Barnum: Importantly, Yes, exactly. So, I mean, I would just broadly describe, and consistently with the way we\u2019re describing it, which is kind of medium-term guidance in a normalized environment that the charge-off environment should, in turn, be normal. So, that\u2019s that. And then, you\u2019re kind of asking me, I guess, about the overhead ratio a little bit. So personally, I kind of don\u2019t love that measure. I think it\u2019s more of an output than an input. And more often than not, it\u2019s driven by revenues, not expenses. And more often than not, in the short term, the revenue number that\u2019s swinging is a function of the rate curve. So essentially, the overhead ratio just becomes a proxy for the Fed funds rate, which makes it not a great management tool for the company. But having said that, in the assumptions that we\u2019re using to build up that 17% rate, we do get back to something like a 55% overhead ratio. But, as Jamie said before, if that number has to go up to deliver the right returns in the long term, it will, like we don\u2019t consider it to be a constraint.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Then obviously, the math implies to get back to 55%, you have kind of outside operating leverage for a few years, right? I mean because I think the efficiency ratio goes the wrong way again in \u201822 for the couple of years of pretty big operating leverage, right?\nJamie Dimon: You\u2019ve got to do your own models, okay?\nJeremy Barnum: In a world where there are inflationary pressures, there\u2019s a lot of post-pandemic effects in the numbers, and we have some critical investments to make. The notion of operating leverage at the level of the Company\u2019s overall numbers for me becomes just not terribly meaningful. I\u2019m not criticizing your question. I understand what you\u2019re asking, but is this kind of another way you think about it.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And I was just curious, Jamie, if you\u2019re mentioning -- still think grow more than expected. Obviously, expectations have moved up quite a bit. And I\u2019m just wondering kind of what\u2019s basing that opinion. And on a side bar, do you think the long end will go up or if it hasn\u2019t gone up yet, why will it from here? Thanks.\nJamie Dimon: Well, first of all, we prepare for all eventualities here. We\u2019re not kind of guessing at one. But the consumer is very strong. And with respect to the fact that people suffering still and COVID and all that, the fact is despite of Omicron, in spite of supply chains, 2021 was one of the best growth years ever. And 2022, it looks like it either be 3.5% or 4%, which is actually pretty good. The consumer is $2 trillion more in their balance sheet, their home prices are up, asset prices are up, jobs are plentiful, wages are going up, which is good for them. We\u2019re not against that, and sharing the wealth a little bit of Americas recovery with everybody. So, the consumer is in really good shape. The spending, I mean, Jeremy took you through the numbers, 25% more than they spent in pre-COVID. 25% more. And that number drives all the order books for everybody else, whether it\u2019s goods and services and obviously, it\u2019s bouncing around between goods and service dollar, kind of stuff like that. Businesses equally are in very good shape with cash and capability and confidence levels are high. What are they seeing? They\u2019re seeing their order books go up, more cars, more motors, more patios, more home improvements, more homes, more demand. We have a shortage of homes in America. So, you see the table is set pretty well with -- for the growth -- with obviously the negative being inflation and how that gets navigated and stuff like that. So, my view is a pretty good chance there\u2019ll be more than 4. It could be 6 or 7. I mean, I grew up in a world where you -- Paul Volcker raised interest 200 basis points on a Saturday night. And this whole notion that somehow it\u2019s going to be sweet and gentle and no one is ever going to be surprised. I think it\u2019s a mistake. That does not mean we won\u2019t have growth. It does not mean unemployment -- in a good position and stuff like that. And the other fact is, it may very well be possible that they\u2019re loan rates -- and I\u2019m a little surprised how low they stay. But the loan rates may react more to the actual QE and then QT. And so, at one point, the Fed is going to be letting run off $100 billion or whatever number a month they\u2019re going to come up with. And then you may see loan rates react a little bit to that. And particularly, I just said about growth and demand for capital and stuff like that, that also tends to drive 10-year bond rates and all that. So, all things being equal. If you look at the company, and it\u2019s very important, we have huge firepower to grow, to expand, to make loans to extend duration and you look at capital liquidity, I just want to point out, it\u2019s $1.7 trillion -- these numbers I\u2019ve never seen the bank with them. And you look at percentages, not just gross amounts, $1.7 trillion in cash and marketable securities, $1 trillion of loans, okay? There\u2019s $500 billion or $600 billion of those cash and marketable securities that could be deployed in higher-yielding assets or loans when and if the time comes depending on all these capital constraints and stuff like that we have to deal with. And those are extraordinary numbers. It\u2019s $2.5 trillion deposits. And we don\u2019t like taking risky deposits. Those are -- they may go down a little bit in QT and all that. But look at how this balance sheet is funded. I\u2019ve never seen a bank balance sheet like that. And that\u2019s -- think of that as kind of firepower over time as we navigate through the world. And so, we\u2019re in pretty good shape. And if -- I wish I could own 100% of the company and be private.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Can I just sneak in, based on all that, I was thinking, like the expense pressure or increase that we\u2019re seeing at JPMorgan or expect to see in \u201822, do you think this is indicative of the broader market as you talk to leaders outside of banks and they see the pipeline of volumes, do you think there\u2019s going to be material surprises on expenses for the broader market?\nJamie Dimon: Yes, I would expect that because almost every CEO is talking about wages and certain inflation and stuff like that. But I just -- I don\u2019t want to be -- please don\u2019t say I\u2019m complaining about wages. I think wages going up is a good thing for the people who have the wages going up. And businesses simply have to deal with changes in prices. So, if you -- commodity prices go up and down, mozzarella goes up and down, wages go up and down. They shouldn\u2019t be cried babies about. They just deal with it. The job is to serve your client as best you can with all the other factors out there. So I\u2019m not opposed to it. But I do think you\u2019ll see more people seeing wage pressure, et cetera, and some have more ability to offset it than others. It hasn\u2019t stopped us from doing anything, zero, none, nada. We\u2019re not cutting back in growth plans or bankers or markets or countries because there was some wage inflation.\nOperator: Next, we have a question from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Good morning. Just two very quick follow-ups. One, Jeremy, in terms of capital deployment. Just talk to us about inorganic growth. Is there any likelihood that you look at any larger M&A transactions, use your currency at any point this year? And should we see a slowdown or a let up in the pace of inorganic fintech investments that you\u2019ve been on over the last year, if you could address those two?\nJamie Dimon: So, the large transactions like over billions unlikely. But we always look. We\u2019re always open mind. We\u2019re looking all over the place for things that fit in and stuff like that. And then the pace of fintech investors, stuff like that, that won\u2019t change at all.\nJeremy Barnum: My version of that, which is consistent with Jamie\u2019s is that we continue to be interested in looking at M&A, and we\u2019re doing that. Obviously, yes, very large deals aren\u2019t realistic. And the fintech investment part is definitely part of the stuff that we\u2019re looking at when we look at deals.\nEbrahim Poonawala: That\u2019s helpful. And just double-clicking on something, Jamie, that you mentioned. You\u2019ve talked about when more square banks leaving the ground open for fintechs over the last few years. Just talk to us, to the extent you can, how these investments -- clearly the market\u2019s focused on near-term expenses, ROTCE pressures. But talk to us two years or three years fast forward, how do you feel about JPM as a franchise competing with bigtech, fintech head-to-head?\nJamie Dimon: Great. But it\u2019s battle and gate. I mean, some of these people do a very good job. I think there are some things we, your bank should have done, so we should be a little self-critical. But we have the capability, the economies of scale and all these things. What we\u2019re not going to do is hamstring ourselves to meet an overhead target. That\u2019s just not even on the card. And we have assets and strengths. Look, the competition is very bright. I mean, they\u2019re bobbing and weaving. They\u2019re not changing, and they\u2019re not static. And I think sometimes few act like they\u2019re static and they\u2019re not static. But if we do a good job, like today, on consumer, I\u2019m sure some you Chase customers, free trading, a lot of ATMs, you\u2019ve got better and better services, more navigation bars, more offers, more travel, more rewards, more -- and you got more of that coming. And we\u2019ve gotten friendlier an overdraft. We\u2019ve gotten -- that\u2019s just one business. That\u2019s true for every single business. So, I look at middle way around JPMorgan, that\u2019s going be pretty tough competition. Like take Chase UK. We\u2019ve been very, very clear that costs us money, and a lot of you want to pay back tomorrow and stuff like that, we\u2019re not going to disclose those numbers, but we are there for the long run. We\u2019re going to be adding products and services and countries for the rest of our lives, okay? So, I doubt, over the long run, we\u2019ll fail. We may not do -- we may not become the best digital bank in the UK or somewhere in the short run.\nOperator: Next, we have Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities.\nMike Mayo: Hi. Jamie, I hear that you\u2019re ready to do an LBO on JPMorgan that you\u2019re so confident.\nJamie Dimon: Yes. I think you\u2019d help me raise the equity capital.\nMike Mayo: Well, that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to figure out here with -- it\u2019s a little frustrating this call because the guidance you\u2019ve given has given all the bad news without any targets. I mean, you\u2019re saying we have to wait two years for the 17% ROTCE, despite the booming economy. You\u2019re guiding for the second year in a row of negative operating leverage. I get it. That\u2019s not how you run the company. But $15 billion of investments, that\u2019s up one-half over last three years. And that $15 billion is enough to capitalize the 11th largest U.S. bank. So, you gave us that, but you didn\u2019t tell us what to expect from all those investments in terms of what specific market share gains are you targeting, what specific revenues do you expect, when do you expect that? Can you put some more meat on the bone here because this is -- at $5 billion of investment spend, look, it worked. You gained share. At $10 billion of investment spend, it worked. You gained share. But now you\u2019re going to $15 billion. It might not always work so well. So, can you, again, put more meat on the bones? The stock is down 5%. The feedback so far is like you\u2019re spending the rate hikes for investments over the next 10 years. That\u2019s great. You\u2019re in there for the long term, but a lot of the investors aren\u2019t planning to invest for a 10-year horizon.\nJamie Dimon: Michael, I feel your pain and frustration. It is very possible in 2023, we\u2019ll have a 17% ROTCE. It depends on how we deploy our capital. It depends on fixed income markets. It depends on a bunch of stuff like that. But every -- but the 400 branches that we\u2019re building, those things will get to contribution profitability just like we expect. The thousand bankers we\u2019re adding in private banking, and Chase Wealth Management, we\u2019re pretty sure we\u2019ll get to breakeven but just we expect that takes a couple of years. And so yes, we can\u2019t -- we\u2019re not going to tell you all of those things. And we already mentioned some of the tech stuff is just kind of we have to do it, and there\u2019s a little bit of bubble expense in that. There\u2019s even a little bit of bubble expense on new headquarters. And so, we\u2019re pretty comfortable we\u2019re doing the right things. And we\u2019re being a little conservative. Like Jeremy was talking about the card stuff, the return, I told our folks that we\u2019re going to -- our card growth this year, but they were skeptical. The American consumer is very strong. Our products and services are very good. Chase, we call now self-directed investing has $55 billion. I think Robinhood has, I think, 80, the last time I saw, something like that. We\u2019re not seeing your -- bragging about our product because I would say it\u2019s not good enough yet. But it\u2019s got $55 billion without us doing virtually anything and or no marketing and no real stuff like that. So, there\u2019s a lot of stuff coming. The competition, we have to face. Some of these acquisitions we made will contribute to profit, maybe not exactly in 2022. But -- and I mentioned the deployment of the balance sheet. We\u2019re pretty conservative in deploying the balance sheet. That may not always be true.\nMike Mayo: I\u2019ll follow up and then I\u2019ll requeue after my follow-up. But as it relates to technology specifically, Jeremy, you talked about retiring technical debt. And so, that\u2019s kind of playing defense, but also on the offensive side, where are you investing for tech where you would expect some more revenues? You talked about digital banking in the UK? Are you also going to Brazil? What other countries are you targeting for that?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. I mean -- it\u2019s funny. I wouldn\u2019t actually describe retiring technical debt as playing defense. I mean, I think that\u2019s actually a great example of the whole point of this conversation, which is that retiring technical debt is an easy thing to not do if you\u2019re playing defense focused on short-term targets. But if you\u2019re playing offense for the long term, it\u2019s exactly this type of decision that creates some of the frustration that you\u2019re articulating that\u2019s critical for the long-term success of the country -- the Company. So that\u2019s\u2026\nJamie Dimon: So, we spent $2 billion on brand-new data centers, okay, which have all the cloud capability you can have in private data centers and stuff like that. We\u2019re still running the old data centers. Now, we\u2019re not going to get involved in every time you talk, I\u2019ll explain every part of the pain cake buildup of expenses going in and expenses going out. But all this stuff going to these new data centers, which is now completely up and running are -- well, some are, but most of the applications that go in have to be cloud eligible. Most of the data that goes in has to be cloud eligible. We\u2019re running a whole bunch of major programs, which I don\u2019t think we disclosed on AWS. And we\u2019re working with Google and Microsoft to run some of the stuff into cloud, so we want to have multiple cloud capabilities. And this year, roughly 30%, 40%, 50% of all our apps and all data will be moving to cloud-related type of stuff. This stuff is absolutely totally valuable. I mean, I can\u2019t -- if you sat in this room and look at the power of the cloud and big data on risk, fraud, marketing, capabilities, offers, customer satisfaction, dealing with errors and complaints, prospecting, it\u2019s extraordinary. You actually see some of that already in how we manage stuff. Like, for example, with all the fraud and all the cyber and all the ransomware, our fraud calls are down this year. There\u2019s a reason for that. It\u2019s because we\u2019ve deployed huge capabilities in those things. So, we have to do those things. And that\u2019s a margin that will be hugely valuable for us. And you\u2019ll see some of that benefit, which is why we\u2019re comfortable that we\u2019ll continue to grow and expand and earn. Like I said, with 17% return on tangible capital, I would take that. If I could push a button and give you that the next 20 years, I would take it. And also, if I did it for the next 20 years, that number would probably be like a big part of the GDP of the United States of America.\nMike Mayo: Okay. I\u2019ll requeue for my follow-up.\nJamie Dimon: Mike asked another very good question market shares. We expect to go up in retail deposit market share, investment market share, private banking market share, fixed income market share, equity market share, investment banking market share, global market share, payments market share and security services market share, commercial banking market share, and what did I miss? I\u2019d be surprised if any of them go down. And we\u2019re not going to give you the number.\nOperator: As per now, we have one last question from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets.\nGerard Cassidy: Jeremy, I\u2019m trying to figure out what the discussion topic is going to be first quarter of 2023 when we talk about fourth quarter numbers. And I think it might have more to do with credit than we\u2019re hearing about on the call today. Can you share with us the underwriting standards that you guys are using compared to what they were at the height of the crisis back in 2020? I\u2019m assuming they\u2019re easier today because the economy is stronger. But also, can you compare them to 2019? How does it look today versus what you guys were doing in 2019?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, sure. So I think broadly for the company, there\u2019s no really large change in our credit risk appetite, and therefore, in our underwriting standards. I think I alluded a little bit to this earlier, which is there\u2019s a subtlety in the card business, where if you remember, pre-pandemic, we had talked about card charge-off rates being at 3.25% and maybe trending a little bit higher over time as a function of some underwriting of some slightly higher risk vintages, still well within our credit box, still within our overall credit risk appetite, but just a slight shift in the composition of the portfolio there. So, that happened back then, and we just didn\u2019t see it flow through because of obviously the extraordinary dynamics that we\u2019ve experienced with pandemic. And now, we\u2019re exiting the fourth quarter of this year with a card net charge-off rate. And I forget the exact number, something like 1.2% or something, so.\nJamie Dimon: So, we can never see\u2026\nJeremy Barnum: Obviously exceptionally well. So, the question then becomes like -- and then I think somewhere in your question there was also about like when we sort of leaned into the reopening, how did we modify the credit box and standards. And the answer to that is that we returned it essentially to the pre-pandemic level. So we were obviously very confident in light of what we were seeing about what credit conditions were.\nJamie Dimon: It got tied a little bit, and now it\u2019s back to where it was...\nJeremy Barnum: Exactly.\nJamie Dimon: None of that was completely material to the results. But one of the things in Jeremy\u2019s slide that you point, we\u2019ve been over earning on credit for years. And we expect that eventually to normalize. You could argue how fast and what time, but credit card has been a number that you\u2019ve never seen in our lives. Middle market has been lower than ever. Other sales have been lower than ever. Mortgages have been lower than ever cards. They\u2019re all low. Eventually, they\u2019re going to normalize. And then we kind of build that out. And the other thing is the loan book, and this is very important for your own modeling. Just assume as the loan book grows, we will add reserves pretty much proportionate to the growth in the loan book, all things being equal. We\u2019ve got CECL and all this stuff like that. So, there\u2019s -- that\u2019s a flip to the negative, obviously, for next year, one item.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. And so, Gerard, to your point about the fourth quarter of next year, right? I mean, one lens to look at that through is what do we think the trajectory of normalization of card net charge-offs is through the course of 2022. And I don\u2019t want to get into too much specific guidance there, but the numbers that we\u2019re putting on the page roughly assume that we get back to that kind of like low-3s around the end of 2022 or early \u201823 in terms of card net charge-offs. So yes, on the one hand, maybe we\u2019ll be talking a lot about the fact that those numbers are going up, but they will have actually gone up exactly in line with our expectations.\nGerard Cassidy: Great. And just as a quick follow-up, Jamie, and Jeremy, you talked about the balance sheet, the way it is today and all that liquidity. And I think, Jamie, you said $500 billion could be put to use. How long will you guys -- will it take you to get to a balance sheet and a mix of business that looks like you would have thought back in 2019 before this whole pandemic started and the balance sheet did what it did?\nJamie Dimon: I think, we\u2019re in a -- again, some of those things are outcomes of decisions you make based on client stuff. But the real fact is we got Basel IV, a lot of changes. And when all that happens, we\u2019ll give you a little bit better update how we\u2019re going to deploy capital and invest the balance sheet and stuff like that. But we\u2019re in no rush to reinvest part of that balance sheet. We\u2019ll be very patient.\nOperator: Mike Mayo had another question.\nMike Mayo: Just more detail on the tech spend. And what I asked before was on digital banking, you\u2019re going to the UK. What other countries are you going to? Again, just looking for some more specifics, at least on digital banking and other tech areas where you expect revenue pickup, not just -- you mentioned fraud and AML and ransomware and cyber, and that\u2019s all -- that\u2019s table stakes, as you would say. But as far as actually getting revenue growth from your tech investments, and starting off with digital banking, which new markets are you entering?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. So, on digital banking, we\u2019re not going to disclose specific countries that we\u2019re going into, one.\nJamie Dimon: There isn\u2019t one we\u2019re talking about for next year.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. I mean I think just to validate Mike\u2019s question, as you know, we have made this investment in C6 in Brazil. So Brazil, it\u2019s not exactly the same. It\u2019s not a de novo build by us, but we\u2019re there. We\u2019re engaged. It\u2019s a significant investment. And Brazil is like a very interesting country from a consumer banking perspective and the digital play there is quite interesting. So, that\u2019s one example. And obviously, we\u2019re thinking about additional places to go, and we\u2019ll let you know when we do it.\nMike Mayo: Okay. And the other tech investments where you could expect additional revenues, what would that include? I mean, for example, with your marketing and the degree you\u2019re using AI and big data for what kind of improved take rates do you have or just again, looking for more specifics where you can provide it?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. I mean, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m personally not a big fan of these types of like anecdotal individual like tech stories. I mean, there\u2019s cool stuff, like we\u2019re doing some AI-enabled lead optimization stuff in AWM, for example. So I could come up with a list of like 20 things like that. But in reality, it\u2019s really much more about the embedding of the modernization and the digitization of the whole ecosystem as part of customer engagement and competition and making the company more efficient and all that type of stuff. Examples where it\u2019s like I spent $10 million on X that\u2019s technology as opposed to like branch build or banker hiring, as Jamie says, and you can then attach a tangible revenue outcome to that. I\u2019m sure we have some of those examples somewhere. I don\u2019t have them with me. Maybe we can talk about them next quarter. But I generally think that that sort of gets into a lot of anecdotal stuff that distracts from the big picture.\nMike Mayo: Okay. Last one. On the -- what is your total tech spend, again? I thought I saw in the deck. How much of that is to run the bank versus change the bank? And then as it relates to the cloud specifically, what do you expect -- that\u2019s a bold move to move Chase, the core bank to the cloud. What do you expect that to save once that gets done?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. So, a couple of things. If you go back to my prepared remarks, so it\u2019s like $12-ish billion, a bit more, 50-50, run the bank, change the bank. And within the change agenda, half again is kind of modernization-type stuff as opposed to features and products. So, it gives you a little bit of a...\nJamie Dimon: Hey, Mike. I\u2019m going to give you one example, which may be a little helpful on this tech platform thing. I think, these numbers are accurate -- we did this a while ago. Card runs a mainframe -- which is quite good. We have one of the most efficient, most economic, 60 million accounts, et cetera, it\u2019s been updated for years, but it\u2019s a mainframe system in the old data center. When it gets modernized to the cloud, the cost savings by running that and marginalizing it will be $30 million or $40 million a year. That isn\u2019t the reason we\u2019re doing it. The reason we\u2019re doing it is once you get that to the cloud that the database is that it uses to feed, its risk, marketing, fraud, real-time offers and stuff like that become accessible to enormous machine learning. So that you can -- when Mike Mayo is going home on a Friday night, we can offer you -- we know what you like to eat, steakhouse, you eat here, immediately offers and fraud stuff is 10 times what it is today. And so that\u2019s the real value. The value isn\u2019t the immediate cost save that you\u2019ve gone from -- you\u2019re saving $30 million running this application. I want the $30 million. And the other thing that allows you to do is to augment that mainframe system. You touch a mainframe system, you\u2019ve got to be a little careful when you go into it, make some modifications. So, like in the old days, you used to modify that mainframe system 4 times a year, big releases and stuff like that, of course, multiple -- for multiple reasons. Now you can go in and modernize a little piece of it every week, every day. And so, that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to do this. And it also makes is hard to quantify the benefits and the cost.\nJeremy Barnum: But Mike, just a big one example, I guess, from a business that I know you know well. If you look at Teresa\u2019s Securities Services business, it\u2019s an interesting example of the way the investment relates to the strategy. So, in that business, as you know, historically, winning new mandates, especially on services administration tended to involve significant correlated large increases in expense as you had to onboard a lot of fund accountants. And so, that was typically the dynamic there. And I think a lot of the investment that we\u2019re making there is to make that business a little bit more scalable in that respect so that when we win new business, it\u2019s a little bit more accretive. So, that\u2019s kind of an interesting example of is that tech investment that produces more revenue? I mean, I guess. I would describe it as investment that means that when we win the revenue, it\u2019s more profitable, for example. At the same time, we\u2019re also building out some really great capabilities in there in terms of data and stuff like that, which maybe will help us win more mandates.\nJamie Dimon: I know we got to end this call because we\u2019ve got some of the stuff we got to do. Just for example, is an important one, and Teresa, there\u2019s all the credit for this. We now are using JPMorgan\u2019s investment banking derivative capability to help clients use derivatives for custody to value them and stuff like that. A lot of people simply can\u2019t do that. And of course, believe it or not, a lot of portfolios now, they\u2019re using more and more what you and I call derivatives as part of the portfolio management. That costs time. It costs money. It\u2019s on the cloud. It\u2019s hugely valuable to Teresa having a competitive advantage. Folks, thank you very much for taking some time with us. Good luck to everybody.\nOperator: That marks the end of your call for today. You may now disconnect. Thank you for joining. Enjoy the rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeremy Barnum",
            "content": "Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. It's slightly longer this quarter to cover both our fourth quarter and full year results, as well as spend some time talking about the outlook for next year. Starting with the fourth quarter on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $10.4 billion, EPS of $3.33 on revenue of $30.3 billion, and delivered an ROTCE of 19%. These results included a $1.8 billion net credit reserve release, which I'll cover in more detail shortly. Adjusting for this, we delivered a 17% ROTCE this quarter. Touching on a few highlights, as we suggested last quarter, we have started to see a pickup in loan growth, 8% year-on-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter ex-PPP, with a significant portion of this growth coming from AWM and Markets. But we're also seeing positive indicators in card, as well as increasing revolver utilization and C&I. And it was an exceptionally strong quarter for Investment Banking, particularly M&A, as well as another good quarter in AWM. On page 2, we have some more detail on the fourth quarter. Revenue of $30.3 billion was up 1% year-on-year. Net interest income was up 3%, primarily driven by balance sheet growth, partially offset by lower CIB Markets NII, and NIR was down 1%, largely driven by normalization in CIB Markets and lower production revenue in home lending, mostly offset by higher IB fees on strong advisory. You'll notice that we've added some memo lines to this page this quarter to show NII and NIR, excluding Markets, as well as the third line of standalone Markets total revenue, which as we said before, is more consistent with the way we run the Company. We'll be keeping this format going forward and you'll see later that this is how we will talk about the outlook. If you look at things on this basis, the drivers are the same, but the numbers are a little different. NII, excluding Markets, is up 4%; NIR, excluding Markets, is up 3%; and Markets is down 11% on normalization. Expenses of $17.9 billion were up $1.8 billion or 11%, largely on higher compensation and credit costs were a net benefit of $1.3 billion, reflecting reserve releases. Looking at the full year results on page 3, the Firm reported net income of $48.3 billion, EPS of $15.36, and record revenue of $125.3 billion. We delivered a return on tangible common equity of 23% or 18%, excluding the reserve releases. And then, onto reserves on page 4. We released $1.8 billion this quarter, reflecting a more balanced outlook due to the continued resilience in the macroeconomic environment. Our outlook remains constructive, but our reserve balances still account for various sources of uncertainty and potential downside as a result of the remaining abnormal features of the economic environment. On the balance sheet and capital on page 5, we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13%, up slightly, and reflecting nearly $5 billion of capital distributions to shareholders, including $1.9 billion of net repurchases. With that, let's go to our businesses, starting with consumer and community banking on page 6. CCB reported net income of $4.2 billion, including reserves releases of $1.6 billion. Revenue of $12.3 billion was down 4% year-on-year and reflects lower production margins in home lending and higher acquisition costs in card, partially offset by higher asset management fees in consumer and business banking. Many of the key balance sheet drivers are in line with the prior quarter. Deposits were up 20% year-on-year and 4%, sequentially, and client investment assets were up 22% year-on-year, about evenly split between market performance and flows. Combined credit and debit spend was up 27% versus the fourth quarter of \u201819 with each quarter in 2021 showing sequential growth compared to 2019. Within that, travel and entertainment spend was up 13% versus 4Q \u201819, but we have seen some softening in recent weeks contemporaneously with the Omicron wave. Card outstandings were up 5% year-on-year, but remain down 8% versus 4Q \u201819. However, it's promising to see that while revolving balances bottomed in May of 2021, since then, they've kept pace with 2019 growth rates. In home lending, loans were down 1% year-on-year, but up 1% quarter-on-quarter as prepayments have slowed. And it was another strong quarter for originations, totaling $42.2 billion, up 30% year-on-year. In fact, it was the highest fourth quarter since 2012, driven by increase in both purchase and refi volumes. In auto, average loans were up 7% year-on-year and up 1% quarter-on-quarter. After several strong quarters, the lack of vehicle supply resulted in a decline in originations to $8.5 billion, down 23% year-on-year. So overall, loans ex-PPP, were up 2% year-on-year and sequentially, driven by card and auto, and expenses of $7.8 billion were up 10% year-on-year on higher compensation, as well as continued investments in technology and marketing. Next, the CIB on page 7. CIB reported net income of $4.8 billion on revenue of $11.5 billion for the fourth quarter. And for the full year, net income was $21 billion on record revenue of $52 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $3.2 billion was up 28% versus the prior year and up 6% sequentially. IB fees were up 37% year-on-year, primarily driven by a strong performance in advisory. And we maintained our number one rank with a full year wallet share of 9.5%. In advisory, we were up 86% and it was the third consecutive all time record quarter, benefiting from elevated M&A volumes that continued throughout 2021, specifically for midsized deals. Debt underwriting fees were up 14%, driven by an active leverage loan market, primarily linked to acquisition financing. And in equity underwriting, fees were up 12%, primarily driven by our strong performance in IPOs. Moving to Markets, total revenue was $5.3 billion, down 11% against a record fourth quarter last year. Compared to 2019, we were up 7%, driven by a strong performance in equities. Fixed income was down 16% year-on-year, reflecting a more difficult trading environment early in the quarter, especially in rates, as well as continued normalization from the favorable trading performance last year in currencies, emerging markets, credit and commodities. Equity markets were down 2% on $2 billion of revenue, as continued strength in Prime was more than offset by modest weakness in derivatives. For the full year, equities revenue was $10.5 billion, up 22% at an all-time record. It was a particularly strong year for both Investment Banking and Markets. And looking ahead, we do expect some modest normalization of the wallet in 2022. However, for purposes of the first quarter in Investment Banking, the overall pipeline remains quite robust. Payments revenue was $1.8 billion, up 26% year-on-year or up 7% excluding net gains on equity investments. And the year-on-year growth was from higher fees and deposits, largely offset by deposit margin compression. Security services revenue of $1.1 billion was flat year-on-year. Expenses of $5.8 billion were up 18% year-on-year, predominantly due to higher compensation as well as volume related and legal expenses. And credit costs were not benefit of $126 million, driven by the reserve release, I mentioned upfront. Moving to Commercial Banking on page 8. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.3 billion and an ROE of 20%. Revenue of $2.6 billion was up 6% year-on-year on record Investment Banking revenue, driven by continued strength in M&A and acquisition related financing. Expenses of $1.1 billion were up 11% year-on-year, largely due to investments and higher volume and revenue related expenses. Deposits were up 8% sequentially on seasonality. Loans were down 1% year-on-year and up 2% sequentially, excluding PPP. C&I loans were up 4% ex-PPP, primarily driven by higher revolver utilization and originations in middle markets and increased short-term financing and corporate client banking. CRE loans were up 1% with higher new loan originations, offset by net payoff activity. And credit costs were a net benefit of $89 million, driven by reserve releases with net charge-offs of 2 basis points. And then, to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 9. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.1 billion with a pretax margin of 34%. Revenue of $4.5 billion was up 16% year-on-year, as higher management fees and growth in deposits and loans were partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $3 billion were up 9% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher performance related compensation and distribution fees. For the quarter, net long-term term inflows were $34 billion and for the full year were positive across all channels, asset classes and regions, totaling a record of $164 billion. AUM of $3.1 trillion and overall client assets of $4.3 trillion, up 15% and 18% year-on-year, respectively, were driven by strong net inflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 4% quarter-on-quarter with continued strength in custom lending, mortgages and securities-based lending while deposits were up 15% sequentially. Turning to corporate on page 10. Corporate reported a net loss of $1.1 billion. Revenue was a loss of $545 million, down $296 million year-on-year. NII was up $160 million, primarily on higher rates, mostly offset by continued deposit growth. And NIR was down $456 million, primarily due to lower net gains on legacy equity investments. Expenses of $251 million were down $110 million year-on-year. So with that, as we close the books on 2021, we think it's important to take a step back and look at the performance over the last few years through the volatility of the COVID period, and then pivot to discussing the 2022 and medium-term outlook. So, turning to page 11, what stands out is the stability of both revenues and returns through a very volatile period, especially when you strip out the reserve builds and subsequent releases in 2020 and 2021. If you look at the revenue drivers on the bottom left-hand side of the page, you see overall revenue growth with some significant diversification benefits. NII, ex-Markets, was down nearly 20% on the headwinds of lower rates and card revolve that we've discussed throughout the year. This was partially offset by significant NIR growth ex-Markets, largely from higher IB fees and AWM management and performance fees. And we also saw strength across products and regions in CIB Markets, as the extraordinary market environment in 2020 did not normalize as much as we expected in 2021. So, when you look across the Company, we saw consistent modest revenue growth, as well as good performance in the areas that we control, notably, staying in front of our clients to serve them well and managing our risks effectively, resulting in quite stable returns, once again proving the power of the JPMorgan Chase platform. So, turning to the next page. The strong revenue performance and consistent returns have further bolstered our confidence in forging ahead with an investment strategy designed to ensure that we're prepared for the long-term. On the left hand side of the page, you can see the expense drivers from 2019 to 2021. The first bar is structural. And while the growth of 2% is modest over the two-year period, that includes some COVID-related effects that we would see as temporary including, for example, lower T&E spend and elevated employee attrition. And we do expect some catch-up in those effects as we look forward. Then, the middle bar is $3.4 billion of growth in volume and revenue-related expenses. Some significant portion of that is driven by increases in incentive compensation, primarily from Investment Banking, Markets and Asset & Wealth Management, the major areas where we have seen exceptionally strong results and where changes in compensation are more closely linked to changes in performance. And remember, we've seen a lot of market appreciation and strong flows in AWM and CCB. So, don't assume all of this is CIB as you look forward because there are some versions of the world where the markets in fee wallet goes one way and AUM goes the opposite way. And then, this bar also includes volume-related non-comp expenses such as brokerage and distribution fees, some of which are true expenses and some of which are bottom line neutral because they're offset with revenue gross-ups. Then, the last bar of $1.7 billion, as previewed with you this time last year, is a result of our investment agenda, which we've been executing largely according to our plans and consistent with our longstanding priorities. You can see the breakdown of the total investment spend on the right hand side of the page, $9.6 billion growing to $11.3 billion across the categories that we've often discussed. We're continuing to broaden our footprint and expand our distribution network. Then marketing, where the significant increase in spend as part of the reopening in the second half of last year resulted in a full year spend comparable to 2019. And tech, which we've broadened to include tech adjacent spend, reflecting our recognition, the tech means more than just software development and encompasses data and analytics, AI as well as the physical aspects of modernization such as data centers. And what's really powerful to note here is our ability to make these investments, which are quite significant in dollar terms and are designed to secure our future while still delivering excellent current returns. So, over the next few pages, let's double click into some of these investment areas to see what we're doing, starting with examples of marketing and distribution on page 13. We've expanded our reach across the U.S. and are thrilled to be the first bank in all contiguous 48 states, an important milestone in our branch market expansion plans. We also continue to expand internationally, including 13 international markets as part of our Commercial Bank expansion, China in both our CIB and AWM businesses, and in the UK with Chase UK, where we've seen exciting progress since we launched in September, although we expect this to be a multiyear journey before having a measurable impact on the firm overall. We continue to hire bankers and advisors in investment banking, private banking and wealth management, really across all of the wholesale and consumer footprint where we believe we have opportunities to better penetrate geographies and sectors to continue to grow share. And as I just said, the point of our investment strategy is to secure the future of the Company. So, we're not making short-term claims about share outcome causality. But as you can see at the bottom of the page, our market shares are robust and growing broadly across the Company. Turning to page 14. In addition to all of our distribution-related investments, a critical foundational component of our strategy is technology where we spend over $12 billion annually with about half of that being investments or as we sometimes call it, change the bank spend. It's important to understand what's in the investment category. About half of that is foundational and mandatory, which includes regulatory-related investments, modernization and the retirement of technical debt in addition to other key strategic initiatives to help us face the future. On the left hand side, you can see some more detail around this. Modernization, which includes migrations to the cloud as well as upgrading legacy infrastructure and architecture, data strategy that enables us to extract the value that exists in our proprietary data set by cleaning it and staging it in the right ways and then deploying modern techniques against it, attracting and acquiring top talent with modern skills, and a product operating model, which is obviously a popular buzzword these days. But if you look through all that, it reflects the simple reality that the best products get delivered when developers and business owners are working together iteratively with end-to-end ownership. Underpinning all of this is our continued emphasis on cybersecurity to protect the Firm and our clients and customers as well as maintaining a sound control environment. Moving to the right hand side. The other half of the investment spend is to drive innovation across our businesses and with our client-facing products. We believe it's critical to identify and resolve customer pain points and improve the user experience. And we're attacking the problem with a combination of building, partnering and buying. And so, a few examples of that. On the retail side, we've been able to digitalize existing product offerings with applications like Chase MyHome and launch a cloud native digital bank with our recent Chase UK launch. On the wholesale side, we continue to innovate on our Execute trading platform, commercialized blockchain through Onyx and are building out real-time payments capabilities. In addition, our modernization allows us to more efficiently partner with or acquire more digitally centered companies. And you can see several examples of this on the page. So, taken together, our strategy and investments are critical to ensuring that we can compete with the most innovative players out there, whether we're the ones pushing the envelope of innovation or responding quickly to the creativity of our competitors but doing so at scale. With that, let's talk about the outlook and the year ahead, starting on page 15. As you'll remember from Daniel's comments in December, the 17% that we have talked about as a medium-term ROTCE target is not realistic for 2022. We do expect to see some tailwinds to NII, including the benefit of the latest implied and the expectation that card revolve rates will increase. But the headwinds likely exceed the tailwinds as capital markets normalize off an elevated wallet, and we continue to make additional investments as well as the impact of inflationary pressures. However, despite these potential challenges for the near-term outlook, we do continue to believe in 17% ROTCE as our central case for the medium term as rates continue to move higher and we realized business growth, driven by our investments. So, let us try to give you more detail around forward-looking drivers that could be headwinds or tailwinds. So first, the rate curve. Our central case does not require a return to a 2.5% Fed funds target rate as the current forward curve only prices in 625 basis-point hikes over the next three years. Assuming we realize the forward curve, from there, we see the outcomes as being relatively symmetric with plus or minus 175 basis points of ROTCE impact as a reasonable range relative to our central case. And of course, there are obviously any number of rate paths to get there, which could produce different outcomes over the near term. In this illustration, the downside assumes that rates stay relatively constant to current spot rates whereas upside would be driven by a combination of a steeper yield curve, more hikes together with a more favorable deposit reprice experience. And of course, what we are evaluating here is the impact of rates in isolation on NII, but for the performance of the Company as a whole, credit matters a lot. And the reason why rates are higher will have an impact on that. In markets and banking, we feel good about the share we've taken, and there are reasons why the beginning of a rate hiking cycle could be quite healthy for fixed income revenues in particular, at least in the sense that it might provide a partial offset to what we would otherwise expect in terms of post-COVID revenue normalization. In our central case, markets and banking normalized somewhat in 2022 relative to their respective record years in 2020 and 2021, and resume modest growth thereafter. The downside case assumes a return to 2019 trend line levels with sub-GDP growth rates, whereas the upside case assumes continued growth from current elevated levels. As we've been discussing in consumer, the big surprise as we emerge from the worst moment of the pandemic was the lower level of card revolve, even as spend has started to return. In our central case, we assume healthy sales growth from the back of continued economic recovery and strong account acquisitions. And that, combined with relatively constant revolve rates, generates a strong recovery in revolving balances. But there are those who worry about a permanent structural shift in consumer behavior, which could be a source of downside. And in that scenario, revolving balances could stay depressed relative to the long-term pre-pandemic averages, resulting in approximately 50 basis points of downside relative to our central case. Of course, there could be an upside case where revolving balances recover much faster but we believe the risks here are more likely to be skewed to the downside. And then, let's touch on inflation for a second, which is obviously increasingly relevant. On balance, modest inflation that leads to higher rates is good for us. But under some scenarios, elevated inflationary pressures on expenses could more than offset the rates benefit, which could represent around 75 basis points of downside. And while it's not on the page, another key driver is capital, where even though we remain hopeful, our central case assumes no recalibration of the rules and that we will operate at a higher CET1, reflecting that we finished the year in the 4.5% GSIB bucket which equates to a 1% increase from GSIB in the central case. Although as a reminder, that does not become binding until 2024. This is a good opportunity to point out that QE deposit growth and growth of the overall financial system proxy by GDP growth of the factors in the original 2015 rule release combined represent two full GSIB buckets. So, in the absence of those, we would still be in the 3.5% bucket. With that in mind, any recalibration could be a tailwind. And each 1% change in the CET1 level is worth about 150 basis points of ROTCE. And to be clear, for simplicity, we've assumed a normal credit environment in the analysis on the page. So, when we take a step back, 17% remains our central case in the medium term. But over the next one to two years, we expect to earn modestly below that target. In light of all that, let's talk about near-term guidance on page 16. We expect NII, excluding Markets, to be roughly $50 billion in 2022, up approximately $5.5 billion from 2021. As I mentioned upfront, this is a change relative to how we've previously guided as we feel that the ups and downs of Markets' NII can be a distraction when the vast majority of that variation is likely to be bottom line neutral. Looking at the key drivers of that for 2022, there are a few major factors. Rates, with the market implied suggesting approximately three hikes later this year and the reason steepening of the yield curve, we would expect to see about $2.5 billion more NII from that effect. You can see at the bottom right, we've shown you the third quarter earnings at risk and an estimate of what we would expect to disclose in the 10-K, reflecting the year-end rate curve and changes in the portfolio composition. And as we note in our quarterly filings, there are lots of reasons to be careful in trying to use EAR to predict NII changes under real-world conditions. But at a high level, if you look at the numbers on the bottom right and what's happening to the yield curve recently, you should find the $2.5 billion increase relatively intuitive. Then, balance sheet growth and mix, where we are expecting higher spend and new originations to drive revolving balances back to 2019 levels, and also benefiting from securities deployment towards the end of 2021 and into 2022. And partially offsetting both of those factors is the roll-off of PPP. So, while we do expect NII to increase year-on-year, depending on the path of rates, it may take a couple of years to return to the full NII generating capacity of the Company. Turning to page 17. As we said at the outset of this section, we are in for a couple of years of sub-target returns. Despite this, we are going to continue to invest and we're not going to let temporary headwinds distract us from critical strategic ambitions. And so, looking at adjusted expenses, we expect roughly $77 billion in 2022, an increase of about $6 billion year-on-year or 8%. And before we go into the breakdown, it's worth noting, while the year-on-year increase is eye-catching, a meaningful portion of it is actually the annualization of post reopening trends from the second half of 2021 across various categories. So starting with the first bucket on the page, which is the structural expense increase. As I alluded to earlier, we are seeing some catch-up this year, both from the impact of inflation and our compensation expenses as well as higher non-comp expense with the resumption of T&E. Then, volume and revenue-related expenses. Remember that this is both comp and non-comp. From a comp perspective, to the extent we are assuming some normalization of capital markets revenues, there should be a tailwind here. But keep in mind a couple of points. The normalization assumption for Markets and IB fees at this point is pretty modest. And our assumption for AUM is for modest increases. At the same time, we have the impact of volume growth on non-comp, both in wholesale and in consumer, which is offset by lower auto lease depreciation. And most importantly, we are adding another $3.5 billion of investments, which I would note includes the run rate impact of our acquisitions as well as some of the run rate effects that I just mentioned and reflects similar themes to the ones I discussed earlier. As I wrap up, it's another good moment to stop and note how privileged we are to have the financial strength and the earnings generating capacity to absorb these inflationary pressures while also making critical investments to secure the future of the Company. So, in closing, on page 18, we're happy with what we've been able to achieve over the last two years. Not only the business results, some of which are highlighted here on the page, but also continuing to serve our customers, clients and communities, and importantly, executing on our strategic priorities. As we look ahead, we will continue to invest and innovate to build and strengthen this franchise for the long term. And while there may be headwinds in the near term as we continue to work through the consequences of the pandemic, we've never felt better about the Company and our position in this very competitive dynamic landscape. So, with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. Right. Okay. So, three questions in there. Let me take them one at a time. So beta, at the end of the day, the reprice experience is going to be a function of the competitive environment. But for the purposes of working through the guidance, I can tell you that we're assuming that this hiking cycle is going to be generally similar to the prior hiking cycle, all else equal. The environment is a little bit different in some important respects. So, I think the system this time around is flushed with deposits, is flushed with liquidity in a way that it wasn't before. So, that could at the margin make the reprice a little bit slower. On the other hand, the competitive environment is different, especially with some of the neo bank entrants and that could go in the other direction. So, it will be what it will be. But for the purposes of the guidance, we're assuming a reprice experience that's similar to what we experienced in the prior cycle. In terms of deployment, obviously, deployment is going to be a situational decision. But, if you're looking at the $4 billion bar on page 16, securities deployment is a modest contributor to that $4 billion number. The bulk of it is the loan growth narrative, particularly in card. And then, in terms of Markets NII, the whole point of not guiding explicitly to Markets NII is to avoid getting distracted by the noise there, which can come from a lot of really kind of relevant places, like interest rate hikes in Brazil and cash versus future positions, which is the example I'd like to give. But big picture, if you need something for your model or whatever, there's a couple of things we could suggest. So, if you look at the supplement, we've actually been disclosing the Markets NII number for some time in the supplement. So, you actually have a pretty decent time series of that number over time. If you address that thing against the Fed funds rate, you'll actually see that there's a pretty clear negative correlation there. And so, you can draw some conclusions from that. But I just will point out that like in any given moment, relatively small changes to the mix of the Markets balance sheet can really change the NII quite significantly, even in an environment of no policy rate changes. So, it's sort of like a health warning against putting too much emphasis on that projection. Yes. So, let me do the second one first. So in short, yes. So, as I said in the script, we are not assuming any recalibration in that 17% target. So, that does mean 4.5% GSIB in the equity component of that number. In terms of SA-CCR, the impact of SA-CCR adoption was about $40 million of standardized RWA. So, I think if you do the math, that's like 10 basis points of CET1. Yes. So, as you know, John, in terms of share buybacks, that's at the bottom of our capital stack. So, to the extent that we're seeing robust loan growth, other opportunities to invest in the business as well as potential M&A opportunities, those are all going to come ahead of buybacks. And so, I don't want to sort of guide on our buyback plans for next year, which under SCB, as you know, are really quite flexible as a function of the earnings generation outcomes, the capital build. But you can kind of draw your own conclusions in terms of the growth and the minimums that we see in the future as well as the loan growth as well as some of the investments that we're making. And frankly, we're kind of happy about that. That's just -- we want the capital to be used that way rather than being used for buybacks. Yes. So, in terms of the target, I mean, I said previously that 12% was not off the table. And that remains true. Depending on the outcome of the rule side, depending on the Basel III endgame, depending on all the various components, you can see a world where 12% remains the minimum. But as you can see, and as I said in response to Erika a second ago, the 17% target assumes something closer to 13% as a function of the expected increases in GSIB and some other factors. So, we're kind of going to operate in that type of range throughout the year with obviously the flexibility that we have. And then, sorry, you also asked about normalization of markets and IB fees. I mean, I would say, if you'd ask me in the middle of the year, we were talking a little bit about thinking that a reversion to 2019 run rate was a thing that like could happen in theory. The way we feel right now, our central case is obviously that we will see some normalization from exceptionally strong performance, both in IB fees and in Markets. But I think we're expecting that normalization to be a little bit less, like we're near all the way down to the 2019 levels, partially because the banking pipeline is really very robust. We feel good about the kind of organic growth in equities and some of the share gains there. And then in fixed income, we've already seen a decent amount of normalization there actually. And as the monetary policy environment evolves next year, that could actually create some tailwinds for that business. Right. Okay. I think I get your question, Glenn. So, number one, to the extent that we've done some M&A over the last 15 months, as you allude to, and that that has introduced some expenses into the run rate, the run rate impact of that is in the $3.5 billion. It's a relatively modest contribution. On the top of my head, I want to say it's probably like $300 million or something like that. So, it could be a little bit more, depending on some factors. So, that's one point. The other point is that there are different types of investments here. So, if you look at, for example, the change in the marketing expense and the marketing investments that come through marketing expense in card, a lot of the decisioning of that actually happened as part of the reopening in the middle of the year. So, that's actually already in the run rate. Whereas other aspects of the investment agenda are obviously thinks that we're executing now, expanding in places, hiring people, hiring technologists to do things that we need to do. So hopefully that answers your question. Your line is breaking up a tiny bit, but I think I basically hear your question, and I think the simple answer is yes. So, in other words, we're sort of saying that as we -- as the environment continues to normalize in a variety of ways, so that includes policy rate normalization, rate curve formalization as well as run rate normalization and Markets revenues with the sort of some background expectation of growth in our Markets and Investment Banking revenues with the background expectation of growth, and when all of that plays out and is finished playing out, we believe we should be back to 17%, all else equal. So, you can kind of see -- it's not that long, if you know what I mean, in terms of like what the current forwards imply about when you get back to a sort of more normalized policy rate environment. Sure. Yes. So, in terms of C&I loan growth, as I said in the script, we are seeing an uptick in revolver utilization rates, especially in the commercial bank. And it remains sort of skewed to the smaller clients. But, we are starting to see an uptick in that actually even in the bigger clients. So, that gets an encouraging sign. One of the things I've heard from the folks who run those businesses is that one driver of that is CEOs and management teams who've been burned by low inventory levels as a result of the supply chain problems, wanting to run higher inventories, and that is maybe driving higher utilization there which, as a result, while it would, I guess, theoretically be a relatively permanent increase in utilization is not a thing that you can sort of project forward in terms of compounding the growth. But at the same time, we're also hearing really quite a bit of confidence in the C-suites and all else equal, that should be positive for C&I loan growth. But clearly, the levels there are modest still in a world where capital markets have been exceptionally receptive to investment-grade issuance, in particular, and more recently, the high-yield issuance throughout the sort of pandemic period. And so, people are well funded from capital markets issuance. Yes, sure. So, there's a lot of stuff in there. So, let me do mortgage and cards. So, in mortgage, you'll see that if you sort of try to do a margin calculation by taking the production revenue and dividing it and so on, you do see an apparently significant drop in margin there. So, there's a few drivers of that. One is the margins were actually slightly elevated in the prior quarter as a result of the timing of the flow-through of the loan-specific pricing adjustments. So, that's one factor. In addition, you actually -- we did -- despite the fact that it was an exceptionally strong overall quarter of originations and for funded loans, as we started to see higher rates towards the end of the quarter, we did see the dynamic that you would expect in terms of drop in saleable new lock volume and so on. So, that's a little of a factor. And then there's the sort of the normal organic dynamics where you tend to see margin compression in mortgage with rates selling off a little bit. So, you have a bunch of factors driving a slightly lower number there, but the overall mortgage environment is quite healthy. And though obviously with higher rates we expect things to be weaker next year, we're still predicting a $3 trillion mortgage market next year, which by historical standards is very robust. So, that's that part. And then, in card, I imagine that you're looking at the card income line where we had a significant drop last quarter. And this quarter, the number is also sort of relatively depressed relative to what we had two quarters ago when it was quite high. So you'll remember that for card income, we had a sort of one-off item last quarter, depressing the number. This quarter, we have another sort of one-offish type item, which is the impact of the Southwest co-brand renegotiation, which is public. So, that's contributing to the card income line, the revenue rate a little bit. But it's important to note that in the background of all this is the impact of the customer acquisition amortization comfort revenue expense, which, as you know, amortizes over 12 months. And so, as I mentioned earlier, as part of the big sort of increase in customer engagement, as part of the reopening in the middle of the year, we ramped that up quite significantly, 100,000 point offers in the market and stuff like that. And so, that's coming through the numbers. So, as a result, when you look at the sort of full year revenue rate for card of around 10%, we actually see that as a reasonable central case for next year with the sort of elevated marketing and customer acquisition amortization being offset, obviously, by expected growth in NII with the revolve narrative that we've laid out. Yes, sure. So, I mean, at some level, the question that you're asking is this perennial question of how can we be sure that the investments that we're making are paying back and on what time line and how do we measure that? And it's interesting. We were just talking about card marketing. I think of that as a continuum. You have a continuum of investments that start with card marketing where every dollar that we put into card marketing investment as part of a very sophisticated, extremely data-driven, highly measurable set of decisioning to ensure that all of those are accretive and when we have sort of measurable outcomes in the short term. So, there's a lot of signs there, and it's pretty precise and you get feedback pretty quickly. At the other end of the continuum is tech modernization type stuff, which is a big part of the theme right now. And those things are things that are just we obviously need to do them. If we don't do them, we'll be clunky and inefficient and hamstrung in the future when we're trying to compete. And it's impossible to prove in some narrow financial sense that there is a tangible return payback from that, but we know that they're absolutely mandatory. So, when we think a little bit about the revenue outlook in our kind of normalized run rate, we are certainly assuming that many of the investments that we're making now and that we've made over the last couple of years will produce the revenues that we expect in that time horizon. But, a lot of what we're doing is not of that nature. And in some sense, those are actually the most important investments because they're the hardest decisions to make. Yes. So, if you look at the bottom left-hand side of page 16, footnote 3, an extremely small print, you will note that the implied curve that we use is from January 5th. So, you can take that curve and whatever the current curve is and use the table on the bottom right and add a long list of caveat that I won't give you and draw your own conclusions. But I mean, it should be a modest increase, modest additional tailwind, very modest. While we wait for the next question, I said something inaccurate before. I realized I wasn't that confident when I said that. The $40 billion standardized RWA increase in SA-CCR, if you do the math, is obviously not 10 basis points of CET1. It's 30 basis points of CET1. So, correction coming through there. Yes, sure. So, I mean, I forget exactly what the market is assuming about the start of QT at this point, QT2 as they're now calling it. But from us, I look closely, there was expected to be a pretty long lag between sort of the end of the hiking cycle and the beginning of QT2. Maybe people are now starting to accelerate that. But in any case, the important point is that as a result of the acceleration of tapering, the amount of balance sheet growth is ending pretty quickly. And therefore, the impact on system-wide deposit growth should be quite modest this year. And that -- and our assumptions are consistent with that. In other words, we're not assuming lots of deposit growth next year because ultimately that's going to be primarily a function of the Fed balance sheet size. But obviously, we are still assuming modest growth rather than reduction as a function of QT, if you know what I'm saying. And so, then, in terms of deployment, you can see in the supplement that we already did some deployment this quarter. It was primarily in the front of the curve. So, we're still being quite cautious about really buying duration. And if you look at again page 16, you noticed that we call out securities deployment as a modest driver of that $4 billion increase that's tied as balance sheet growth and mix. So, it's reasonable to assume that we might be -- we might do a little bit of duration buying if the rate curve develops as the forwards predict, but it shouldn't be too dramatic. And Betsy, the only thing I want to add to that, which I was going to basically say the same thing, this whole like ask for 10 and hope to get 5. I mean, we would -- we aim to manage the Company much better than that. So, I certainly don't have that type of authority. That's not the way it works. And I think the important point is that what actually happens is a ton of scrutiny of the investment agenda, two or three levels down in the organization with a lot of discipline there. So that's where the conversations happen about whether this makes sense to do now, whether it's the right priority now, whether we have the capacity to do it, whether in the case of where the returns are measurable, where it's producing the right returns. And that's really part of how we operate the Company and part of the discipline of the day to day. Yes. So Steve... This is fine. It's perfectly reasonable question. So, okay. So, here you go. So, when you look at the current state of the so-called Basel III endgame or Basel IV proposals, and you look at the RWA components of them in isolation, you've got the change in the credit conversion factors, which all else equal is a tailwind. You've got the fundamental review of the trading book, which is quite complicated and it's going to depend institution by institution, but it's potentially for some folks a headwind. And then, you've got the introduction of operational risk capital into standardized RWA. And if you look at sort of central case estimates of all those things in a simple way, you will conclude that there's a bunch of RWA inflation. But, a couple of things. First, there's all things plays in the context of the global regulatory community or at least in the U.S. saying that the system has enough capital. And it doesn't actually need more capital. And it's important to realize... Yes. And so, it is important to realize, Steve, that as you know, obviously, there are additional tools. So the most important one of which is how standardized output floors interact with the introduction of operational risk capital into standardized RWA, and then in turn, how that interacts potentially with the Collins Floor as well as more generally the fact that there are opportunities to tweak, potential double counting and the stress capital buffer against FRTB and so on and so forth. So, the point of all this is that there are more levers and tools here than just the overall RWA inflation. And the way we see the world, we don't expect the Basel III endgame in and of itself to increase the dollars of capital that we need to carry as a company. Exactly. And we are allowing the G-SIFI increases to flow through to the medium-term ROTCE assumptions. Yes, sure. So, I still, to be honest, get a little bit confused between payment rates and revolve rates and all these various ratios. But I think it's a little bit simpler. If you just take a step back, you look at the revolve rate and you look at the overall level of revolving balances and what we sort of expect for that. So, there's a few things to note. So, the revolve rate having dropped quite a bit has more or less stabilized. There's a little bit of a blip in the fourth quarter as a function of holiday spend and maybe some Omicron stuff. But broadly, it's stabilized. In the meantime, the growth in overall Card loans has now, for several quarters in a row, produced modest growth in revolving card balances. And our central case for next year basically assumes that that trend stays in place. So, what's important about that is that we're not assuming some sort of aggressive return of the revolving rate to the pre-pandemic levels. We're simply assuming that it stabilizes and that overall card loan growth therefore contributes its fair share of revolving loan growth. And so, the kind of central case that we put on the page for the balance sheet contribution to NII growth in 2022 has, very roughly speaking, revolving balances getting back to the pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2022, roughly. And then, sorry, Steve, I think you had another -- was there another part of that question that I forgot? Yes, sure. So, in terms of credit cost, as I said, we're assuming a roughly normal credit environment at that point. So that would mean card charge-off rates back into the sort of low to mid-3s type of thing. As we said, pre-pandemic, we were assuming we would get to, especially as we underwrite some slightly higher loss vintages over time. Importantly, Yes, exactly. So, I mean, I would just broadly describe, and consistently with the way we're describing it, which is kind of medium-term guidance in a normalized environment that the charge-off environment should, in turn, be normal. So, that's that. And then, you're kind of asking me, I guess, about the overhead ratio a little bit. So personally, I kind of don't love that measure. I think it's more of an output than an input. And more often than not, it's driven by revenues, not expenses. And more often than not, in the short term, the revenue number that's swinging is a function of the rate curve. So essentially, the overhead ratio just becomes a proxy for the Fed funds rate, which makes it not a great management tool for the company. But having said that, in the assumptions that we're using to build up that 17% rate, we do get back to something like a 55% overhead ratio. But, as Jamie said before, if that number has to go up to deliver the right returns in the long term, it will, like we don't consider it to be a constraint. In a world where there are inflationary pressures, there's a lot of post-pandemic effects in the numbers, and we have some critical investments to make. The notion of operating leverage at the level of the Company's overall numbers for me becomes just not terribly meaningful. I'm not criticizing your question. I understand what you're asking, but is this kind of another way you think about it. My version of that, which is consistent with Jamie's is that we continue to be interested in looking at M&A, and we're doing that. Obviously, yes, very large deals aren't realistic. And the fintech investment part is definitely part of the stuff that we're looking at when we look at deals. Yes. I mean -- it's funny. I wouldn't actually describe retiring technical debt as playing defense. I mean, I think that's actually a great example of the whole point of this conversation, which is that retiring technical debt is an easy thing to not do if you're playing defense focused on short-term targets. But if you're playing offense for the long term, it's exactly this type of decision that creates some of the frustration that you're articulating that's critical for the long-term success of the country -- the Company. So that's... Yes, sure. So I think broadly for the company, there's no really large change in our credit risk appetite, and therefore, in our underwriting standards. I think I alluded a little bit to this earlier, which is there's a subtlety in the card business, where if you remember, pre-pandemic, we had talked about card charge-off rates being at 3.25% and maybe trending a little bit higher over time as a function of some underwriting of some slightly higher risk vintages, still well within our credit box, still within our overall credit risk appetite, but just a slight shift in the composition of the portfolio there. So, that happened back then, and we just didn't see it flow through because of obviously the extraordinary dynamics that we've experienced with pandemic. And now, we're exiting the fourth quarter of this year with a card net charge-off rate. And I forget the exact number, something like 1.2% or something, so. Obviously exceptionally well. So, the question then becomes like -- and then I think somewhere in your question there was also about like when we sort of leaned into the reopening, how did we modify the credit box and standards. And the answer to that is that we returned it essentially to the pre-pandemic level. So we were obviously very confident in light of what we were seeing about what credit conditions were. Exactly. Yes. And so, Gerard, to your point about the fourth quarter of next year, right? I mean, one lens to look at that through is what do we think the trajectory of normalization of card net charge-offs is through the course of 2022. And I don't want to get into too much specific guidance there, but the numbers that we're putting on the page roughly assume that we get back to that kind of like low-3s around the end of 2022 or early \u201823 in terms of card net charge-offs. So yes, on the one hand, maybe we'll be talking a lot about the fact that those numbers are going up, but they will have actually gone up exactly in line with our expectations. Yes. So, on digital banking, we're not going to disclose specific countries that we're going into, one. Yes. I mean I think just to validate Mike's question, as you know, we have made this investment in C6 in Brazil. So Brazil, it's not exactly the same. It's not a de novo build by us, but we're there. We're engaged. It's a significant investment. And Brazil is like a very interesting country from a consumer banking perspective and the digital play there is quite interesting. So, that's one example. And obviously, we're thinking about additional places to go, and we'll let you know when we do it. Yes. I mean, I don't know. I'm personally not a big fan of these types of like anecdotal individual like tech stories. I mean, there's cool stuff, like we're doing some AI-enabled lead optimization stuff in AWM, for example. So I could come up with a list of like 20 things like that. But in reality, it's really much more about the embedding of the modernization and the digitization of the whole ecosystem as part of customer engagement and competition and making the company more efficient and all that type of stuff. Examples where it's like I spent $10 million on X that's technology as opposed to like branch build or banker hiring, as Jamie says, and you can then attach a tangible revenue outcome to that. I'm sure we have some of those examples somewhere. I don't have them with me. Maybe we can talk about them next quarter. But I generally think that that sort of gets into a lot of anecdotal stuff that distracts from the big picture. Yes. So, a couple of things. If you go back to my prepared remarks, so it's like $12-ish billion, a bit more, 50-50, run the bank, change the bank. And within the change agenda, half again is kind of modernization-type stuff as opposed to features and products. So, it gives you a little bit of a... But Mike, just a big one example, I guess, from a business that I know you know well. If you look at Teresa's Securities Services business, it's an interesting example of the way the investment relates to the strategy. So, in that business, as you know, historically, winning new mandates, especially on services administration tended to involve significant correlated large increases in expense as you had to onboard a lot of fund accountants. And so, that was typically the dynamic there. And I think a lot of the investment that we're making there is to make that business a little bit more scalable in that respect so that when we win new business, it's a little bit more accretive. So, that's kind of an interesting example of is that tech investment that produces more revenue? I mean, I guess. I would describe it as investment that means that when we win the revenue, it's more profitable, for example. At the same time, we're also building out some really great capabilities in there in terms of data and stuff like that, which maybe will help us win more mandates."

            "name": "Jamie Dimon",
            "content": "Glenn, I would just like to add, we don't really know about 2023, and I'd be very cautious in that. Plus, I expect more interest rates increases is in the implied curve. And obviously, the world is very competitive. I also want to point out that a 17% return on tangible equity, if you can get that to the rest of our lives would be exceptional. So, reconfirming that that's kind of what we do, we can do is pretty good. By the way, I would say 15% on tangible for the rest of my life, if I can guarantee that. And some are very basic. Opening 400 branches, $800 million a year, obviously, the payback comes over time, adding thousand of sales people kind of know pretty much what the payback is, but obviously, it comes over time. And so it's a whole mix. And just think about it as expenses you should expect to go up a little bit in 2023. I answer that question. We do not sit at the table and tell people you can only do X. We sit at a table and ask people what do you want to do? So, think of it's 100% within our capability because some things you just simply can't do. You can't attack 14 funds at the same time or something like that. And that's number one. So, we want to make those kind of investments. Each one goes through kind of rigorous process as is necessary. Some of them are table stakes. I do remember sitting around the table one day and people talking about digital account opening and do NPV. I was like just don't do an NPV. Just get it done. That's just serving your client properly and stuff like that. And so -- and like as I said, a lot -- I mean, Jeremy mentioned it's 400 branch in the United States. It's 13 sites overseas. It's more countries, more products. It's all the things we should be doing that you'd want to do if you owned 100% of the Company. So, it may not be what you do if you have to meet NII next quarter of X, Y or Z or something like that. And the second part of your question wasn't that, it was -- the consumer digital and stuff like that. We're not going to start giving you real numbers and all that, but that is a march. That's a journey, and it's hard. And we want to get there as soon as possible. Pieces and pockets have already gotten there. So certain applications and certain datasets already running on the private cloud, somewhere in the public cloud, some parts of the company ahead of other parts of the companies, that's a lot of work. And there is -- you guys have pointed a little bit call it bubbles expression there. We're not going to disclose that either because then we just got a doctor closing 84 other bubble expenses. Those are our responsibility. And to the extent we have opportunities to do more, we will do more. We have extraordinary capability. And I think I also want to point out, Jeremy, you mentioned the assumptions around capital. I mean, SLR, G-SIFI, and most of these other companies should be recalibrated, okay? Even the regular these things should be recalibrated for the global side, the global economy. If you put capital against treasuries and capital Fed deposits and let's see what happens. So, we -- on that, we're kind of conservative. We're not going to be expecting a lot of relief. But, even some of the folks yesterday we mentioned that were being questioned Fed prospects were being questioned about SLR and acknowledge that there are issues around SLR that are not good for the markets. I'd like to give you another example. If we can spend $2 billion more and get to the cloud tomorrow, I would do that in a second. It's possible. But if it happens, it will be for a good reason. And I read about the competition, the global competition, the nonbank competition, direct fiber lending competition, there's Jane Street [ph] competition, the [indiscernible] competition, there's fintech competition, there's PayPal competition, there's direct competition, it's a lot of competition, and we intend to win. And sometimes you guys spend a few bucks. And I want to emphasize, too, embedded upon that, as we've always said, we're going to -- we want to be very, very competitive and pay. There's a $1 billion in merit increase. There's a lot more compensation for our top bankers and traders and managers who actually say, by the way, did an extraordinary job in the last couple of years delivering this stuff. And we will be competitive and pay. And that squeezes margin a little bit for shareholders, so be it. Don't give too much... Which by the way, anyone does any real analysis at all would come to that conclusion. And you were conservative in saying, it's the 4.5% G-SIFI. We will very, very aggressively manage those things when we know the actual numbers, like very aggressively manage them. And building reserves as the loan books grow. You've got to do your own models, okay? Well, first of all, we prepare for all eventualities here. We're not kind of guessing at one. But the consumer is very strong. And with respect to the fact that people suffering still and COVID and all that, the fact is despite of Omicron, in spite of supply chains, 2021 was one of the best growth years ever. And 2022, it looks like it either be 3.5% or 4%, which is actually pretty good. The consumer is $2 trillion more in their balance sheet, their home prices are up, asset prices are up, jobs are plentiful, wages are going up, which is good for them. We're not against that, and sharing the wealth a little bit of Americas recovery with everybody. So, the consumer is in really good shape. The spending, I mean, Jeremy took you through the numbers, 25% more than they spent in pre-COVID. 25% more. And that number drives all the order books for everybody else, whether it's goods and services and obviously, it's bouncing around between goods and service dollar, kind of stuff like that. Businesses equally are in very good shape with cash and capability and confidence levels are high. What are they seeing? They're seeing their order books go up, more cars, more motors, more patios, more home improvements, more homes, more demand. We have a shortage of homes in America. So, you see the table is set pretty well with -- for the growth -- with obviously the negative being inflation and how that gets navigated and stuff like that. So, my view is a pretty good chance there'll be more than 4. It could be 6 or 7. I mean, I grew up in a world where you -- Paul Volcker raised interest 200 basis points on a Saturday night. And this whole notion that somehow it's going to be sweet and gentle and no one is ever going to be surprised. I think it's a mistake. That does not mean we won't have growth. It does not mean unemployment -- in a good position and stuff like that. And the other fact is, it may very well be possible that they're loan rates -- and I'm a little surprised how low they stay. But the loan rates may react more to the actual QE and then QT. And so, at one point, the Fed is going to be letting run off $100 billion or whatever number a month they're going to come up with. And then you may see loan rates react a little bit to that. And particularly, I just said about growth and demand for capital and stuff like that, that also tends to drive 10-year bond rates and all that. So, all things being equal. If you look at the company, and it's very important, we have huge firepower to grow, to expand, to make loans to extend duration and you look at capital liquidity, I just want to point out, it's $1.7 trillion -- these numbers I've never seen the bank with them. And you look at percentages, not just gross amounts, $1.7 trillion in cash and marketable securities, $1 trillion of loans, okay? There's $500 billion or $600 billion of those cash and marketable securities that could be deployed in higher-yielding assets or loans when and if the time comes depending on all these capital constraints and stuff like that we have to deal with. And those are extraordinary numbers. It's $2.5 trillion deposits. And we don't like taking risky deposits. Those are -- they may go down a little bit in QT and all that. But look at how this balance sheet is funded. I've never seen a bank balance sheet like that. And that's -- think of that as kind of firepower over time as we navigate through the world. And so, we're in pretty good shape. And if -- I wish I could own 100% of the company and be private. Yes, I would expect that because almost every CEO is talking about wages and certain inflation and stuff like that. But I just -- I don't want to be -- please don't say I'm complaining about wages. I think wages going up is a good thing for the people who have the wages going up. And businesses simply have to deal with changes in prices. So, if you -- commodity prices go up and down, mozzarella goes up and down, wages go up and down. They shouldn't be cried babies about. They just deal with it. The job is to serve your client as best you can with all the other factors out there. So I'm not opposed to it. But I do think you'll see more people seeing wage pressure, et cetera, and some have more ability to offset it than others. It hasn't stopped us from doing anything, zero, none, nada. We're not cutting back in growth plans or bankers or markets or countries because there was some wage inflation. So, the large transactions like over billions unlikely. But we always look. We're always open mind. We're looking all over the place for things that fit in and stuff like that. And then the pace of fintech investors, stuff like that, that won't change at all. Great. But it's battle and gate. I mean, some of these people do a very good job. I think there are some things we, your bank should have done, so we should be a little self-critical. But we have the capability, the economies of scale and all these things. What we're not going to do is hamstring ourselves to meet an overhead target. That's just not even on the card. And we have assets and strengths. Look, the competition is very bright. I mean, they're bobbing and weaving. They're not changing, and they're not static. And I think sometimes few act like they're static and they're not static. But if we do a good job, like today, on consumer, I'm sure some you Chase customers, free trading, a lot of ATMs, you've got better and better services, more navigation bars, more offers, more travel, more rewards, more -- and you got more of that coming. And we've gotten friendlier an overdraft. We've gotten -- that's just one business. That's true for every single business. So, I look at middle way around JPMorgan, that's going be pretty tough competition. Like take Chase UK. We've been very, very clear that costs us money, and a lot of you want to pay back tomorrow and stuff like that, we're not going to disclose those numbers, but we are there for the long run. We're going to be adding products and services and countries for the rest of our lives, okay? So, I doubt, over the long run, we'll fail. We may not do -- we may not become the best digital bank in the UK or somewhere in the short run. Yes. I think you'd help me raise the equity capital. Michael, I feel your pain and frustration. It is very possible in 2023, we'll have a 17% ROTCE. It depends on how we deploy our capital. It depends on fixed income markets. It depends on a bunch of stuff like that. But every -- but the 400 branches that we're building, those things will get to contribution profitability just like we expect. The thousand bankers we're adding in private banking, and Chase Wealth Management, we're pretty sure we'll get to breakeven but just we expect that takes a couple of years. And so yes, we can't -- we're not going to tell you all of those things. And we already mentioned some of the tech stuff is just kind of we have to do it, and there's a little bit of bubble expense in that. There's even a little bit of bubble expense on new headquarters. And so, we're pretty comfortable we're doing the right things. And we're being a little conservative. Like Jeremy was talking about the card stuff, the return, I told our folks that we're going to -- our card growth this year, but they were skeptical. The American consumer is very strong. Our products and services are very good. Chase, we call now self-directed investing has $55 billion. I think Robinhood has, I think, 80, the last time I saw, something like that. We're not seeing your -- bragging about our product because I would say it's not good enough yet. But it's got $55 billion without us doing virtually anything and or no marketing and no real stuff like that. So, there's a lot of stuff coming. The competition, we have to face. Some of these acquisitions we made will contribute to profit, maybe not exactly in 2022. But -- and I mentioned the deployment of the balance sheet. We're pretty conservative in deploying the balance sheet. That may not always be true. So, we spent $2 billion on brand-new data centers, okay, which have all the cloud capability you can have in private data centers and stuff like that. We're still running the old data centers. Now, we're not going to get involved in every time you talk, I'll explain every part of the pain cake buildup of expenses going in and expenses going out. But all this stuff going to these new data centers, which is now completely up and running are -- well, some are, but most of the applications that go in have to be cloud eligible. Most of the data that goes in has to be cloud eligible. We're running a whole bunch of major programs, which I don't think we disclosed on AWS. And we're working with Google and Microsoft to run some of the stuff into cloud, so we want to have multiple cloud capabilities. And this year, roughly 30%, 40%, 50% of all our apps and all data will be moving to cloud-related type of stuff. This stuff is absolutely totally valuable. I mean, I can't -- if you sat in this room and look at the power of the cloud and big data on risk, fraud, marketing, capabilities, offers, customer satisfaction, dealing with errors and complaints, prospecting, it's extraordinary. You actually see some of that already in how we manage stuff. Like, for example, with all the fraud and all the cyber and all the ransomware, our fraud calls are down this year. There's a reason for that. It's because we've deployed huge capabilities in those things. So, we have to do those things. And that's a margin that will be hugely valuable for us. And you'll see some of that benefit, which is why we're comfortable that we'll continue to grow and expand and earn. Like I said, with 17% return on tangible capital, I would take that. If I could push a button and give you that the next 20 years, I would take it. And also, if I did it for the next 20 years, that number would probably be like a big part of the GDP of the United States of America. Mike asked another very good question market shares. We expect to go up in retail deposit market share, investment market share, private banking market share, fixed income market share, equity market share, investment banking market share, global market share, payments market share and security services market share, commercial banking market share, and what did I miss? I'd be surprised if any of them go down. And we're not going to give you the number. So, we can never see... It got tied a little bit, and now it's back to where it was... None of that was completely material to the results. But one of the things in Jeremy's slide that you point, we've been over earning on credit for years. And we expect that eventually to normalize. You could argue how fast and what time, but credit card has been a number that you've never seen in our lives. Middle market has been lower than ever. Other sales have been lower than ever. Mortgages have been lower than ever cards. They're all low. Eventually, they're going to normalize. And then we kind of build that out. And the other thing is the loan book, and this is very important for your own modeling. Just assume as the loan book grows, we will add reserves pretty much proportionate to the growth in the loan book, all things being equal. We've got CECL and all this stuff like that. So, there's -- that's a flip to the negative, obviously, for next year, one item. I think, we're in a -- again, some of those things are outcomes of decisions you make based on client stuff. But the real fact is we got Basel IV, a lot of changes. And when all that happens, we'll give you a little bit better update how we're going to deploy capital and invest the balance sheet and stuff like that. But we're in no rush to reinvest part of that balance sheet. We'll be very patient. There isn't one we're talking about for next year. Hey, Mike. I'm going to give you one example, which may be a little helpful on this tech platform thing. I think, these numbers are accurate -- we did this a while ago. Card runs a mainframe -- which is quite good. We have one of the most efficient, most economic, 60 million accounts, et cetera, it's been updated for years, but it's a mainframe system in the old data center. When it gets modernized to the cloud, the cost savings by running that and marginalizing it will be $30 million or $40 million a year. That isn't the reason we're doing it. The reason we're doing it is once you get that to the cloud that the database is that it uses to feed, its risk, marketing, fraud, real-time offers and stuff like that become accessible to enormous machine learning. So that you can -- when Mike Mayo is going home on a Friday night, we can offer you -- we know what you like to eat, steakhouse, you eat here, immediately offers and fraud stuff is 10 times what it is today. And so that's the real value. The value isn't the immediate cost save that you've gone from -- you're saving $30 million running this application. I want the $30 million. And the other thing that allows you to do is to augment that mainframe system. You touch a mainframe system, you've got to be a little careful when you go into it, make some modifications. So, like in the old days, you used to modify that mainframe system 4 times a year, big releases and stuff like that, of course, multiple -- for multiple reasons. Now you can go in and modernize a little piece of it every week, every day. And so, that's why it's so important to do this. And it also makes is hard to quantify the benefits and the cost. I know we got to end this call because we've got some of the stuff we got to do. Just for example, is an important one, and Teresa, there's all the credit for this. We now are using JPMorgan's investment banking derivative capability to help clients use derivatives for custody to value them and stuff like that. A lot of people simply can't do that. And of course, believe it or not, a lot of portfolios now, they're using more and more what you and I call derivatives as part of the portfolio management. That costs time. It costs money. It's on the cloud. It's hugely valuable to Teresa having a competitive advantage. Folks, thank you very much for taking some time with us. Good luck to everybody."

        "content": "Operator: Please standby, we're about to begin. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your lines will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please standby. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.\nJeremy Barnum: Thanks, Operator. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $11.7 billion, EPS of $3.74 on revenue of 30.4 billion, and delivered a return on tangible common equity of 22%.  These results include a $2.1 billion net credit reserve release, which I'll cover in more detail shortly, as well as an income tax benefit of 566 million. Adjusting for these items, we delivered an 18% or OTC this quarter, touching on a few highlights. It was another strong quarter for investment banking, including an all-time record for M&A.  And while loan growth remains muted, we see a number of indicators to suggest it has stabilized and may be poised to begin more robust growth across the Company and particularly in card. And consistent with last quarter, credit continues to be quite healthy. In fact, net charge-offs are the lowest we've experienced in recent history.  On Page 2, we have some more detail. Revenue of $30.4 billion was up $500 million or 2% year-on-year. Net interest income was up 1% with Balance Sheet growth and higher rates primarily offset by mix and lower CIB Markets NII. And NIR was up 3% driven by solid fee generation across investment banking and AWM largely offset by net securities losses in corporate versus gains in the prior year and lower revenue in home lending.  Expenses of 17.1 billion were up 1% year-on-year on continued investments and higher volume and revenue-related expenses, predominantly offset by lower legal expense and the absence of an impairment in the prior year. and credit costs were a net benefit of $1.5 billion driven by the reserve release. But it's also worth noting that net charge-offs of just over $500 million were approximately half of last year's third-quarter number.  Let's cover reserves on the next page. We released $2.1 billion this quarter driven by less severe downside scenarios as the macro environment continues to normalize. Reserves stand at 20.5 billion, which still accounts for elevated uncertainties surrounding COVID, and the current labor market dynamics, including the exploration of expanded unemployment benefits.  Now moving to balance sheet and capital on Page 4, we ended the quarter with a CG1 ratio of 12.9% down modestly primarily on higher RWA. The firm distributed $8 billion of capital to shareholders this quarter, including 5 billion of net repurchases and the common dividend was increased to $1 per share. With that, let's move on to our businesses starting with Consumer and Community Banking on page 5.  CCB reported net income of 4.3 billion, including reserve releases of 950 million on revenue of $12.5 billion down 3% year-on-year. Deposits were up 3% quarter-on-quarter, indicating some deceleration as excess deposits are stabilizing. Notably contributing to this growth, we ranked number 1 in retail deposit share based on the FDIC data, and we're the only large bank to show meaningful share growth up 70 basis points year-on-year. Similarly, client investment assets were up 29% year-on-year. And while market performance was a driver, retail flows in both advisor and digital channels were strong. Touching on spend, combined credit and debit spend was up 24% versus the third quarter of '19 and in line with last quarter, within that data, travel, and entertainment spend was up 8% versus 3Q '19, and very closely track the patterns of the Delta variant within the quarter, softening in August and early September, and reaccelerating in recent weeks.  Card outstanding\u2019s were up 1% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter, benefiting from higher new account originations. And while the payment rate is still very elevated, it's come down from the highs and revolving balances have stabilized. And when we look inside our data, we see evidence of excess deposits starting to normalize in segments of the population that traditionally revolve. So as a result, we're optimistic about the growth prospects of revolving card balances. Moving to home lending. Average loans or down 6% year-on-year, but up 2% quarter-on-quarter with portfolio additions now outpacing prepayments. It was another strong quarter for originations totaling nearly 42 billion, up 43% year-on-year, reflecting record purchase volume and share gains in the refi market. And in Auto, we had 11.5 billion of originations, second only to last quarter's record.  So overall, loans PPP, were up 3% quarter-on-quarter on the growth in card and home lending I just mentioned Expenses 7.2 billion, were up 5% year-on-year, driven by investments in the business, including marketing. And more generally, we continue to see that the acceleration in digital adoption during the pandemic has persisted with active mobile users up 10% year-on-year to almost 45 million.  So with that, looking forward, we are encouraged by our household growth and balance sheet trends. However, we expect it to take some time for revolving credit card balances to return to pre-pandemic levels, given the amount of liquidity in the system. In the meantime, credit losses and delinquencies remain extraordinary low. In card on a year-to-date basis versus 2019, low charge-offs more than offset lower NII.  Next, the corporate and investment bank on Page 6, CIB reported net income of $5.6 billion on revenue of 12.4 billion. Investment banking revenue of $3 billion was up 45% versus the prior year, and down 12%, sequentially. IB fees were up 52% year-on-year, driven by strong performance in advisory and equity underwriting and we maintained our number 1 rank with a year-to-date wallet share of 9.4%. An advisory was an all-time record quarter benefiting from the surge in M&A activity, and we almost tripled fees year on year in a market that doubled. Debt underwriting fees were up 3% driven by an active leveraged loan market primarily linked to acquisition financing.  And in equity underwriting, fees were up 41% primarily driven by our strong performance and IPOs. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, the overall pipeline is healthy and the M&A market is expected to remain active. And if so, IBTs should be up year-on-year, but down sequentially. Moving to Markets, total revenue was 6.3 billion, down 5% compared to a record third quarter last year.  Notably, we were up 24% from 2019, driven by the continued strong performance in equities and spread products. Fixed income was down 20% year-on-year due to ongoing normalization across products, particularly in commodities, as well as an adjustment to liquidity assumptions in our derivatives portfolio.  Equities was up 30%, a record third quarter, with strength across regions and, and reflecting higher balances in prime, strong client activity in cash, as well as ongoing momentum in derivatives. In terms of outlook, keep in mind that it will be a difficult compare against the record fourth quarter last year.  But the current environment continues to challenge our ability to forecast revenues. Wholesale payments revenue of $1.6 billion was up 22% or up 10% excluding gains on strategic equity investments. And the year-on-year growth was driven by higher deposits and fees, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Security Services revenue of 1.1 billion was up 9%, primarily driven by growth in fees on higher market levels.  Expenses of 5.9 billion or flat year-on-year as higher structural and volume and revenue-related expense, as well as investments, were offset by lower legal expense. And credit costs were a net benefit of 638 million, driven by the reserve release I mentioned upfront. Moving to commercial banking on Page 7, commercial banking reported net income of $1.4 billion, revenue of 2.5 billion was up 10% year-on-year on higher investment banking and wholesale payments revenue.  Record gross investment banking revenue of $1.3 billion was up 60% primarily driven by increased large deal activity with continued strength in MNA and acquisition-related financing across both corporate client and middle-market banking. Expenses of $1 billion were up 7% year-on-year, predominantly due to investments and higher volume and revenue-related expenses.  Deposits were up 4% sequentially, mainly driven by higher operating balances, and loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter. C & I loans were down 3%, but up 1%, excluding PPP, driven by higher originations. And it's also worth noting that consistent with last quarter, we are seeing a slight uptick in utilization rates in middle market.  And those among larger corporates seem to have stabilized albeit at historically low levels. CRE loans were flat with modestly higher originations in commercial term lending offset by net payoff activity and real estate banking. Finally, credit costs were a net benefit of 363 million, driven by reserve releases with net charge-offs of 6 basis points.  And then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 8. Asset and Wealth Management reported net income of $1.2 billion with pretax margin of 37%, record revenue of 4.3 billion was up 21% year-on-year as higher management fees and growth in deposit and loan balances were partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of 2.8 billion were up 13% year-on-year, largely driven by higher performance-related compensation, as well as distribution fees.  For the quarter net long-term inflows of 33 billion, continue to be positive across all channels, asset classes, and regions, with notable strength in equities and fixed income. AUM of $3 trillion and overall assets of $4.1 trillion, up 17% and 22% year-on-year respectively, were driven by higher market levels and strong net inflows.  And finally, loans were up 3% quarter-on-quarter, with continued strength in custom lending, securities-based lending, and mortgages. While deposits were up 5% sequentially. Turning to corporate on Page 9. Corporate reported a net loss of $817 million, including 383 million of the 566 million tax benefit, that I mentioned upfront. Revenue was a loss of $1.3 billion down 957 million year-on-year.  N II was a loss of 1.1 billion down 372 million, primarily unlimited deployment opportunities as deposit growth continued. And we realized 256 million of net investment securities losses in the quarter compared to 466 million of net gains last year. Expenses of a 160 million were down 559 million year-on-year, primarily driven by the absence of an impairment on a legacy investment in the prior year. On the next page, let's discuss the outlook. Our full-year outlook for 2021 remains largely in line with our previous guidance.  We still expect NII to be approximately $52.5 billion and adjusted expenses to be approximately $71 billion. But as you'll see on the page, we've lowered our outlook for the card net charge-off rate to around 2% as delinquencies remain very low. So to wrap up, we're pleased with this quarter's performance as we approach what we hope is the tail end of the pandemic.  The strengths of the Company, both in terms of our diversified business model, as well as our fortress Balance Sheet, talent and culture, have enabled us to perform well through this difficult period while continuing to serve our clients, customers, and communities. As we look ahead and the environment normalizes, new challenges will undoubtedly arise, but we feel confident with the position of the Company and the strategy going forward. With that, Operator, please open the line to Q&A.\nOperator: And our first question is coming from John McDonald from Autonomous Research. John, please proceed.\nJohn McDonald: Good morning, Jeremy. Wanted to ask about the net interest income guidance for the year. It seems to imply a nice step-up in NII for the fourth quarter to roughly 13.5 billion. Was wondering what do you expect to be the drivers of that sequential step-up and would you see the fourth quarter NII as a good starting point for us to think about our 2022 NII forecasts?\nJeremy Barnum: Yeah, John. Good question and good catch there. It's true, that is quite a bit of sequential growth. If you do the math, it suggests about 350 million. And in reality, if you think about what we've been saying about the outlook for increased revolving and deployment and so on, The increase is non-intuitively high.  And so just to explain within that, there are a couple of factors. So one, there's actually a meaningful amount of markets and our growth between the third and the fourth quarter, which in general we would sort of encouraging you to ignore. And there's also some sequential increase in NII from PPP forgiveness contributing to the fourth quarter number. If you strip those two out, you still see a little bit of modest growth, which is a little bit more consistent, I think with the overall story that we've been tying, which is that the real acceleration in NII, especially from higher card revolve, is a 2022 item.  In that context, then if you take that sort of lower number and thinking about annualizing that, I think it's fair to assume that that would be a lower-end estimate for the 2022 number in light of what we believe will happen in terms of -- especially card revolve. But obviously, we'll give you a little bit more color about 2022, next quarter.\nJohn McDonald: Okay. And as a follow-up, your cash balances continue to grow and you have been conservative on liquidity appointments, could you update us on your thinking around liquidity deployment, pacing that, and what factors you're balancing?\nJeremy Barnum: Yeah, totally. At the highest level, I would say that nothing's really changed, meaning we're still all else equal, happy to be patient. We still believe in a robust global recovery. We still are a little bit concerned about inflation, I think relative to the consensus. And all of that contributes to a willingness to be relatively patient about deployment. But it's also fair to say, that relative to last quarter, rates are obviously higher.  We start to see central banks around the world normalizing their policy stance a little bit, so the market-implied rates are coming a little bit more in line with our view and given that, it wouldn't be surprising if we saw some more opportunities for front-end deployment, cash, and cash-like activity, as well as possibly some duration management.\nJohn McDonald: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. Please, proceed.\nJim Mitchell: Hey. Good morning. Just first on loan growth. As you noted, the auto has been a strong card starting to show signs of life, but it looks like outside of acquisition, finance, C &I still seems a little weak and we've got ongoing supply chain issues. I don't know, as we think about the big picture, how are you seeing, I guess loan demand trends playing out, and what are you expecting as the next 12 months progresses?\nJeremy Barnum: Yeah. So let's go through loan growth because obviously, that's one of the areas that everyone's interested in. And so if we start with a card, which is obviously the one that's going to amount of the most in terms of NII impact, as you said, we see some signs of life and we believe that recovery is strongly underway and it seems hopeful like Delta is really fading so that's going to help.  If you just look forward just to the holiday season, we would expect to see normal seasonality, normal growth there. And the question really for Card as we've talked about a lot is whether that growth in spend and in Card outstanding translates into Revolve.  But as I noted in the prepared remarks, when we look inside the data and we look at the customers who have both deposit accounts with us and our Card customers, and we look at those who would typically be the ones that are most inclined to Revolve, we actually do see slightly faster spend down of the excess deposit balances there.  So that makes us relatively optimistic about both the potential for card outstanding to grow with the higher spending, but also for increased revolve and lower pay rates as we go into next year. It's going to take time obviously, but that is the core view. In-home lending, broadly, we expected this quarter's trend with portfolio additions outpacing prepayments to continue.  And then in C&I, which you mentioned, just a reminder, that as you go to the higher end of the spectrum in terms of the size of the C&I customers were eager to lend to them as a key part of the franchise. But from a financial performance perspective, that's more of an outcome rather than a goal.  But we do, as I noted up front, see a little bit of an uptick in utilization rates amongst smaller corporates. So that's consistent with a theme that we've been seeing, which is that the smaller you are, the less likely you are to have benefited from the wide-open Capital Markets, the more likely you are to be borrowing.  We do hear a lot about supply chain issues from that customer segment. So it's going to be interesting to see how that plays out. And then in CRE, we see quite a robust origination pipeline, as we've fully removed any pandemic-related credit pullbacks, and we're leaning into that and we do expect to see a little bit of net loan growth going forward.  And then finally, I would note that we do see some loan growth in markets actually, and we generally discourage you from focusing too much on NII and loan growth within markets, but it is an indicator that there are some opportunities there that we're taking advantage of, in the usual kind of nimble way that you would expect us to do in markets.\nJim Mitchell: Okay. That's all very helpful. And maybe just a follow-up on the expense side. You and your peers have all seen higher expenses this year, higher capital markets, and incentive expenses, and increased investment spend.  But as we think about going into next year, our capital markets activity normalizes as many expect. Can we start to see expense growth slow or are there other considerations to think about whether it's investment spend or inflation pressures that we should think about?\nJeremy Barnum: Yeah. So it's a little bit of an all-of-the-above story I would say. So first of all, we're still in the middle of budgeting and it's sort of a little early to be giving you 2022 expense guidance. We'll do more of that next quarter, but realistically, expenses are going to be up next year. Now, to your point about capital markets-related expenses, it's obviously true that we pay for performance and in light of the very strong performance over the last couple of years in both Banking and Markets, we have seen increased compensation expense on the way up.  And therefore, as a function of the amount of normalization that you see in 2022, you're going to see that come down in line all else equal. Obviously, I would point out, that I think that the amount of growth in that number that we've seen through the pandemic, is less than a lot of people would have expected, actually.  And therefore, on the way back down, you would also potentially expect less participation, not to mention just the timing dynamics associated with the treatment of stock-based compensation investing. So all of that aside, at the same time, we are still investing. We still see significant opportunities.  We still see marketing opportunities in the card, and yeah, labor inflation is a question. You saw us raise wages in parts of the U.S. at the entry level. That just came into effect this September. And as we look out, we see a lot of churns. And as Jamie was saying, it's good stuff, it's normal, it's understandable in this environment, but labor inflation is definitely a watch item for us. So when you put all that stuff together, as I said, we'll update you more next quarter, but that's how we see the expense outlook for next year.\nJim Mitchell: Okay. Great. That's helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Next question is coming from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Please proceed.\nMike Mayo: Hi, there are a couple of events during the quarter that I wanted to ask about, and specifically, how has the tech strategy evolved? One, you made the announcement that you're changing the retail bank core system entirely to the public cloud. and that's a big change.  And Jamie, I would love to hear your comments on that. And then second, your expansion in the UK with digital banking, what metrics are you shooting for? And third, your recent Fintech acquisitions to what degree are there synergies among the acquisitions in addition to JPMorgan? Thanks.\nJeremy Barnum: Okay, Mike. Hang on. I'm writing doing your questions because I don't want to lose track. Let's start with the Cloud first. Yeah, you will have seen some press coverage around our partnership with Thought Machine. At a high level, there's actually nothing new here. We've actually been committed to the Cloud for a long time.  And by the way, when I say Cloud, I think we're talking about both private and public Cloud. Our core strategy involves really leaning into both and being very nimble across both. And I think that's very important for us as a regulated institution from our resiliency perspective. But the reasons, for do -- and that's all part of our overall tech monetization road map.  And a lot of the investments that we're doing that you've heard all the leadership of the Company talk about. When it comes to Thought Machine in the consumer space, There are five main reasons why we did that and it's all the normal reasons why you do cloud stuff and you do tech monetization.  We want to be able to innovate quickly and bring custom products to consumers faster. We want to be able to run multiple products on the same platform. As I mentioned, resiliency is critical. Increasingly, we want to be able to run the bank much more in real-time rather than based on batch processes.  And obviously, APIs are central to the entire strategy in this environment. So that's what I would say about that. Now -- yes, Jamie.\nJamie Dimon: Thought Machine is, basically, the core general ledger. It's not all the other stuff around the consumer. And when you do these conversions different than conversions in the past, you can do them -- you could schedule pieces, do part at a time, not all at once, like a big bang, which we used to have to do when we did big merge and stuff like that. So it's -- put it at a lower risk for the Company. But the core strategy hasn't changed at all.\nJeremy Barnum: Yeah. Okay. And then Mike, international consumer and acquisitions, I think you asked about. So in terms of international consumers, you will have seen that we launched -- it's obviously early days to give meaningful updates on that, but you will have noted actually that we've just rebranded NutMeg as a JPMorgan Company just a couple of days ago.  So all that's proceeding at pace and it seems to be pretty well received. I think the offering has seen us differentiated and innovative, so we'll have more to say about that over time. Generally --\nJamie Dimon: I just again, this is -- this is a 10-year game plan. This is not, they're going to worry that much about metrics in the next month or two. And with this the long-term work to try to get this thing right because if we're ever going to be retail overseas, it's going to be digital. And so we're going to be very patient. and at one point Mike, we will report some metrics so you can see them, but they're not going to be material to the firm's numbers for years.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. That's going to take time for sure. So -- but just more generally, in terms of the acquisition strategy, we've talked about this a little bit before. We're not claiming that we have some overarching top-down acquisition strategy.  I think broadly we are just doing things that make sense. But there are some themes that you can detect around bolt-on and adding capabilities. If -- just for the sake of argument, if you start with AWM, you'll see a pretty consistent theme in there of ESG related capability additions.  You've mentioned already international expansion and the potential for growth, and it will be a long game, as Jamie says. And then, yeah, there's definitely a fintech narrative a little bit in terms of some of the stuff that we've done in the CIB.  And then within the consumer, most recently, the collection of things that we've done I think is unified by the theme of providing more integrated and holistic experiences to our customers. We've always been very proud of the value proposition that we offer, especially in the Card product. But we think we can take it up another notch with some of the stuff that we're doing around lounges and CX loyalty and stuff like that. I think I touched on everything there, Mike.\nMike Mayo: That you certainly did. And just as a follow-up, we see the results, the marginal efficiency in the businesses where you're growing has improved. And we just don't have the why. So how much of that is tech-driven versus other reasons that I guess you have metrics internally that we just don't have. But your, your marginal efficiency is what or your unit costs are going down or any additional color as to why the marginal efficiency is improving?\nJeremy Barnum: Yeah. I mean, I think reasonable people can differ on how you talk about this stuff, especially in terms of what parts of the expensive space to see us a little bit more fixed versus a little bit more floating.  I would've said that in reality, marginal expense increases as a function of most types of marginal revenue are actually lower than a lot of people think. So the operating leverage that you see, especially in the type of environment that we've had with really big increases in revenue on the capital markets areas and on the NRR site is actually relatively consistent with what I would've expected, but a little bit to your point, Mike, what's also true is that we're a big organization.  There's a scale play here. We have a big fixed cost base and a lot of the modernization agenda is about making sure that that doesn't creep and that it's as expensive as possible so that it can be as nimble as possible. And that marginal efficiency over time is as good as possible. But that's a long play there.\nMike Mayo: All right. Thank you.\nJamie Dimon: And Mike, one of the things you think about, one is you people worried about the forecast for next year and stuff like that. We're playing the game for ten years here. So we're going to -- and we're not going to disclose certain things, like, margin byproduct or something like that because it's competitive information.  But in the long game, we're competing with some very large, talented, global players, who are not even in banking today. And we are going to compete in that. So even some of these acquisitions are more around that, than around what I consider traditional banking.  And so -- in my whole life, just so you know, we've been modernizing technology, Every year of every month of every quarter, that's like a permanent state of affairs. Obviously, now it's to the Cloud and stuff like that. Those things are critical to do to be competitive going forward. That was true, by the way, 20 years ago.\nMike Mayo: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: Next up, we have a question from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open. Please, proceed.\nKen Usdin: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask if you can expand a little bit more upon card fees and card revenue rate. We all certainly expected the marketing expenses to go up inside that line. And just wondering if you can help us understand how much of that was captured in the third quarter and just what your general outlook is for the fee line and the underlying overall revenue rate. Thank you.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. Ken. You're right. Part of the drop in the revenue rate this quarter is a function of higher card marketing spend, which you would have expected. As a result of what we said last quarter in terms of the importance of getting our fair share of the growth and spending as we emerge from the pandemic and the fact that we're out in the market with a lot of offers that are seeing good uptake and we're seeing nice growth there.  So that's expected. And I think that card marketing number will actually remain elevated. And if anything ticks up a little bit sequentially, just based on how the amortization there works. So you should expect to see that continue.  But in addition, this quarter we have an adjustment to the rewards liability, which is contributing to the drop this quarter as well. So that is not something that we see continuing. So that should come out of the run rate as we look forward.\nKen Usdin: Can you help us understand what the magnitude of that is and what you think about the overall Card revenue rate going forward?\nJeremy Barnum: I mean, we don't really manage the Card revenue rate, so it's not a number that I'm eager to guide to. But I think the -- if I remember correctly, I think the rewards liability adjustment this quarter was of the order of something like 180 million, so we'll confirm that, but I think that's right.\nKen Usdin: Okay. Thanks. If I might just ask Jamie, you made a comment yesterday about the supply chain hopefully easing by next year around this time. What are you just hearing from your partners around the world in terms of the logjams and the potential for that to open up from here?\nJamie Dimon: I'm not hearing much different than you're hearing. I'm just -- I know that the over-focus over time is so extraordinary sometimes in the press, that people forget the big picture. The economy's going 4 or 5%. What people are buying is changed, which has also hurt supply chains a little bit.  There's not one Company I know who's not working aggressively to fix the supply chain issues. Sales are still up, credit card debit card spends still up because it was in great shape. And capitalism works. I doubt we'll be talking about supply chain stuff in a year. I just think that [Indiscernible] we're focusing on too much is simply dampening a fairly good economy. It's not reversing a fairly good economy.\nKen Usdin: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Next up, we have a question from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please, proceed.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. I have 2 questions: one, just following up on the Card discussion that we just have regarding the fees and the 180 million on the -- roughly 180 million on the rewards adjustment. I mean, it still leaves us with a pretty big decline in Q-on-Q. And I'm just trying to think through that a little bit because I know marketing rewards, etc, is up.  But was there anything, in particular, that would have driven a one-timer that is unlikely to persist or not? I realize that cashback is a little more expensive, so maybe that's a piece of it and it's a one-time move or is it more a function of, hey, we're going to be ramping our offerings here. And so you should expect that the forward-look is a step-down from what you had been seeing in 2Q?\nJeremy Barnum: Yeah. So Betsy, in short, it's really the latter. So the only thing that is one-time - ish in nature, for lack of a better term, is the rewards liability adjustment. And the rest of it really is marketing spend.  And we see that as a critical investment at this moment to moment of high engagement with the product, and we're very committed to making those investments. And so that is going to remain elevated. And if anything, tick off a little bit as we look forward.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. Thanks. And then separately, I think today is the last day of the Vice-Chair of Supervision, Randy Quarles as Vice-Chair of [Indiscernible] and so the question is, how should we be thinking about how you are positioning for an environment where maybe these rules don't change, right?  Like the LCR, the SLR, other things that we had been hoping might have some changes in them. Should we be anticipating that in order to help deliver the growth that you're looking for, that we should anticipate more pref issuance going forward?\nJeremy Barnum: Yeah. So I think, obviously, we're a little disappointed that we haven't seen some of the changes on the non-risk sensitive size-based constraints that we'd expected, but we're still hopeful that that will come soon.  We know the staff is hard at work on the [Indiscernible] endgame, and that's complicated stuff and it may be the case that some of those things are connected.  And our strategy on pref issuance has been to try to balance giving ourselves the capacity that we want to deal with the SLR constrain, without over issuing and therefore being stuck with a high-cost product that isn't callable for 5 years.  So that's part of the reason why we're operating a little bit above our CET1 target right now, and we're just going to continue to be nimble in that respect.\nOperator: Thanks. Next up, a question from Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Your line proceeds.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi. Thanks very much. So in the spirit of your thought on not overly focusing on the near-term. Did I hear your comments on payment rates and cards for [Indiscernible] seasonality, optimism about revolving card balances.  So is there an implicit comment within there about buying now, pay later, and the impact it may or may not have? I'd love to get your perspective on hand this old, but I guess a new payment option might have on the cards industry overall. Thanks.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. Thanks, Glenn. So BNPL, everyone's talking about it. It is funny how layaway is back in the e-commerce checkout land. But -- and obviously, we're looking at it. Everyone is talking about it and it's a moment for us as a Company where even though for any given thing that's emerging, you can easily convince yourself that it's kind of not a threat.  We're in a moment of taking all types of potential disruptions, especially [Indiscernible] type disruptions quite seriously. And in the case of BNPL, it's obviously particularly high profile because of the growth that we've seen, although it's a relatively small portion of the overall market.  I will remind you that we have our own very compelling offerings that speak directly to the installment payment experience in the form of My Chase Loan and My Chase Plan, which we get really good feedback on the customer experience there in terms of the post-purchase experience. You can select eligible purchases on the app and then move that to an installment plan if you want. But yeah, we acknowledge that it is downstream of the point-of-sale, which potentially raises some questions about whether we should be looking at moving a little bit more upstream there.  But even more generally when you take a step back, what we're really trying to do in the consumer business here, is think about what is the actual customer need that is driving the growth and BNPL and how can we respond to it in a strategic holistic way across all of our customers, and not too narrowly and too reactively, just respond to BNPL, but it's, obviously, a thing that we're looking at it and it's quite interesting.\nJamie Dimon: I think it's another example of growth in the Company. You saw a firm come out and it's no longer just about BNPL. They're going to have a debit card and attached banking accounts. So these are all different forms of competition which we have to respond to. And so that's why when we talked about, like, expenses, we will spend whatever we have to spend to compete with all these folks in our space.\nGlenn Schorr: I appreciate all that. Maybe one mother comment or get your thought on the right perspective to think about China and Evergrande and what people care about most is, is there an expansion across the border, meaning, is this a contained within their market? Are the funders, that will have some marks within their market, or do you see any domino effect in crossing borders? Thanks.\nJeremy Barnum: Yeah. So look, obviously, everyone is looking at Evergrande. Let me start by just saying that, for us, in terms of direct Evergrande exposure is absolute de minimis. So that's one piece. As you would expect, we've also looked at more indirect exposures in terms of the broad China property sector, as well as exposures of financial institutions that we deal with, to the China property sector, and in general, those exposures are all very modest.  So we're, obviously, watching it closely and continuing to look for reading across and do what you would expect us to do, but we're not terribly concerned right now about the impact on us.  I think, in terms of cross-border contagion, I don't hold my own opinion on this in particularly high regard, but it does seem like this was pretty well telegraphed by the Chinese authorities when they talked about their three red lines. So it's a process that's being managed. And I would say the better view right now is that it will be contained. But of course, it's the market, so we'll see what happens.\nGlenn Schorr: Thanks for all that, Jeremy. Thanks.\nOperator: Next up, we have a question from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Good morning. I guess just wanted to follow up on two things that were discussed; one around FinTechs and the regulatory changes, a lot of focus on the change in leadership at the regulatory agencies.  Jamie, you've talked about in the past in terms of regulatory arbitrage, when you look at big tech non-bank players, I think BNPL is a good example of that. Do you think as we have new leadership at the regulatory agencies, they're alert to this arbitrage, and do you think we see a clampdown, or is it too late for really them to create a framework that would level the playing field?\nJamie Dimon: I don't expect that there will be beneficial changes that help banks. And, I think, that we just have to compete with what we're -- the hand we're dealt, and not expect anything like that. And I think that you're going to have some people clamp down more in banks and maybe some people regulate fintech based on products or service, something like that. But I'm not expecting any relief.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Good. Yeah. and I was just wondering if there would be increased scrutiny of the non-bank players then it's good to banks, but point noted. And I guess, just on a separate question, Jeremy, we didn't see any building the CET1 when I look at the numerator, anything going on there this quarter that impacted it? And with the stock rate is at 2.4 times tangible, just remind us of how important are buybacks here, and opposed to just keeping some dry powder as the economy gets better?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. So, the answer to how important buybacks are that they're at the end of our capital hierarchy we often say, right. So organic growth, including acquisitions, sustainable dividends, and only then do we look at buybacks. And in light of the SCB environment that we're in, where we don't have a Fed-approved buyback plan anymore and we just simply have to comply with the minimums and BAU, that gives us quite a bit of nimbleness, which is an important thing to preserve in light of a world\nJeremy Barnum: where we do hope for loan growth next year and where acquisitions are still potentially on the horizon. So nothing really going on in this quarter other than a little bit of RWA growth in the denominator and we're just really going to stay nimble there.\nEbrahim Poonawala: But is there a case to be made, Jamie, in terms of just holding some dry-powder in excess capital given your macro outlook, as opposed to buying back stock at current valuations?\nJamie Dimon: Yeah, I [Indiscernible] evaluations -- as the stock goes up, you're going to -- you should expect to one day buy less. And we don't need dry powder, we have an extraordinary amount of capital liquidity. I mean extraordinary, and we earned 40 billion pre-tax a year. I mean, how much dry powder do you need? We have $1.6 trillion of cash and marketable securities. We have 200 -- well over 200 billion of equity. We can issue prefers, we can issue debt, we can issue stock if we had to do something. So I don't think we need dry powder. I think our capital cup runneth over where it is.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Noted. Thank you.\nOperator: Next one is from Steve Chubak from Wolfe Research. Please proceed.\nSteven Chubak: Good morning. So, Jeremy, you provided some helpful detail on the drivers of loan growth by category. Just looking ahead, is your expectation that loan growth begins to keep pace with GDP or economic growth? Or is there anything that would actually justify more meaningful acceleration lending activity, whether it's just greater pent-up loan demand, normalization of the card payment rates, or something else?\nJeremy Barnum: Good question, Steve. But I think you're sort of potentially leading me into giving fairly detailed loan growth guidance for 2022, which I -- I'm not really in a position to do. But let me see if I can answer this at a high level. I mean, we've talked a lot about Spend, which we believe in, driving Card loans higher, so that's one piece.  And the Revolve story within that as a function of the spend down and cash buffers, especially in our revolver -- the revolving segment of our customers. And obviously, as you know well if you think about our NII as the sum product of the NIM and the outstandings in the various loan categories, it is really disproportionately Card that drives things.  In the meantime, if you move a little bit away from consumer to the larger wholesale system. In a world where, even if tapering sorts relatively soon, if that plays out over roughly 8 months at $15 billion of decrease a month, you still, if you do the math, wind up with another $0.5 trillion of QE.  So we're dealing with a system that has a lot of surplus liquidity. And so in that context, realistically, it's hard to imagine seeing a lot of wholesale loan growth at a minimum. But. frankly, that's not really a big driver of performance for us. So I don't know if that helps,\nJeremy Barnum: but it's a good question.\nSteven Chubak: Thanks, Jeremy. It absolutely helps. And just one clarifying question on the [Indiscernible] commentary. You noted this quarter's result included an adjustment to liquidity assumptions in the derivatives portfolio. So maybe you can help unpack what that adjustment actually entails, what prompted it, and could you help size the impact in the quarter?\nJeremy Barnum: I could help unpack it, but it would take another 20 minutes which we don't really have. It's just bog-standard liquidity evaluation type stuff in the derivatives book in terms of as we revise our assumptions about what the potential transaction costs would be associated with transferring certain types of positions. It's normal course stuff that just happened to be a little bit bigger. I think fixed income was down 20% and I think without that it would have been down 15%. So if that helps.\nSteven Chubak: Very helpful. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Next question is from Matthew O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nMatthew O\u2019Connor: Hey guys. I was hoping to follow up on the capacity to deploy liquidity. And, I guess, it's to lead it a little bit. If we look at the growth in deposits, and I know some of them are considered non-core, but take out the loan growth and the growth in the securities book since COVID.  It's not about an extra 500 billion of deposits. And how much of that do you think can be deployed into securities? And understanding that you expect loan growth to pick up. So that'll go to some. But is there a way to a size that 500 billion capacity in terms of buying securities?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. So I think there's a lot of factors that play into what the deployment decision is at any given moment. Obviously, as you said, loan growth, but also we will always make these decisions on the long-term economic basis, not for the purpose of generating short-term NII.  And so when you do that, you have to think about capital volatility, drawdowns, and frankly, whether or not you see the value. And that if anything is probably the biggest single factor right now. As I talked about earlier,\nJeremy Barnum: it is true that the market has come a little bit more in line with our views, at least from a rate perspective. And that may lead to a little bit more deployment, all else equal right now. but when you start talking about spread product, for example, in light of the liquidity environment that we're in and the QE numbers that I mentioned a second ago, that remains very, very compressed, and there's just not a lot of value there. So we always try to be long-term economically motivated there, considering all the scenarios, considering risk management, considering the convexity of the balance sheet, and looking at value and being tactical there. So that's really how I would think about that.\nMatthew O\u2019Connor: I mean, I just did on a near-term basis, but I think a lot of investors are sitting here saying if the 10-year or really any part of that curve hits that magic point for you, what is this at capacity? So for example, if the 10-year gets to say 3%, and your confidence is not going to go to 5, do you have 100 billion at capacity, is it 300 billion? Just any way to frame it longer-term appreciating that it's not what you're looking to do at this moment at these levels.\nJeremy Barnum: No, I get the question.\nJamie Dimon: We could easily do 200 billion.\nJeremy Barnum: Yeah. I mean, I get the question. I get why you want to know, I guess, I just think, for a Company of our sophistication and given how carefully we think about this stuff, the idea of a particular target at which we would deploy a particular amount. Of course, Jamie is right, but it's always going to be situational, it's always going to be a function of why the rate is where it is.  I mean, in your question you alluded to it, it's like if the 10-year note's at 3, and we're sure it's not going to 5, but then where's the rest of the yield curve, what are the other options, what's going on in that moment. So we're always going to be situational and tactical about it.\nMatthew O\u2019Connor: That's helpful. And then kind of squeeze in, you've announced a bunch of what most of us have characterized as relatively small acquisitions, some this quarter and obviously, looking back for the full year. Is there something that -- is there a way you could kind of size the capital impact of that?  I know most of the terms weren't disclosed individually, but any way to frame the capital and financial impact? And then just lastly, remind us, what is the driving force when you look for a deal? Because some of the deals you look at and you're like how does that fit into broader JPMorgan Chase? Thank you.\nJamie Dimon: The capital impact in total isn't that big a deal and we're not going to disclose any more nor is the immediate financial impact. And each one is different. So in Consumer, Jeremy already said, it's more about lifestyle, travel, lounges, millennial, stuff like that.  In asset management of products, there was [Indiscernible] products, ESG products, timber products, stuff like that. And then between NutMeg and C6 and stuff like that, that is a longer-term view of us trying to get positioned into retail overseas over 10 years if we can.\nMatthew O\u2019Connor: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Next one is coming from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Good morning. Jeremy, you were saying that -- when we were talking earlier about the potential SLR changes and such, and we haven't seen anything in [Indiscernible] leaving today. But you mentioned about maybe the [Indiscernible] is focus on the Basel III end game, that's coming very soon here. Can you share with us from your guy's perspective, what are you focusing on with the Basel III final rules and regulations that could affect your growth going forward?\nJeremy Barnum: Yeah. So I think, I mean, the thing about the Basel III End Game is that you need to essentially deal simultaneously with the Basel floors -- the Basel standardized floors and the Collins floor. So you need to simultaneously -- so from the perspective of the staff that's working on this stuff, they have a tough challenge to simultaneously put in place the U.S. rule, which is Basel compliant, while also complying with the Collins floor standardized or WA minimum.  And so that's complicated and it's hard and it's quite technical and that sort of explains why it's taking a little bit longer than we might have all otherwise thought. In terms of the impact of that on our long-term growth, I mean at a high level, it's unlikely to be significant.  I think the related point is whether or not there are some changes as part of that or contemporaneously with that to these non-risk sensitive size-based constraints like G7 SLR, where obviously, most prominently in the case of GSIB, it's really getting pretty extreme in terms of the growth in the score for reasons that really have nothing to do with what the original design of the metric was.  And to a very significant degree are driven by the expansion of the system that we've seen in the last 18 months. So that's why we believe that that should be addressed as was contemplated in the original role. And so across all of those potential changes, you could see us doing a little bit of optimization in response to those.  You can imagine that Basel III endgame in terms of standardized and advanced and the impact on different products might make some things a little bit more capital efficient and others a little bit less capital efficient at the margin. But we're a big diversified Company. We're pretty good at navigating this stuff. So when we have clarity, we'll make the necessary tweaks.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. Thank you. And then obviously, you in the industry have seen really good deposit growth on a year-over-year basis. I think your deposits are up 20% all-in. You talked specifically about retail being the number one market share and retail deposits.  When the Fed ends QE, assuming it does some time by the middle of next year, and I'm not asking you guys to forecast what your deposits are going to be, but just higher level, should we anticipate that deposits could actually decline?  Or know that they are going to be so sticky even with the liquidity that everybody carriers, that we shouldn't really see a decline in deposits after QE, and this, let's call it second half, for next year?\nJeremy Barnum: I think there's a couple of factors in here. So let's, for the sake of argument, set our RP aside for a second and hold that constant -- if you just look at the impact of QE on system-wide deposits, we talked about tapering, but as I said earlier, tapering still involves another 0.5 trillion of system expansion between now and the end of tapering, or rather between the start of tapering and the end of tapering.  If the Fed follows the same type of trajectory that it followed last time, there would be an extended pause between the end of QE and the beginning of QT. And again, setting our IPO aside for a second, it would only really be with the beginning of QT that you would expect the size of the system deposit base to start shrinking, and I think the timing the last time if I remember correctly, was something like 22 months between the end of QE and the beginning of QT.  Now, of course, RP could bounce around and there could be other factors, but at a high level, that's how we're thinking about it.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you.\nJamie Dimon: I will just add my two cents. I think that they'll have to go quicker than that, and they'll have to reverse some of it. So you're talking about we're still going to increase deposits for a year, and then there will be a fairly large reduction over a 2 or 3-year period, which we should be prepared for.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from Charles Peabody from Portales Partners. Please, proceed.\nCharles Peabody: Yes. Good morning. I wanted to get a progress report on your new headquarter building. Specifically, what's the projected move-in date, or has that been affected by the pandemic? Secondly, are there costs, noticeable costs, running through 2021, expense structure for that build-out? And does that tick up noticeably when you move in? And then thirdly, what's the plan for unloading the properties that you'll be vacating and how is that being affected by the current real estate market? Thank you.\nJeremy Barnum: So the plan is on schedule moving date 20, I think 2025. There is no material expense, of course, it's duplicate expenses and we got to sell the building, stuff like that, but nothing material to our shareholder. We need to disclose. Operator, are there any other questions?\nOperator: Yes, sir. That is coming from [Indiscernible] from Societe Generale. Please proceed.\nAndrew Lim: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So you put, Jamie, about how you all focusing on inflation. Just wondering if you could outline what you're looking at exactly metric-wise across your businesses to signal to you that inflation is actually materializing with the concern. And how will that payout versus your expectations?  In terms of, like, how we deal with this if it does materialize as concerned, is there anything that you can do to try and protect the bank against inflationary forces there?\nJamie Dimon: Yeah, I think we should look at the big picture here, which, I think, is always important. I mean, 2 years ago we were facing COVID, virtually a great depression, global pandemic. And that's all in the back mirror, which is good. So by hopefully a year from now, there will be no supply chain problems.  The pandemic will become endemic. and I think it's very good to have good healthy growth, which we have. And it'll be good to have unemployment of 4%, it's good that their jobs are open, I think it's good that wages went up [Indiscernible], and I think there's too much focus on -- and none of these changes how we run the business, which to we add clients all the time.  Consumer, card, auto, deposits, real estate, small business, large companies, and stuff like that, which is the underlying thing to drive JPMorgan. It's not whether they take your revolver from 25% to 27%. So having said all that, and I'm not focused on inflation; we simply have pointed out -- well, you have [Indiscernible] inflation. It's 4%. It's been 4% now for the better part of a couple of quarters and it's, in my view, unlikely to be lower than that next quarter or the quarter after that.  Another question is, does it start to ease after that with supply chains and wages? More people looking for work or does it continue to go up? And of course, we prepare for probabilities and eventualities and one of those probabilities is that it might go higher than people think and they'll have to tamp down.  I doubt that will happen before late 2022. In the meantime, I think it's unbelievable that we're getting out of this and we have 4% unemployment, and you can have good growth with some inflation, and that's okay. I think that people are always focusing too much on immediate concerns. If you have inflation of 4% or 5%, we're still going to open deposit accounts, checking accounts, and grow our business.  I also should point out because it's always in the back of my mind, about $30 billion of revenues, 20 billion in subscription revenues. Asset Management, commercial banking, consumer banking, which are pretty good.  Wholesale payments, security services, custody, and so we're pretty crowded with the people who've accomplished all this, that if you look at the actual underlying numbers to getting earnings per second, more customers, more accounts, more share. And at the end of the day, that is what drives everything.\nAndrew Lim: Okay. That's great. It seems like you're taking a benign view, and it's manageable, it's not going to get out of hand. Which is fair enough.\nJamie Dimon: It's not -- I'm telling you. I don't -- I'm sorry, [Indiscernible] I don't know. We're prepared for all eventualities. There may be effect Gelb inflation. And the one other thing about our balance sheet, you guys talked about, putting your stuff like that. One of the stack tails of banks do, that are banks should be worried about is high inflation and high rates. And we have been very liquid, protects us more than against that and other things.\nAndrew Lim: Right, got it. Thanks for the clarity on that. And just a short follow-on question, Remy. Could you update us on the number of excess provisions you've got versus your base case economics scenario, you've given that number in the past and perhaps a bit of color more so on how that base case has changed over the quarter if it has indeed?\nJeremy Barnum: Yeah. I think the base case -- the central case has probably actually gotten a tiny bit worse quarter-on-quarter in light of the revisions and GDP outlook. But as you know, the framework also involves looking at probability-weighted scenarios. And as I said in the prepared remarks, the less extreme downside scenarios contributed a bit to the release this quarter.  In terms of sizing the overall balance, again, as I said in the prepared remarks, they remain a little bit elevated relative to what they would be if we had this type of economic performance with none of the COVID -related unusual features, i.e. uncertainty about the virus as much as we are optimistic about that right now, or uncertainty about labor market conditions, or the fact that even though a lot of the -- essentially all the federal level unemployment assistance has now rolled off and most of the states have too.  There are still some forms of assistance. The mortgage foreclosure moratorium, student loan stuff, rent moratoria, stuff like that, that don't roll off until later in the year. So there's a number of factors in the environment that are still unusual, which do contribute to slightly elevated reserves relative to what we would otherwise have. And as things play out, those will develop.\nJamie Dimon: Jeremy, just to interrupt real quickly. I got to go because I am out of town I have meetings I have to go to. You guys should continue and folks, thanks for listening to us and we'll talk to you all soon.\nJeremy Barnum: All right. Thanks, Jamie.\nOperator: And by that, we have no further questions waiting.\nJeremy Barnum: Okay. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Everyone, that marks the end of our call for today. You may now disconnect. Thank you for joining. Enjoy the rest of your Enjoy the rest of day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeremy Barnum",
            "content": "Thanks, Operator. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $11.7 billion, EPS of $3.74 on revenue of 30.4 billion, and delivered a return on tangible common equity of 22%.  These results include a $2.1 billion net credit reserve release, which I'll cover in more detail shortly, as well as an income tax benefit of 566 million. Adjusting for these items, we delivered an 18% or OTC this quarter, touching on a few highlights. It was another strong quarter for investment banking, including an all-time record for M&A.  And while loan growth remains muted, we see a number of indicators to suggest it has stabilized and may be poised to begin more robust growth across the Company and particularly in card. And consistent with last quarter, credit continues to be quite healthy. In fact, net charge-offs are the lowest we've experienced in recent history.  On Page 2, we have some more detail. Revenue of $30.4 billion was up $500 million or 2% year-on-year. Net interest income was up 1% with Balance Sheet growth and higher rates primarily offset by mix and lower CIB Markets NII. And NIR was up 3% driven by solid fee generation across investment banking and AWM largely offset by net securities losses in corporate versus gains in the prior year and lower revenue in home lending.  Expenses of 17.1 billion were up 1% year-on-year on continued investments and higher volume and revenue-related expenses, predominantly offset by lower legal expense and the absence of an impairment in the prior year. and credit costs were a net benefit of $1.5 billion driven by the reserve release. But it's also worth noting that net charge-offs of just over $500 million were approximately half of last year's third-quarter number.  Let's cover reserves on the next page. We released $2.1 billion this quarter driven by less severe downside scenarios as the macro environment continues to normalize. Reserves stand at 20.5 billion, which still accounts for elevated uncertainties surrounding COVID, and the current labor market dynamics, including the exploration of expanded unemployment benefits.  Now moving to balance sheet and capital on Page 4, we ended the quarter with a CG1 ratio of 12.9% down modestly primarily on higher RWA. The firm distributed $8 billion of capital to shareholders this quarter, including 5 billion of net repurchases and the common dividend was increased to $1 per share. With that, let's move on to our businesses starting with Consumer and Community Banking on page 5.  CCB reported net income of 4.3 billion, including reserve releases of 950 million on revenue of $12.5 billion down 3% year-on-year. Deposits were up 3% quarter-on-quarter, indicating some deceleration as excess deposits are stabilizing. Notably contributing to this growth, we ranked number 1 in retail deposit share based on the FDIC data, and we're the only large bank to show meaningful share growth up 70 basis points year-on-year. Similarly, client investment assets were up 29% year-on-year. And while market performance was a driver, retail flows in both advisor and digital channels were strong. Touching on spend, combined credit and debit spend was up 24% versus the third quarter of '19 and in line with last quarter, within that data, travel, and entertainment spend was up 8% versus 3Q '19, and very closely track the patterns of the Delta variant within the quarter, softening in August and early September, and reaccelerating in recent weeks.  Card outstanding's were up 1% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter, benefiting from higher new account originations. And while the payment rate is still very elevated, it's come down from the highs and revolving balances have stabilized. And when we look inside our data, we see evidence of excess deposits starting to normalize in segments of the population that traditionally revolve. So as a result, we're optimistic about the growth prospects of revolving card balances. Moving to home lending. Average loans or down 6% year-on-year, but up 2% quarter-on-quarter with portfolio additions now outpacing prepayments. It was another strong quarter for originations totaling nearly 42 billion, up 43% year-on-year, reflecting record purchase volume and share gains in the refi market. And in Auto, we had 11.5 billion of originations, second only to last quarter's record.  So overall, loans PPP, were up 3% quarter-on-quarter on the growth in card and home lending I just mentioned Expenses 7.2 billion, were up 5% year-on-year, driven by investments in the business, including marketing. And more generally, we continue to see that the acceleration in digital adoption during the pandemic has persisted with active mobile users up 10% year-on-year to almost 45 million.  So with that, looking forward, we are encouraged by our household growth and balance sheet trends. However, we expect it to take some time for revolving credit card balances to return to pre-pandemic levels, given the amount of liquidity in the system. In the meantime, credit losses and delinquencies remain extraordinary low. In card on a year-to-date basis versus 2019, low charge-offs more than offset lower NII.  Next, the corporate and investment bank on Page 6, CIB reported net income of $5.6 billion on revenue of 12.4 billion. Investment banking revenue of $3 billion was up 45% versus the prior year, and down 12%, sequentially. IB fees were up 52% year-on-year, driven by strong performance in advisory and equity underwriting and we maintained our number 1 rank with a year-to-date wallet share of 9.4%. An advisory was an all-time record quarter benefiting from the surge in M&A activity, and we almost tripled fees year on year in a market that doubled. Debt underwriting fees were up 3% driven by an active leveraged loan market primarily linked to acquisition financing.  And in equity underwriting, fees were up 41% primarily driven by our strong performance and IPOs. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, the overall pipeline is healthy and the M&A market is expected to remain active. And if so, IBTs should be up year-on-year, but down sequentially. Moving to Markets, total revenue was 6.3 billion, down 5% compared to a record third quarter last year.  Notably, we were up 24% from 2019, driven by the continued strong performance in equities and spread products. Fixed income was down 20% year-on-year due to ongoing normalization across products, particularly in commodities, as well as an adjustment to liquidity assumptions in our derivatives portfolio.  Equities was up 30%, a record third quarter, with strength across regions and, and reflecting higher balances in prime, strong client activity in cash, as well as ongoing momentum in derivatives. In terms of outlook, keep in mind that it will be a difficult compare against the record fourth quarter last year.  But the current environment continues to challenge our ability to forecast revenues. Wholesale payments revenue of $1.6 billion was up 22% or up 10% excluding gains on strategic equity investments. And the year-on-year growth was driven by higher deposits and fees, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Security Services revenue of 1.1 billion was up 9%, primarily driven by growth in fees on higher market levels.  Expenses of 5.9 billion or flat year-on-year as higher structural and volume and revenue-related expense, as well as investments, were offset by lower legal expense. And credit costs were a net benefit of 638 million, driven by the reserve release I mentioned upfront. Moving to commercial banking on Page 7, commercial banking reported net income of $1.4 billion, revenue of 2.5 billion was up 10% year-on-year on higher investment banking and wholesale payments revenue.  Record gross investment banking revenue of $1.3 billion was up 60% primarily driven by increased large deal activity with continued strength in MNA and acquisition-related financing across both corporate client and middle-market banking. Expenses of $1 billion were up 7% year-on-year, predominantly due to investments and higher volume and revenue-related expenses.  Deposits were up 4% sequentially, mainly driven by higher operating balances, and loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter. C & I loans were down 3%, but up 1%, excluding PPP, driven by higher originations. And it's also worth noting that consistent with last quarter, we are seeing a slight uptick in utilization rates in middle market.  And those among larger corporates seem to have stabilized albeit at historically low levels. CRE loans were flat with modestly higher originations in commercial term lending offset by net payoff activity and real estate banking. Finally, credit costs were a net benefit of 363 million, driven by reserve releases with net charge-offs of 6 basis points.  And then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 8. Asset and Wealth Management reported net income of $1.2 billion with pretax margin of 37%, record revenue of 4.3 billion was up 21% year-on-year as higher management fees and growth in deposit and loan balances were partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of 2.8 billion were up 13% year-on-year, largely driven by higher performance-related compensation, as well as distribution fees.  For the quarter net long-term inflows of 33 billion, continue to be positive across all channels, asset classes, and regions, with notable strength in equities and fixed income. AUM of $3 trillion and overall assets of $4.1 trillion, up 17% and 22% year-on-year respectively, were driven by higher market levels and strong net inflows.  And finally, loans were up 3% quarter-on-quarter, with continued strength in custom lending, securities-based lending, and mortgages. While deposits were up 5% sequentially. Turning to corporate on Page 9. Corporate reported a net loss of $817 million, including 383 million of the 566 million tax benefit, that I mentioned upfront. Revenue was a loss of $1.3 billion down 957 million year-on-year.  N II was a loss of 1.1 billion down 372 million, primarily unlimited deployment opportunities as deposit growth continued. And we realized 256 million of net investment securities losses in the quarter compared to 466 million of net gains last year. Expenses of a 160 million were down 559 million year-on-year, primarily driven by the absence of an impairment on a legacy investment in the prior year. On the next page, let's discuss the outlook. Our full-year outlook for 2021 remains largely in line with our previous guidance.  We still expect NII to be approximately $52.5 billion and adjusted expenses to be approximately $71 billion. But as you'll see on the page, we've lowered our outlook for the card net charge-off rate to around 2% as delinquencies remain very low. So to wrap up, we're pleased with this quarter's performance as we approach what we hope is the tail end of the pandemic.  The strengths of the Company, both in terms of our diversified business model, as well as our fortress Balance Sheet, talent and culture, have enabled us to perform well through this difficult period while continuing to serve our clients, customers, and communities. As we look ahead and the environment normalizes, new challenges will undoubtedly arise, but we feel confident with the position of the Company and the strategy going forward. With that, Operator, please open the line to Q&A. Yeah, John. Good question and good catch there. It's true, that is quite a bit of sequential growth. If you do the math, it suggests about 350 million. And in reality, if you think about what we've been saying about the outlook for increased revolving and deployment and so on, The increase is non-intuitively high.  And so just to explain within that, there are a couple of factors. So one, there's actually a meaningful amount of markets and our growth between the third and the fourth quarter, which in general we would sort of encouraging you to ignore. And there's also some sequential increase in NII from PPP forgiveness contributing to the fourth quarter number. If you strip those two out, you still see a little bit of modest growth, which is a little bit more consistent, I think with the overall story that we've been tying, which is that the real acceleration in NII, especially from higher card revolve, is a 2022 item.  In that context, then if you take that sort of lower number and thinking about annualizing that, I think it's fair to assume that that would be a lower-end estimate for the 2022 number in light of what we believe will happen in terms of -- especially card revolve. But obviously, we'll give you a little bit more color about 2022, next quarter. Yeah, totally. At the highest level, I would say that nothing's really changed, meaning we're still all else equal, happy to be patient. We still believe in a robust global recovery. We still are a little bit concerned about inflation, I think relative to the consensus. And all of that contributes to a willingness to be relatively patient about deployment. But it's also fair to say, that relative to last quarter, rates are obviously higher.  We start to see central banks around the world normalizing their policy stance a little bit, so the market-implied rates are coming a little bit more in line with our view and given that, it wouldn't be surprising if we saw some more opportunities for front-end deployment, cash, and cash-like activity, as well as possibly some duration management. Yeah. So let's go through loan growth because obviously, that's one of the areas that everyone's interested in. And so if we start with a card, which is obviously the one that's going to amount of the most in terms of NII impact, as you said, we see some signs of life and we believe that recovery is strongly underway and it seems hopeful like Delta is really fading so that's going to help.  If you just look forward just to the holiday season, we would expect to see normal seasonality, normal growth there. And the question really for Card as we've talked about a lot is whether that growth in spend and in Card outstanding translates into Revolve.  But as I noted in the prepared remarks, when we look inside the data and we look at the customers who have both deposit accounts with us and our Card customers, and we look at those who would typically be the ones that are most inclined to Revolve, we actually do see slightly faster spend down of the excess deposit balances there.  So that makes us relatively optimistic about both the potential for card outstanding to grow with the higher spending, but also for increased revolve and lower pay rates as we go into next year. It's going to take time obviously, but that is the core view. In-home lending, broadly, we expected this quarter's trend with portfolio additions outpacing prepayments to continue.  And then in C&I, which you mentioned, just a reminder, that as you go to the higher end of the spectrum in terms of the size of the C&I customers were eager to lend to them as a key part of the franchise. But from a financial performance perspective, that's more of an outcome rather than a goal.  But we do, as I noted up front, see a little bit of an uptick in utilization rates amongst smaller corporates. So that's consistent with a theme that we've been seeing, which is that the smaller you are, the less likely you are to have benefited from the wide-open Capital Markets, the more likely you are to be borrowing.  We do hear a lot about supply chain issues from that customer segment. So it's going to be interesting to see how that plays out. And then in CRE, we see quite a robust origination pipeline, as we've fully removed any pandemic-related credit pullbacks, and we're leaning into that and we do expect to see a little bit of net loan growth going forward.  And then finally, I would note that we do see some loan growth in markets actually, and we generally discourage you from focusing too much on NII and loan growth within markets, but it is an indicator that there are some opportunities there that we're taking advantage of, in the usual kind of nimble way that you would expect us to do in markets. Yeah. So it's a little bit of an all-of-the-above story I would say. So first of all, we're still in the middle of budgeting and it's sort of a little early to be giving you 2022 expense guidance. We'll do more of that next quarter, but realistically, expenses are going to be up next year. Now, to your point about capital markets-related expenses, it's obviously true that we pay for performance and in light of the very strong performance over the last couple of years in both Banking and Markets, we have seen increased compensation expense on the way up.  And therefore, as a function of the amount of normalization that you see in 2022, you're going to see that come down in line all else equal. Obviously, I would point out, that I think that the amount of growth in that number that we've seen through the pandemic, is less than a lot of people would have expected, actually.  And therefore, on the way back down, you would also potentially expect less participation, not to mention just the timing dynamics associated with the treatment of stock-based compensation investing. So all of that aside, at the same time, we are still investing. We still see significant opportunities.  We still see marketing opportunities in the card, and yeah, labor inflation is a question. You saw us raise wages in parts of the U.S. at the entry level. That just came into effect this September. And as we look out, we see a lot of churns. And as Jamie was saying, it's good stuff, it's normal, it's understandable in this environment, but labor inflation is definitely a watch item for us. So when you put all that stuff together, as I said, we'll update you more next quarter, but that's how we see the expense outlook for next year. Okay, Mike. Hang on. I'm writing doing your questions because I don't want to lose track. Let's start with the Cloud first. Yeah, you will have seen some press coverage around our partnership with Thought Machine. At a high level, there's actually nothing new here. We've actually been committed to the Cloud for a long time.  And by the way, when I say Cloud, I think we're talking about both private and public Cloud. Our core strategy involves really leaning into both and being very nimble across both. And I think that's very important for us as a regulated institution from our resiliency perspective. But the reasons, for do -- and that's all part of our overall tech monetization road map.  And a lot of the investments that we're doing that you've heard all the leadership of the Company talk about. When it comes to Thought Machine in the consumer space, There are five main reasons why we did that and it's all the normal reasons why you do cloud stuff and you do tech monetization.  We want to be able to innovate quickly and bring custom products to consumers faster. We want to be able to run multiple products on the same platform. As I mentioned, resiliency is critical. Increasingly, we want to be able to run the bank much more in real-time rather than based on batch processes.  And obviously, APIs are central to the entire strategy in this environment. So that's what I would say about that. Now -- yes, Jamie. Yeah. Okay. And then Mike, international consumer and acquisitions, I think you asked about. So in terms of international consumers, you will have seen that we launched -- it's obviously early days to give meaningful updates on that, but you will have noted actually that we've just rebranded NutMeg as a JPMorgan Company just a couple of days ago.  So all that's proceeding at pace and it seems to be pretty well received. I think the offering has seen us differentiated and innovative, so we'll have more to say about that over time. Generally -- Yes. That's going to take time for sure. So -- but just more generally, in terms of the acquisition strategy, we've talked about this a little bit before. We're not claiming that we have some overarching top-down acquisition strategy.  I think broadly we are just doing things that make sense. But there are some themes that you can detect around bolt-on and adding capabilities. If -- just for the sake of argument, if you start with AWM, you'll see a pretty consistent theme in there of ESG related capability additions.  You've mentioned already international expansion and the potential for growth, and it will be a long game, as Jamie says. And then, yeah, there's definitely a fintech narrative a little bit in terms of some of the stuff that we've done in the CIB.  And then within the consumer, most recently, the collection of things that we've done I think is unified by the theme of providing more integrated and holistic experiences to our customers. We've always been very proud of the value proposition that we offer, especially in the Card product. But we think we can take it up another notch with some of the stuff that we're doing around lounges and CX loyalty and stuff like that. I think I touched on everything there, Mike. Yeah. I mean, I think reasonable people can differ on how you talk about this stuff, especially in terms of what parts of the expensive space to see us a little bit more fixed versus a little bit more floating.  I would've said that in reality, marginal expense increases as a function of most types of marginal revenue are actually lower than a lot of people think. So the operating leverage that you see, especially in the type of environment that we've had with really big increases in revenue on the capital markets areas and on the NRR site is actually relatively consistent with what I would've expected, but a little bit to your point, Mike, what's also true is that we're a big organization.  There's a scale play here. We have a big fixed cost base and a lot of the modernization agenda is about making sure that that doesn't creep and that it's as expensive as possible so that it can be as nimble as possible. And that marginal efficiency over time is as good as possible. But that's a long play there. Yes. Ken. You're right. Part of the drop in the revenue rate this quarter is a function of higher card marketing spend, which you would have expected. As a result of what we said last quarter in terms of the importance of getting our fair share of the growth and spending as we emerge from the pandemic and the fact that we're out in the market with a lot of offers that are seeing good uptake and we're seeing nice growth there.  So that's expected. And I think that card marketing number will actually remain elevated. And if anything ticks up a little bit sequentially, just based on how the amortization there works. So you should expect to see that continue.  But in addition, this quarter we have an adjustment to the rewards liability, which is contributing to the drop this quarter as well. So that is not something that we see continuing. So that should come out of the run rate as we look forward. I mean, we don't really manage the Card revenue rate, so it's not a number that I'm eager to guide to. But I think the -- if I remember correctly, I think the rewards liability adjustment this quarter was of the order of something like 180 million, so we'll confirm that, but I think that's right. Yeah. So Betsy, in short, it's really the latter. So the only thing that is one-time - ish in nature, for lack of a better term, is the rewards liability adjustment. And the rest of it really is marketing spend.  And we see that as a critical investment at this moment to moment of high engagement with the product, and we're very committed to making those investments. And so that is going to remain elevated. And if anything, tick off a little bit as we look forward. Yeah. So I think, obviously, we're a little disappointed that we haven't seen some of the changes on the non-risk sensitive size-based constraints that we'd expected, but we're still hopeful that that will come soon.  We know the staff is hard at work on the [Indiscernible] endgame, and that's complicated stuff and it may be the case that some of those things are connected.  And our strategy on pref issuance has been to try to balance giving ourselves the capacity that we want to deal with the SLR constrain, without over issuing and therefore being stuck with a high-cost product that isn't callable for 5 years.  So that's part of the reason why we're operating a little bit above our CET1 target right now, and we're just going to continue to be nimble in that respect. Yes. Thanks, Glenn. So BNPL, everyone's talking about it. It is funny how layaway is back in the e-commerce checkout land. But -- and obviously, we're looking at it. Everyone is talking about it and it's a moment for us as a Company where even though for any given thing that's emerging, you can easily convince yourself that it's kind of not a threat.  We're in a moment of taking all types of potential disruptions, especially [Indiscernible] type disruptions quite seriously. And in the case of BNPL, it's obviously particularly high profile because of the growth that we've seen, although it's a relatively small portion of the overall market.  I will remind you that we have our own very compelling offerings that speak directly to the installment payment experience in the form of My Chase Loan and My Chase Plan, which we get really good feedback on the customer experience there in terms of the post-purchase experience. You can select eligible purchases on the app and then move that to an installment plan if you want. But yeah, we acknowledge that it is downstream of the point-of-sale, which potentially raises some questions about whether we should be looking at moving a little bit more upstream there.  But even more generally when you take a step back, what we're really trying to do in the consumer business here, is think about what is the actual customer need that is driving the growth and BNPL and how can we respond to it in a strategic holistic way across all of our customers, and not too narrowly and too reactively, just respond to BNPL, but it's, obviously, a thing that we're looking at it and it's quite interesting. Yeah. So look, obviously, everyone is looking at Evergrande. Let me start by just saying that, for us, in terms of direct Evergrande exposure is absolute de minimis. So that's one piece. As you would expect, we've also looked at more indirect exposures in terms of the broad China property sector, as well as exposures of financial institutions that we deal with, to the China property sector, and in general, those exposures are all very modest.  So we're, obviously, watching it closely and continuing to look for reading across and do what you would expect us to do, but we're not terribly concerned right now about the impact on us.  I think, in terms of cross-border contagion, I don't hold my own opinion on this in particularly high regard, but it does seem like this was pretty well telegraphed by the Chinese authorities when they talked about their three red lines. So it's a process that's being managed. And I would say the better view right now is that it will be contained. But of course, it's the market, so we'll see what happens. Yes. So, the answer to how important buybacks are that they're at the end of our capital hierarchy we often say, right. So organic growth, including acquisitions, sustainable dividends, and only then do we look at buybacks. And in light of the SCB environment that we're in, where we don't have a Fed-approved buyback plan anymore and we just simply have to comply with the minimums and BAU, that gives us quite a bit of nimbleness, which is an important thing to preserve in light of a world where we do hope for loan growth next year and where acquisitions are still potentially on the horizon. So nothing really going on in this quarter other than a little bit of RWA growth in the denominator and we're just really going to stay nimble there. Good question, Steve. But I think you're sort of potentially leading me into giving fairly detailed loan growth guidance for 2022, which I -- I'm not really in a position to do. But let me see if I can answer this at a high level. I mean, we've talked a lot about Spend, which we believe in, driving Card loans higher, so that's one piece.  And the Revolve story within that as a function of the spend down and cash buffers, especially in our revolver -- the revolving segment of our customers. And obviously, as you know well if you think about our NII as the sum product of the NIM and the outstandings in the various loan categories, it is really disproportionately Card that drives things.  In the meantime, if you move a little bit away from consumer to the larger wholesale system. In a world where, even if tapering sorts relatively soon, if that plays out over roughly 8 months at $15 billion of decrease a month, you still, if you do the math, wind up with another $0.5 trillion of QE.  So we're dealing with a system that has a lot of surplus liquidity. And so in that context, realistically, it's hard to imagine seeing a lot of wholesale loan growth at a minimum. But. frankly, that's not really a big driver of performance for us. So I don't know if that helps, but it's a good question. I could help unpack it, but it would take another 20 minutes which we don't really have. It's just bog-standard liquidity evaluation type stuff in the derivatives book in terms of as we revise our assumptions about what the potential transaction costs would be associated with transferring certain types of positions. It's normal course stuff that just happened to be a little bit bigger. I think fixed income was down 20% and I think without that it would have been down 15%. So if that helps. Yes. So I think there's a lot of factors that play into what the deployment decision is at any given moment. Obviously, as you said, loan growth, but also we will always make these decisions on the long-term economic basis, not for the purpose of generating short-term NII.  And so when you do that, you have to think about capital volatility, drawdowns, and frankly, whether or not you see the value. And that if anything is probably the biggest single factor right now. As I talked about earlier, it is true that the market has come a little bit more in line with our views, at least from a rate perspective. And that may lead to a little bit more deployment, all else equal right now. but when you start talking about spread product, for example, in light of the liquidity environment that we're in and the QE numbers that I mentioned a second ago, that remains very, very compressed, and there's just not a lot of value there. So we always try to be long-term economically motivated there, considering all the scenarios, considering risk management, considering the convexity of the balance sheet, and looking at value and being tactical there. So that's really how I would think about that. No, I get the question. Yeah. I mean, I get the question. I get why you want to know, I guess, I just think, for a Company of our sophistication and given how carefully we think about this stuff, the idea of a particular target at which we would deploy a particular amount. Of course, Jamie is right, but it's always going to be situational, it's always going to be a function of why the rate is where it is.  I mean, in your question you alluded to it, it's like if the 10-year note's at 3, and we're sure it's not going to 5, but then where's the rest of the yield curve, what are the other options, what's going on in that moment. So we're always going to be situational and tactical about it. Yeah. So I think, I mean, the thing about the Basel III End Game is that you need to essentially deal simultaneously with the Basel floors -- the Basel standardized floors and the Collins floor. So you need to simultaneously -- so from the perspective of the staff that's working on this stuff, they have a tough challenge to simultaneously put in place the U.S. rule, which is Basel compliant, while also complying with the Collins floor standardized or WA minimum.  And so that's complicated and it's hard and it's quite technical and that sort of explains why it's taking a little bit longer than we might have all otherwise thought. In terms of the impact of that on our long-term growth, I mean at a high level, it's unlikely to be significant.  I think the related point is whether or not there are some changes as part of that or contemporaneously with that to these non-risk sensitive size-based constraints like G7 SLR, where obviously, most prominently in the case of GSIB, it's really getting pretty extreme in terms of the growth in the score for reasons that really have nothing to do with what the original design of the metric was.  And to a very significant degree are driven by the expansion of the system that we've seen in the last 18 months. So that's why we believe that that should be addressed as was contemplated in the original role. And so across all of those potential changes, you could see us doing a little bit of optimization in response to those.  You can imagine that Basel III endgame in terms of standardized and advanced and the impact on different products might make some things a little bit more capital efficient and others a little bit less capital efficient at the margin. But we're a big diversified Company. We're pretty good at navigating this stuff. So when we have clarity, we'll make the necessary tweaks. I think there's a couple of factors in here. So let's, for the sake of argument, set our RP aside for a second and hold that constant -- if you just look at the impact of QE on system-wide deposits, we talked about tapering, but as I said earlier, tapering still involves another 0.5 trillion of system expansion between now and the end of tapering, or rather between the start of tapering and the end of tapering.  If the Fed follows the same type of trajectory that it followed last time, there would be an extended pause between the end of QE and the beginning of QT. And again, setting our IPO aside for a second, it would only really be with the beginning of QT that you would expect the size of the system deposit base to start shrinking, and I think the timing the last time if I remember correctly, was something like 22 months between the end of QE and the beginning of QT.  Now, of course, RP could bounce around and there could be other factors, but at a high level, that's how we're thinking about it. So the plan is on schedule moving date 20, I think 2025. There is no material expense, of course, it's duplicate expenses and we got to sell the building, stuff like that, but nothing material to our shareholder. We need to disclose. Operator, are there any other questions? Yeah. I think the base case -- the central case has probably actually gotten a tiny bit worse quarter-on-quarter in light of the revisions and GDP outlook. But as you know, the framework also involves looking at probability-weighted scenarios. And as I said in the prepared remarks, the less extreme downside scenarios contributed a bit to the release this quarter.  In terms of sizing the overall balance, again, as I said in the prepared remarks, they remain a little bit elevated relative to what they would be if we had this type of economic performance with none of the COVID -related unusual features, i.e. uncertainty about the virus as much as we are optimistic about that right now, or uncertainty about labor market conditions, or the fact that even though a lot of the -- essentially all the federal level unemployment assistance has now rolled off and most of the states have too.  There are still some forms of assistance. The mortgage foreclosure moratorium, student loan stuff, rent moratoria, stuff like that, that don't roll off until later in the year. So there's a number of factors in the environment that are still unusual, which do contribute to slightly elevated reserves relative to what we would otherwise have. And as things play out, those will develop. All right. Thanks, Jamie. Okay. Thanks very much."

            "name": "Jamie Dimon",
            "content": "Thought Machine is, basically, the core general ledger. It's not all the other stuff around the consumer. And when you do these conversions different than conversions in the past, you can do them -- you could schedule pieces, do part at a time, not all at once, like a big bang, which we used to have to do when we did big merge and stuff like that. So it's -- put it at a lower risk for the Company. But the core strategy hasn't changed at all. I just again, this is -- this is a 10-year game plan. This is not, they're going to worry that much about metrics in the next month or two. And with this the long-term work to try to get this thing right because if we're ever going to be retail overseas, it's going to be digital. And so we're going to be very patient. and at one point Mike, we will report some metrics so you can see them, but they're not going to be material to the firm's numbers for years. And Mike, one of the things you think about, one is you people worried about the forecast for next year and stuff like that. We're playing the game for ten years here. So we're going to -- and we're not going to disclose certain things, like, margin byproduct or something like that because it's competitive information.  But in the long game, we're competing with some very large, talented, global players, who are not even in banking today. And we are going to compete in that. So even some of these acquisitions are more around that, than around what I consider traditional banking.  And so -- in my whole life, just so you know, we've been modernizing technology, Every year of every month of every quarter, that's like a permanent state of affairs. Obviously, now it's to the Cloud and stuff like that. Those things are critical to do to be competitive going forward. That was true, by the way, 20 years ago. I'm not hearing much different than you're hearing. I'm just -- I know that the over-focus over time is so extraordinary sometimes in the press, that people forget the big picture. The economy's going 4 or 5%. What people are buying is changed, which has also hurt supply chains a little bit.  There's not one Company I know who's not working aggressively to fix the supply chain issues. Sales are still up, credit card debit card spends still up because it was in great shape. And capitalism works. I doubt we'll be talking about supply chain stuff in a year. I just think that [Indiscernible] we're focusing on too much is simply dampening a fairly good economy. It's not reversing a fairly good economy. I think it's another example of growth in the Company. You saw a firm come out and it's no longer just about BNPL. They're going to have a debit card and attached banking accounts. So these are all different forms of competition which we have to respond to. And so that's why when we talked about, like, expenses, we will spend whatever we have to spend to compete with all these folks in our space. I don't expect that there will be beneficial changes that help banks. And, I think, that we just have to compete with what we're -- the hand we're dealt, and not expect anything like that. And I think that you're going to have some people clamp down more in banks and maybe some people regulate fintech based on products or service, something like that. But I'm not expecting any relief. Yeah, I [Indiscernible] evaluations -- as the stock goes up, you're going to -- you should expect to one day buy less. And we don't need dry powder, we have an extraordinary amount of capital liquidity. I mean extraordinary, and we earned 40 billion pre-tax a year. I mean, how much dry powder do you need? We have $1.6 trillion of cash and marketable securities. We have 200 -- well over 200 billion of equity. We can issue prefers, we can issue debt, we can issue stock if we had to do something. So I don't think we need dry powder. I think our capital cup runneth over where it is. We could easily do 200 billion. The capital impact in total isn't that big a deal and we're not going to disclose any more nor is the immediate financial impact. And each one is different. So in Consumer, Jeremy already said, it's more about lifestyle, travel, lounges, millennial, stuff like that.  In asset management of products, there was [Indiscernible] products, ESG products, timber products, stuff like that. And then between NutMeg and C6 and stuff like that, that is a longer-term view of us trying to get positioned into retail overseas over 10 years if we can. I will just add my two cents. I think that they'll have to go quicker than that, and they'll have to reverse some of it. So you're talking about we're still going to increase deposits for a year, and then there will be a fairly large reduction over a 2 or 3-year period, which we should be prepared for. Yeah, I think we should look at the big picture here, which, I think, is always important. I mean, 2 years ago we were facing COVID, virtually a great depression, global pandemic. And that's all in the back mirror, which is good. So by hopefully a year from now, there will be no supply chain problems.  The pandemic will become endemic. and I think it's very good to have good healthy growth, which we have. And it'll be good to have unemployment of 4%, it's good that their jobs are open, I think it's good that wages went up [Indiscernible], and I think there's too much focus on -- and none of these changes how we run the business, which to we add clients all the time.  Consumer, card, auto, deposits, real estate, small business, large companies, and stuff like that, which is the underlying thing to drive JPMorgan. It's not whether they take your revolver from 25% to 27%. So having said all that, and I'm not focused on inflation; we simply have pointed out -- well, you have [Indiscernible] inflation. It's 4%. It's been 4% now for the better part of a couple of quarters and it's, in my view, unlikely to be lower than that next quarter or the quarter after that.  Another question is, does it start to ease after that with supply chains and wages? More people looking for work or does it continue to go up? And of course, we prepare for probabilities and eventualities and one of those probabilities is that it might go higher than people think and they'll have to tamp down.  I doubt that will happen before late 2022. In the meantime, I think it's unbelievable that we're getting out of this and we have 4% unemployment, and you can have good growth with some inflation, and that's okay. I think that people are always focusing too much on immediate concerns. If you have inflation of 4% or 5%, we're still going to open deposit accounts, checking accounts, and grow our business.  I also should point out because it's always in the back of my mind, about $30 billion of revenues, 20 billion in subscription revenues. Asset Management, commercial banking, consumer banking, which are pretty good.  Wholesale payments, security services, custody, and so we're pretty crowded with the people who've accomplished all this, that if you look at the actual underlying numbers to getting earnings per second, more customers, more accounts, more share. And at the end of the day, that is what drives everything. It's not -- I'm telling you. I don't -- I'm sorry, [Indiscernible] I don't know. We're prepared for all eventualities. There may be effect Gelb inflation. And the one other thing about our balance sheet, you guys talked about, putting your stuff like that. One of the stack tails of banks do, that are banks should be worried about is high inflation and high rates. And we have been very liquid, protects us more than against that and other things. Jeremy, just to interrupt real quickly. I got to go because I am out of town I have meetings I have to go to. You guys should continue and folks, thanks for listening to us and we'll talk to you all soon."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your lines will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.\nJeremy Barnum: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Before we get going, I\u2019d just like to say how honored I am to be on my first earnings call following the footsteps of Marianne and Jen, both of whom taught me so much during my time working for them and whose shoes will be very difficult to fill, but I'm going to try. So with that, this presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on page one. The Firm reported net income of $11.9 billion, EPS of $3.78 on revenue of $31.4 billion and delivered a return on tangible common equity of 23%. These results include $3 billion of credit reserve releases, which I'll cover in more detail shortly. Touching on a few highlights. Combined debit and credit spend was up 45% year on year and more importantly up 22% versus the more normal pre-COVID second quarter of 2019. It was an all-time record for IB fees, up 25% year on year, driven by advisory and debt underwriting. We saw particularly strong growth in AWM with record long-term flows as well as record revenue. And finally, credit continues to be quite healthy as evidenced by our exceptionally low net charge-offs across the board. Regarding our balance sheet, the trends from recent quarters have largely continued. Deposits are up 23% year on year and 4% sequentially, and loan growth remains low, flat year-on-year and up 1% quarter-on-quarter, although we have bright spots in certain pockets, and the consumer spend trends are encouraging. So, now turning to page 2 for more detail. As I go through this page, I'm going to provide you some context about the prior-year quarter because the year-on-year comparisons are a bit noisy. So, with respect to revenue, the second quarter of 2020 was an all-time record for markets with revenue of over $9.7 billion, and we recorded approximately $700 million of gains in our bridge book. With that in mind, revenue of $31.4 billion was down $2.4 billion or 7% year-on-year. Non-interest revenue was down $1.3 billion or 7% due to the prior year items I just mentioned, partially offset by strong fee generation in Investment Banking and AWM as well as from card-related fees on higher spend. And net interest income was down $1.1 billion or 8%, driven by lower markets NII and lower balances in card. Expenses of $17.7 billion were up 4% year-on-year, largely on continued investments. And then on credit costs, going back to last year again, you will recall, in last year's second quarter, we built $8.9 billion in credit reserves during the height of the pandemic, whereas this year, we released $3 billion. So in this quarter, credit costs were a net benefit of $2.3 billion. And setting aside the reserve release, it's also worth noting that net charge-offs of just over $700 million were half of last year's second quarter number and continue to trend near historical lows. On the next page, let's go over the reserves. We released $3 billion this quarter as we grow increasingly confident about the economy in light of continued improvement in COVID, especially in the U.S. In Consumer, we released $2.6 billion, including $1.8 billion in Card and $600 million in Home Lending. And in Wholesale, we released nearly $450 million. So, this leaves us with reserves of $22.6 billion, which as a result of elevated remaining uncertainty about COVID and the shape of the economic recovery are higher than would otherwise be implied by our central economic forecasts. Now, moving to balance sheet and capital on page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13%, down slightly versus the prior quarter as net growth in retained earnings was more than offset by higher RWA across both retail and wholesale lending. This quarter also reflects the expiration of the temporary SLR exclusions. And as we anticipated, leverage is now a binding constraint. As you know, we finished CCAR a couple of weeks ago and our SCB will be 3.2%, which reflects the Board's intention to increase the dividend to $1 per share in the third quarter. Okay, now let's go to our businesses starting with Consumer & Community Banking on page 5. CCB reported net income of $5.6 billion, including reserve releases of $2.6 billion on revenue of $12.8 billion, up 3% year-on-year. Of particular note this quarter is the acceleration of card spend. And so, while card outstandings remained lower than pre-pandemic levels, this quarter's trends made us optimistic. Total debit and credit spend was up 45% year-on-year, and more importantly, up 22% versus the second quarter of '19. And within that, compared to 2019, June total spend was up 24%, indicating some healthy acceleration throughout the quarter. And travel and entertainment has really turned the corner with spend flat versus the second quarter of '19, accelerating from down 11% in April to actually up 13% in June. The rest of the CCB story remains consistent with prior quarters. Consumer and small business cash balances remain elevated, resulting in depressed loan growth. Overall loans were down 3% year-on-year from continued elevated prepayments in mortgage and on lower card outstandings, partially offset by strong growth in Auto and the impact of PPP. Home Lending and Auto continued to have strong originations with Home Lending up 64% to $40 billion, the highest quarterly figure since the third quarter of 2013, and Auto up 61% to a record $12.4 billion. Deposits were up 25% year-on-year or approximately $200 billion, and client investment assets were up 36%, driven by market appreciation and positive net flows across our advisor and digital channels. And our omnichannel strategy continues to deliver. We are more than halfway through our initial market expansion commitment as we have opened more than 200 new branches out of our goal of 400, which have exceeded our expectations by generating $7 billion in deposits and investments. And we are planning to be in all 48 contiguous states by the end of the summer. Digital trends continue to be strong as retail mobility recovers at a faster pace than branch transactions, which are still down more than 20% versus 2019. Active mobile users grew 10% year-on-year to over 42 million, and total digital transactions per engaged customer were up 12%. Expenses of $7.1 billion were up 4% year-on-year, driven by continued investments and higher volume and revenue-related expenses. Looking forward, the obvious question is the outlook for loan growth, especially in card. And we are quite optimistic that the current spend trends will convert into resumption of loan growth through the end of this year and into next. And while we wait, the exceptionally low level of net charge-offs provides a substantial offset to the NII headwind. Next, the Corporate & Investment Bank on page 6. CIB reported net income of $5 billion and an ROE of 23% on revenue of $13.2 billion. IB fees of $3.6 billion were up 25% year-on-year and up 20% quarter-on-quarter, an all-time record, driven by advisory and debt underwriting, leading to a year-to-date global IB wallet share of 9.4% and a number 1 ranking. In advisory, we were up 52% year-on-year, benefiting from the surge in announcement activity that has continued into the second quarter. Debt underwriting fees were up 26%, driven by an active acquisition finance market, offset by lower investment-grade issuance. And in equity underwriting, fees were up 9%, primarily driven by a strong performance in IPOs. The resulting Investment Banking revenue of $3.4 billion was roughly flat year-on-year due to the headwind of the prior year's markup in the bridge book. Looking ahead to the third quarter, the pipeline remains very strong. We expect M&A activity and the IPO market to remain active. And while IB fees are likely to be down sequentially, we still expect them to be up year-on-year. Moving to markets. Total revenue was $6.8 billion, down 30% compared to an all-time record quarter last year. While normalization has been more prevalent in macro, overall, we ran above 2019 levels throughout the quarter on the back of strong client activity, outperforming our own expectations from earlier in the year. Fixed income was down 44% compared to last year's exceptional results, but up 11% compared to the second quarter of '19. Equity markets was up 13%, driven by record balances in prime as well as strong performance in cash and equity derivatives, where we matched last year's great results. Looking forward, while we expect normalization to continue across both, Investment Banking and markets, and most notably in fixed income, the timing and the extent of the normalization is obviously hard to predict. Wholesale Payments revenue was $1.5 billion, up 5% driven by higher deposits and fees, largely offset by deposit margin compression. And security services revenue was $1.1 billion, down 1%, as deposit margin compression was predominantly offset by growth in deposits and fees. Expenses of $6.5 billion were down 4% year-on-year, driven by lower performance-related compensation, partially offset by higher volume-related expense. Moving to Commercial Banking on Page 7. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.4 billion and an ROE of 23%. Revenue of $2.5 billion was up 3% year-on-year with higher Investment Banking, Lending and Wholesale Payments revenue, largely offset by lower deposit revenue and the absence of a prior year equity investment gain. Record gross Investment Banking revenue of $1.2 billion was up 37% on increased M&A and acquisition-related financing activity compared to prior year lows. Expenses of $981 million were up 10% year-on-year, driven by higher volume and revenue-related expenses and investments. Deposits of $290 billion were up 22% year-on-year as client balances remain elevated. Loans of $2.5 billion were down 12% year-on-year, driven by lower revolver utilization compared to the prior year quarter and down 1% sequentially. C&I loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter with lower utilization, partially offset by new loan activity in middle market. And CRE loans were down 1%, but we saw pockets of growth in affordable housing activity. Finally, credit costs were a net benefit of $377 million, driven by reserve releases with net charge-offs of only 1 basis point. And to complete our lines of business, on to Asset & Wealth Management on page 8. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.2 billion with pretax margin of 37% and an ROE of 32%. Record revenue of $4.1 billion was up 20% year-on-year as higher management fees and growth in deposit and loan balances were partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $2.6 billion were up 11% year-on-year driven by higher performance-related compensation and distribution expenses. For the quarter, net long-term inflows of $49 billion continued to be positive across all channels, with notable strength in equities, fixed income and alternatives. AUM was $3 trillion. And for the first time, overall client assets were over $4 trillion, up 21% and 25% year-on-year, respectively, driven by higher market levels and strong net inflows. And finally, loans were up 21% year-on-year, with continued strength in securities-based lending, custom lending and mortgages, while deposits were up 37%. Turning to Corporate on page 9. Corporate reported a net loss of $1.2 billion. Revenue was a loss of $1.2 billion, down $415 million year-on-year. NII was down $274 million primarily on limited deployment opportunities as deposit growth continued, and we realized $155 million of net investment securities losses in the quarter. Expenses of $515 million were up $368 million year-on-year. So with that, on page 10, the outlook. Our 2021 NII outlook of around $52.5 billion remains in line with the updated guidance we provided last month. But, as you'll note, we've also lowered our outlook for the card net charge-off rate to less than 250 basis points, which, as I mentioned in CCB, provides a meaningful offset to the NII headwind. And it's worth mentioning that the current environment makes forecasting NII even in the near term unusually challenging. So, while $52.5 billion remains our current central case, you should expect some elevated uncertainty around that number, not only because of the ongoing impact of stimulus on consumer balance sheets, but also due to volatility coming from markets, among other things. And as a reminder, most of any fluctuation in markets NII, whether up or down, is likely to be offset in NIR. On expenses, we've increased our guidance to approximately $71 billion, driven by higher volume and revenue-related expenses. So, to wrap up, we are encouraged by the continued progress against the virus and the economic recovery that is underway, especially in the United States. Although we want to acknowledge the challenges that much of the rest of the world is facing and we're hopeful that a global recovery will follow closely behind. Our performance this quarter once again showcases the power of our diversified business model as headwinds in NII from consumer delevering are offset by strong fee generation across AWM and CIB, and exceptionally low net charge-offs across the board. While we're proud of the performance of the Company and of our people through the crisis, the competition in every business from banks, fintechs and others is as intense as ever. So, as we look forward to an increasingly normal environment, we are enthusiastically focused on competing for every piece of share in every market, product and business where we operate and making the necessary investments to win. With that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is coming from the line Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI.\nJeremy Barnum: Hi Glenn.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi there. Hi Jeremy. Welcome. Welcome to the party.\nJeremy Barnum: Thank you very much.\nGlenn Schorr: Question on NII if I could, and I apologize if it's a little multifaceted. But so even though we're getting some inflationary data and you're possibly inclined on economy as it might, rates fell. I'm not sure you want to opine on why, but let's talk about you kept the NII guide, I'm assuming, because deposit growth is strong. Curious your thoughts on consumer payment rates staying at this elevated level, deposit growth staying at this elevated level? And then most importantly, if you're managing the balance sheet any differently, meaning you had been slow playing putting money to work, rates are even lower now, are you still slow playing putting money to work? I appreciate it. Thanks.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. Thanks, Glenn. All right. So, let's sort of take that in parts. So, in terms of our NII guidance, so yes, so we're reiterating $52.5 billion for the full year. So, just to take your deployment point first, obviously, rates are a little bit lower, long end rates are a bit lower. The curve has flattened a little bit since we provided that guidance. But when we provided that guidance, we were reasonably conservative in our deployment assumptions through the rest of the year. So, as a result of that, it's not really a meaningful factor sort of at the level of precision that we\u2019re talking about here. In terms of the consumer side, as you say, obviously it's really card is really going to be the big driver. So, you heard us talking about payment rates, and you see the sequential growth in card loans. So, we do believe that the sort of acceleration in the pickup in spend is going to translate to, as I say, a resumption of loan growth in card. But, we do think that pay rates are going to remain quite elevated at a minimum through the end of this year. So, as a result, we don't really see revolving interest-bearing balances increasing meaningfully this year. And so, as a result, that remains a headwind for the overall NII for this year, which is incorporated in the outlook.\nGlenn Schorr: Okay. And then, in terms of managing balance sheet any differently in terms of putting money to work, are you still conservative on that front?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. Look, I mean, I think you've heard us talk about this before, right? So, our central case, from an economic perspective, is for a very robust recovery. And that's pretty much a consensus view between us, our research team, the Fed, et cetera. And that view is associated with higher inflation, along the lines of the Fed's own targets for higher inflation. All those things together -- it's an outlook that's associated with higher rates, all else equal. And so, in light of all that, we do remain happy to stay patient here. And if you look at our EIR disclosure, which you obviously won't see until you get the Q, but some of you guys have written about this recently, our overall sensitivities here are kind of in line with the industry. So when you consider kind of the tail type things that Jamie always talks about, the complexity of the balance sheet and various other factors, we do still feel that being patient here makes sense.\nGlenn Schorr: Okay. And just one quickie on the recent both acquisitions and investments, and you or Jamie could feel free to take it. I'm curious on A, big picture, is it just coincidence that there's been five things within a very short period of time? And maybe if you want to expand on maybe net mix specifically and why the change in terms of shying away from international expansion in the past and now making a little bit better move in. I appreciate it. Thanks.\nJeremy Barnum: Sure, Glenn. So, let me start with the international expansion point on the consumer side because that's interesting. You've heard Jamie over the years talk about why it wouldn't really make sense to do international expansion in consumer when you think about that through the lens of branch-based strategy. So, if you imagine, going outside of the U.S. and opening branches in other countries and competing with the incumbents, just from a branding perspective, from an operating leverage perspective, we've never felt that, that was likely to be a successful strategy for us, and that hasn't really changed. The difference right now is the ability to do that digital. So, what's really particularly exciting about the international expansion narrative both in the UK and now with our recent investment in C6 in Brazil, is the ability to kind of experiment a little bit. Obviously, it's a strategically compelling opportunity. Brazil, as you probably know, is like the third biggest consumer banking market in the world, but it's kind of fun to be the disruptor. And so, I think for us, given our position in consumer banking in the United States, being in a place where we are actually the outsider disrupting through these kind of digital channels, we see it among other things, in addition to being compelling financially, as a really good opportunity to learn and to challenge ourselves a little bit from the inside. So, we're very excited about that stuff.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of John McDonald from Autonomous Research.\nJohn McDonald: Good morning, Jeremy. I wanted to ask you about capital. You mentioned leverage is now the binding constraint. And Jen has previously talked about a 12% CET1 target. I guess, could you talk about the multiple variables that you're balancing as you guys decide what capital levels to run at? You've got a rising G-SIB score, an SLR cushion that's shrinking, but maybe the rules get revised. And obviously, in SCB, that came down a little bit, but maybe you're hoping for more. How are you wrapping that all together into what kind of capital levels to target?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. It's a good question, John, and yes, there are a lot of variables. So, let me start by saying that in terms of a 12% target, it's not off the table is what I'll say about that, meaning 12%, it's not necessarily -- doesn't necessarily need to be higher. So for now, it's not off the table. But, the element of time, i.e. when are we bound by what, matters quite a bit as you think about this. So, just to go through some of the pieces, you've noted the GSIB point. So, we're in the 4% bucket now as of the end of last year. That comes into play in 2023. We're currently operating in 4.5. As you know, that's quite a seasonal number. So, it's still possible to get under 4.5 for the end of this year. But, we have to acknowledge an elevated probability, I would say, of landing in 4.5 bucket this year. But, the 4.5 bucket would be binding in 2024. And as you noted, in the meantime, we're bound by SLR. And we've been quite public about our views about these things, about the extent to which, increasingly, our capital requirements are driven by non-risk sensitive size-based measures, which were really designed, especially in the case of SLR, as backstops, which the Fed has acknowledged. So, our priority right -- and the Fed has talked about potentially addressing some of these things. We know we're waiting for an NPR on SLR, but also, they've said that a potential G-SIB fix could come as part of the holistic implementation of the Basel III end game. So, there's a lot of things that are going to play out between now and some of those minimums becoming binding. And realistically, right now, we're going to be operating above 12% anyway in light of the leverage bound in all likelihood. So, we're managing a variety of different factors, near term, short term, props, common, et cetera. And we're just going to try to be nimble about it as more information comes out over the next few quarters.\nJamie Dimon: If I could make a further point, we have tons of capital, $200 billion of CET1, $35 billion of preferred, $300 billion of long-term debt, only $1 trillion of loans, which is the riskiest asset we have, and $1.5 trillion of cash and marketable securities. So, the underlying thing is there's just tons of capital in the system. And I think one day, if you\u2019re going to look at and say, why so much, to the liquid side.\nJohn McDonald: Yes. And then, a quick follow-up, Jeremy, on expenses. You revised the fiscal year '21 outlook upward a few times now. Could you give a little more detail on the business volumes and revenues that are driving this? And also, we hear a lot about inflation across the economy. Are we seeing broader inflation play a role in your Company's expenses and outlook?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. So, a couple of things there. So yes, as you note, we have revised up from 70 to 71. And the biggest single driver there is volume and revenue-related expense, where if you -- it is tough. Well, it's...\nJamie Dimon: The comp, we're going to be competitive in comp no matter what it takes. Let's keep that at the back of your mind.\nJeremy Barnum: It is a little bit of comp. It's also transaction-related volumes. It's also marketing expense in certain pockets. So, it's all the stuff that fits in the category of volume and revenue-related. And I think the point is obviously, we're all a little bit focused on the NII headwinds right now. But from an NIR [ph] perspective, across markets, AWM, IB, CIB in general and even pockets, wealth management and CCB, we're actually outperforming the revenue expectations that were built into our prior expense guidance. So that's kind of the dynamic there. In terms of inflation, I would say that we're not seeing inflation in our actuals. But obviously, your guess is as good as mine in terms of the future, but it would be reasonable to assume that that's going to be a little bit of a challenge to a greater or lesser degree if the economy as a whole is in a slightly higher inflationary environment. And we did probably include a little bit of that expectation in the 71 for this year.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies.\nKen Usdin: Jeremy, if I could just follow up on your points about capital. And just how we should be thinking about -- you gave us clarity on the dividend, and we know there's the $30 billion open authorization on the buyback. Again, just kind of fitting for the middle there, how do you balance just the magnitude of buyback you do from here versus the ongoing growth that we have in the balance sheet vis-\u00e0-vis what you just talked about as far as the limitations? Thanks.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. So I mean the answer to how we balance it is we talk about it a lot. We have a lot of smart people looking at it, trying to balance all the different constraints that we're managing. And I think Jen talked before, especially when it comes to the balance between our risk-based minimums and the SLR constraint, which, as you know, we can address with pref, so about kind of the mixture of prefs and common. So, we're looking at that. I think RRP is helping a little bit on the deposit growth side, which helps a little bit with the management of SLR. But, as I said previously, we're going to stay nimble there and use the tools at our disposal to try to strike the right balance between buybacks and pref issuance, recognizing that overissuing prefs potentially locks us into high cost prefs with low flexibility because of the five-year lockout. So, there's a lot of balancing there, and we're just staying nimble as information potentially trickles out on the evolution of the rules.\nKen Usdin: Okay. And then, just so then as far as how you guys will communicate, we'll just find out about the buyback on a quarterly basis as opposed to you giving a more broad outlook of your expectations around buybacks as it happened more in the past. Is that fair?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. I think that's right, especially in the new environment that we're operating in from a buyback perspective, now that it's not sort of an approved plan through CCAR, but it\u2019s rather than just the overall $30 billion Board authorization. Given what I just talked about in terms of the need to stay nimble across multiple constraints, we wouldn't want to box ourselves in by speaking publicly ahead of time in terms of what we're going to do, so. And you know, obviously, our normal capital here. At the end of the day, we're always going to invest first and look at interesting acquisitions and pay a sustainable dividend. And at the end of that, we'll look at buybacks in the context of all the other factors.\nJamie Dimon: Yes. We can probably give you a more definitive thing after they finish Basel III, which is now 10 years in the making and SLR and all the updates, and then you'll have more certainty about how this is going to operate going forward.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities.\nJim Mitchell: Maybe just a follow-up on the card business. You had 7% quarter-over-quarter growth in balances, but I think your guidance was still a little cautious. Is that just being conservative, you're still not sure about the relationship between spend and balance growth, or how do we think about the good quarter and sort of that cautious outlook?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. So, I wouldn't use the word conservative. We've tried very hard in our outlook to give you central case numbers. So, we're going to be wrong, but hopefully, it will be wrong symmetrically. So, we really want to try hard to give you central case numbers that don't have baseless optimism or unnecessary conservatism in them. So, the point that you highlight, the sort of apparent disconnect between the sequential increase in card loans and the relatively muted NII outlook is really just about pay rates. So, we continue to see very elevated pay rates by historical standards really highly unusual as a result of some of the themes that we've called out in terms of the strength of the consumer balance sheet. So, as long as that's true, and we're seeing sort of unusually low conversion of spend into revolving balances, that's going to be a little bit of an NII headwind until the consumer starts to re-lever, which we do think will happen. We just don't think it's likely to be a meaningful effect this year.\nJim Mitchell: That's fair. And then, on the charge-offs, that's obviously been a big benefit. I think if we look at delinquencies, both early stage and later stage, they kept falling throughout the quarter. Is there anything unusual this quarter where we saw a pretty big drop? Should we expect further declines in NCOs as the year progresses, given delinquency trends?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. So, I think on charge-offs, I would just stick to the updated card guidance that we gave, which is lower, just saying there's going to be below 2.5. But again, it's the same themes, right? Like elevated cash buffers in consumers are resulting in exceptionally strong NCO performance and sort of upside surprises in terms of people paying. So, there's sort of two sides of the same coin right now, lower revolving balances, better NCOS. And then, as we continue returning to normal, presumably in 2022, we should see both of those come back slightly to historical trends.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities.\nMike Mayo: Hey. Jeremy, welcome. My question, I want to follow-up, I think Glenn asked Jamie for the answer to this question. So I'm going to try again. Are these acquisitions that you've done, I count eight since December. And the question is, Jamie, what is the strategy? Is the strategy, I guess, in some cases, it's to disrupt to new markets as Jeremy said, maybe it's to avoid costs, maybe it's the scale across tens of millions of customers or, and this is the real question, are you looking to connect some of these acquisitions like Nutmeg with -- these Kraft Analytics, MaxX, [ph] C6 Bank, OpenInvest, 55ip. Is the goal to somehow 1 plus 1 plus 1 to equal more than 3 as you introduce these acquisitions, these companies, these people to each other to create kind of like a 21st century digital banking storefront, or is that too much of a reach? What's the grand plan here?\nJamie Dimon: A little bit too much of a reach, but there's a very smart analyst who said it was a string of pearls, and I put in that category. On asset management Campbell [ph] is just managing lumber assets. Timber assets is going to be great things for asset management. 55ip has a tax-efficient management to it there. Obviously, Nutmeg, and what we're already doing in the UK will be linked together, offering consumers digital product, both in deposits, small business, eventually lending and investments, global investing, et cetera, makes sense. C6 is another one. Jeremy said it's a huge market. So, we're looking at anything which has adjacencies. It could be data, it could be management. A lot of these are going to fill in, and some are a little bit more discount for us. So, how we look at retail, digital overseas, we've got patience and time. And we're going to spend a lot of time to see if we can build something very different than we have in the United States. And so, it's a little bit of everything. The cxLoyalty, the travel company, again, if you look at that, we are already so large in the travel business. So, think of this as enhanced services and products and capabilities to work with our clients, travel packages, et cetera, which we already got to remember, the seventh largest travel company in the United States. And that doesn't include all the travel going across our credit card and debit card that's traveled, but we are in the travel -- effectively the travel agent. And so, it's a little bit of all that. I'm thrilled we're doing it. We're looking all the time. We're not going to end up with a lot of wasted assets. But some of these things may not work there, but that will be okay.\nJeremy Barnum: Mike, the only thing I would add is there's a couple of themes that to me come through some of the things that we've done recently. One of them is ESG. You see that especially in the AWM deals. And the other is just improving the customer experience, whether it's through various fintech deals or cxLoyalty, customer experience is a key priority for us. And we want to have all the tools necessary to deliver that.\nJamie Dimon: And equally important, we're putting a lot of money into building. And we have, like every quarter for the next two years, you're going to have new products and new services being rolled out across the Company. I think they're just exciting and very good, and more and more integrated, more and more simple to use, more and more customer friendly, et cetera. And so, -- but we're doing a little bit of all of that. And we want -- yes, go ahead.\nJeremy Barnum: Go ahead, Mike.\nMike Mayo: And just my follow-up, as you talked about disrupting, I thought that was interesting, disrupting in the UK. But since you wrote your CEO letter, Jamie, I mean, it's only gotten more competitive from the fintech and big tech and big retail and everybody else. And that's a question that comes up probably to everyone on this call. Are you going to be disintermediated over the next five years, whether it's -- you know all the companies, but it just seems like they're ramping up that much more. You have an executive order from the White House, maybe you have to share data. What\u2019s your current mark-to-market of the threat from outside of banking to your business?\nJamie Dimon: Yes. I don't see any different thing when I wrote the letter. I think we have huge competition in banking and shadow banking, fintech and big tech and Walmart. And obviously, there's always a changing landscape, but we also have a huge -- we've got brands and capability and products and services and market share and profitability. I think some of these competitors are going to do quite well. I think a lot of them will succeed over time. But that's called good old American capitalism. I'm quite comfortable we'll do fine. I do think there's going to be a lot of people still in the banking business. I'm talking over 5 or 10 or 15 years. I think one day on a call which when they took a shadow bank or banks who will shadow -- will be shadows themselves.\nJeremy Barnum: We're working hard to make sure that we're offering services that are not disruptible because they're good. So if our clients are happy, and we're providing them a great experience, then there's nothing to disrupt.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nEbrahim Poonawala: I guess just sticking with the digital strategy. We heard Jamie talk about multiple times around the lack of imagination that cost the banking industry in terms of either payments or buy now pay later, and you talked about your international expansion. But again, going back to Mike's point, as shareholders of banks in the U.S., should the expectation be that banks will be fast followers of what fintech comes up with and replicating that, given the risk of cannibalizing your own sort of revenue set, or do we expect or do you think we should expect more disruptive innovation coming from banks in the United States on consumer banking?\nJamie Dimon: I think it's both. I mean, it's not an either/or question. And remember, a lot of these banks have done quite well, including Bank of America has done quite well in digital products and stuff like that. So, when I talk about lack of imagination, I mean, the whole Company. I mean, when you look at some of these things, it was -- we could have imagined more why they become a competitor down the road. So, some of these competitors are quite good. I call it Bobby and Eaton. [Ph] They start with one little thing. They have product. They have services. They have eyeballs. They had customers, and they find ways to monetize it. So, we've got to be a little more forward-looking in how they're looking at active guys and stuff like that. But in our case, there'll be a little bit of everything.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. And I would just say the whole like cannibalization and fast following thing, I think we've moved a little bit beyond that. Like there will be times where we have the first idea and we're eager to lean in and innovate that way. There are times when someone else has the first idea, and we're eagerly copying it. But, the whole -- we don't want to do this thing that makes sense with the customer because we might be cannibalizing our own revenues, that's a recipe to become a shadow of your...\nJamie Dimon: We have no fun cannibalizing revenue. Just keep that in mind. We will do the right thing when the time comes. And sometimes dayrate dollar short, but we'll do the right thing. And just if you look at the Company, I mean, if you look at -- we talked about SLR, I always get -- about CS and SLR, but look at the flows across this company. Look at the debit card, the credit card, the trading flows, the market share, the -- that's why I look at much more than what are the ups and downs to the earnings this quarter because of CECL. I don't think that means anything for the future of the company. I mean, our bankers, our traders, our credit card, our debit card, our merchant services, our auto business, our digital, it's doing pretty good. I read -- I look at these reports. My God, the company is doing quite fine. And yes, and we'd like to be a little critical of ourselves. I think when companies aren't, that's part of their failure. They should look at what they didn't do well and what other people have done well. And so, I'd be prepared. And we have a really fair assessment of the competition. It is very large and it's going to be very tough. It does not mean that JPMorgan will win, these eyes are open.\nEbrahim Poonawala: And I agree and I think banks don't do talk enough about client acquisitions and market share. So, I agree with you there. Just as a follow-up, Jamie, very quickly. There's some questions around like peak inflation, peak growth. I know you guys are very bullish. Compare and contrast how the world looks to you today versus back in 2011 when we came out of the financial crisis and the risk of GDP growth disappointing over the next few years?\nJamie Dimon: I think they're completely different fundamentally. Coming out of the '09 crisis, okay, the world was massive overleveraged. We had investment banks at 40 times leveraged, not JPMorgan. We did not need PARP and didn't need help. The Lehman, Baird, Goldman, Morgan, you had banks overseas, Dexia, the landed banks that I can't remember half of them, all went bankrupt. You had hedge funds deleveraging, a constant deleveraging, you had $0.5 trillion to $1 trillion in mortgage losses that were going to be recognized, actual losses spread around balance sheets and derivatives and stuff like that. So, the world is in a massive deleveraging mode. The consumers overleveraged, companies were overleveraged. The bridge book on Wall Street was $400 billion. Today, it's, I think, 60. If you look at today, today, everything we talk about loans being down is the consumer is -- the positive prime. The consumer, their house value is up, their stock rises up, their incomes are up, their savings are up, their confidence are up. The pandemic is kind of in the rearview mirror. Hopefully, nothing gets worse with it. And they're ready to go. And you see it in home prices, you see it in auto purchases. You see it -- I mean, they'd be much higher but for supply constraints right now. And so -- and businesses equally are in good shape. They're not overleveraged today. They do have a lot of charts show that corporate debt is like higher than it was, so, is corporate cash. If you look at middle market losses, it's almost zero, almost zero and huge unutilized revolving stuff like that. So, the second the economy starts to grow, which -- and I mean, as you're going to see loans go up because inventory receivables and capital expenditures and stuff like that, so it is completely different. And you've got fiscal policy on autopilot. I mean, there's a lot that hasn't been spent yet. There's a lot more that's going to be passed. And if QE so far is a little bit of [indiscernible] $220 million [ph] a month. And I just think you're going to see -- hopefully, see a very strong economy. We don't know how long. Obviously, if you listened to what I just said, that is a inflationary effect on that. And we don't know in the future, I talk about Goldilocks. Goldilocks is -- and I'm hopeful, not predicting. Like Goldilocks is that inflation goes up, the 10-year bond goes up, the growth is still quite strong. You may have growth in the second half this year as stronger than it's ever been in the United States of America, okay? And Europe is probably six months behind America. And so, growth can go into next year, and the 10-year bond goes to 3% and a lot of growth, the short base grows. It won't make any difference. We always had strong growth in consumer there, jobs are plentiful, wages are going up. These are all good things. And so, obviously, if the inflation can be worse than people think, I think it will be a little bit worse with these kinds of things. I don't think it's all temporary, but that doesn't matter if we have very strong growth.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. There are always risks in any environment, but the risks in this one I think are quite different from the ones that we had coming out of the global financial crisis.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: So, I wanted to start off with just a follow-up question on card NII. Jeremy, you did strike an optimistic tone on the higher spend trends and the potential for future NII tailwind as payment rates start to normalize. And just looking at the card revenue rate, given there are another of inputs in that metric, I was hoping you could just help us isolate the potential NII benefit versus the current baseline from a normalization in payment rate. So, just the payment rate normalizing, what would be the incremental step-up in the quarterly NII run rate?\nJeremy Barnum: Okay. So, there's a lot of pieces in that question. So first, let's talk about the revenue rate. So, a couple of things. So, in terms of the NII, we don't really see a meaningful uptick in card NII happening this year. Like you might maybe see a tiny bit of it sequentially fourth quarter versus third quarter, but I think it's going to be pretty hard to see. So, I think you want to be thinking about that as a 2022 effect. I'm not going to get into guiding on revenue rate for 2022. And I will actually point out that we're in the market right now competing aggressively with some great offers, and I'm happy to say actually the client acquisition in card is going great and we're seeing great uptake on the offers. But that comes with a bit of elevated marketing expense. So, as I look out to next quarter, you might actually see a bit of a dip in the revenue rate just because of the way the accounting works there.\nSteven Chubak: Okay. And for my follow-up, Jeremy, I just wanted to ask or at least hone in on one comment you made, where you said you could potentially still manage to a 12% capital target. I was just trying to better understand how much capital cushion you are looking to manage to under the SEB? And if the G-SIB surcharge is not recalibrated, where do you think you'll have to run on a steady-state basis just because it feels like waiting for to go, we haven't seen any changes on the recalibration front, specifically with the G-SIB surcharge.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. Okay. So basically, that's a question about the management buffer and a question about what we would do in a world where G-SIB doesn't get recalibrated. And a world where GSIB doesn't get recalibrated is a world where our capital minimums are quite a bit higher, starting in 2023. We obviously disagree with that. We don't think it makes any sense at all, given that a big part of the driver of that increase in the amount of capital that we would have. And as Jamie pointed out earlier, both we and the system are really flushed with capital, and the regulators have been pretty clear that there's enough capital in the system right now, and that growth would increase that amount quite a bit for us and for everyone else. So, that's a big part of the reason why we've been so vocal for so long about the need to recalibrate that. And I think we see some of our competitors making those points, too, as they start to creep up into higher buckets. And to be fair, the Fed has acknowledged that this is a thing that used to get fixed. It's just that they're kind of busy trying to get the Basel III end game put in place in the U.S. rules, which brings particular complexities in light of the Collins floor.\nJamie Dimon: Can I just add to this? So, I've always remarked that the G-SIB calculation is one of the [indiscernible] I've ever seen in my whole life. And then we doubled it here. So, the European banks have a lot of disadvantages in terms of -- they don't -- they can't have the regulators -- they can expand across Europe. But one of the advantages, they have pretty much half the G-SIB. But I still think that in the long run, that's right for America to be doubling what I could consider basing artificial number. So, let's just wait to see what all the new rules are, and then we'll answer that question. You don't have to sit there and guess what's going to happen.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. And I think you see the important point is that in the near term, we're actually bound by leverage. So, that's what we're focused on right now. That's our biggest single thing that we'd like to see fixed because that is affecting the management of the balance sheet right now in ways that we think really don't make sense and eventually result in higher costs that will get passed on into the real economy. Just to touch on your buffer point briefly, when all is said and done and the framework is fully settled, hopefully, we're back to being bound by risk-based constraints. We have a bit more experience with a couple of years of SCB and there's a little bit less rule uncertainty, it would be -- there's an interesting conversation to have about what the right management buffers are for people in a world where we do think it's important, and we've made these points to destigmatize the use of buffers. We've made this point in the context, for example, of the money market complex, too. We have all these kind of guidelines and the rules have them as buffers that you're supposedly free to use, but that's not the way everyone treats them. So, buffers become minimums, and that adds brittleness to the system that makes it more procyclical than anyone wants it to be. So, down the road when things are stable, the buffer discussion could become interesting. But right now, it's a somewhat simpler story, and that's really the SLR.\nJamie Dimon: And remember, there's one buffer, you guys -- we don't really talk about, which is $40 billion of pretax earnings a year, okay? That's a huge buffer. It's huge. It allows you to change your forward-looking capital if you buy back stock and don't buy back stock. And so, we have a lot of levers. And whatever happens, we're going to figure out a way to do a great job for shareholders.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line from Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: I want to circle back on costs. Obviously, this year, some of it is driven by the stronger-than-expected fees. Some of it is the inflationary pressures you mentioned. Some is I think discretionary, as you pointed out in the past, accelerating some investment spend. But, the question is, as we exit this year, when we look back on costs from 2021 and say they're a little bloated because of all those factors, or is this going to be a good base year to grow off of going forward?\nJeremy Barnum: Okay. So, there's a couple of points in there. There's -- the word -- let's talk about bloated. I mean, you've heard Jamie talk about cost before, right? So we go after everything all the time. We go after waste. We try very hard to never be loaded and to not waste. That is a constant discipline. It's hard work. We look for it everywhere. So I would like to say that bloated is not a word we would ever use to describe ourselves. And we spent a bunch of time in the valves of this organization. I really don't think that, that's true. And I don't think anything about what we're doing in terms of how money is being spent this year is wasteful. And in fact, as you know, the really big driver of the kind of impact on run rate spend is the investments that we're making, especially investments in technology and customer experience and then transforming the core efficiency of the company in terms of things like technology, modernization and data centers and so on. So, in terms of projecting forward into 2022, I don't want to get into giving 2022 expense guidance here. And I think that you really have to unpack that cost number between the parts of it that are volume and revenue-related and the kind of more run rate, structural and investment costs as we've talked about before. So, I think this year is -- it's a little bit tricky to unpack the components from their perspective to project them to...\nJamie Dimon: If we can find more good money to spend, we're going to spend it. And I told you guys that there's good expense. When we have credit card spend, so much money in marketing, the returns are very good and they spend it. If we can open hire great bankers, something, we're going to spend it. If we can -- we spend $200 million in new data centers, which have a huge benefit for us down the road, we're going to spend it. We do not manage the Company so we can tell analysts what the expense number is going to be. That is just a bad way to run a company. And conversely, a lot of revenue stuff, too. Revenues aren't always good. And we all know how much risk we take in these businesses and stuff like that. So, we spend a lot of time in good revenue, bad revenue and good expense and debt expense. And that's what's going to drive the franchise in the next 5 or 10 years.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Understood. And then separately, as we think about capital allocation kind of longer term, is there a thought to more meaningfully increase the dividend payout? I mean, as you saw at the beginning of the COVID crisis, buybacks were suspended, after stocks dropped sharply, banks couldn't repurchase until they roughly doubled. But dividends were maintained. And obviously, your pretax earnings power that you alluded to is very strong. It seems like that soft 30% cap has gone, obviously. So, just thoughts, it's not going to happen all in maybe one CCAR cycle, but if we do get a multiyear economic recovery, is your thoughts of pushing the dividend higher maybe closer to like a 50% payout?\nJamie Dimon: Probably not. I mean, I think firstly, we wanted the dividend which is sustainable through a bad downturn, and so we really want to do that. And I think this time kind of proves that. It was a very minor thing relative to capital retention. But we want to invest in our future and invest in growing and stuff like that. And if we can't -- and we don't want to raise the dividend so high that it cripples your ability to do other things.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. And the way that flows into just capital buffer sort of makes that point clear, right? So every -- part of the reason that we're at 3.2 instead of 3.1 is the $0.10 increase that the Board announced its intention to do.\nJamie Dimon: And if I owned 100% of the Company, there would be no dividend.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets.\nGerard Cassidy: Can you guys share with us -- if you take a look at your net interest margin in the quarter, obviously, it came under pressure. And if we assume -- and I know this is a big assumption, but if we assume that rates don't really change from here over the next 6 to 12 months, the long end stays anchored where it is, at what point does the average yield in your average interest-earning assets start to stabilize or maybe go up because the new business that you're putting on equals or exceeds what's running off in terms of interest rates on the products that are coming off the balance sheet?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. Good question, Gerard. So, I mean, I guess one way to think about your question is whether we basically think that NIM has hit the bottom in this quarter. And I think we've all learned the lesson that calling the bottom is a very dangerous thing. And I would also point out, and I would direct you to like the last page of our supplement, I'm not going to give you a big speech on markets NII, which is my favorite topic and why that is really a sort of a distraction that we shouldn't look at, maybe a little bit about next quarter. But we do have that disclosure where we split out total NII and markets NII as well as NIM excluding markets. And the reason I raised that is that, yes, your overall mental model is not wrong. It's reasonable to think that NIM might stabilize around these levels. But it's noisy, and the markets numbers in there, and that's going to add noise. And also, I would say right now, there's an unusual amount of numerator, denominator type effects. So whatever winds up being true about the numerator, you also have quite a bit of volatility in the denominator there, which is one of the reasons that we obviously don't manage to that number as you've heard us say before. But your overall frame, it sounds reasonable to me.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And then, as a follow-up, and I may have misheard you, so correct me if I'm wrong. But I think you said that the higher level of noninterest expense, the outlook that is, was really driven by the improved outlook for noninterest income. Can you give us any color on that part of it, the outlook for noninterest income improvement?\nJeremy Barnum: Well, it's -- I mean, some of it's in actuals, and some of it's in the outlook. But at a high level, the point is simply that if you look at the mix of revenue across this company, we have some offsetting dynamics right now. We've got NII headwinds from the consumer delevering, as we've discussed. But, as you saw in this quarter's CIB and AWM results, we had exceptional performance in banking even though -- and in wealth management. And even though markets is down year-on-year, it's actually up significantly from what we expect [Technical Difficulty] higher expense guidance. So, that's kind of how it all comes together.\nGerard Cassidy: I appreciate it. Thank you.\nJeremy Barnum: You want some of these expenses to go up because that means that good revenues are going up.\nJamie Dimon: Indeed.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: I had a couple of questions. One was just on thinking through the outlook for NII, like you indicated, $52.5 billion, subject to market conditions. Can you just give us a sense as to how you're thinking about market conditions? What's the trigger point for being maybe better than expected versus coming down? And I ask in context of -- I noticed your securities book, you shifted a bunch from AFS to HTM. So, it feels like from that, you're waiting more for rates to move up materially before you would lean into that yield curve trade. Maybe you can give us a sense as to what that market conditions comment was referring to and how you're thinking about that?\nJeremy Barnum: Sure. So, let's go through that for a second. So, I said I wasn't going to give my big markets NII speech until next quarter, but I can't resist. So, you talk about market conditions, the markets NII component of that NII outlook includes things like the extent to which we have spec pools versus TBA, is the extent to which we have futures versus cash and high rate countries like Brazil, the growth in prime brokerage balances. The common theme across all of these is there are situations where you're deploying balance sheet in the markets business to serve clients. And that's profitable deployment on a spread basis, but there's quite a bit of gross up between the kind of non-derivative piece of it and a derivative or derivative-like piece of it, where the derivative piece of it doesn't have any NII, and the non-derivative piece of it does. So, every unit of that sort of activity that you do creates a significant swing in the NII number, either up or down, with very little impact to the bottom line. Now that's not the entirety of the market story. There are parts of the markets business where we're actually doing more...\nJamie Dimon: The market, not the market...\nJeremy Barnum: No, I know. But a part of the market dependent comment is the market dependent -- I don't have markets. I'll go to the other point in a second, and I'm almost done with the speech. Anyway, you get the point. So, that's one point of fluctuation. But going to your other piece, so the AFS, HTM, and I think your implied question, which is basically what would make us want to deploy more into a higher rate environment. So, I will say that the AFS, HTM changes that you've seen are really just primarily about managing capital across the various constraints while preserving the right level of flexibility to do deployment. But given the level of cash balances right now, the AFS, HTM, there really remain constrained in terms of duration buys. And I think we have enough flexibility in there to do kind of short-end cash deployment tactically as we always do. So, to get to the punchline, it's kind of what we said before, which is, we're bullish on the economy. We believe that that comes with higher inflation and therefore, higher rates. And in light of that, we're happy to be patient right now. When that actually changes and we decide to deploy more, you'll see it in the future.\nJamie Dimon: And just a simple way to think about it, the 52.5 other than the markets business, which goes up or down, if rates go up, you do see our earnings at risk disclosure, we will earn more NII, all things being equal, which of course they never are, but all the deal. And in addition to that, we can make decisions to deploy more money for more NII.\nBetsy Graseck: It's interesting versus when you were at our conference, Jamie, but it seems like the 52.5 is more a function of the curve, given the fact that card did, it looks like better than you had thought at that time in the middle of June, based on your comments about spend being up so much. But, the...\nJamie Dimon: Betsy, let me just -- sorry to interrupt you, but let me just pick up on that point for a second because I think someone else has a similar question. But I would just remind you that we do see that very healthy sequential growth in card loans on the back of spending. But, the key issue is the revolve behavior. And so, our view on that really hasn't changed, and we do see elevated pay rates as a result of the cash buffers, which remains kind of the consistent reason why we have a muted outlook this year.\nBetsy Graseck: Yes. No, I totally get that.\nJamie Dimon: I don't want to correct anyone here, but I personally think you'll see it go up by the end of the year, okay? I think, we'll be a little conservative on that because of all the spend and stuff like that. But we hate guessing. What I look at much more is how many cards you have? How much spend do you have? How many happy customers do you have? NII will take care of itself.\nBetsy Graseck: And on that front, your card fees were quite good, right? You mentioned that in your press release. Maybe you can give us a sense as to the drivers? Is that new openings? Is that basically what it is? How sustainable is that? Because that was a bit of an upside surprise in this result, the card fees?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. I mean, I think it's just spend, right, Betsy? I mean we can get you a bit more color than that. Reggie can follow-up if you want. But at a high level, I think the card spend number is really all about -- I mean, sorry, the card fee number is really all about spend terms.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. And then, just one last if I can squeeze it in. Your VAR came down significantly. Can you give us a sense as to what's going on there?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. I mean, that's just the volatility of last year's prior quarter coming out of the time series, right, if you think about it.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Charles Peabody from Portales Partners.\nCharles Peabody: Yes. I want to ask that NII question a little bit differently. In reiterating your $52.5 billion guidance, you said there was potential for some variation or variability around that number. And I'm trying to understand where the greatest variation could come from. Is it in your loan growth expectations? Because I'm hearing that you really are not expecting much in the way of loan growth, or is it in the shape of the yield curve because of the Fed's QE actions or words around taper? And talking about the yield curve, could you also talk a little bit about what's more important, the short end of the yield curve between Fed funds in the two-year or the long end? And in that conversation, also talk about the significant amount of liquidity that's about to hit the short end. Thanks.\nJeremy Barnum: There is a disclosure in the March 31st 10-Q, it shows earning risk if rates go up 100 basis points, U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar of $7 billion, if the whole curve goes up 100 basis points. So, the $7 billion, some number like 4.5 or 5 is short rates versus long rates. The long rate number is cumulative. I would add every year until you roll over these things at slightly higher rates. That is the number, okay? They are -- obviously, loan growth is loan growth, that's in the plus or minus, but the biggest thing is interest rates.\nJamie Dimon: Yes.\nJeremy Barnum: Because of variables. Well, let me give you the variables, Charles, because it's kind of a reasonable question. So I'll spare any more markets NII speech. You heard it already, but that's obviously a big factor. Within card, we are somewhat optimistic about loan growth, but just remember that that loan growth has to translate into revolve to drive NII. And so, if pay rates remain -- as I said earlier, it's the central case forecast that reflects the recent experience. So, we are forecasting elevated pay rates. But of course, we could be wrong, they could be even more elevated than we are currently forecasting. So, that would be downside. And the opposite of that if we see the consumer relevering, starting a little bit sooner, would create upside there. And then, there's the impact of deployment. So we're staying patient right now. That means that we're not earning the steepness of the yield curve. And if that changes, that could create a little bit of upside. And then, there's always the tactical action that we can in the front end of the curve. Right now, those aren't very interesting because IOER is above money market rates, which is a big part of the reason that you see RRP having so much uptake. But if that were to change and there were opportunities in repo and so on, then that could help a little bit as part of our constant tactical deployment there. But that's not again our simple case.\nCharles Peabody: Just to follow-up on that. I mean, the liquidity that's going to hit in July and August is substantial. And that's going to have some impact on the shape of the yield curve at the short end. We saw a rise in the overnight repo rate, reverse repo rate in June. Is it possible that we have to have another one to keep rates from falling too far?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. I mean, I think that's a question for kind of short-term fixed income market strategists and my old research team. But right now, it seems like the Fed is pretty committed to making sure that repo rates don't trade negative. That's part of the reason they made the technical correction. That's part of the reason RRP is paying what it pays. So, we'll see what happens there. But to me, the front end of the yield curve from a deployment perspective looks not very interesting right now, and that is kind of our central case for the rest of this year.\nCharles Peabody: And did the rise in the RRP rate have any -- your comments about market-driven NII, did it have any impact on market-driven NII?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. That's not really the way that works\u2026\nJamie Dimon: About 5 basis points.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. I mean I think you may be -- I mean, I don't know if it's part of your question or not, but there's, of course, the increase in IOER, and there's some pretty simple math you can do there about 5 basis points on -- or 10 basis points on $0.5 trillion for half a year. But those are pretty small numbers in the scheme of all the precision we're dealing with here.\nOperator: A follow-up question is coming from the line from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets.\nGerard Cassidy: Jeremy, I just wanted to follow-up. Can you give us some color about the residential mortgage lending business? How was the gain on sale margins this quarter? Any outlook on margins or any outlook on volumes, I should say? But also, did you say also that you guys sustained a small loss or a loss in the servicing area? If so, what drove that? Thank you.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. So let's talk a little bit about mortgage, which is a business I'm still learning. But, we've had very robust originations, $40 billion this quarter. I think the most significant -- one of the significant things that's going on is we've really finished unwinding all of our credit pullbacks from the crisis. So, we're fully back in the corresponding channel, which is obviously helping the volumes. There's obviously been a huge refi boom over the last year with lower rates. That's starting to slow down a little bit. The purchase market has been quite robust, although now we've seen so much home price appreciation that maybe affordability starts to be a little bit of a headwind. So, as we sit here today from a margin perspective, you have your kind of typical dynamics. As rates go up a little bit, refi slows down a little bit that the industry has built capacity. You have probably a little bit of a margin headwind looking forward. And obviously, there's a mix effect. So, as corresponding becomes a much bigger part of the originations, you have mix-based margin compression, so. And obviously...\nJamie Dimon: \u2026 was at all-time highs. And now, it's not even normal. It's just getting -- all-time highs.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, exactly. So it's a headwind relative to a super elevated prior year quarter, but it's still perfectly healthy. In terms of the servicing business, I think really, as you all understand, in the current environment, the prepayment rates, prepayment speeds have been running significantly above our model forecast. And so, as we continue to really update those as part of our risk management, that can -- small risk management losses. But in general, the risk management of the parts of the MSR that can be managed has actually been very good and very stable. So, I think that's everything you had, Gerard, right?\nGerard Cassidy: Yes. Thank you very much.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes.\nOperator: No incoming questions. Thank you.\nJamie Dimon: At the end, I just wanted to thank Jen Piepszak for a great job as CFO. You'll also know she's happy Wisconsin in a new job. And Jeremy, I know a lot of you know Jeremy, but he's been the CFO of the IB for seven or eight -- eight years or so, so a complete professional. And so, Jeremy, welcome to your first call, and congratulations.\nJeremy Barnum: Thank you, Jamie.\nJamie Dimon: Also talk to you all soon. Thank you.\nJeremy Barnum: Well, I survived it.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone. That marks the end of your call. Thank you for joining, and have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeremy Barnum",
            "content": "Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Before we get going, I'd just like to say how honored I am to be on my first earnings call following the footsteps of Marianne and Jen, both of whom taught me so much during my time working for them and whose shoes will be very difficult to fill, but I'm going to try. So with that, this presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on page one. The Firm reported net income of $11.9 billion, EPS of $3.78 on revenue of $31.4 billion and delivered a return on tangible common equity of 23%. These results include $3 billion of credit reserve releases, which I'll cover in more detail shortly. Touching on a few highlights. Combined debit and credit spend was up 45% year on year and more importantly up 22% versus the more normal pre-COVID second quarter of 2019. It was an all-time record for IB fees, up 25% year on year, driven by advisory and debt underwriting. We saw particularly strong growth in AWM with record long-term flows as well as record revenue. And finally, credit continues to be quite healthy as evidenced by our exceptionally low net charge-offs across the board. Regarding our balance sheet, the trends from recent quarters have largely continued. Deposits are up 23% year on year and 4% sequentially, and loan growth remains low, flat year-on-year and up 1% quarter-on-quarter, although we have bright spots in certain pockets, and the consumer spend trends are encouraging. So, now turning to page 2 for more detail. As I go through this page, I'm going to provide you some context about the prior-year quarter because the year-on-year comparisons are a bit noisy. So, with respect to revenue, the second quarter of 2020 was an all-time record for markets with revenue of over $9.7 billion, and we recorded approximately $700 million of gains in our bridge book. With that in mind, revenue of $31.4 billion was down $2.4 billion or 7% year-on-year. Non-interest revenue was down $1.3 billion or 7% due to the prior year items I just mentioned, partially offset by strong fee generation in Investment Banking and AWM as well as from card-related fees on higher spend. And net interest income was down $1.1 billion or 8%, driven by lower markets NII and lower balances in card. Expenses of $17.7 billion were up 4% year-on-year, largely on continued investments. And then on credit costs, going back to last year again, you will recall, in last year's second quarter, we built $8.9 billion in credit reserves during the height of the pandemic, whereas this year, we released $3 billion. So in this quarter, credit costs were a net benefit of $2.3 billion. And setting aside the reserve release, it's also worth noting that net charge-offs of just over $700 million were half of last year's second quarter number and continue to trend near historical lows. On the next page, let's go over the reserves. We released $3 billion this quarter as we grow increasingly confident about the economy in light of continued improvement in COVID, especially in the U.S. In Consumer, we released $2.6 billion, including $1.8 billion in Card and $600 million in Home Lending. And in Wholesale, we released nearly $450 million. So, this leaves us with reserves of $22.6 billion, which as a result of elevated remaining uncertainty about COVID and the shape of the economic recovery are higher than would otherwise be implied by our central economic forecasts. Now, moving to balance sheet and capital on page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13%, down slightly versus the prior quarter as net growth in retained earnings was more than offset by higher RWA across both retail and wholesale lending. This quarter also reflects the expiration of the temporary SLR exclusions. And as we anticipated, leverage is now a binding constraint. As you know, we finished CCAR a couple of weeks ago and our SCB will be 3.2%, which reflects the Board's intention to increase the dividend to $1 per share in the third quarter. Okay, now let's go to our businesses starting with Consumer & Community Banking on page 5. CCB reported net income of $5.6 billion, including reserve releases of $2.6 billion on revenue of $12.8 billion, up 3% year-on-year. Of particular note this quarter is the acceleration of card spend. And so, while card outstandings remained lower than pre-pandemic levels, this quarter's trends made us optimistic. Total debit and credit spend was up 45% year-on-year, and more importantly, up 22% versus the second quarter of '19. And within that, compared to 2019, June total spend was up 24%, indicating some healthy acceleration throughout the quarter. And travel and entertainment has really turned the corner with spend flat versus the second quarter of '19, accelerating from down 11% in April to actually up 13% in June. The rest of the CCB story remains consistent with prior quarters. Consumer and small business cash balances remain elevated, resulting in depressed loan growth. Overall loans were down 3% year-on-year from continued elevated prepayments in mortgage and on lower card outstandings, partially offset by strong growth in Auto and the impact of PPP. Home Lending and Auto continued to have strong originations with Home Lending up 64% to $40 billion, the highest quarterly figure since the third quarter of 2013, and Auto up 61% to a record $12.4 billion. Deposits were up 25% year-on-year or approximately $200 billion, and client investment assets were up 36%, driven by market appreciation and positive net flows across our advisor and digital channels. And our omnichannel strategy continues to deliver. We are more than halfway through our initial market expansion commitment as we have opened more than 200 new branches out of our goal of 400, which have exceeded our expectations by generating $7 billion in deposits and investments. And we are planning to be in all 48 contiguous states by the end of the summer. Digital trends continue to be strong as retail mobility recovers at a faster pace than branch transactions, which are still down more than 20% versus 2019. Active mobile users grew 10% year-on-year to over 42 million, and total digital transactions per engaged customer were up 12%. Expenses of $7.1 billion were up 4% year-on-year, driven by continued investments and higher volume and revenue-related expenses. Looking forward, the obvious question is the outlook for loan growth, especially in card. And we are quite optimistic that the current spend trends will convert into resumption of loan growth through the end of this year and into next. And while we wait, the exceptionally low level of net charge-offs provides a substantial offset to the NII headwind. Next, the Corporate & Investment Bank on page 6. CIB reported net income of $5 billion and an ROE of 23% on revenue of $13.2 billion. IB fees of $3.6 billion were up 25% year-on-year and up 20% quarter-on-quarter, an all-time record, driven by advisory and debt underwriting, leading to a year-to-date global IB wallet share of 9.4% and a number 1 ranking. In advisory, we were up 52% year-on-year, benefiting from the surge in announcement activity that has continued into the second quarter. Debt underwriting fees were up 26%, driven by an active acquisition finance market, offset by lower investment-grade issuance. And in equity underwriting, fees were up 9%, primarily driven by a strong performance in IPOs. The resulting Investment Banking revenue of $3.4 billion was roughly flat year-on-year due to the headwind of the prior year's markup in the bridge book. Looking ahead to the third quarter, the pipeline remains very strong. We expect M&A activity and the IPO market to remain active. And while IB fees are likely to be down sequentially, we still expect them to be up year-on-year. Moving to markets. Total revenue was $6.8 billion, down 30% compared to an all-time record quarter last year. While normalization has been more prevalent in macro, overall, we ran above 2019 levels throughout the quarter on the back of strong client activity, outperforming our own expectations from earlier in the year. Fixed income was down 44% compared to last year's exceptional results, but up 11% compared to the second quarter of '19. Equity markets was up 13%, driven by record balances in prime as well as strong performance in cash and equity derivatives, where we matched last year's great results. Looking forward, while we expect normalization to continue across both, Investment Banking and markets, and most notably in fixed income, the timing and the extent of the normalization is obviously hard to predict. Wholesale Payments revenue was $1.5 billion, up 5% driven by higher deposits and fees, largely offset by deposit margin compression. And security services revenue was $1.1 billion, down 1%, as deposit margin compression was predominantly offset by growth in deposits and fees. Expenses of $6.5 billion were down 4% year-on-year, driven by lower performance-related compensation, partially offset by higher volume-related expense. Moving to Commercial Banking on Page 7. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.4 billion and an ROE of 23%. Revenue of $2.5 billion was up 3% year-on-year with higher Investment Banking, Lending and Wholesale Payments revenue, largely offset by lower deposit revenue and the absence of a prior year equity investment gain. Record gross Investment Banking revenue of $1.2 billion was up 37% on increased M&A and acquisition-related financing activity compared to prior year lows. Expenses of $981 million were up 10% year-on-year, driven by higher volume and revenue-related expenses and investments. Deposits of $290 billion were up 22% year-on-year as client balances remain elevated. Loans of $2.5 billion were down 12% year-on-year, driven by lower revolver utilization compared to the prior year quarter and down 1% sequentially. C&I loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter with lower utilization, partially offset by new loan activity in middle market. And CRE loans were down 1%, but we saw pockets of growth in affordable housing activity. Finally, credit costs were a net benefit of $377 million, driven by reserve releases with net charge-offs of only 1 basis point. And to complete our lines of business, on to Asset & Wealth Management on page 8. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.2 billion with pretax margin of 37% and an ROE of 32%. Record revenue of $4.1 billion was up 20% year-on-year as higher management fees and growth in deposit and loan balances were partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $2.6 billion were up 11% year-on-year driven by higher performance-related compensation and distribution expenses. For the quarter, net long-term inflows of $49 billion continued to be positive across all channels, with notable strength in equities, fixed income and alternatives. AUM was $3 trillion. And for the first time, overall client assets were over $4 trillion, up 21% and 25% year-on-year, respectively, driven by higher market levels and strong net inflows. And finally, loans were up 21% year-on-year, with continued strength in securities-based lending, custom lending and mortgages, while deposits were up 37%. Turning to Corporate on page 9. Corporate reported a net loss of $1.2 billion. Revenue was a loss of $1.2 billion, down $415 million year-on-year. NII was down $274 million primarily on limited deployment opportunities as deposit growth continued, and we realized $155 million of net investment securities losses in the quarter. Expenses of $515 million were up $368 million year-on-year. So with that, on page 10, the outlook. Our 2021 NII outlook of around $52.5 billion remains in line with the updated guidance we provided last month. But, as you'll note, we've also lowered our outlook for the card net charge-off rate to less than 250 basis points, which, as I mentioned in CCB, provides a meaningful offset to the NII headwind. And it's worth mentioning that the current environment makes forecasting NII even in the near term unusually challenging. So, while $52.5 billion remains our current central case, you should expect some elevated uncertainty around that number, not only because of the ongoing impact of stimulus on consumer balance sheets, but also due to volatility coming from markets, among other things. And as a reminder, most of any fluctuation in markets NII, whether up or down, is likely to be offset in NIR. On expenses, we've increased our guidance to approximately $71 billion, driven by higher volume and revenue-related expenses. So, to wrap up, we are encouraged by the continued progress against the virus and the economic recovery that is underway, especially in the United States. Although we want to acknowledge the challenges that much of the rest of the world is facing and we're hopeful that a global recovery will follow closely behind. Our performance this quarter once again showcases the power of our diversified business model as headwinds in NII from consumer delevering are offset by strong fee generation across AWM and CIB, and exceptionally low net charge-offs across the board. While we're proud of the performance of the Company and of our people through the crisis, the competition in every business from banks, fintechs and others is as intense as ever. So, as we look forward to an increasingly normal environment, we are enthusiastically focused on competing for every piece of share in every market, product and business where we operate and making the necessary investments to win. With that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. Hi Glenn. Thank you very much. Yes. Thanks, Glenn. All right. So, let's sort of take that in parts. So, in terms of our NII guidance, so yes, so we're reiterating $52.5 billion for the full year. So, just to take your deployment point first, obviously, rates are a little bit lower, long end rates are a bit lower. The curve has flattened a little bit since we provided that guidance. But when we provided that guidance, we were reasonably conservative in our deployment assumptions through the rest of the year. So, as a result of that, it's not really a meaningful factor sort of at the level of precision that we're talking about here. In terms of the consumer side, as you say, obviously it's really card is really going to be the big driver. So, you heard us talking about payment rates, and you see the sequential growth in card loans. So, we do believe that the sort of acceleration in the pickup in spend is going to translate to, as I say, a resumption of loan growth in card. But, we do think that pay rates are going to remain quite elevated at a minimum through the end of this year. So, as a result, we don't really see revolving interest-bearing balances increasing meaningfully this year. And so, as a result, that remains a headwind for the overall NII for this year, which is incorporated in the outlook. Yes. Look, I mean, I think you've heard us talk about this before, right? So, our central case, from an economic perspective, is for a very robust recovery. And that's pretty much a consensus view between us, our research team, the Fed, et cetera. And that view is associated with higher inflation, along the lines of the Fed's own targets for higher inflation. All those things together -- it's an outlook that's associated with higher rates, all else equal. And so, in light of all that, we do remain happy to stay patient here. And if you look at our EIR disclosure, which you obviously won't see until you get the Q, but some of you guys have written about this recently, our overall sensitivities here are kind of in line with the industry. So when you consider kind of the tail type things that Jamie always talks about, the complexity of the balance sheet and various other factors, we do still feel that being patient here makes sense. Sure, Glenn. So, let me start with the international expansion point on the consumer side because that's interesting. You've heard Jamie over the years talk about why it wouldn't really make sense to do international expansion in consumer when you think about that through the lens of branch-based strategy. So, if you imagine, going outside of the U.S. and opening branches in other countries and competing with the incumbents, just from a branding perspective, from an operating leverage perspective, we've never felt that, that was likely to be a successful strategy for us, and that hasn't really changed. The difference right now is the ability to do that digital. So, what's really particularly exciting about the international expansion narrative both in the UK and now with our recent investment in C6 in Brazil, is the ability to kind of experiment a little bit. Obviously, it's a strategically compelling opportunity. Brazil, as you probably know, is like the third biggest consumer banking market in the world, but it's kind of fun to be the disruptor. And so, I think for us, given our position in consumer banking in the United States, being in a place where we are actually the outsider disrupting through these kind of digital channels, we see it among other things, in addition to being compelling financially, as a really good opportunity to learn and to challenge ourselves a little bit from the inside. So, we're very excited about that stuff. Yes. It's a good question, John, and yes, there are a lot of variables. So, let me start by saying that in terms of a 12% target, it's not off the table is what I'll say about that, meaning 12%, it's not necessarily -- doesn't necessarily need to be higher. So for now, it's not off the table. But, the element of time, i.e. when are we bound by what, matters quite a bit as you think about this. So, just to go through some of the pieces, you've noted the GSIB point. So, we're in the 4% bucket now as of the end of last year. That comes into play in 2023. We're currently operating in 4.5. As you know, that's quite a seasonal number. So, it's still possible to get under 4.5 for the end of this year. But, we have to acknowledge an elevated probability, I would say, of landing in 4.5 bucket this year. But, the 4.5 bucket would be binding in 2024. And as you noted, in the meantime, we're bound by SLR. And we've been quite public about our views about these things, about the extent to which, increasingly, our capital requirements are driven by non-risk sensitive size-based measures, which were really designed, especially in the case of SLR, as backstops, which the Fed has acknowledged. So, our priority right -- and the Fed has talked about potentially addressing some of these things. We know we're waiting for an NPR on SLR, but also, they've said that a potential G-SIB fix could come as part of the holistic implementation of the Basel III end game. So, there's a lot of things that are going to play out between now and some of those minimums becoming binding. And realistically, right now, we're going to be operating above 12% anyway in light of the leverage bound in all likelihood. So, we're managing a variety of different factors, near term, short term, props, common, et cetera. And we're just going to try to be nimble about it as more information comes out over the next few quarters. Yes. So, a couple of things there. So yes, as you note, we have revised up from 70 to 71. And the biggest single driver there is volume and revenue-related expense, where if you -- it is tough. Well, it's... It is a little bit of comp. It's also transaction-related volumes. It's also marketing expense in certain pockets. So, it's all the stuff that fits in the category of volume and revenue-related. And I think the point is obviously, we're all a little bit focused on the NII headwinds right now. But from an NIR [ph] perspective, across markets, AWM, IB, CIB in general and even pockets, wealth management and CCB, we're actually outperforming the revenue expectations that were built into our prior expense guidance. So that's kind of the dynamic there. In terms of inflation, I would say that we're not seeing inflation in our actuals. But obviously, your guess is as good as mine in terms of the future, but it would be reasonable to assume that that's going to be a little bit of a challenge to a greater or lesser degree if the economy as a whole is in a slightly higher inflationary environment. And we did probably include a little bit of that expectation in the 71 for this year. Yes. So I mean the answer to how we balance it is we talk about it a lot. We have a lot of smart people looking at it, trying to balance all the different constraints that we're managing. And I think Jen talked before, especially when it comes to the balance between our risk-based minimums and the SLR constraint, which, as you know, we can address with pref, so about kind of the mixture of prefs and common. So, we're looking at that. I think RRP is helping a little bit on the deposit growth side, which helps a little bit with the management of SLR. But, as I said previously, we're going to stay nimble there and use the tools at our disposal to try to strike the right balance between buybacks and pref issuance, recognizing that overissuing prefs potentially locks us into high cost prefs with low flexibility because of the five-year lockout. So, there's a lot of balancing there, and we're just staying nimble as information potentially trickles out on the evolution of the rules. Yes. I think that's right, especially in the new environment that we're operating in from a buyback perspective, now that it's not sort of an approved plan through CCAR, but it's rather than just the overall $30 billion Board authorization. Given what I just talked about in terms of the need to stay nimble across multiple constraints, we wouldn't want to box ourselves in by speaking publicly ahead of time in terms of what we're going to do, so. And you know, obviously, our normal capital here. At the end of the day, we're always going to invest first and look at interesting acquisitions and pay a sustainable dividend. And at the end of that, we'll look at buybacks in the context of all the other factors. Yes. So, I wouldn't use the word conservative. We've tried very hard in our outlook to give you central case numbers. So, we're going to be wrong, but hopefully, it will be wrong symmetrically. So, we really want to try hard to give you central case numbers that don't have baseless optimism or unnecessary conservatism in them. So, the point that you highlight, the sort of apparent disconnect between the sequential increase in card loans and the relatively muted NII outlook is really just about pay rates. So, we continue to see very elevated pay rates by historical standards really highly unusual as a result of some of the themes that we've called out in terms of the strength of the consumer balance sheet. So, as long as that's true, and we're seeing sort of unusually low conversion of spend into revolving balances, that's going to be a little bit of an NII headwind until the consumer starts to re-lever, which we do think will happen. We just don't think it's likely to be a meaningful effect this year. Yes. So, I think on charge-offs, I would just stick to the updated card guidance that we gave, which is lower, just saying there's going to be below 2.5. But again, it's the same themes, right? Like elevated cash buffers in consumers are resulting in exceptionally strong NCO performance and sort of upside surprises in terms of people paying. So, there's sort of two sides of the same coin right now, lower revolving balances, better NCOS. And then, as we continue returning to normal, presumably in 2022, we should see both of those come back slightly to historical trends. Mike, the only thing I would add is there's a couple of themes that to me come through some of the things that we've done recently. One of them is ESG. You see that especially in the AWM deals. And the other is just improving the customer experience, whether it's through various fintech deals or cxLoyalty, customer experience is a key priority for us. And we want to have all the tools necessary to deliver that. Go ahead, Mike. We're working hard to make sure that we're offering services that are not disruptible because they're good. So if our clients are happy, and we're providing them a great experience, then there's nothing to disrupt. Yes. And I would just say the whole like cannibalization and fast following thing, I think we've moved a little bit beyond that. Like there will be times where we have the first idea and we're eager to lean in and innovate that way. There are times when someone else has the first idea, and we're eagerly copying it. But, the whole -- we don't want to do this thing that makes sense with the customer because we might be cannibalizing our own revenues, that's a recipe to become a shadow of your... Yes. There are always risks in any environment, but the risks in this one I think are quite different from the ones that we had coming out of the global financial crisis. Okay. So, there's a lot of pieces in that question. So first, let's talk about the revenue rate. So, a couple of things. So, in terms of the NII, we don't really see a meaningful uptick in card NII happening this year. Like you might maybe see a tiny bit of it sequentially fourth quarter versus third quarter, but I think it's going to be pretty hard to see. So, I think you want to be thinking about that as a 2022 effect. I'm not going to get into guiding on revenue rate for 2022. And I will actually point out that we're in the market right now competing aggressively with some great offers, and I'm happy to say actually the client acquisition in card is going great and we're seeing great uptake on the offers. But that comes with a bit of elevated marketing expense. So, as I look out to next quarter, you might actually see a bit of a dip in the revenue rate just because of the way the accounting works there. Yes. Okay. So basically, that's a question about the management buffer and a question about what we would do in a world where G-SIB doesn't get recalibrated. And a world where GSIB doesn't get recalibrated is a world where our capital minimums are quite a bit higher, starting in 2023. We obviously disagree with that. We don't think it makes any sense at all, given that a big part of the driver of that increase in the amount of capital that we would have. And as Jamie pointed out earlier, both we and the system are really flushed with capital, and the regulators have been pretty clear that there's enough capital in the system right now, and that growth would increase that amount quite a bit for us and for everyone else. So, that's a big part of the reason why we've been so vocal for so long about the need to recalibrate that. And I think we see some of our competitors making those points, too, as they start to creep up into higher buckets. And to be fair, the Fed has acknowledged that this is a thing that used to get fixed. It's just that they're kind of busy trying to get the Basel III end game put in place in the U.S. rules, which brings particular complexities in light of the Collins floor. Yes. And I think you see the important point is that in the near term, we're actually bound by leverage. So, that's what we're focused on right now. That's our biggest single thing that we'd like to see fixed because that is affecting the management of the balance sheet right now in ways that we think really don't make sense and eventually result in higher costs that will get passed on into the real economy. Just to touch on your buffer point briefly, when all is said and done and the framework is fully settled, hopefully, we're back to being bound by risk-based constraints. We have a bit more experience with a couple of years of SCB and there's a little bit less rule uncertainty, it would be -- there's an interesting conversation to have about what the right management buffers are for people in a world where we do think it's important, and we've made these points to destigmatize the use of buffers. We've made this point in the context, for example, of the money market complex, too. We have all these kind of guidelines and the rules have them as buffers that you're supposedly free to use, but that's not the way everyone treats them. So, buffers become minimums, and that adds brittleness to the system that makes it more procyclical than anyone wants it to be. So, down the road when things are stable, the buffer discussion could become interesting. But right now, it's a somewhat simpler story, and that's really the SLR. Okay. So, there's a couple of points in there. There's -- the word -- let's talk about bloated. I mean, you've heard Jamie talk about cost before, right? So we go after everything all the time. We go after waste. We try very hard to never be loaded and to not waste. That is a constant discipline. It's hard work. We look for it everywhere. So I would like to say that bloated is not a word we would ever use to describe ourselves. And we spent a bunch of time in the valves of this organization. I really don't think that, that's true. And I don't think anything about what we're doing in terms of how money is being spent this year is wasteful. And in fact, as you know, the really big driver of the kind of impact on run rate spend is the investments that we're making, especially investments in technology and customer experience and then transforming the core efficiency of the company in terms of things like technology, modernization and data centers and so on. So, in terms of projecting forward into 2022, I don't want to get into giving 2022 expense guidance here. And I think that you really have to unpack that cost number between the parts of it that are volume and revenue-related and the kind of more run rate, structural and investment costs as we've talked about before. So, I think this year is -- it's a little bit tricky to unpack the components from their perspective to project them to... Yes. And the way that flows into just capital buffer sort of makes that point clear, right? So every -- part of the reason that we're at 3.2 instead of 3.1 is the $0.10 increase that the Board announced its intention to do. Yes. Good question, Gerard. So, I mean, I guess one way to think about your question is whether we basically think that NIM has hit the bottom in this quarter. And I think we've all learned the lesson that calling the bottom is a very dangerous thing. And I would also point out, and I would direct you to like the last page of our supplement, I'm not going to give you a big speech on markets NII, which is my favorite topic and why that is really a sort of a distraction that we shouldn't look at, maybe a little bit about next quarter. But we do have that disclosure where we split out total NII and markets NII as well as NIM excluding markets. And the reason I raised that is that, yes, your overall mental model is not wrong. It's reasonable to think that NIM might stabilize around these levels. But it's noisy, and the markets numbers in there, and that's going to add noise. And also, I would say right now, there's an unusual amount of numerator, denominator type effects. So whatever winds up being true about the numerator, you also have quite a bit of volatility in the denominator there, which is one of the reasons that we obviously don't manage to that number as you've heard us say before. But your overall frame, it sounds reasonable to me. Well, it's -- I mean, some of it's in actuals, and some of it's in the outlook. But at a high level, the point is simply that if you look at the mix of revenue across this company, we have some offsetting dynamics right now. We've got NII headwinds from the consumer delevering, as we've discussed. But, as you saw in this quarter's CIB and AWM results, we had exceptional performance in banking even though -- and in wealth management. And even though markets is down year-on-year, it's actually up significantly from what we expect [Technical Difficulty] higher expense guidance. So, that's kind of how it all comes together. You want some of these expenses to go up because that means that good revenues are going up. Sure. So, let's go through that for a second. So, I said I wasn't going to give my big markets NII speech until next quarter, but I can't resist. So, you talk about market conditions, the markets NII component of that NII outlook includes things like the extent to which we have spec pools versus TBA, is the extent to which we have futures versus cash and high rate countries like Brazil, the growth in prime brokerage balances. The common theme across all of these is there are situations where you're deploying balance sheet in the markets business to serve clients. And that's profitable deployment on a spread basis, but there's quite a bit of gross up between the kind of non-derivative piece of it and a derivative or derivative-like piece of it, where the derivative piece of it doesn't have any NII, and the non-derivative piece of it does. So, every unit of that sort of activity that you do creates a significant swing in the NII number, either up or down, with very little impact to the bottom line. Now that's not the entirety of the market story. There are parts of the markets business where we're actually doing more... No, I know. But a part of the market dependent comment is the market dependent -- I don't have markets. I'll go to the other point in a second, and I'm almost done with the speech. Anyway, you get the point. So, that's one point of fluctuation. But going to your other piece, so the AFS, HTM, and I think your implied question, which is basically what would make us want to deploy more into a higher rate environment. So, I will say that the AFS, HTM changes that you've seen are really just primarily about managing capital across the various constraints while preserving the right level of flexibility to do deployment. But given the level of cash balances right now, the AFS, HTM, there really remain constrained in terms of duration buys. And I think we have enough flexibility in there to do kind of short-end cash deployment tactically as we always do. So, to get to the punchline, it's kind of what we said before, which is, we're bullish on the economy. We believe that that comes with higher inflation and therefore, higher rates. And in light of that, we're happy to be patient right now. When that actually changes and we decide to deploy more, you'll see it in the future. Yes. I mean, I think it's just spend, right, Betsy? I mean we can get you a bit more color than that. Reggie can follow-up if you want. But at a high level, I think the card spend number is really all about -- I mean, sorry, the card fee number is really all about spend terms. Yes. I mean, that's just the volatility of last year's prior quarter coming out of the time series, right, if you think about it. There is a disclosure in the March 31st 10-Q, it shows earning risk if rates go up 100 basis points, U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar of $7 billion, if the whole curve goes up 100 basis points. So, the $7 billion, some number like 4.5 or 5 is short rates versus long rates. The long rate number is cumulative. I would add every year until you roll over these things at slightly higher rates. That is the number, okay? They are -- obviously, loan growth is loan growth, that's in the plus or minus, but the biggest thing is interest rates. Because of variables. Well, let me give you the variables, Charles, because it's kind of a reasonable question. So I'll spare any more markets NII speech. You heard it already, but that's obviously a big factor. Within card, we are somewhat optimistic about loan growth, but just remember that that loan growth has to translate into revolve to drive NII. And so, if pay rates remain -- as I said earlier, it's the central case forecast that reflects the recent experience. So, we are forecasting elevated pay rates. But of course, we could be wrong, they could be even more elevated than we are currently forecasting. So, that would be downside. And the opposite of that if we see the consumer relevering, starting a little bit sooner, would create upside there. And then, there's the impact of deployment. So we're staying patient right now. That means that we're not earning the steepness of the yield curve. And if that changes, that could create a little bit of upside. And then, there's always the tactical action that we can in the front end of the curve. Right now, those aren't very interesting because IOER is above money market rates, which is a big part of the reason that you see RRP having so much uptake. But if that were to change and there were opportunities in repo and so on, then that could help a little bit as part of our constant tactical deployment there. But that's not again our simple case. Yes. I mean, I think that's a question for kind of short-term fixed income market strategists and my old research team. But right now, it seems like the Fed is pretty committed to making sure that repo rates don't trade negative. That's part of the reason they made the technical correction. That's part of the reason RRP is paying what it pays. So, we'll see what happens there. But to me, the front end of the yield curve from a deployment perspective looks not very interesting right now, and that is kind of our central case for the rest of this year. Yes. That's not really the way that works... Yes. I mean I think you may be -- I mean, I don't know if it's part of your question or not, but there's, of course, the increase in IOER, and there's some pretty simple math you can do there about 5 basis points on -- or 10 basis points on $0.5 trillion for half a year. But those are pretty small numbers in the scheme of all the precision we're dealing with here. Yes. So let's talk a little bit about mortgage, which is a business I'm still learning. But, we've had very robust originations, $40 billion this quarter. I think the most significant -- one of the significant things that's going on is we've really finished unwinding all of our credit pullbacks from the crisis. So, we're fully back in the corresponding channel, which is obviously helping the volumes. There's obviously been a huge refi boom over the last year with lower rates. That's starting to slow down a little bit. The purchase market has been quite robust, although now we've seen so much home price appreciation that maybe affordability starts to be a little bit of a headwind. So, as we sit here today from a margin perspective, you have your kind of typical dynamics. As rates go up a little bit, refi slows down a little bit that the industry has built capacity. You have probably a little bit of a margin headwind looking forward. And obviously, there's a mix effect. So, as corresponding becomes a much bigger part of the originations, you have mix-based margin compression, so. And obviously... Yes, exactly. So it's a headwind relative to a super elevated prior year quarter, but it's still perfectly healthy. In terms of the servicing business, I think really, as you all understand, in the current environment, the prepayment rates, prepayment speeds have been running significantly above our model forecast. And so, as we continue to really update those as part of our risk management, that can -- small risk management losses. But in general, the risk management of the parts of the MSR that can be managed has actually been very good and very stable. So, I think that's everything you had, Gerard, right? Yes. Thank you, Jamie. Well, I survived it."

            "name": "Jamie Dimon",
            "content": "If I could make a further point, we have tons of capital, $200 billion of CET1, $35 billion of preferred, $300 billion of long-term debt, only $1 trillion of loans, which is the riskiest asset we have, and $1.5 trillion of cash and marketable securities. So, the underlying thing is there's just tons of capital in the system. And I think one day, if you're going to look at and say, why so much, to the liquid side. The comp, we're going to be competitive in comp no matter what it takes. Let's keep that at the back of your mind. Yes. We can probably give you a more definitive thing after they finish Basel III, which is now 10 years in the making and SLR and all the updates, and then you'll have more certainty about how this is going to operate going forward. A little bit too much of a reach, but there's a very smart analyst who said it was a string of pearls, and I put in that category. On asset management Campbell [ph] is just managing lumber assets. Timber assets is going to be great things for asset management. 55ip has a tax-efficient management to it there. Obviously, Nutmeg, and what we're already doing in the UK will be linked together, offering consumers digital product, both in deposits, small business, eventually lending and investments, global investing, et cetera, makes sense. C6 is another one. Jeremy said it's a huge market. So, we're looking at anything which has adjacencies. It could be data, it could be management. A lot of these are going to fill in, and some are a little bit more discount for us. So, how we look at retail, digital overseas, we've got patience and time. And we're going to spend a lot of time to see if we can build something very different than we have in the United States. And so, it's a little bit of everything. The cxLoyalty, the travel company, again, if you look at that, we are already so large in the travel business. So, think of this as enhanced services and products and capabilities to work with our clients, travel packages, et cetera, which we already got to remember, the seventh largest travel company in the United States. And that doesn't include all the travel going across our credit card and debit card that's traveled, but we are in the travel -- effectively the travel agent. And so, it's a little bit of all that. I'm thrilled we're doing it. We're looking all the time. We're not going to end up with a lot of wasted assets. But some of these things may not work there, but that will be okay. And equally important, we're putting a lot of money into building. And we have, like every quarter for the next two years, you're going to have new products and new services being rolled out across the Company. I think they're just exciting and very good, and more and more integrated, more and more simple to use, more and more customer friendly, et cetera. And so, -- but we're doing a little bit of all of that. And we want -- yes, go ahead. Yes. I don't see any different thing when I wrote the letter. I think we have huge competition in banking and shadow banking, fintech and big tech and Walmart. And obviously, there's always a changing landscape, but we also have a huge -- we've got brands and capability and products and services and market share and profitability. I think some of these competitors are going to do quite well. I think a lot of them will succeed over time. But that's called good old American capitalism. I'm quite comfortable we'll do fine. I do think there's going to be a lot of people still in the banking business. I'm talking over 5 or 10 or 15 years. I think one day on a call which when they took a shadow bank or banks who will shadow -- will be shadows themselves. I think it's both. I mean, it's not an either/or question. And remember, a lot of these banks have done quite well, including Bank of America has done quite well in digital products and stuff like that. So, when I talk about lack of imagination, I mean, the whole Company. I mean, when you look at some of these things, it was -- we could have imagined more why they become a competitor down the road. So, some of these competitors are quite good. I call it Bobby and Eaton. [Ph] They start with one little thing. They have product. They have services. They have eyeballs. They had customers, and they find ways to monetize it. So, we've got to be a little more forward-looking in how they're looking at active guys and stuff like that. But in our case, there'll be a little bit of everything. We have no fun cannibalizing revenue. Just keep that in mind. We will do the right thing when the time comes. And sometimes dayrate dollar short, but we'll do the right thing. And just if you look at the Company, I mean, if you look at -- we talked about SLR, I always get -- about CS and SLR, but look at the flows across this company. Look at the debit card, the credit card, the trading flows, the market share, the -- that's why I look at much more than what are the ups and downs to the earnings this quarter because of CECL. I don't think that means anything for the future of the company. I mean, our bankers, our traders, our credit card, our debit card, our merchant services, our auto business, our digital, it's doing pretty good. I read -- I look at these reports. My God, the company is doing quite fine. And yes, and we'd like to be a little critical of ourselves. I think when companies aren't, that's part of their failure. They should look at what they didn't do well and what other people have done well. And so, I'd be prepared. And we have a really fair assessment of the competition. It is very large and it's going to be very tough. It does not mean that JPMorgan will win, these eyes are open. I think they're completely different fundamentally. Coming out of the '09 crisis, okay, the world was massive overleveraged. We had investment banks at 40 times leveraged, not JPMorgan. We did not need PARP and didn't need help. The Lehman, Baird, Goldman, Morgan, you had banks overseas, Dexia, the landed banks that I can't remember half of them, all went bankrupt. You had hedge funds deleveraging, a constant deleveraging, you had $0.5 trillion to $1 trillion in mortgage losses that were going to be recognized, actual losses spread around balance sheets and derivatives and stuff like that. So, the world is in a massive deleveraging mode. The consumers overleveraged, companies were overleveraged. The bridge book on Wall Street was $400 billion. Today, it's, I think, 60. If you look at today, today, everything we talk about loans being down is the consumer is -- the positive prime. The consumer, their house value is up, their stock rises up, their incomes are up, their savings are up, their confidence are up. The pandemic is kind of in the rearview mirror. Hopefully, nothing gets worse with it. And they're ready to go. And you see it in home prices, you see it in auto purchases. You see it -- I mean, they'd be much higher but for supply constraints right now. And so -- and businesses equally are in good shape. They're not overleveraged today. They do have a lot of charts show that corporate debt is like higher than it was, so, is corporate cash. If you look at middle market losses, it's almost zero, almost zero and huge unutilized revolving stuff like that. So, the second the economy starts to grow, which -- and I mean, as you're going to see loans go up because inventory receivables and capital expenditures and stuff like that, so it is completely different. And you've got fiscal policy on autopilot. I mean, there's a lot that hasn't been spent yet. There's a lot more that's going to be passed. And if QE so far is a little bit of [indiscernible] $220 million [ph] a month. And I just think you're going to see -- hopefully, see a very strong economy. We don't know how long. Obviously, if you listened to what I just said, that is a inflationary effect on that. And we don't know in the future, I talk about Goldilocks. Goldilocks is -- and I'm hopeful, not predicting. Like Goldilocks is that inflation goes up, the 10-year bond goes up, the growth is still quite strong. You may have growth in the second half this year as stronger than it's ever been in the United States of America, okay? And Europe is probably six months behind America. And so, growth can go into next year, and the 10-year bond goes to 3% and a lot of growth, the short base grows. It won't make any difference. We always had strong growth in consumer there, jobs are plentiful, wages are going up. These are all good things. And so, obviously, if the inflation can be worse than people think, I think it will be a little bit worse with these kinds of things. I don't think it's all temporary, but that doesn't matter if we have very strong growth. Can I just add to this? So, I've always remarked that the G-SIB calculation is one of the [indiscernible] I've ever seen in my whole life. And then we doubled it here. So, the European banks have a lot of disadvantages in terms of -- they don't -- they can't have the regulators -- they can expand across Europe. But one of the advantages, they have pretty much half the G-SIB. But I still think that in the long run, that's right for America to be doubling what I could consider basing artificial number. So, let's just wait to see what all the new rules are, and then we'll answer that question. You don't have to sit there and guess what's going to happen. And remember, there's one buffer, you guys -- we don't really talk about, which is $40 billion of pretax earnings a year, okay? That's a huge buffer. It's huge. It allows you to change your forward-looking capital if you buy back stock and don't buy back stock. And so, we have a lot of levers. And whatever happens, we're going to figure out a way to do a great job for shareholders. If we can find more good money to spend, we're going to spend it. And I told you guys that there's good expense. When we have credit card spend, so much money in marketing, the returns are very good and they spend it. If we can open hire great bankers, something, we're going to spend it. If we can -- we spend $200 million in new data centers, which have a huge benefit for us down the road, we're going to spend it. We do not manage the Company so we can tell analysts what the expense number is going to be. That is just a bad way to run a company. And conversely, a lot of revenue stuff, too. Revenues aren't always good. And we all know how much risk we take in these businesses and stuff like that. So, we spend a lot of time in good revenue, bad revenue and good expense and debt expense. And that's what's going to drive the franchise in the next 5 or 10 years. Probably not. I mean, I think firstly, we wanted the dividend which is sustainable through a bad downturn, and so we really want to do that. And I think this time kind of proves that. It was a very minor thing relative to capital retention. But we want to invest in our future and invest in growing and stuff like that. And if we can't -- and we don't want to raise the dividend so high that it cripples your ability to do other things. And if I owned 100% of the Company, there would be no dividend. Indeed. The market, not the market... And just a simple way to think about it, the 52.5 other than the markets business, which goes up or down, if rates go up, you do see our earnings at risk disclosure, we will earn more NII, all things being equal, which of course they never are, but all the deal. And in addition to that, we can make decisions to deploy more money for more NII. Betsy, let me just -- sorry to interrupt you, but let me just pick up on that point for a second because I think someone else has a similar question. But I would just remind you that we do see that very healthy sequential growth in card loans on the back of spending. But, the key issue is the revolve behavior. And so, our view on that really hasn't changed, and we do see elevated pay rates as a result of the cash buffers, which remains kind of the consistent reason why we have a muted outlook this year. I don't want to correct anyone here, but I personally think you'll see it go up by the end of the year, okay? I think, we'll be a little conservative on that because of all the spend and stuff like that. But we hate guessing. What I look at much more is how many cards you have? How much spend do you have? How many happy customers do you have? NII will take care of itself. Yes. About 5 basis points. ... was at all-time highs. And now, it's not even normal. It's just getting -- all-time highs. At the end, I just wanted to thank Jen Piepszak for a great job as CFO. You'll also know she's happy Wisconsin in a new job. And Jeremy, I know a lot of you know Jeremy, but he's been the CFO of the IB for seven or eight -- eight years or so, so a complete professional. And so, Jeremy, welcome to your first call, and congratulations. Also talk to you all soon. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Piepszak. Ms. Piepszak. Ms. Piepszak, please go ahead.\nJennifer Piepszak: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'll take you through the presentation which as always is available on our website and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back.  Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $14.3 billion, EPS of $4.50, on revenue of $33.1 billion and delivered a return on tangible common equity of 29%. Included in these results are two significant items, $5.2 billion of net credit reserve releases, which I'll cover in more detail shortly, and a $550 million contribution to the Firm's Foundation in the form of equity investments. Touching on a few highlights. We saw another strong quarter in CIB. In fact, net income was an all time record with IB fees up 57% year-on-year, reflecting continued robust activity and markets up 25% year-on-year as the environment remain favorable in January and February although it did start to normalize in March. In AWM, we had record net long term inflows of $48 billion this quarter and deposits of $2.2 trillion were up 36% year-on-year and 5% sequentially, as the Fed balance sheet continues to expand. But loan growth remains muted up 1% year-on-year and 2% quarter-on -quarter, with the bright spots being AWM and secured lending in CIB. Onto Page 2 for more detail on our results. When looking at this quarter's performance, there's a lot of noise in the year-on-year comparisons, particularly given what happened in March of last year. And so it's important to remember a few key points here about March 2020. Effectively investment banking activity stopped or got delayed except for investment grade debt issuance. We recorded $950 million of losses in credit adjustments and other in CIB as well as a $900 million mark down on our bridge book. And in credit, we built $6.8 billion of reserves relative to this quarter's release of $5.2 billion. So with that, in mind, revenue of $33.1 billion was up $4.1 billion or 14% year-on-year. Net interest income was down $1.6 billion, or 11% primarily driven by lower rates. And noninterest revenue was up $5.7 billion, or 39%. While this comparison is in part impacted by several of the items I just mentioned, in absolute terms, we saw strong fee generation across the franchise including in investment banking, AWM and home lending as well as a strong performance in markets. Expenses of $18.7 billion were up 12% year-on-year on higher volume and revenue related expenses. The contribution to the Foundation that I just mentioned as well as continued investments. And credit costs were a net benefit of $4.2 billion driven by reserve releases. And here it's worth noting that charge-offs were down about $400 million year-on-year or 28%, and continue to trend near historical lows. Turning to Page 3 for more detail on our reserves. We released approximately $5.2 billion of reserves this quarter as recent economic data has been consistently positive, indicating that the recovery may be accelerating faster than we would have thought just a few months ago. Starting with consumer, in card, we released $3.5 billion as the employment picture has continued to improve. The round three stimulus has provided another level of support and early stage delinquencies remain very low. And in home lending, we release $625 million primarily driven by continued improvement in HPI expectations and to a lesser extent portfolio runoff. And then in wholesale, we released approximately $700 million. While strong recovery seems in motion, we're also prepared for more adverse outcomes given remaining uncertainties around the impact of new virus strains and the health of the underlying labor markets. So for now, we remain cautious and are still weighted to our downside scenarios, and at about $26 billion were reserved at approximately $7 billion above the current base case. However, it's worth noting that even in a more normalized environment, we wouldn't expect to be 100% weighted to the base case, as we'll always have some weighting on alternative scenarios. Now moving to balance sheet and capital on page 4; we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.1% flat versus the prior quarter as net growth and retained earnings was offset by lower AOCI and higher RWA. Perhaps more interesting ratio right now is SLR which is at 5.5% excluding the temporary relief that just expired. As we said all along, we were never going to rely on short-term temporary relief as a long term planning matters. And this is evidenced by actions we've taken. We've already engaged with our wholesale deposit clients to explore solutions, and we issued $1.5 billion of preferred stock in the first quarter. Having said that it's worth reinforcing a few points here. First, it's important to remember that the SLR is a leverage based requirement, not a risk based requirement. The growth in bank leverage has been driven by deposits and therefore cannot be cured by reducing lending. In fact, the opposite would be true. If we had more loan growth, it would help because it would absorb excess risk based capital. The issue is that we've had muted loan demands to date. And even if it starts to pick up, it's hard to envision that organic loan growth could keep pace with further QE. And therefore we expect this leverage issue to persist for some time. And finally, when a bank is leveraged constraint, this lowers the marginal value of any deposits regardless if it is wholesale or retail, operational or non-operational and regulators to consider whether requiring banks to hold additional capital for further deposit growth is the right outcome. As we told you last quarter, we have levers to manage SLR and we will, however, raising capital against deposits and/or turning away deposits are unnatural actions for banks and cannot be good for the system in the long run. And then just to wrap up on capital regarding distribution, the limitations were extended another quarter. So based on our income that corresponds to buyback capacity of about $7.4 billion in the second quarter after paying our $0.90 dividend. Given the preferred, we plan to issue and the work underway around excess client deposits, while of course this could become more challenging, we believe that we should be able to buy back most if not all of that capacity. Now let's go to our businesses starting with consumer and community banking on page 5. CCB reported net income of $6.7 billion including reserve releases of $4.6 billion. Starting with the key drivers of year-on-year financial performance, which I'll just note have generally been consistent over the last few quarters against the backdrop of strong consumer balance sheets, with higher savings rates and investments as well as healthy de-leveraging. Deposit growth was 32% or $240 billion as existing customer balances remain elevated. And we also continue to acquire new customers. Client investment assets were up 44% driven by market appreciation and positive net flows across our advisor and digital channels. Home lending originations were $39 billion, up 40% and an overall larger market. And auto loan and lease originations were $11.2 billion, up 35%, with March being the best month on record. However, loans were down 7% as outstandings in card remain lower even as spend is recovering to pre-COVID levels. This is in addition to the continued runoff of the mortgage portfolio and partially offset by PPP additions.  Mobile users grew 9% to nearly $42 million, and the customer migration to digital continued with brands transactions still down double digits. In consumer banking, approximately 50% of new checking and savings accounts were opened digitally. And that's up more than 10 percentage points year-on-year. Notably, we're also seeing a few emerging trends worth covering. Consumer sentiment has returned to more normalized levels reflecting increased optimism. We've seen debit and credit cards been returned to pre-pandemic levels, up 9% year-on-year and 14% versus 1Q, 2019 despite T&E remaining significantly lower. That said we are seeing strong momentum in T&E with spend up more than 50% in March compared to February, and similar growth across CX loyalty and ultimate reward travel bookings. With higher rates, mortgage lock margins have tightened and refi applications have slowed but the overall market is still robust. And on credit, government's stimulus and industry forbearance programs have provided confidence that the bridge is likely going to be long enough and strong enough. Taken together with the pace of the vaccine rollout, we believe there's some permanent to the loss mitigation. And while 1Qm 2021 card losses are higher quarter-on- quarter, we do expect losses to decrease in the second and third quarters. In summary, revenue of $12.5 billion was down 6% year-on-year driven by deposit margin compression and lower card NII and lower balances largely offset by strong deposit growth and higher home lending production revenue. Expenses of $7.2 billion were down 1% as we self-fund our investment. And credit costs were a net benefit of $3.6 billion driven by the $4.6 billion of reserve releases I previously mentioned; partially offset by net charge- offs of a $1 billion. Now turning to the corporate and investment bank on Page 6. CIB reported net income of $5.7 billion and an ROE of 27% on record first quarter revenue of $14.6 billion. Investment banking revenue of $2.9 billion was up 67% year-on-year excluding the impact of the bridge bookmark down last year. IB fees of $3 billion were up 57% and while we nap ranked number two largely due to SPAC IPOs, we maintained our global IB wallet share of 9%. The quarter's performance was an all time record driven by the continued momentum in the equity issuance markets, as well as robust activity in M&A and DCM. In advisory, we were up 35% benefiting from the surge and announcement activity in the second half of 2020. Debt underwriting fees were up 17% driven by leveraged finance activity, and here we maintained our number one rank and lead left position. And in equity underwriting fees were up more than 200% primarily driven by IPOs, as clients continue to take advantage of strong market conditions. Looking forward, the IPO calendar is expected to remain active with M&A momentum likely to continue. And while the pipeline is higher than it's ever been, the number of flow deals outside of the pipeline both this year and last year, make it difficult to predict the second quarter. So at this point, I'd say we expect IB fees to be about flat year-on-year. Moving to markets, total revenue was $9.1 billion, up 25% against a strong prior year quarter. In January and February, we saw a robust trading environment and client activity remained elevated with the positive momentum from the end of 2020 carrying through to the start of the year. In March, our performance started to normalize but remained above pre-COVID levels. Fixed Income was up 15% with outperformance in securitized products and credit supported by active primary and secondary markets, partially offset by lower revenues and rates and currency and emerging markets against a tough compare in March of last year.  Equity markets was up 47% and an all time record driven by a favorable trading environment and equity derivatives as well as strong client activity across products. In terms of outlook based on recent weeks, we would expect this quarter to be closer to the second quarter of 2019 as to 2Q 2020 was the best quarter on record for our markets franchise but obviously it's still early.  Wholesale payments and security services revenues were $1.4 billion and $1.1 billion respectively, both down 2% year-on-year with higher deposit balances more than offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $7.1 billion were up 19% year-on-year on higher revenue related compensation, partially offset by lower legal expense. And credit costs were a net benefit of $331 million driven by the reserve releases I discussed earlier. Now let's go to commercial banking on page 7. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.2 billion and an ROE of 19%. Revenue of $2.4 billion was up 11% year-on-year with higher lending in investment banking revenue and the absence of a prior year marked down in the bridge book partially offset by lower deposit revenue. Record gross investment banking revenue of $1.1 billion was up 65% with broad based strength as market conditions remain favorable. Expenses of $969 million were down 2% driven by lower structural expenses. Deposits of $291 billion were up 54% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on-quarter as client balances remain elevated. And loans were down 2% year-on-year and 3% sequentially. C&I loans were down 4% from the prior quarter on lower revolver balances as clients continue to access capital markets for liquidity, partially offset by additional PPP funding. And CRE loans were down 1% with continued low origination volumes and commercial term lending, partially offset by increased affordable housing activity. Finally, credit costs were a net benefit of $118 million driven by reserve releases with net charge-offs of $29 million driven by oil and gas. Now on to asset and wealth management on page 8. Asset and wealth management generated record net income of $1.2 billion with pretax margin of 40% and ROE of 35%. For the quarter, revenue of $4.1 billion was up 20% year-on-year, as higher management fees, growth and deposit and loan balances as well as investment valuation gains were partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $2.6 billion were up 6% with higher volume and revenue related expenses, partially offset by lower structural expense. And credit costs were a net benefit of $121 million primarily due to reserve releases. For the quarter, record net long-term inflows of $48 billion were again positive across all channels, asset classes and regions with particular strength and equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $44 billion as banks encourage clients to move excess deposits away from them. AUM of $2.8 trillion and overall client assets of $3.8 trillion, up 28% and 32% year-on-year respectively, were driven by higher market levels as well as strong net inflows. And finally, deposits were up 43% and loans were up 18% with strength in security based lending, custom lending and mortgages. Now onto corporate on page 9. Corporate reported a net loss of $580 million. Revenue was a loss of $473 million, down $639 million year-on-year. Net interest income was down nearly $700 million on lower rates as well as limited deployment opportunities on the back of continued deposit growth. And expenses of $876 million were up $730 million year-on-year, primarily driven by the contribution to the Foundation I mentioned earlier. The results for the quarter also include a tax benefit related to the impact of the Firm's expected full year tax rate relative to the level of pretax income this quarter. So with that, moving to the outlook on page 10. You'll see here that our 2021 and NII outlook have around $55 billion remains in line with our previous guidance, as the benefits of the steepening yield curve are being offset by customer behavior in card. It's worth noting that forecasting NII is perhaps more challenging than it's been in a long time, as many of the key inputs market, implied rates, deposit forecast, securities reinvestment and customer behavior in card are all quite fluid. And as a reminder, while customer de-leveraging in higher payment rates in card is a headwind for NII, it's a tailwind for credit. And we now expect our card net charge-off rate to be around 250 basis points for the year. And then on expenses, we've increased our guidance to approximately $70 billion with the largest driver being higher volume and revenue related expenses, which importantly have offsets in revenue. So to wrap up, the year has gotten off to a strong start and a robust economic recovery seems underway. Of course, there are still risks and uncertainties ahead that we're preparing for as well as specific issues that we're facing, including the balance sheet dynamics. I mentioned the rate environment and tough year-over-year comparisons, among other things. Having said that, the earnings power of the franchise remains evident, and we'll continue to use our resources to serve our clients, customers and communities. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nErikaNajarian: Hi, good morning. My first question is for Jamie. Jamie, you noted during a December conference that you believe that normalized ROTC for JPMorgan would be about 17%. And investors are wondering as we think about JPMorgan, perhaps cementing a higher GSIB surcharge at 4% this year, is 17% still achievable under that context or constraint?\nJenniferPiepszak: So, yes, so Erika, I'll start. So just a couple of things to think about on capital. So while we're, we ended the year in the 4% bucket for GSIB and it's probably worth mentioning, given the continued expansion of the system through the Fed's balance sheet, even staying in four could become challenging for us. But just a couple of things to keep in mind there is we believe that like we do have offsets in the stress capital buffer, and we do believe that it's very possible that we'll see those come through in this round. Of course, it's dependent upon the Fed models, not our models, but we've talked about things that actions that we've taken sort of mechanical in nature in addition to moving investment securities into held to maturity that should give us some benefit on the SCB. Of course, that's scenario dependent, but we do expect some benefit there that could offset. It's also important to remember that we still are waiting for the Basel III endgame. And the indication from the Fed is that they will address GSIB recalibration as part of that. And so it's quite possible that we see GSIB recalibration but perhaps another constraint that we will be managing. So there is a lot that we will learn over probably the next year or two. And of course, the higher GSIB it doesn't come into effect until the first quarter of 2023. So we do think we have offsets, we're still thinking about 12% as being a target CET1 for us, of course, given what we know today. But we are still waiting for that Basel III endgame to really understand what we're dealing with. And at that 12% in a more normalized environment, which wouldn't just be about rates, it would also be about loan demand 17% still feels achievable for us. \nErikaNajarian: Got it. And thank you for going through, some of the leverage constraint now that SLR has been -- exemption has expired. Investors have also been wondering as we think about your opportunity to continue to facilitate the economic recovery globally, does the constraint on SLR and the moving pieces on GSIB change your priorities in terms of timing or sizing of the $30 billion buyback or, inorganic growth opportunities that you've mentioned in the past?\nJenniferPiepszak: I would say broadly speaking, no, but an important point there on SLR, we obviously, the levers we have are issuing preferred, we can retain more common, but we're also working closely with wholesale clients in a very selective way, as I mentioned, to find alternatives for excess deposits. So it is true that common is one of the levers although I will say that while it might give us more flexibility, it comes at a much greater cost. So at this point, given what we know and what we expect, we don't expect that we would have to retain more common. We think we can manage this through issuing more preferred and working closely with our clients to find alternatives. So I would say broadly speaking, no, the GSIB constraints, as we've been saying for years now is one that will become increasingly challenging for us and now particularly with the expansion of the system it's even more challenging than perhaps it was just a few years ago, but we're managing through that as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research.\nJohnMcDonald: Hey, good morning, Jen. I want to ask about expenses. Obviously, you've raised the outlook by a $1 billion a few times, the last couple times you spoken. I guess in terms of the increase that you've announced today to the outlook, can you give a little more color on how much of that is volume and revenue related, as opposed to the other buckets you talked about in January, which were investments and structural?\nJenniferPiepszak: Sure. So the increase from the $69 billion, which was the guidance we gave in the K, is almost entirely volume and revenue related. And so there, I'll just make an important point that it's volume and revenue related. So as an example, volumes in CCB, just given the environment, they are very valuable for long-term franchise revenue growth, but we may not see that revenue growth in the near term. But as we always say, we don't manage this place for one quarter or even one year. So there are expenses associated with volume growth that may not have the revenue growth, you would anticipate over the long run, but it's almost entirely volume and revenue related. There are a few other things like marketing expense that given the strength of the recovery that we expect, we now expect to lean more in on marketing expense in the second half of the year. So that's part of it as well.\nJohnMcDonald: Okay, and I guess the follow up would be, is that necessarily mean that it's more concentrated the increase in the first quarter because you had such a big quarter? And are there COVID related costs that you have in your numbers this year that might come out over time?\nJenniferPiepszak: Obviously, some of it is in the first quarter, but things like further volume related expenses, like I talked about, or marketing, they're less so in the first quarter. And then what was your other question? \nJohnMcDonald: COVID. \nJenniferPiepszak: Oh, those numbers are lower than they were even last year and yes included in the outlook but not material in the grand scheme of things.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.\nGlennSchorr: Hello there. So, if you're right on the economy, which I think a lot of us think you are, we're starting to see the spend part of the pickup now, as you mentioned, across credit and debit, and some of the [T&E] [ph]. So my question is, how do you think about the staging of the lend part? Both consumer corporates are so flush with all that liquidity. Have you think about the timing for loan growth? And if I could get a consumer versus wholesale comment that would be great.\nJenniferPiepszak: Sure, so you use the right word, which is demand. And it really is all about demand, which of course is quite healthy, particularly as it relates to the consumer, when you think about the amount of deleveraging that we've seen through this process. So there we do expect a second half pickup, because as you say, we first have to see spend recover before we see re-levering on the consumer side. So and then it is also true even for small business, which is obviously part of CCB, their demand has been very low, given the support that's available through PPP. And so that will likely pick up in the second half as well. And then elsewhere, AWM has been strong throughout. And we see that continuing. And then on the CIB side, I mean, that's always lumpy and deal dependent. But that's active as well. And we do see within secured lending opportunities there across asset classes, again, that's a bit more opportunistic. And then in the commercial bank, given the level of support the amount of liquidity in the markets, as well as the amount of cash on balance sheets, loan growth, there has been muted and probably will be for some time, but again, that's incredibly healthy, ultimately for their recovery. And so whether we see that pickup later this year, or next year, remains to be seen, but it's all for good reasons. \nGlennSchorr: I appreciate that. And maybe I'll just ask one follow up on the deposit side, obviously, deposit growth has been incredibly strong. So the two parter is what do you think happens on the deposit side as the economy goes down the path that you've outlined, and what do you do with the deposit money in the meantime because I saw a loud and clear Jamie comments on it's hard to justify the price of US debt. So what we are doing with all that liquidity in the meantime?\nJenniferPiepszak: So first of all, I would say that deposits are going to be driven by the Fed's balance sheet. And to some extent, obviously, by bank lending, but given the demand picture there, you can think of it in the near term as all being driven by Fed balance sheet expansion. And so we obviously continue to expect significant deposit growth, which is why we've been talking about this so much. And then just in terms of how we deploy it, you will have seen that our cash balances are up quarter-over-quarter. And there, it's just important to remember that for sure we are being patient in the investment securities portfolio that is true. I'll also mention that we are -- because of the steepening of the yield curve, we are less short, and banks will drift long in a sell off. And so that has been part of the dynamic as well, but they are short term cash deployment also. And so what we saw there was when repo markets fall below IOER, we're going to hold that short term cash deployment in IOER relative to the repo market. So you'll see that dynamic on our balance sheet, as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies.\nKenUsdin: Hey, Jen thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to elaborate on that. You mentioned the record investment banking pipeline, and flattish year-over-year is the best guess. So I was just wondering if you could talk about the mix dynamics there. Obviously, the first quarter was just ridiculously great in terms of the ECM markets. And can you just give us a flavor of just where you see activity? And how much is that underwriting activity, potentially dampening what might be happening on the commercial loan side?\nJenniferPiepszak: Well, I'll start with the latter, which is, it's absolutely been very, very supportive of corporates, and therefore it has a lot to do with what we're seeing in terms of the muted loan demand from corporates. And then in terms of the mix, we expect ECM and M&A to continue. But on DCM there's a lot of flow activity that doesn't necessarily get represented in a pipeline because it's high velocity type activity. We saw that in the second quarter of last year. We continue to see that now, which is why I said it makes it a little bit difficult to predict the second quarter so that while the pipeline is higher than it's ever been, there is still a lot of high velocity activity. And so that's why we think that the quarter will be flattish year-over-year despite the very high pipeline.\nJamieDimon: Do you guys hear me?\nJenniferPiepszak: Yes.\nJamieDimon: Because we can't hear you anymore. Oh. And I'm gonna put you on mute for a minute.\nJenniferPiepszak: Okay. Jamie's traveling, so we have him on zoom. I know everybody can appreciate technology challenges, because we've all had them over the last year.\nKenUsdin: Okay, great, Jen. And my just -- my follow up --\nJamieDimon: Jen, just keep on going because I can't hear the questions. I can't hear you. But you're doing a great job, and you don't really need me\nJenniferPiepszak: Well, thank you. I'm sure I'll need you at some point. So hope they're on that. Anyway, go ahead. I'm sorry.\nKenUsdin: Yes, no problem, Jen. Okay, so the second one is just with regards to the comments that you guys have made for a while about looking at acquisition opportunities. Just wondering just how is the interplay between everything you've talked about already on balance sheet capacity, and ongoing deposit growth and limitations on CET1 and SLR versus how you make potential decisions around usage of capital and an acquisition capacity?\nJenniferPiepszak: Yes, it's a great question. Interestingly, the issue is not that we don't have capital available to make those types of decisions. The issue is that we have the wrong binding constraints. So the binding constraint is leverage not risk based. And so it doesn't change the way we think about acquisitions at all. In fact, acquisitions and/or increased loan growth would help to kind of normalize the constraints between leverage and risk based. And so we would love to be able to absorb some of our CET1 through acquisitions, because as I said, it sort of just brings the balance back into focus. The issue is that that it's leverage base constraint, that is the constraint and we're in a low rate environment with low loan demand and very strong deposit growth. So it's the combination of all those things that make leverage the binding constraint. But it doesn't change the way we're thinking about acquisitions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsyGraseck: Hey, Jen. Hey, thanks for the time. Jen, a question on card and looking at the net charge-off. You've gave us the full year of 2.5% and I know you spent a lot of time in card earlier in your career. So maybe you could give us some sense on how you're thinking about the quote unquote normalization of that loss content over time. When I think back to the bankruptcy, changes in the 00's, it took many years for consumers to relapse. And I'm wondering, given your background there, could you give us a sense as to what is different this time? And are there timeframes historically, we should look at or what a normal course like re-leveraging back to normal of that card loss content should be? How do you think about that?\nJenniferPiepszak: Sure, I would say this; first of all, it's difficult to find a historical comparison that's totally relevant here. Because I don't think we've ever seen this amount of support in the system, which came, of course, on top of an already reasonably healthy consumer. So it's difficult to find the historical perspective, but I will say the 2.5%, I mean, pre-COVID, we would have thought that our loss rate in card this year would have been 3.3%, 3.5%. So it just gives you a sense there of that tailwind on credit is significant. And in terms of, what it's going to take for consumers to re-lever, I mean, we do expect there to be significant economic activity in the second half. And so that could come quite naturally. But it could come a little bit later, given the amount of deleveraging we've seen, but the fact that we already see spend above pre-COVID levels, and obviously, we still have restrictions in place, particularly around T&E on consumers ability to spend. When that comes back, we do think that we'll see spend tick even higher. And that will be a point where perhaps we'll start to see that re-levering. But it is difficult to know, it's a great question.\nBetsyGraseck: Okay. And then the follow up I have on your comments around the NII guide. And the fact that it's hard to forecast. I got a couple of questions in this morning just on hey, why do you think it's flat versus prior guide given the curve has steepened? And also, deposit growth should continue to be up significantly given QE is continuing this full year? So is there some spread angle that you're kind of thinking about that keeps you a little bit more muted? Is it more the loan growth? Maybe you could talk a little bit about those piece parts that you identified?\nJenniferPiepszak: Sure, I think it's probably all the above, Betsy, but starting with the steepening of the yield curve. So if you look at the earnings at risk disclosure, I mean, we are -- we did see the benefit roughly in line with what that disclosure shows, which is, since we last guided on NII, we steepened probably 25-30 basis points. So that is incorporated in the outlook. But it is completely offset by the fact that we continue to see consumer behavior in card in terms of higher payment rates. And we haven't started to see re-levering as we were just talking about, even though spends has recovered. So card, the impacts of card completely offset the steepening of the yield curve; you also mentioned loan growth, which is, critically important to realizing the benefits of the steepening yield curve. And then I would just mention, we have reflected in our outlook, the fact that we have been patient on deploying further deposit growth into the securities portfolio in terms of duration. And then also, it's probably worth noting that the marginal benefit of further deposit growth is quite small, given the fact that deployment opportunities are minimal. And so, you can think about them as being something less than 10 basis points, because we do have pay rates above zero, so it's something less than 10 basis points. So the marginal deposit growth from here doesn't add a whole lot in this environment anyway.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMikeMayo: Hey, Jennifer. My question is for Jamie. And Jamie, your philosophy is to invest through a downturn, and you're increasing your investments by one fourth year-over-year, you already said that. But what's your philosophy about investing through a boom as you expect over the next three years? I mean, if the pie is growing, do your investments go higher? It looks like that's not the case with the guidance you guys gave.\nJamieDimon: So I think, Mike, the way to really look at it as it might doesn't -- it doesn't affected a much by boom and bust as you think. So we isolate opportunities like for -- so now we're going to hire 300 black financial advisors, we're going to do that whether it's boom or bust. We're building new data centers. We're building new agile, we're going to the cloud, so I think it doesn't really paying that much over time. I just think you're probably seeing our investment go up over time not go down. We get plenty of organic growth opportunities, which we want to invest in.\nMikeMayo: And then how much you spending in climate? Your 66 pages CEO letter was, I guess that's like a -- could be a third of a book almost. But you really had the table on climate risk and what you guys need to do, how much you actually spending? And what's the payback on that spending for shareholders? Or is this really an ESG reputational benefit you're looking for?\nJenniferPiepszak: So I'll start there, Mike, and then Jamie, you can chime in. But climate is a long game, obviously. And we're investing a lot of effort in our ESG initiatives, not only because they have a positive impact on society and communities, but because they're also important to our clients, customers and our shareholders. So we don't exactly think about it that way, Mike. But we've also invested in multiple teams to help clients through the transition. And we do recognize it's a transition and clients appreciate that. We've also made the Paris aligned financing commitment last year, and we're going to release our annual ESG report next month. So you'll see more there. And then we also committed to finance $200 billion towards climate action and sustainable development. And we're continuing to grow those efforts as well. And in fact, your questions quite timely, because we're planning to make an ambitious announcement tomorrow about long-term scaling of our financing efforts here. So much more detail to come shortly on that. But Jamie, I don't know if you want to add anything.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global.\nJimMitchell: Hey, good morning. Maybe just maybe a question on the bank SLR which I think was a bit more of a constraint even than the Firmwide SLR? Just I guess, two questions related to that. What kind of flexibility do you have to kind of manage the difference between the two moving assets out of the bank perhaps? And then just if you have any updates or thoughts on potential changes that regulators are discussing to kind of give maybe relief 2.0 in a more permanent sense on the SLR?\nJenniferPiepszak: So the bank SLR, I mean, broadly speaking, it's going to be the same levers, we do have a little bit more flexibility, as you note, because we can move things, we can inject capital into the bank from the holding company. So it's a little bit more flexible, but generally speaking, the constraints and the levers are the same. And then in terms of changes, we know what you know. And so, we look forward to our proposal, the only thing I can mention is, of course, the difference between the US and Europe on Basel as it relates to SLR is there, it's 3% plus half year, GSIB. And so we have a constant 2% buffer. And so -- and with that, you get the flexibility in a Basel compliant way to exclude deposits at central banks for a period of time. So it's possible that it could look something like that, but we don't know.\nJimMitchell: Okay, thanks.\nJamieDimon: So I think there is too much focus there. We run the business, do a great job servicing clients over time, we manage 20 years. If I, god knows how many different capital liquidity contents. We have multiple levers to pull all the time to do that while serving our clients. If we've got to adjust our strategy going forward, so be it, we'll probably be fine. I think the question you should be asking isn't what it means for us, is what it means the marketplace. I've already mentioned several times we have $1.5 trillion of cash and marketable securities, which we cannot deploy in a whole bunch of different ways into the marketplace with repo or just financing positions or helping people because of these constraints. So the constraints are more of a constraint on the economy than they are on JPMorgan Chase. We will find a way regardless of any constraints to do things. The other thing GSIB SLR, they're always bubble thing. They need to be recalibrated. And I think people have been asking why how would you recalibrate to do the best job for the United States and the people of United States not for JPMorgan? JPMorgan is going to be fine either way.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerardCassidy: Hi, Jen, how are you? Question, I apologize if you address this. I had to jump off for a minute here. But can you share with us on the service -- mortgage servicing business? It looked like you had a small loss this quarter similar to the fourth quarter. Can you tell us some of the metrics that went into why the servicing business recorded a small loss?\nJenniferPiepszak: Oh, gosh, Gerard. Not even sure. But Reggie and the team can follow up with you.\nGerardCassidy: Okay, very good. The second question has to do with when we go back to the day one, loan loss reserves, established in January 1, 2020 for you and your peers under CECL accounting. If I recall, I think your loan loss reserves to total loans at the time were approximately 1.87%. Today, they're approximately 2.42%. I know you guys gave some color on your outlook for what you think credit will look like you being a little more conservative. But can you share with us what would it take to bring the reserves back down to the day one levels that we saw in January 1, 2020?\nJenniferPiepszak: Well, it's very difficult to try to compare today to just taking our balance sheet today, taking the profile of our portfolio today and compare it to CECL day one, because we are a very far away from that, in fact, in a very healthy way. So that's very difficult to do. What I will say is that it is true that things have continued to improve even since we closed our process in the first quarter. And we obviously expect things to be, we expect the recovery to be robust in the second half of the year. And so if we continue to see that, if we continue to see labor markets recover, if we continue to see the vaccine rollout be successful, we would have future releases from here. And but I would note importantly, that the $7 billion that is the distance between our reserve and the base case is just for context, we will always have weightings on alternative scenarios. And so all else equal, which is there's a lot in the all else equal bucket. But we would release something less than $7 billion so difficult to compare back to CECL day one, but there could be further releases ahead.\nJamieDimon: Yes. One of the negatives to CECL, which I pointed out, right in the beginning that we spend a lot of time on these calls describing something which is virtually irrelevant for the bank, which is these are multiple scenarios, hypothetical probability based, and obviously, the more volatile environments and more volatile these numbers, if a base case was $20 billion, and we now have something like $30 billion, we're not going to be taking down a lot of reserves now, because you're always, As Jen said, you are always going to have extreme adverse case. Think of it like kind CCAR test, you always have a percentage of reserves up for that permanently. And so always and hopefully, I mean, my view is we should waste a lot less time on CECL that makes almost no difference to the company in general. \nJenniferPiepszak: And then back on your servicing point, I got the answer. It's updates to the MSR model. So HPI updates, prepay updates. So it's less about the operation and more about the MSR model update.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMattO'Connor: Good morning, I wanted to ask about the CEO letter where there was talk about being open to FinTech deals, which is something you've talked about in the past. But what type of deals would you be interested in? And I guess it could be material to JPMorgan as we think about whether it's a strategy or financial impact?\nJamieDimon: So remember, we're after paying a steady, careful dividend and stuff like. You might prefer to invest in our business organically, including the acquisitions than buyback stock. We're buying back stock because our cup run is over. We have 13.6% capital to risk weighted, advanced risk weighted assets. We're earning a tremendous sum of money, and we really have no option right now. But I think the door is open to anything that makes sense. So we've already done InstaMed, which is an electronic digital payment platform between providers and consumers in health care. We did 55 IP which is a tax way of -- a tax efficient way of managing money. And we're looking at tons of things ourselves. Some we're doing ourselves like dynamo. Some are going to partner with other people. We've got investments and probably 100 different companies are going to be a partner with or like. So we're completely open minded. It could be payments, it could be asset management, it could be an agency, it could data, and it could be anything like that. It cannot be a US Bank. So we're just reminding people if you got great ideas for us, let us know.\nMattO'Connor: And as the mentality and FinTech specifically is that to potentially accelerate some of the investments that you would have done on your own or to add capabilities, or maybe to protect what you already have?\nJamieDimon: Well, it's a little of everything because you see us adding Chase My Plan and Chase My Loan and obviously, see competing a little bit buy now pay later, you see us doing Chase Offers and compete with people, you see us doing Zelle payments, we got tons of fabulous stuff coming. We did do invest a couple of years ago and had a very good quarter, we're ending Robo investing, which is just getting going. So we're adding a broad set of capabilities across the full spectrum. And you're going to see a lot more, and you're going to see personalization apps. If you go into the payment system, you can see, global wallets, you can see tons of stuff is coming in. Like I said, the FinTech has done a great job. And I pointed out that they live under different constraints. But they've done a great job, getting rid of pain points, making full automated digitizing things using the cloud. It's incumbent upon us to go faster the cloud; we already have 115 major AI projects. But my guess is in five years, it'll be 1,000 AI projects. So we're going as fast as we can to do a great job for customers. And obviously, FinTech is -- it will be a challenge; there's a lot of money there. They're very smart people. I want to be clear, we're not wishing regulations on them like I'm not, and I think they are to be bad for America. But we are wishing for a level playing field when it comes around certain products and certain services. Now I for one thing it's grossly unfair, that a neo bank could have a small checking account, earn $200, in Durbin fees, and we earn $100, that just isn't right. And I go on and on and on about some of the unfair things, but let the regulars do it. I'm not expecting any change. We'll just adjust our strategies accordingly.\nOperator: Your next question comes from a line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.\nBrianKleinhanzl: Hey, Good morning. I just have a quick question. I mean, as we start to look out to forward rates and market kind of implying Fed moving somewhat in the near term or intermediate term? I mean how are you guys thinking about the positive beta this cycle and kind of what's included in your NII sensitivity both on the consumer and commercial deposits? Thanks.\nJamieDimon: So I think the way to answer is the betas have gamma mean, they change over time. And we have our best guess and numbers that Jen gave you. So obviously, the beta is going up all the time. And then it levels off.\nJenniferPiepszak: That's right. And so the betas have gamma. Like, I'd say that if you can think of it as being nonlinear, meaning the beta for the first 100 basis points will be lower than the beta for the second and third increments of 100 basis points. And so from here, on the retail side, specifically, the first 100 basis points will be very valuable, because there is a lower beta associated with it. So that's really where we see the benefit in NII with short rates in an environment with low loan growth. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Peabody with Portales Partners.\nCharlesPeabody: Hello, can you hear me?\nJenniferPiepszak: Yes, we can hear you go ahead.\nCharlesPeabody: Sorry about that. I had a question about the impact that negative rates at the short end of the yield curve might have on your entity. Specifically, if we -- you touched a little bit on IOR rate and the overnight repo rate being raised. Would that have any impacts on your market related NII, we had to raise by five basis points. Secondly, if we do get negative rates at the short end, is that incorporated in your $55 billion NII guidance? And then thirdly, if we do get negative rates at the short end, does that have any implications for what loan demand might look like? Thank you.\nJenniferPiepszak: Sure. So I'll just start by saying while we have seen repo go negative at times, it's been orderly and so we don't expect short rates to be negative for any longer period of time or and we certainly haven't seen spikes, which is something you would worry about more. I think with the amount of capacity in the money market complex and the fact that the Fed increased their RRP facility. Now that facility is at zero, so that certainly is supportive of ensuring short rates don't go negative for any meaningful period of time, they also obviously could increase that. And then for us, I would say not a meaningful impact because obviously we have 10 basis points of IOER as an option for us. But we do trade around it. \nJamieDimon: And I would just add, the why is far more important than the number like NII, obviously, like in trading, it goes in and out, the whole thing have been equal, no, it just shows up in a different place. But if you go negative in NII because you're going back into recession, because there's a negative variance, that's a whole different issue, than if it's a temporary timing thing, I will tell you, we would expect rates moving up over time, we expect a rather healthy and very strong economy.\nJenniferPiepszak: Yes. And what we've seen so far on the short end is not unhealthy or something we're worried about. It's a dynamic of so much cash chasing the supply.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lim with Societe Generale.\nAndrewLim: Hi, Jen, Jamie, morning. So just circling back to the SLR. Despite issuing $1.5 billion preferred, you saw last about 30 basis points on your SLR. I am just wondering how you think about the ratio to three quarters out from now. Whether issuing preferred and having a discussion with wholesale depositors is going to be enough to put a flow on that SLR at 5.5% or whether you can have to pull harder on those levers or have to pull hard on other levers?\nJenniferPiepszak: Yes. So the minimum is 5%. So we have some room, naturally, we will have a buffer above the minimum as you always need to when you have binary consequences of going. So you can think about some management buffer above that. But we do still have room at 5.5%. And we do think that we can manage this at this point through issuing will be in the market again, with preferred, as well as the conversations that we've had with clients. So far, they have not been disruptive. We're hopeful that remains the case and that we can manage this.\nAndrewLim: Okay, so what's your level of concept for the buffer above the 5%? And that's my follow up. And then just another question. You gave an update, a couple of quarters guys saying that you had a buffer of, or let's say excess proficiency of about $10 billion versus your best case scenario, economic outlook. Obviously, you've released a lot of provisions since then. Can you give an update on what that figure is now?\nJenniferPiepszak: Sure. So you can think about a buffer on the SLR of call it 25 basis points. There -- it is important to note, something like AOCI is something that we have to incorporate into our thinking and the impact of AOCI is that's part of Tier 1 capital. So we need to have a buffer to make sure that we can manage through any noise we might see there. So that's why we have a buffer and 25 basis points is probably a reasonable one to think about. In terms of the on reserves, the distance between where we are in the base case, as I said in my prepared remarks, that's now $7 billion. What's interesting to note is that that was $10 billion, it was then $9 billion, and we've released $8 billion and it's still $7 billion. So the all of the scenarios have been moving. And there are a lot that goes into how we think about reserves; we've always just provided that as context for everyone, particularly last year as we were managing through so much uncertainty in terms of the inputs into our reserves. So I wouldn't put a lot of weight into that. Because what I also said, on the $7 billion is that you shouldn't think about that as available for release, because we will always have some waiting on alternative scenarios. And so even if everything plays out exactly as we expect, based upon where we closed the books for the first quarter, it would be something less than $7 billion.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Security.\nMikeMayo: Hi, I'm still wrestling with the deposit conundrum. So I guess your national deposit share is something like 12%. And over the last year, I think your incremental deposit share gain is 20%. And in others, the industry deposits are up around $3 trillion and your deposits are up to $600 billion. So I'm just wondering how much of that was due to QE and how much of that is due to organic growth. And maybe you can fill us in because you're building out the branches in the lower 48 states. And you're expanding commercial bankers and try to build up all this organic growth at a time when you can't really monetize those deposits. Thanks.\nJenniferPiepszak: Sure. So first of all, as we always say, we're running the place for the long term. And we don't expect this challenge to be a long-term challenge, maybe a short to medium term, but not a long term. And then I'll just say that, yes, there was certainly some organic growth, but it is Fed balance sheets and bank lending that create deposits. And so that's what we are focused on. And we do think given what we expect here that we can manage it. So and it certainly isn't going to change the way we think about market expansion or otherwise, is that is long term franchise value.\nJamieDimon: I think Jen another just kind of -- I think Mike the $600 billion and it's really hard -- yes, we think we're growing actual share in almost every business deposits. But $500 billion to $600 billion was the Fed balance sheet. And we're a big wholesale bank and a big consumer bank. So obviously a big portion that shows up inside our company. And, again, we try to -- the new branch is doing great, but they're not going to move the needle quite like the Fed, adding $3 trillion to deposit in the system. \nJenniferPiepszak: That's right. \nMikeMayo: And just a quick update on the build out into the 48 lower states branches, you said by the middle of this year.\nJenniferPiepszak: Yes. So we'll be in all lower 48 by the end of July. Is that right? Yes, Reggie is confirming for me. We will be in all lower 48 by the end of July. We opened about 75 branches in market expansion last year; we got a little bit slowed down by COVID. But that's going to be about 150 this year. So remain super excited about that. And all the opportunities that bring across the company not just in deposits, of course, because it brings incredible value to the commercial bank into the private bank. And so the business case there, if you will, is not just about deposits.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nErikaNajarian: Hi. Apologies for prolonging the call. I just got this question a lot on Bloomberg from investors. Just wanted to react the first question another way, it seems like we have been waiting for recalibration on the GSIB for some time now. On the other hand, clearly, the expansion of your balance sheet comes with additional revenue generation and market share taking in some opportunities. And so investors are wondering, if we don't get any sort of calibration that's meaningful, and that CET1 floor does have to move up from 12%. What is the sensitivity of the normalized, what's the outlook, if any at all if that 12% does have to move up in 50 basis points increment?\nJenniferPiepszak: Okay, so if the 12% has to move up, Erika that would obviously have an impact. But there is so much between here and there, and that being a reality that we can't really comment on it because not only I know we've been waiting for GSIB recalibration for a long time, but it has been made very clear that GSIB recalibration will be part of the Basel III endgame which we have also been waiting for a very long time. And so there will be potential offsets that we yet are not -- we were unable to manage because we don't know what they are yet. So we continue to wait for Basel III endgame. And then as I said, we do believe we can manage the stress capital buffer. Again, it's scenario dependent, but we do believe we can manage that to be closer to 2.5%, which helps an awful lot in terms of an offset to GSIB constraints. So we're thinking about that 12% number until we know something's different.\nJamieDimon: And I would just add, we're going to finally try to keep at 12% and we're pretty sure we can do it. So I'm not that worried about it. But I don't know what the confusion is. If it did go up, like if we're earning 20% tangible equity, and our capital goes up by 5%. And we get no return on the 5%; our ROE goes to 19%. So I don't understand the confusion. The underlying results are still fabulous and great and you have slight low returns. But I even think that will be temporary, we will over time find strategies and tactics to get referred to the federal shareholders. But the most importantly about those returns we have great business. Great branches, great products, great services, good margins, good service, good app, the control is good. And that's what we really build all the time. It is other stuffs that just managing around capitals and franchise. It's a shame that this, I mean, this is not the way to run a railroad anymore. We are spending time and are calling CECL and SLR and it's a shame and it does distract from growing the American economy. I've mentioned over and over we have one -- we have $2.2 trillion deposits, $1 trillion loans, $1.5 trillion cash and marketable securities. Much of it would cannot be deployed intermediate or lend. How conservative do you want to get?\nJenniferPiepszak: No, I agree. I think the market needed to hear that. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time.\nJennifer Piepszak: Thank you. Thanks everyone. Thanks, operator. \nJamie Dimon: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jennifer Piepszak",
            "content": "Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'll take you through the presentation which as always is available on our website and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back.  Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $14.3 billion, EPS of $4.50, on revenue of $33.1 billion and delivered a return on tangible common equity of 29%. Included in these results are two significant items, $5.2 billion of net credit reserve releases, which I'll cover in more detail shortly, and a $550 million contribution to the Firm's Foundation in the form of equity investments. Touching on a few highlights. We saw another strong quarter in CIB. In fact, net income was an all time record with IB fees up 57% year-on-year, reflecting continued robust activity and markets up 25% year-on-year as the environment remain favorable in January and February although it did start to normalize in March. In AWM, we had record net long term inflows of $48 billion this quarter and deposits of $2.2 trillion were up 36% year-on-year and 5% sequentially, as the Fed balance sheet continues to expand. But loan growth remains muted up 1% year-on-year and 2% quarter-on -quarter, with the bright spots being AWM and secured lending in CIB. Onto Page 2 for more detail on our results. When looking at this quarter's performance, there's a lot of noise in the year-on-year comparisons, particularly given what happened in March of last year. And so it's important to remember a few key points here about March 2020. Effectively investment banking activity stopped or got delayed except for investment grade debt issuance. We recorded $950 million of losses in credit adjustments and other in CIB as well as a $900 million mark down on our bridge book. And in credit, we built $6.8 billion of reserves relative to this quarter's release of $5.2 billion. So with that, in mind, revenue of $33.1 billion was up $4.1 billion or 14% year-on-year. Net interest income was down $1.6 billion, or 11% primarily driven by lower rates. And noninterest revenue was up $5.7 billion, or 39%. While this comparison is in part impacted by several of the items I just mentioned, in absolute terms, we saw strong fee generation across the franchise including in investment banking, AWM and home lending as well as a strong performance in markets. Expenses of $18.7 billion were up 12% year-on-year on higher volume and revenue related expenses. The contribution to the Foundation that I just mentioned as well as continued investments. And credit costs were a net benefit of $4.2 billion driven by reserve releases. And here it's worth noting that charge-offs were down about $400 million year-on-year or 28%, and continue to trend near historical lows. Turning to Page 3 for more detail on our reserves. We released approximately $5.2 billion of reserves this quarter as recent economic data has been consistently positive, indicating that the recovery may be accelerating faster than we would have thought just a few months ago. Starting with consumer, in card, we released $3.5 billion as the employment picture has continued to improve. The round three stimulus has provided another level of support and early stage delinquencies remain very low. And in home lending, we release $625 million primarily driven by continued improvement in HPI expectations and to a lesser extent portfolio runoff. And then in wholesale, we released approximately $700 million. While strong recovery seems in motion, we're also prepared for more adverse outcomes given remaining uncertainties around the impact of new virus strains and the health of the underlying labor markets. So for now, we remain cautious and are still weighted to our downside scenarios, and at about $26 billion were reserved at approximately $7 billion above the current base case. However, it's worth noting that even in a more normalized environment, we wouldn't expect to be 100% weighted to the base case, as we'll always have some weighting on alternative scenarios. Now moving to balance sheet and capital on page 4; we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.1% flat versus the prior quarter as net growth and retained earnings was offset by lower AOCI and higher RWA. Perhaps more interesting ratio right now is SLR which is at 5.5% excluding the temporary relief that just expired. As we said all along, we were never going to rely on short-term temporary relief as a long term planning matters. And this is evidenced by actions we've taken. We've already engaged with our wholesale deposit clients to explore solutions, and we issued $1.5 billion of preferred stock in the first quarter. Having said that it's worth reinforcing a few points here. First, it's important to remember that the SLR is a leverage based requirement, not a risk based requirement. The growth in bank leverage has been driven by deposits and therefore cannot be cured by reducing lending. In fact, the opposite would be true. If we had more loan growth, it would help because it would absorb excess risk based capital. The issue is that we've had muted loan demands to date. And even if it starts to pick up, it's hard to envision that organic loan growth could keep pace with further QE. And therefore we expect this leverage issue to persist for some time. And finally, when a bank is leveraged constraint, this lowers the marginal value of any deposits regardless if it is wholesale or retail, operational or non-operational and regulators to consider whether requiring banks to hold additional capital for further deposit growth is the right outcome. As we told you last quarter, we have levers to manage SLR and we will, however, raising capital against deposits and/or turning away deposits are unnatural actions for banks and cannot be good for the system in the long run. And then just to wrap up on capital regarding distribution, the limitations were extended another quarter. So based on our income that corresponds to buyback capacity of about $7.4 billion in the second quarter after paying our $0.90 dividend. Given the preferred, we plan to issue and the work underway around excess client deposits, while of course this could become more challenging, we believe that we should be able to buy back most if not all of that capacity. Now let's go to our businesses starting with consumer and community banking on page 5. CCB reported net income of $6.7 billion including reserve releases of $4.6 billion. Starting with the key drivers of year-on-year financial performance, which I'll just note have generally been consistent over the last few quarters against the backdrop of strong consumer balance sheets, with higher savings rates and investments as well as healthy de-leveraging. Deposit growth was 32% or $240 billion as existing customer balances remain elevated. And we also continue to acquire new customers. Client investment assets were up 44% driven by market appreciation and positive net flows across our advisor and digital channels. Home lending originations were $39 billion, up 40% and an overall larger market. And auto loan and lease originations were $11.2 billion, up 35%, with March being the best month on record. However, loans were down 7% as outstandings in card remain lower even as spend is recovering to pre-COVID levels. This is in addition to the continued runoff of the mortgage portfolio and partially offset by PPP additions.  Mobile users grew 9% to nearly $42 million, and the customer migration to digital continued with brands transactions still down double digits. In consumer banking, approximately 50% of new checking and savings accounts were opened digitally. And that's up more than 10 percentage points year-on-year. Notably, we're also seeing a few emerging trends worth covering. Consumer sentiment has returned to more normalized levels reflecting increased optimism. We've seen debit and credit cards been returned to pre-pandemic levels, up 9% year-on-year and 14% versus 1Q, 2019 despite T&E remaining significantly lower. That said we are seeing strong momentum in T&E with spend up more than 50% in March compared to February, and similar growth across CX loyalty and ultimate reward travel bookings. With higher rates, mortgage lock margins have tightened and refi applications have slowed but the overall market is still robust. And on credit, government's stimulus and industry forbearance programs have provided confidence that the bridge is likely going to be long enough and strong enough. Taken together with the pace of the vaccine rollout, we believe there's some permanent to the loss mitigation. And while 1Qm 2021 card losses are higher quarter-on- quarter, we do expect losses to decrease in the second and third quarters. In summary, revenue of $12.5 billion was down 6% year-on-year driven by deposit margin compression and lower card NII and lower balances largely offset by strong deposit growth and higher home lending production revenue. Expenses of $7.2 billion were down 1% as we self-fund our investment. And credit costs were a net benefit of $3.6 billion driven by the $4.6 billion of reserve releases I previously mentioned; partially offset by net charge- offs of a $1 billion. Now turning to the corporate and investment bank on Page 6. CIB reported net income of $5.7 billion and an ROE of 27% on record first quarter revenue of $14.6 billion. Investment banking revenue of $2.9 billion was up 67% year-on-year excluding the impact of the bridge bookmark down last year. IB fees of $3 billion were up 57% and while we nap ranked number two largely due to SPAC IPOs, we maintained our global IB wallet share of 9%. The quarter's performance was an all time record driven by the continued momentum in the equity issuance markets, as well as robust activity in M&A and DCM. In advisory, we were up 35% benefiting from the surge and announcement activity in the second half of 2020. Debt underwriting fees were up 17% driven by leveraged finance activity, and here we maintained our number one rank and lead left position. And in equity underwriting fees were up more than 200% primarily driven by IPOs, as clients continue to take advantage of strong market conditions. Looking forward, the IPO calendar is expected to remain active with M&A momentum likely to continue. And while the pipeline is higher than it's ever been, the number of flow deals outside of the pipeline both this year and last year, make it difficult to predict the second quarter. So at this point, I'd say we expect IB fees to be about flat year-on-year. Moving to markets, total revenue was $9.1 billion, up 25% against a strong prior year quarter. In January and February, we saw a robust trading environment and client activity remained elevated with the positive momentum from the end of 2020 carrying through to the start of the year. In March, our performance started to normalize but remained above pre-COVID levels. Fixed Income was up 15% with outperformance in securitized products and credit supported by active primary and secondary markets, partially offset by lower revenues and rates and currency and emerging markets against a tough compare in March of last year.  Equity markets was up 47% and an all time record driven by a favorable trading environment and equity derivatives as well as strong client activity across products. In terms of outlook based on recent weeks, we would expect this quarter to be closer to the second quarter of 2019 as to 2Q 2020 was the best quarter on record for our markets franchise but obviously it's still early.  Wholesale payments and security services revenues were $1.4 billion and $1.1 billion respectively, both down 2% year-on-year with higher deposit balances more than offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $7.1 billion were up 19% year-on-year on higher revenue related compensation, partially offset by lower legal expense. And credit costs were a net benefit of $331 million driven by the reserve releases I discussed earlier. Now let's go to commercial banking on page 7. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.2 billion and an ROE of 19%. Revenue of $2.4 billion was up 11% year-on-year with higher lending in investment banking revenue and the absence of a prior year marked down in the bridge book partially offset by lower deposit revenue. Record gross investment banking revenue of $1.1 billion was up 65% with broad based strength as market conditions remain favorable. Expenses of $969 million were down 2% driven by lower structural expenses. Deposits of $291 billion were up 54% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on-quarter as client balances remain elevated. And loans were down 2% year-on-year and 3% sequentially. C&I loans were down 4% from the prior quarter on lower revolver balances as clients continue to access capital markets for liquidity, partially offset by additional PPP funding. And CRE loans were down 1% with continued low origination volumes and commercial term lending, partially offset by increased affordable housing activity. Finally, credit costs were a net benefit of $118 million driven by reserve releases with net charge-offs of $29 million driven by oil and gas. Now on to asset and wealth management on page 8. Asset and wealth management generated record net income of $1.2 billion with pretax margin of 40% and ROE of 35%. For the quarter, revenue of $4.1 billion was up 20% year-on-year, as higher management fees, growth and deposit and loan balances as well as investment valuation gains were partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $2.6 billion were up 6% with higher volume and revenue related expenses, partially offset by lower structural expense. And credit costs were a net benefit of $121 million primarily due to reserve releases. For the quarter, record net long-term inflows of $48 billion were again positive across all channels, asset classes and regions with particular strength and equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $44 billion as banks encourage clients to move excess deposits away from them. AUM of $2.8 trillion and overall client assets of $3.8 trillion, up 28% and 32% year-on-year respectively, were driven by higher market levels as well as strong net inflows. And finally, deposits were up 43% and loans were up 18% with strength in security based lending, custom lending and mortgages. Now onto corporate on page 9. Corporate reported a net loss of $580 million. Revenue was a loss of $473 million, down $639 million year-on-year. Net interest income was down nearly $700 million on lower rates as well as limited deployment opportunities on the back of continued deposit growth. And expenses of $876 million were up $730 million year-on-year, primarily driven by the contribution to the Foundation I mentioned earlier. The results for the quarter also include a tax benefit related to the impact of the Firm's expected full year tax rate relative to the level of pretax income this quarter. So with that, moving to the outlook on page 10. You'll see here that our 2021 and NII outlook have around $55 billion remains in line with our previous guidance, as the benefits of the steepening yield curve are being offset by customer behavior in card. It's worth noting that forecasting NII is perhaps more challenging than it's been in a long time, as many of the key inputs market, implied rates, deposit forecast, securities reinvestment and customer behavior in card are all quite fluid. And as a reminder, while customer de-leveraging in higher payment rates in card is a headwind for NII, it's a tailwind for credit. And we now expect our card net charge-off rate to be around 250 basis points for the year. And then on expenses, we've increased our guidance to approximately $70 billion with the largest driver being higher volume and revenue related expenses, which importantly have offsets in revenue. So to wrap up, the year has gotten off to a strong start and a robust economic recovery seems underway. Of course, there are still risks and uncertainties ahead that we're preparing for as well as specific issues that we're facing, including the balance sheet dynamics. I mentioned the rate environment and tough year-over-year comparisons, among other things. Having said that, the earnings power of the franchise remains evident, and we'll continue to use our resources to serve our clients, customers and communities. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. So, yes, so Erika, I'll start. So just a couple of things to think about on capital. So while we're, we ended the year in the 4% bucket for GSIB and it's probably worth mentioning, given the continued expansion of the system through the Fed's balance sheet, even staying in four could become challenging for us. But just a couple of things to keep in mind there is we believe that like we do have offsets in the stress capital buffer, and we do believe that it's very possible that we'll see those come through in this round. Of course, it's dependent upon the Fed models, not our models, but we've talked about things that actions that we've taken sort of mechanical in nature in addition to moving investment securities into held to maturity that should give us some benefit on the SCB. Of course, that's scenario dependent, but we do expect some benefit there that could offset. It's also important to remember that we still are waiting for the Basel III endgame. And the indication from the Fed is that they will address GSIB recalibration as part of that. And so it's quite possible that we see GSIB recalibration but perhaps another constraint that we will be managing. So there is a lot that we will learn over probably the next year or two. And of course, the higher GSIB it doesn't come into effect until the first quarter of 2023. So we do think we have offsets, we're still thinking about 12% as being a target CET1 for us, of course, given what we know today. But we are still waiting for that Basel III endgame to really understand what we're dealing with. And at that 12% in a more normalized environment, which wouldn't just be about rates, it would also be about loan demand 17% still feels achievable for us. I would say broadly speaking, no, but an important point there on SLR, we obviously, the levers we have are issuing preferred, we can retain more common, but we're also working closely with wholesale clients in a very selective way, as I mentioned, to find alternatives for excess deposits. So it is true that common is one of the levers although I will say that while it might give us more flexibility, it comes at a much greater cost. So at this point, given what we know and what we expect, we don't expect that we would have to retain more common. We think we can manage this through issuing more preferred and working closely with our clients to find alternatives. So I would say broadly speaking, no, the GSIB constraints, as we've been saying for years now is one that will become increasingly challenging for us and now particularly with the expansion of the system it's even more challenging than perhaps it was just a few years ago, but we're managing through that as well. Sure. So the increase from the $69 billion, which was the guidance we gave in the K, is almost entirely volume and revenue related. And so there, I'll just make an important point that it's volume and revenue related. So as an example, volumes in CCB, just given the environment, they are very valuable for long-term franchise revenue growth, but we may not see that revenue growth in the near term. But as we always say, we don't manage this place for one quarter or even one year. So there are expenses associated with volume growth that may not have the revenue growth, you would anticipate over the long run, but it's almost entirely volume and revenue related. There are a few other things like marketing expense that given the strength of the recovery that we expect, we now expect to lean more in on marketing expense in the second half of the year. So that's part of it as well. Obviously, some of it is in the first quarter, but things like further volume related expenses, like I talked about, or marketing, they're less so in the first quarter. And then what was your other question? Oh, those numbers are lower than they were even last year and yes included in the outlook but not material in the grand scheme of things. Sure, so you use the right word, which is demand. And it really is all about demand, which of course is quite healthy, particularly as it relates to the consumer, when you think about the amount of deleveraging that we've seen through this process. So there we do expect a second half pickup, because as you say, we first have to see spend recover before we see re-levering on the consumer side. So and then it is also true even for small business, which is obviously part of CCB, their demand has been very low, given the support that's available through PPP. And so that will likely pick up in the second half as well. And then elsewhere, AWM has been strong throughout. And we see that continuing. And then on the CIB side, I mean, that's always lumpy and deal dependent. But that's active as well. And we do see within secured lending opportunities there across asset classes, again, that's a bit more opportunistic. And then in the commercial bank, given the level of support the amount of liquidity in the markets, as well as the amount of cash on balance sheets, loan growth, there has been muted and probably will be for some time, but again, that's incredibly healthy, ultimately for their recovery. And so whether we see that pickup later this year, or next year, remains to be seen, but it's all for good reasons. So first of all, I would say that deposits are going to be driven by the Fed's balance sheet. And to some extent, obviously, by bank lending, but given the demand picture there, you can think of it in the near term as all being driven by Fed balance sheet expansion. And so we obviously continue to expect significant deposit growth, which is why we've been talking about this so much. And then just in terms of how we deploy it, you will have seen that our cash balances are up quarter-over-quarter. And there, it's just important to remember that for sure we are being patient in the investment securities portfolio that is true. I'll also mention that we are -- because of the steepening of the yield curve, we are less short, and banks will drift long in a sell off. And so that has been part of the dynamic as well, but they are short term cash deployment also. And so what we saw there was when repo markets fall below IOER, we're going to hold that short term cash deployment in IOER relative to the repo market. So you'll see that dynamic on our balance sheet, as well. Well, I'll start with the latter, which is, it's absolutely been very, very supportive of corporates, and therefore it has a lot to do with what we're seeing in terms of the muted loan demand from corporates. And then in terms of the mix, we expect ECM and M&A to continue. But on DCM there's a lot of flow activity that doesn't necessarily get represented in a pipeline because it's high velocity type activity. We saw that in the second quarter of last year. We continue to see that now, which is why I said it makes it a little bit difficult to predict the second quarter so that while the pipeline is higher than it's ever been, there is still a lot of high velocity activity. And so that's why we think that the quarter will be flattish year-over-year despite the very high pipeline. Yes. Okay. Jamie's traveling, so we have him on zoom. I know everybody can appreciate technology challenges, because we've all had them over the last year. Well, thank you. I'm sure I'll need you at some point. So hope they're on that. Anyway, go ahead. I'm sorry. Yes, it's a great question. Interestingly, the issue is not that we don't have capital available to make those types of decisions. The issue is that we have the wrong binding constraints. So the binding constraint is leverage not risk based. And so it doesn't change the way we think about acquisitions at all. In fact, acquisitions and/or increased loan growth would help to kind of normalize the constraints between leverage and risk based. And so we would love to be able to absorb some of our CET1 through acquisitions, because as I said, it sort of just brings the balance back into focus. The issue is that that it's leverage base constraint, that is the constraint and we're in a low rate environment with low loan demand and very strong deposit growth. So it's the combination of all those things that make leverage the binding constraint. But it doesn't change the way we're thinking about acquisitions. Sure, I would say this; first of all, it's difficult to find a historical comparison that's totally relevant here. Because I don't think we've ever seen this amount of support in the system, which came, of course, on top of an already reasonably healthy consumer. So it's difficult to find the historical perspective, but I will say the 2.5%, I mean, pre-COVID, we would have thought that our loss rate in card this year would have been 3.3%, 3.5%. So it just gives you a sense there of that tailwind on credit is significant. And in terms of, what it's going to take for consumers to re-lever, I mean, we do expect there to be significant economic activity in the second half. And so that could come quite naturally. But it could come a little bit later, given the amount of deleveraging we've seen, but the fact that we already see spend above pre-COVID levels, and obviously, we still have restrictions in place, particularly around T&E on consumers ability to spend. When that comes back, we do think that we'll see spend tick even higher. And that will be a point where perhaps we'll start to see that re-levering. But it is difficult to know, it's a great question. Sure, I think it's probably all the above, Betsy, but starting with the steepening of the yield curve. So if you look at the earnings at risk disclosure, I mean, we are -- we did see the benefit roughly in line with what that disclosure shows, which is, since we last guided on NII, we steepened probably 25-30 basis points. So that is incorporated in the outlook. But it is completely offset by the fact that we continue to see consumer behavior in card in terms of higher payment rates. And we haven't started to see re-levering as we were just talking about, even though spends has recovered. So card, the impacts of card completely offset the steepening of the yield curve; you also mentioned loan growth, which is, critically important to realizing the benefits of the steepening yield curve. And then I would just mention, we have reflected in our outlook, the fact that we have been patient on deploying further deposit growth into the securities portfolio in terms of duration. And then also, it's probably worth noting that the marginal benefit of further deposit growth is quite small, given the fact that deployment opportunities are minimal. And so, you can think about them as being something less than 10 basis points, because we do have pay rates above zero, so it's something less than 10 basis points. So the marginal deposit growth from here doesn't add a whole lot in this environment anyway. So I'll start there, Mike, and then Jamie, you can chime in. But climate is a long game, obviously. And we're investing a lot of effort in our ESG initiatives, not only because they have a positive impact on society and communities, but because they're also important to our clients, customers and our shareholders. So we don't exactly think about it that way, Mike. But we've also invested in multiple teams to help clients through the transition. And we do recognize it's a transition and clients appreciate that. We've also made the Paris aligned financing commitment last year, and we're going to release our annual ESG report next month. So you'll see more there. And then we also committed to finance $200 billion towards climate action and sustainable development. And we're continuing to grow those efforts as well. And in fact, your questions quite timely, because we're planning to make an ambitious announcement tomorrow about long-term scaling of our financing efforts here. So much more detail to come shortly on that. But Jamie, I don't know if you want to add anything. So the bank SLR, I mean, broadly speaking, it's going to be the same levers, we do have a little bit more flexibility, as you note, because we can move things, we can inject capital into the bank from the holding company. So it's a little bit more flexible, but generally speaking, the constraints and the levers are the same. And then in terms of changes, we know what you know. And so, we look forward to our proposal, the only thing I can mention is, of course, the difference between the US and Europe on Basel as it relates to SLR is there, it's 3% plus half year, GSIB. And so we have a constant 2% buffer. And so -- and with that, you get the flexibility in a Basel compliant way to exclude deposits at central banks for a period of time. So it's possible that it could look something like that, but we don't know. Oh, gosh, Gerard. Not even sure. But Reggie and the team can follow up with you. Well, it's very difficult to try to compare today to just taking our balance sheet today, taking the profile of our portfolio today and compare it to CECL day one, because we are a very far away from that, in fact, in a very healthy way. So that's very difficult to do. What I will say is that it is true that things have continued to improve even since we closed our process in the first quarter. And we obviously expect things to be, we expect the recovery to be robust in the second half of the year. And so if we continue to see that, if we continue to see labor markets recover, if we continue to see the vaccine rollout be successful, we would have future releases from here. And but I would note importantly, that the $7 billion that is the distance between our reserve and the base case is just for context, we will always have weightings on alternative scenarios. And so all else equal, which is there's a lot in the all else equal bucket. But we would release something less than $7 billion so difficult to compare back to CECL day one, but there could be further releases ahead. And then back on your servicing point, I got the answer. It's updates to the MSR model. So HPI updates, prepay updates. So it's less about the operation and more about the MSR model update. That's right. And so the betas have gamma. Like, I'd say that if you can think of it as being nonlinear, meaning the beta for the first 100 basis points will be lower than the beta for the second and third increments of 100 basis points. And so from here, on the retail side, specifically, the first 100 basis points will be very valuable, because there is a lower beta associated with it. So that's really where we see the benefit in NII with short rates in an environment with low loan growth. Yes, we can hear you go ahead. Sure. So I'll just start by saying while we have seen repo go negative at times, it's been orderly and so we don't expect short rates to be negative for any longer period of time or and we certainly haven't seen spikes, which is something you would worry about more. I think with the amount of capacity in the money market complex and the fact that the Fed increased their RRP facility. Now that facility is at zero, so that certainly is supportive of ensuring short rates don't go negative for any meaningful period of time, they also obviously could increase that. And then for us, I would say not a meaningful impact because obviously we have 10 basis points of IOER as an option for us. But we do trade around it. Yes. And what we've seen so far on the short end is not unhealthy or something we're worried about. It's a dynamic of so much cash chasing the supply. Yes. So the minimum is 5%. So we have some room, naturally, we will have a buffer above the minimum as you always need to when you have binary consequences of going. So you can think about some management buffer above that. But we do still have room at 5.5%. And we do think that we can manage this at this point through issuing will be in the market again, with preferred, as well as the conversations that we've had with clients. So far, they have not been disruptive. We're hopeful that remains the case and that we can manage this. Sure. So you can think about a buffer on the SLR of call it 25 basis points. There -- it is important to note, something like AOCI is something that we have to incorporate into our thinking and the impact of AOCI is that's part of Tier 1 capital. So we need to have a buffer to make sure that we can manage through any noise we might see there. So that's why we have a buffer and 25 basis points is probably a reasonable one to think about. In terms of the on reserves, the distance between where we are in the base case, as I said in my prepared remarks, that's now $7 billion. What's interesting to note is that that was $10 billion, it was then $9 billion, and we've released $8 billion and it's still $7 billion. So the all of the scenarios have been moving. And there are a lot that goes into how we think about reserves; we've always just provided that as context for everyone, particularly last year as we were managing through so much uncertainty in terms of the inputs into our reserves. So I wouldn't put a lot of weight into that. Because what I also said, on the $7 billion is that you shouldn't think about that as available for release, because we will always have some waiting on alternative scenarios. And so even if everything plays out exactly as we expect, based upon where we closed the books for the first quarter, it would be something less than $7 billion. Sure. So first of all, as we always say, we're running the place for the long term. And we don't expect this challenge to be a long-term challenge, maybe a short to medium term, but not a long term. And then I'll just say that, yes, there was certainly some organic growth, but it is Fed balance sheets and bank lending that create deposits. And so that's what we are focused on. And we do think given what we expect here that we can manage it. So and it certainly isn't going to change the way we think about market expansion or otherwise, is that is long term franchise value. That's right. Yes. So we'll be in all lower 48 by the end of July. Is that right? Yes, Reggie is confirming for me. We will be in all lower 48 by the end of July. We opened about 75 branches in market expansion last year; we got a little bit slowed down by COVID. But that's going to be about 150 this year. So remain super excited about that. And all the opportunities that bring across the company not just in deposits, of course, because it brings incredible value to the commercial bank into the private bank. And so the business case there, if you will, is not just about deposits. Okay, so if the 12% has to move up, Erika that would obviously have an impact. But there is so much between here and there, and that being a reality that we can't really comment on it because not only I know we've been waiting for GSIB recalibration for a long time, but it has been made very clear that GSIB recalibration will be part of the Basel III endgame which we have also been waiting for a very long time. And so there will be potential offsets that we yet are not -- we were unable to manage because we don't know what they are yet. So we continue to wait for Basel III endgame. And then as I said, we do believe we can manage the stress capital buffer. Again, it's scenario dependent, but we do believe we can manage that to be closer to 2.5%, which helps an awful lot in terms of an offset to GSIB constraints. So we're thinking about that 12% number until we know something's different. No, I agree. I think the market needed to hear that. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks everyone. Thanks, operator."

            "name": "JamieDimon",
            "content": "Do you guys hear me? Because we can't hear you anymore. Oh. And I'm gonna put you on mute for a minute. Jen, just keep on going because I can't hear the questions. I can't hear you. But you're doing a great job, and you don't really need me So I think, Mike, the way to really look at it as it might doesn't -- it doesn't affected a much by boom and bust as you think. So we isolate opportunities like for -- so now we're going to hire 300 black financial advisors, we're going to do that whether it's boom or bust. We're building new data centers. We're building new agile, we're going to the cloud, so I think it doesn't really paying that much over time. I just think you're probably seeing our investment go up over time not go down. We get plenty of organic growth opportunities, which we want to invest in. So I think there is too much focus there. We run the business, do a great job servicing clients over time, we manage 20 years. If I, god knows how many different capital liquidity contents. We have multiple levers to pull all the time to do that while serving our clients. If we've got to adjust our strategy going forward, so be it, we'll probably be fine. I think the question you should be asking isn't what it means for us, is what it means the marketplace. I've already mentioned several times we have $1.5 trillion of cash and marketable securities, which we cannot deploy in a whole bunch of different ways into the marketplace with repo or just financing positions or helping people because of these constraints. So the constraints are more of a constraint on the economy than they are on JPMorgan Chase. We will find a way regardless of any constraints to do things. The other thing GSIB SLR, they're always bubble thing. They need to be recalibrated. And I think people have been asking why how would you recalibrate to do the best job for the United States and the people of United States not for JPMorgan? JPMorgan is going to be fine either way. Yes. One of the negatives to CECL, which I pointed out, right in the beginning that we spend a lot of time on these calls describing something which is virtually irrelevant for the bank, which is these are multiple scenarios, hypothetical probability based, and obviously, the more volatile environments and more volatile these numbers, if a base case was $20 billion, and we now have something like $30 billion, we're not going to be taking down a lot of reserves now, because you're always, As Jen said, you are always going to have extreme adverse case. Think of it like kind CCAR test, you always have a percentage of reserves up for that permanently. And so always and hopefully, I mean, my view is we should waste a lot less time on CECL that makes almost no difference to the company in general. So remember, we're after paying a steady, careful dividend and stuff like. You might prefer to invest in our business organically, including the acquisitions than buyback stock. We're buying back stock because our cup run is over. We have 13.6% capital to risk weighted, advanced risk weighted assets. We're earning a tremendous sum of money, and we really have no option right now. But I think the door is open to anything that makes sense. So we've already done InstaMed, which is an electronic digital payment platform between providers and consumers in health care. We did 55 IP which is a tax way of -- a tax efficient way of managing money. And we're looking at tons of things ourselves. Some we're doing ourselves like dynamo. Some are going to partner with other people. We've got investments and probably 100 different companies are going to be a partner with or like. So we're completely open minded. It could be payments, it could be asset management, it could be an agency, it could data, and it could be anything like that. It cannot be a US Bank. So we're just reminding people if you got great ideas for us, let us know. Well, it's a little of everything because you see us adding Chase My Plan and Chase My Loan and obviously, see competing a little bit buy now pay later, you see us doing Chase Offers and compete with people, you see us doing Zelle payments, we got tons of fabulous stuff coming. We did do invest a couple of years ago and had a very good quarter, we're ending Robo investing, which is just getting going. So we're adding a broad set of capabilities across the full spectrum. And you're going to see a lot more, and you're going to see personalization apps. If you go into the payment system, you can see, global wallets, you can see tons of stuff is coming in. Like I said, the FinTech has done a great job. And I pointed out that they live under different constraints. But they've done a great job, getting rid of pain points, making full automated digitizing things using the cloud. It's incumbent upon us to go faster the cloud; we already have 115 major AI projects. But my guess is in five years, it'll be 1,000 AI projects. So we're going as fast as we can to do a great job for customers. And obviously, FinTech is -- it will be a challenge; there's a lot of money there. They're very smart people. I want to be clear, we're not wishing regulations on them like I'm not, and I think they are to be bad for America. But we are wishing for a level playing field when it comes around certain products and certain services. Now I for one thing it's grossly unfair, that a neo bank could have a small checking account, earn $200, in Durbin fees, and we earn $100, that just isn't right. And I go on and on and on about some of the unfair things, but let the regulars do it. I'm not expecting any change. We'll just adjust our strategies accordingly. So I think the way to answer is the betas have gamma mean, they change over time. And we have our best guess and numbers that Jen gave you. So obviously, the beta is going up all the time. And then it levels off. And I would just add, the why is far more important than the number like NII, obviously, like in trading, it goes in and out, the whole thing have been equal, no, it just shows up in a different place. But if you go negative in NII because you're going back into recession, because there's a negative variance, that's a whole different issue, than if it's a temporary timing thing, I will tell you, we would expect rates moving up over time, we expect a rather healthy and very strong economy. I think Jen another just kind of -- I think Mike the $600 billion and it's really hard -- yes, we think we're growing actual share in almost every business deposits. But $500 billion to $600 billion was the Fed balance sheet. And we're a big wholesale bank and a big consumer bank. So obviously a big portion that shows up inside our company. And, again, we try to -- the new branch is doing great, but they're not going to move the needle quite like the Fed, adding $3 trillion to deposit in the system. And I would just add, we're going to finally try to keep at 12% and we're pretty sure we can do it. So I'm not that worried about it. But I don't know what the confusion is. If it did go up, like if we're earning 20% tangible equity, and our capital goes up by 5%. And we get no return on the 5%; our ROE goes to 19%. So I don't understand the confusion. The underlying results are still fabulous and great and you have slight low returns. But I even think that will be temporary, we will over time find strategies and tactics to get referred to the federal shareholders. But the most importantly about those returns we have great business. Great branches, great products, great services, good margins, good service, good app, the control is good. And that's what we really build all the time. It is other stuffs that just managing around capitals and franchise. It's a shame that this, I mean, this is not the way to run a railroad anymore. We are spending time and are calling CECL and SLR and it's a shame and it does distract from growing the American economy. I've mentioned over and over we have one -- we have $2.2 trillion deposits, $1 trillion loans, $1.5 trillion cash and marketable securities. Much of it would cannot be deployed intermediate or lend. How conservative do you want to get? Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] We will now go live to the presentation. Please standby. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.\nJeremy Barnum: Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer on the back. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $11 billion, EPS of $3.57, on revenue of $35.6 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 20%. This quarter, we had two significant items in corporate, a $914 million gain on the sale of Visa B shares, offset by $874 million of net investment securities loss. Touching on a few highlights. Combined credit and debit spend is up 9% year-on-year, with growth in both discretionary and non-discretionary spending. We ended the year ranked at #1 for global IB fees with a wallet share of 8% and credit continues to normalize, but actual performance remains strong across the company. On Page 2, we have more on our fourth quarter results. Revenue of $35.6 billion was up $5.2 billion or 17% year-on-year. NII ex Markets was up $8.4 billion or 72% driven by higher rates. NIR ex Markets was down $3.5 billion or 26%, predominantly driven by lower IB fees as well as management and performance fees in AWM, lower auto lease income and Home Lending production revenue. And Markets revenue was up $382 million or 7% year-on-year. Expenses of $19 billion were up $1.1 billion or 6% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher structural expense and investments. And credit costs of $2.3 billion included net charge-offs of $887 million. The net reserve build of $1.4 billion was driven by updates to the firm\u2019s macroeconomic outlook, which now reflects a mild recession in the central case as well as loan growth in card services, partially offset by a reduction in pandemic-related uncertainty. Looking at the full year results on Page 3, the firm reported net income of $37.7 billion, EPS of $12.09 and record revenue of $132.3 billion and we delivered an ROTCE of 18%. On the balance sheet and capital on Page 4, we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.2%, up 70 basis points, primarily driven by the benefit of net income, including the sale of Visa B shares less distributions, AOCI gains and lower RWA. RWA declined approximately $20 billion quarter-on-quarter, reflecting lower RWA in the Markets business, which was partially offset by an increase in lending, primarily in card services. Recall that we had a 13% CET1 target for the first quarter of 2023, which we have now reached one quarter early. So given that, we expect to resume share repurchases this quarter. Now, let\u2019s go to our businesses, starting on Page 5. Starting with a quick update on the health of U.S. consumers and small businesses based on our data. They are generally on solid footing, although sentiment for both reflects recessionary concerns not yet fully reflected in our data. Combined debit and credit spend is up 9% year-on-year. Both discretionary and non-discretionary spend are up year-on-year, the strongest growth in discretionary being travel. Retail spend is up 4% on the back of a particularly strong fourth quarter last year. E-commerce spend was up 7%, while in-person spend was roughly flat. Cash buffers for both consumers and small businesses continue to slowly normalize, with lower income segments and smaller businesses normalizing faster. Consumer cash buffers for the lower income segments are expected to be back to pre-pandemic levels by the third quarter of this year. Now moving to financial results. This quarter, CCB reported net income of $4.5 billion on revenue of $15.8 billion, which was up 29% year-on-year. You will notice in our presentation that we renamed Consumer & Business Banking to Banking & Wealth Management. Starting there, revenue was up 56% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. Deposits were down 3% quarter-on-quarter as spend remains strong and the rate cycle plays out, with outflows being partially offset by new relationships. Client investment assets were down 10% year-on-year, driven by market performance, partially offset by net inflows where we are seeing good momentum, including from our deposit customers. Home Lending revenue was down 46% year-on-year, largely driven by lower production revenue. Moving to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher card services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower Auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 19%. Total revolving balances were up 20% and we are now back to pre-pandemic levels. However, revolving balances per account are still below pre-pandemic levels, which should be a tailwind in 2023. And then auto originations were $7.5 billion, down 12%. Expenses of $8 billion were up 3% year-on-year, primarily driven by investments as well as higher compensation, largely offset by auto lease depreciation from lower volumes. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.8 billion, reflecting reserve builds of $800 million in Card and $200 million in Home Lending and net charge-offs of $845 million, up $330 million year-on-year. Next, the CIB on Page 6. CIB reported net income of $3.3 billion on revenue of $10.5 billion for the fourth quarter. Investment Banking revenue of $1.4 billion was down 57% year-on-year. IB fees were down 58%, in line with the market. In Advisory, fees were down 53%, reflecting lower announced activity earlier in the year. Our underwriting businesses were affected by market conditions, resulting in fees down 58% for debt and down 69% for equity. In terms of the outlook, the dynamics remain the same. Pipeline is relatively robust, but conversion is very sensitive to market conditions and sentiment about the economic outlook. Also note that it will be a difficult compare against last year\u2019s first quarter. Moving to Markets, revenue was $5.7 billion, up 7% year-on-year, driven by the strength in our macro franchise. Fixed Income was up 12% as elevated volatility drove strong client activity, particularly in rates and currencies in emerging markets, while securitized products continue to be challenged by the market environment. Equity markets was relatively flat against a strong fourth quarter last year. Payments revenue was $2.1 billion, up 15% year-on-year. Excluding the net impact of equity investments, it was up 56% and the year-on-year growth was driven by higher rates. Security Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 9% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher rates, largely offset by lower deposits and market levels. Expenses of $6.4 billion were up 10% year-on-year, predominantly driven by the timing of revenue-related compensation. On a full year basis, expenses of $27.1 billion were up 7% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher structural expense and investments, partially offset by lower revenue-related compensation. Moving to the Commercial Bank on Page 7. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.4 billion. Record revenue of $3.4 billion was up 30% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins, partially offset by lower investment banking revenue and deposit-related fees. Gross Investment Banking revenue of $700 million was down 52% year-on-year, driven by reduced capital markets activity. Expenses of $1.3 billion were up 18% year-on-year.  Deposits were down 14% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter, primarily reflecting attrition of non-operating deposits. Loans were up 14% year-on-year and 3% [ph] sequentially. C&I loans were up 4% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting continued strength in originations and revolver utilization. CRE loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting a slower pace of growth from earlier in the year due to higher rates, which impacts both originations and prepayment activity. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 8. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.1 billion with pre-tax margin of 33%. Revenue of $4.6 billion was up 3% year-on-year driven by higher deposit margins on lower balances, predominantly offset by reductions in management and performance and placement fees linked to this year\u2019s market declines. Expenses of $3 billion were up 1% year-on-year, predominantly driven by growth in our Private Banking Advisory teams, largely offset by lower performance-related compensation. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $10 billion, positive across equities and fixed income and $47 billion for the full year. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $33 billion for the quarter and net outflows of $55 billion for the full year. AUM of $2.8 trillion and overall client assets of $4 trillion were down 11% and 6% year-on-year respectively driven by lower market levels. Finally, loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower securities-based lending, while deposits were down 6% sequentially driven by the rising rate environment, resulting in migration to investments and other cash alternatives. Turning to Corporate on Page 9. Corporate reported a net gain of $581 million. Revenue of $1.2 billion was up $1.7 billion year-on-year. NII was $1.3 billion, up $2 billion year-on-year due to the impact of higher rates. NIR was a loss of $115 million and reflects the two significant items I mentioned earlier. And expenses of $339 million were up $88 million year-on-year. With that, let\u2019s pivot to the outlook for 2023, which I will cover over the next few pages, starting with NII on Page 10. I will take a sip of water. Okay. We expect total NII to be approximately $73 billion and NII ex Markets to be approximately $74 billion. On the page, we show how the significant increases in quarterly NII throughout 2022 culminated in the $81 billion run-rate for the fourth quarter and how we expect that to evolve for 2023. Going through the drivers. The outlook assumes that rates follow the forward curve. The combination of the annualization of the hike in late December, the hikes expected early in the year and the cuts expected later in the year should be a nice tailwind. Offsetting that tailwind is the impact of deposit repricing, which includes our best guess of rate paid in both wholesale and consumers. In addition, looking at balance sheet growth and mix, we expect solid overall card spend growth as well as further normalization of revolving balances per account and modest loan growth across the rest of the company. We expect that this tailwind will be offset by lower deposit balances given modest attrition in both consumer and wholesale. But it\u2019s very important to note that this NII outlook is particularly uncertain. Specifically, Fed funds could deviate from forwards, balance attrition and migration assumptions could be meaningfully different and deposit product and pricing decisions will be determined by customer behavior and competitive dynamics as we focus on maintaining and growing primary bank relationships and maybe quite different from what this outlook assumes. And further, the timing of all these factors could significantly affect the sequential trajectory of NII throughout the year. That said, as we continue executing our strategy of investing to acquire new customers as well as deepen relationships with existing ones and as we see the impact of loan growth, we would expect sequential NII growth to return, all else being equal. And just to finish up on NII. As the guidance indicates, we expect Markets NII for the year to be slightly negative as a result of higher rates, but remember, this is offset in Markets NIR. Now turning to expenses on Page 11, we expect 2023 adjusted expense to be about $81 billion, which includes approximately $500 million from the higher FDIC assessment. Going through some of the other drivers, we expect increases from labor inflation, which, while it seems to be abating on a forward-looking basis, is effectively in the run-rate for 2023. An additional labor-related driver is the annualization of 2022 headcount growth as well as our plans from a modest headcount increase in the year, all of which are primarily in connection with executing our investments. And on investments, while we are continuing to invest consistent with what we told you at Investor Day, it\u2019s a more modest increase than last year. The themes remain consistent and we will continue to give you more detail throughout the year, including at Investor Day in May. Of course, as is always true, this outlook includes continuing to generate efficiencies across the company. And finally, while volume and revenue-related expense was ultimately a tailwind for 2022, we are expecting it to be close to flat in 2023, which will be completely market dependent as always. Moving to credit on Page 12, on the page, you can see how exceptionally benign the credit environment was in 2022 for the company across wholesale, card and the rest of consumer. Turning to the 2023 outlook, for card net charge-off rates specifically, Marianne gave quite a bit of detail about this at our recent conference and our outlook hasn\u2019t really changed. So to recap that story, the entry to delinquency rate is the leading indicator of future charge-offs. And it is currently around 80% of pre-pandemic levels. We expect that to normalize around the middle of the year, with the associated charge-offs following about 6 months later. As a result, loss rates in 2023 will still be normalizing. So while we anticipate exiting the year around normalized levels, we expect the 2023 card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.6%, up from the historically low rate of 147 basis points in 2022, but still well below fully normalized levels. So let\u2019s turn to Page 13 for a brief wrap up before going to Q&A. We are very proud of the 2022 results, producing an 18% ROTCE and record revenue in what was a quite dynamic environment. Throughout my discussion of the outlook, I have emphasized the uncertainty in many of the key drivers of 2023 results. And while we are ready for a range of scenarios, our expectation is for another strong performance. So as we look forward, we expect to continue to produce strong returns in the near-term and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our through-the-cycle target of 17% ROTCE. And with that, operator, let\u2019s open up the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] [Technical Difficulty] is coming from the line of John McDonald from Autonomous Research. You may proceed.\nJohn McDonald: Hi. Good morning, Jeremy. I wanted to ask about the NII outlook, Slide 10. The range of outcomes on deposit costs is quite wide. As you mentioned, it looks like 1.5% to 2% demonstrated there. Does the $74 billion NII line up with kind of the midpoint of that? Maybe you could give some color about kind of the drivers of the $74 billion and where that lines up on this range of deposit cost outcomes?\nJeremy Barnum: Sure, John. I mean I wouldn\u2019t take the chart on the bottom left too literally. That\u2019s just supposed to give a stylized indication of the fact that relatively small changes in deposit rate paid for the company on average, as we all know, can produce quite significant impacts on the NII and also that there is \u2013 as we have already talked about, a meaningful [Technical Difficulty]. The outlook is our best guess, as Jamie says. And the drivers within that are the usual drivers in wholesale. We would expect to see a little bit of continued attrition, especially of the non-operating type balances. And you are going to see some internal migration there out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing over time. In consumer, CDs are flowing right now and we are seeing good new CD production. We have got a 4% CD in the market as of this morning. And so continued CD production and internal migration there will be a driver. And the rest of it is \u2013 well, of course, as I said in the prepared remarks, we do expect across the company modest deposit attrition as we look forward as a function of QT in the rate cycle and so on. So we have got the best guesses for all of those in the outlook. And of course, the actual outcome will be different in one way or another and we will just run the business this year.\nJohn McDonald: Okay. Thanks. And on buybacks, how will you think about approaching buybacks and putting it in that mix of capital decisions that you have and any thoughts on kind of the size or quantifying the potential buybacks?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, sure. So sort of in the mode of like helping you guys out to put a number in the model. If you sort of look at the way we are seeing things, obviously, we have got another GSIB stuff coming next year. So say, 13.5% target and the sort of using your estimates, organic capital generation, minus dividends, etcetera and all of the elements of uncertainty there, I think a good number to use is something like $12 billion of buybacks for this year for 2023. But you know, of course, that buybacks are always at the end of our capital hierarchy. So if we have better uses for the money, those will come first and the timing and the conditions of how much we do when is entirely at our discretion and also noting that we are potentially going to see a Basel III NPR sometime in the first quarter or maybe the second quarter. And while that will be an NPR and it will only cover part of the surface area and it won\u2019t be final, so it\u2019s unlikely that it meaningfully shapes short-term decision-making. There will be some information content of that release that could shape our decisions as well.\nJohn McDonald: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. You may proceed.\nErika Najarian: Hi, good morning. Jeremy, my first question is just, as you can imagine, following up on the NII line of questioning, I appreciate that there is a significant amount of uncertainty in this year\u2019s NII forecast in particular. But to follow-up with John\u2019s question, I\u2019m wondering if you could give a sort of more specific guardrails with regards to what you\u2019re expecting for deposit attrition and deposit beta in terms of the terminal deposit beta. I think the feedback I\u2019m getting very early from investors is that they appreciate the headwinds that\u2019s occurring for NII this year. At the same time, you have been consistently beating what seems like conservative NII expectations for 2022, including printing a giant $20.3 billion number in the fourth quarter. So that\u2019s why I think the more specific guardrails could be very helpful as investors try to figure out what their own expectations are versus that?\nJeremy Barnum: Thanks, Erika. So look, I totally appreciate the desire for more specific guardrails. I would want that too, if I were you. I do think that we\u2019re trying to be quite helpful by giving you a full year number which, if we\u2019re honest, involves a lot of guessing about how things will evolve throughout the year. I think once you start giving guardrails, you implicitly assume that outcomes outside of the guardrails are very unlikely. And that\u2019s just a level of precision that we\u2019re just not prepared to get into, especially because in the end, as I said, a lot of the repricing decisions that we will be faced with as a company or respond to data in the moment at a granular level in connection with the strategy, which is about growing and maintaining primary bank relationships rather than chasing every dollar of balances at any cost. So in that context, we do expect modest balance attrition across the company for deposits, as I said. Jamie, on [indiscernible]\nJamie Dimon: Erika, thank you. I do want to give a big picture about why and I do not consider 74 conservative. So the Federal Reserve reduced its balance sheet by $400 billion. $1.5 trillion came out of bank deposits. And so investors can invest in fee bills, money market funds. And of course, banks are competing for the cap of money now, and banks are all in different places. And some banks are started competing heavily. Some have a lot of excess cash and maybe compete less. But if you look at prior \u2013 and forget what happened in 2016. I think people make a huge mistake looking at that. We\u2019ve never had this queued this zero rates. We\u2019ve never had rates go up this fast. So I expect there will be more migration to CD, more migration to money market funds. A lot of people are competing for it, and we\u2019re going to have to change saving rates. Now we can do it at our own pace and look at what other people are doing. We don\u2019t know the timing, but it will happen. And I just also want to point out that even at 74, we\u2019re earning quite good returns. And that\u2019s not \u2013 and we\u2019ve always pointed out to you that sometimes we\u2019re over earning and sometimes are under earning. But I would say, okay, this time we\u2019re over earning on NII this quarter. We\u2019re maybe over earning on credit. We maybe underearning something else. So these are still very good numbers, and we\u2019re going to wait and see and we will report to you, but I don\u2019t want to give you false notions how secure it is.\nErika Najarian: And my follow-up is exactly in that line of questioning. Let\u2019s zoom out for a second here. To your point, Jamie, the returns are still good. You mentioned that your outlook already captures a mild recession. And I\u2019m going to reask the question I asked in the third quarter. As you think about 2023, do you think JPMorgan can hit that 17% ROTCE that you laid out in Investor Day, even with the headwind in NII and the headwind on the provision?\nJamie Dimon: Yes, we can. But a lot of factors could turn that. But yes, we can. I think when we do Investor Day in May, we may give you a more interesting number, which is what do we think our ROTC will be if we have a real recession, which I think even in a real recession, it would probably equal the average industrial company, which is good. So we\u2019re going to give you some detail around that, and those are still good returns, and we can still grow. And 17% is \u2013 remember 17% is very good if you compound. Some growth is 17%. Those are extraordinary numbers. And I also want to point, we don\u2019t know exactly what capital needs to be at this point, and we have to modify that at one point.\nJeremy Barnum: And Erika, let me just add a very minor clarifying point as I want to be crystal clear about this. So as you know and as we discussed a lot, like through the pandemic in terms of the way we construct and build the allowance, while it\u2019s anchored around our economist central case forecast, which is correctly, say, is a mild recession, through the way we weight the different scenarios and a range of other factors, the de facto scenario that\u2019s embedded in the forecast is actually more conservative than that from an [allowance] (ph) perspective. So we just want to be clear about.\nErika Najarian: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may proceed.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Good morning. I guess maybe, Jeremy, just following up on the credit assumptions underlying. If you could give us a sense of what\u2019s assumed in that reserve ratio at the end of the year, be it in terms of the unemployment rate and your outlook around, just a lot of chatter around commercial real estate, the struggles to reprice in the current rate backdrop? Are you concerned about that? Are you seeing pain points in CRE customers given what\u2019s happening with cap rates and then just the overall backdrop today?\nJeremy Barnum: Sure. Let me just do CRE quickly, Ebrahim. As you know, our sort of multifamily commercial term lending business is really quite different from the classic office type business. Our office portfolio is very small Class A best developers, best locations. So the vast majority of the loan balances in commercial real estate are that sort of affordable multifamily housing, commercial term lending stuff, which is really quite secure from a credit perspective for a variety of reasons. So we feel quite comfortable with the loss profile of that business. And so yes, so then you were asking about the assumptions in credit overall. So yes, as I said, like the central case economic forecast has a mild recession and if I remember correctly, unemployment peaking at something like 4.9%. The adjustments that we make to the scenarios to reflect a slightly more conservative outlook have us imply a peak unemployment that\u2019s notably higher than that. So I think we have appropriately conservative assumptions about the outlook embedded in our current balances. And the trajectory that we\u2019ve talked about in the presentation, they are definitely \u2013 can capture something more than a very mild soft lending. But of course, it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to reflect a full-blown hard landing in our current numbers since the probability of that is clearly well below 100%.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Noted. And I guess just as a follow-up on you\u2019ve managed RWA growth pretty well when you look at like loan growth year-over-year versus RWA, stayed relatively flat. As we think about just managing capital, how should we think about the evolution of RWA? Are there still opportunities to optimize that going into whatever the Fed comes out with on Basel? Thank you.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. So there are definitely still opportunities to optimize. We\u2019re continuing to work very hard, and it\u2019s a big area of focus. Some of that is reflected in this quarter\u2019s numbers, but some of the other drivers of this quarter are what you might call more passive items, particularly in market with RWA. And yes, but we should be clear that although we\u2019ve said that the effects of capital optimization are not a material economic headwind for the company, they are also not zero. There are real consequences due to the choices that we\u2019re making as a result of this capital environment. And in a Basel III outcome, that is unreasonably punitive from a capital perspective. There will be additional consequences to that. We obviously are hoping that\u2019s not the case and believe that it\u2019s not appropriate, but we will see what happens.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. You may proceed.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thank you. I\u2019m curious, I want to talk levered loans for a second. You\u2019ve done a good job avoiding some of these \u2013 put on these loans for the like the better half of the last half year. So good call on your part. Things have gotten a lot cheaper. However, bank balance sheets, not yours, are still kind of mucked up with a lot of the back book. I\u2019m curious to see if things have gotten cheap enough. Do you consider yourself back in? And how important is this in general for activity levels to pick back up to have available funding from the big banks?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. A couple of things there, Glenn. So short answer is we\u2019re absolutely open for business there. Terms are better, pricing is better. We have the resources needed. We\u2019re fully there. No overhang and no issue. Also, I think there is a bit of a narrative that like activity in the market needs to overcome overhang, we\u2019re not convinced that, that\u2019s true. We think that the overhang is in the numbers and people need to look forward and the system has the capacity to handle the risks. So I recognize your point. I think it\u2019s an interesting point, but we are wide open for business and not particularly concerned about the overhang from the perspective of bank\u2019s ability to finance activity.\nGlenn Schorr: Interesting. So maybe a bit asking, more so. Okay. Maybe, Jamie, while we have you. In the last annual letter, you talked about low competitive moats and intense competition from all angles, not just fin-tech. And I was just trying to think out loud. Is that better or worse, that competitive landscape in a much higher rate backdrop? Maybe I\u2019ll just leave it at that for you to see where you go with it.\nJamie Dimon: I think it\u2019s the same. You have the Apples, who are basically doing a lot of banking services and Walmart starting theirs. And obviously, higher rates will hurt some of the folks in the fin-tech world and maybe even help some folks. So we expect tough competition going forward.\nGlenn Schorr: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Hi, Jeremy.\nJeremy Barnum: Hi, Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy: Jeremy, you mentioned in your payments business that if you took out the equity investment write-downs, the growth was over 50%. Can you share with us on the equity write-downs, obviously, private equity is going through some challenging times. And I\u2019m assuming that...\nJeremy Barnum: It was a gain last year. It wasn\u2019t a write-down this year.\nGerard Cassidy: I got it. Okay. I thought there was a write-down there. Okay.\nJeremy Barnum: Let me make that clear. sorry about that.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. Thank you, Jamie. Can you \u2013 sticking just with private equity for a moment. Can you share with us where the risks are in the private equity markets to JPMorgan? Is there \u2013 when you think about it from your loan book? Or is it really just an equity investments? And maybe expand upon that.\nJeremy Barnum: Sorry, do you want me to take that? Yes, this is a couple of things. So Jamie is right. The headwind year-on-year is primarily a function of the fact that this is an investment that just because of the management alternative accounting standard we were forced to mark up previously. This is an investment that we got payment in kind as part of the sale of some of our internally developed initiatives. So anyway, it\u2019s fine. The point is there is a small write-down this quarter. And the important point there is that the core business performing exceptionally well, both because of higher rates, but also because of the strategy that talked a lot at Investor Day paying off across fees and value-added services and so on and so forth. And I guess throughout your question is like private equity in general and how are we feeling about that space? Did I hear that correctly?\nGerard Cassidy: That\u2019s correct, Jeremy. And just in terms of any lending, obviously, so many of these companies have seen their valuations come down considerably. Is there any elevated risk lending to some of these companies considering the struggles they are having?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. I mean I think that\u2019s a risk that we manage quite tightly as a company. Our exposure to the sort of non-bank financial sector are probably defined. And of course, as we thought a little bit about what normalized wholesale charge-offs could look like through the cycle. they are obviously higher than effectively zero, which is what we have now. But we feel confident with our credit discipline and what we have on the books.\nGerard Cassidy: Great. And then as a follow-up question, you guys did a good job building up that loan loss reserve this quarter. Two questions to that. First, the Shared National Credit exam results are always released in February. Does the reserve buildup takes some of that into account? And second, how much of the reserve build was more of a management overlay versus your base case, the quantitative part of the decision-making for building up the reserve.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. I mean, I\u2019ll give you that answer, but I\u2019m oversimplifying a lot. I would say that.\nJamie Dimon: Over simplify.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, yes, I know. I got it. The sort of conservatism of the management overlay did not change for all intents and purposes quarter-on-quarter. I think that\u2019s the best way to think about that, Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy: And then sure Natural \u2013 yes, go ahead.\nJamie Dimon: The National Shared Credit thing will not affect our results materially.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. Thank you, Jamie.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. You may proceed.\nKen Usdin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I\u2019m just wondering if you can help us understand the ongoing efforts on your mitigation for the RWAs in advance of all the points we\u2019ve made already about the pending capital regime. How do we \u2013 can you help us understand what type of effects that has, if any, on parts of the income statement, whether it\u2019s NII or the trading business?\nJamie Dimon: Yes. So if I just take that one. Just assume we\u2019re going to have modest growth in RWA. And in every single businesses, mortgages, loans, derivatives, how we hedge CVA and stuff like that, we take access to manage RWA. Do not \u2013 it does not really affect the business that much. It might 1 day, but it doesn\u2019t affect it today. And so we don\u2019t build in somehow we lose a little bit of this, a little bit of that. And there \u2013 and the biggest opportunity down the road will be a reopening in the securitization markets. and they are still very tight. And I think 1 day, they will reopen.\nKen Usdin: Okay. And then on the \u2013 one follow-up, just coming back to the reserving process. Can you just help us understand relative to the 5% peak in 3Q that you gave for your unemployment rate quarterly average in the 3.9 average baseline? Just where does this fourth quarter reserve get you to? And does that rule of thumb that you kind of gave us last quarter still stand in terms of scenario analysis on potential builds ahead of this mild recession?\nJamie Dimon: Can I just make it real simple? The base case, okay, is where it hits almost that 5% unemployment. Then you probability weight other scenarios. That\u2019s why Jeremy is saying the reserve is higher than the base case. We didn\u2019t change the probabilities in our weighting. But of course, it got worse and the base case got worse. That\u2019s all it is, which still is a good benchmark, you\u2019ll keep in mind, is if we got to a relative adverse case, all that a 6% unemployment, we \u2013 and then once you get there, you assume the average weighting, you have wins. It could get better or it could get worse. At that case, we would need about $6 billion more. When the base case itself deteriorates, we\u2019re moving closer to relative adverse, that\u2019s all it is. These are all probabilities and possibilities and hypothetical numbers. And if I review, like just look at charge-offs like actual results. And so \u2013 and we break this out, but it\u2019s hard to describe, and every bank does it slightly differently, and every bank has a slightly different base case and slightly different weighting of adverse cases, etcetera. And so we\u2019re just trying to make it as simple as possible.\nKen Usdin: Yes, I hear you. The challenge at this time is that we\u2019re going to have the income statement effect way ahead of that charge-off. So we\u2019re all trying to just fit for that. But I appreciate that. Thanks, Jamie.\nJamie Dimon: And once the any base case gets to where you expect relative adverse, you\u2019d be adding to $6 billion of reserves before you have charge-offs.\nKen Usdin: Exactly. Right.\nJeremy Barnum: Hey, Ken, maybe just out of interest. Implied to your question might be a little bit, to what extent does this quarter\u2019s build sort of is a down payment on the $6 billion? And the answer to that question is much less than all of it because a lot of it was driven by loan growth, but in some of it, as Jamie says, is driven by the flow-through of the downward provision in the central case. You could say, subject to the caveat that this is a little bit or not science, that there is some down payment on that $6 billion.\nKen Usdin: Yes. Understood. Thanks for all that.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning.\nJamie Dimon: Hey, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: I wanted to understand a little bit about how you are thinking about managing the expense line as you go through this year. I know we talked already about how it\u2019s hard to predict NII. Obviously, markets has pushes and pulls. Can you help us understand how you are thinking about delivering operating leverage? Where the elements of the expense base are needing to be invested and so you really can\u2019t touch? And where there are opportunities to potentially peel back such that if you get a weaker rev line, you can still deliver positive operating leverage?\nJamie Dimon: Sure. So, I mean as we have \u2013 as you know, obviously, we tend to break down our expenses across our three categories. And in some sense, the category that you are addressing is the volume and revenue-related expense, which we highlight because it should pre-symmetrically respond to a better or worse environment and thereby contribute to operating leverage. So, for example, in this year\u2019s ultimate outcome, and the number that we want on printing on Page 22, the year-on-year change in volume and revenue-related expense, still we are finding the numbers, we will probably show you more at the Investor Day, but it\u2019s probably close to $1 billion. In other words, year-on-year decline, whereas next year, we are assuming something more like flat. So, while the sort of year-on-year dollar change in the outlook sort of \u201821 to \u201822, \u201822 to \u201823 is comparable, the mix is quite different actually. And so for example, if we wound up being long about the type of environment that we are budgeting for, you would expect a significant drop in the volume and revenue-related expense number that\u2019s in the current outlook, and that would contribute to operating leverage. For the rest of it, we are always generating efficiency. And we have worked just as hard at that, whether the revenue environment is good or bad. And as you know, we invest through the cycle. And so broadly, our investment plans really should be that sensitive to short-term changes in the environment. Of course, certain types of things like marketing investments in the card business, in particular, the math of what we expect the NPV of those things to be the cycle may change in a downturn. And that could produce lower investment, all else equal. But the core strategic investments that we are making to secure the future of the company are not going to get modified because of the ups and downs of both the environment and...\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. And part of the reason for asking is one of the debate points on JPMorgan stock has been around the capital charges, the capital march. And will capital be a bigger burden for you to bear as we go through the next couple of years? As you deliver on the positive operating leverage side, it gives you room to absorb some more capital obviously and still hit those IRR and ROTCE target on incremental investments. Maybe you could help us understand what level of capital increase you could absorb given the operating leverage you are expecting to generate? And maybe that\u2019s an unfair question today, and it\u2019s a better question for Investor Day, but that\u2019s kind of the debate that\u2019s out there on the stock.\nJeremy Barnum: Got it. I mean it\u2019s a fair question. It\u2019s a good question. I am not going to answer it super specifically. And Jamie may have some views there too. But let me just quickly say, we have kind of said that we feel quite confident about this company\u2019s ability to generate 17% in the cycle. And that\u2019s incorporating our sense of the current environment, the operating leverage that you talked about and the expectation of higher capital requirements with the 13.5% target in the first quarter of \u201824. The question of whether Basel III end game and other factors increase that number and how much of that we can absorb and still produce those returns is of course, impossible to answer right now. But I would remind you that it\u2019s not just denominator of our expansion, unreasonable capital outcomes will increase costs into the real economy, which goes into the numerator too. It\u2019s not what we want, but that is the possible outcome.\nBetsy Graseck: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.\nMike Mayo: Hi. I recognize you are evolving your business model and you are spending money to make more money and that your track record last decade was strong there. But as it relates to Frank acquisition that\u2019s been in the news, I am just wondering what that says about the financial discipline for the 15 deals that you pursued, the $7 billion of investing each year and the one-fifth increase in expenses over 3 years to your guide of $81 billion in 2023. So, it\u2019s really a question about financial discipline. And I know you can\u2019t go in details on the Frank deal. And look, you earn the purchase price in two days, okay? So, I get that. And if there is fraud, there is only \u2013 you can\u2019t do anything about fraud, but still it\u2019s diverse management resources and attention. So, maybe just in the specifics as it relates to the acquisition strategy, like who sources them? Who negotiates them? Who does the due diligence? Who runs it? And ultimately, who is accountable for all these 15 different deals? And when you have investments going across business lines, which is a strength of you guys, but who is ultimately accountable when these investments don\u2019t go the way you want to? And Jamie, you recognized, a couple of years ago at Investor Day, you said, \u201cLook, sometimes you are going to waste money as you are innovating and you are growing.\u201d But ultimately, who is accountable when investment doesn\u2019t go right, like the Frank deal or another deal or some of the other $81 billion that you expect to spend this year?\nJamie Dimon: Obviously, Mike, let\u2019s say, a very good question, which we always concerned at. We have always talked about complacency and all things like that. So obviously, when you are getting up to bat 300 times a year, you are going to make \u2013 have errors. And we don\u2019t want our company to be terrified errors that we don\u2019t do anything. And the complacency is then burdened by bureaucracy, which is stasis and depth. So, you have to be very careful when you make an error like you cripple the firm. We are very disciplined and you see that in a lot of different ways. You see in our leverage lending book. You see the success of our investments. You see it in the quality of our products and services. You see it in our \u2013 in all these things. And it\u2019s no different for an acquisition. There are \u2013 so the acquisitions are done by the businesses, but it\u2019s also a centralized team that does extensive due diligence. So, the business does it. The centralized team does it. We have been doing it for 20 years, like we just started doing something like that. And obviously, there are always lessons learned. And at one point, we will tell you the lesson we learned here when this thing is out of litigation. But we are quite comfortable. And the people who are responsible are the people in the business. So, they \u2013 that business did the acquisition, they are responsible, they report back. And we expect people, when they talk to all of us is the goods, the bad, the ugly. We are never looking for how great everything was. And obviously, this thing in one way or another, it was a huge mistake.\nMike Mayo: Let me follow-up on that. So, that relates to the inorganic growth. As it relates to the organic growth, such as in the payments business, which I know is a focus that cuts across a lot of different business lines. So, as you invest more in payments, which is \u2013 can be a 20 or 30 PE business, which could be great if you got there, who is responsible for that sort of organic investment that cuts across? Sometimes the way you aggregate the data, it\u2019s consumer, it\u2019s the investment bank, it could be asset management, it could be commercial, it can be everything in payments. Who is responsible for those?\nJamie Dimon: So, just to be clarified. So, I would say that Marianne and Jen, when it comes to credit, debit, checks and all the consumer-related stuff and Takis, which I think you saw in the presentation about payments at Investor Day reporting to Daniel, and that is on the wholesale payments, merchant processing, a whole bunch of stuff and those are direct responsibilities, it\u2019s quite clear this is an area that counts across the company. So, it\u2019s a payments working group that just spends time on that. That working group has not done an acquisition, okay. And if they make \u2013 if they want to invest \u2013 which there are cases, by the way, which you \u2013 and you will see more this year, we decided jointly and all the way up to Daniel and me.\nMike Mayo: And then last follow-up to my first start, the general comment. I mean this is the third year in a row of about $5 billion of expense growth, and you have Slide 11 there. But I mean that\u2019s a lot of certain front-loaded expenses for less certain back-ended benefits. How is your comfort level that you are going to see those back-ended benefits relative to the past?\nJamie Dimon: Totally and we try to show you guys at Investor Day, every branch we open, for every bank that we hire, for every tech thing we do, we are pretty comfortable. There are certain things that\u2019s more like infrastructure, like getting to the cloud, and stuff like that, which you can\u2019t identify all of that. But we are pretty comfortable that we \u2013 if they weren\u2019t working, we changed them. So, we ask ourselves that question every day with any wealth managers or branches or certain things, so \u2013 and marketing is half of that, not quite half, but half that number. That\u2019s a very specific \u2013 for the most part, very specific dollar in, how many dollars out. It\u2019s not a guess, and we are pretty accurate at that kind of stuff. And again, if we \u2013 if there is $1 billion that we were spending that didn\u2019t give us the return, we cut the $1 billion.\nMike Mayo: Alright. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of Steve Chubak from Wolfe Research. You may proceed.\nSteve Chubak: Hi, good morning. So, I wanted to start off with a question on the outlook for trading in the investment banking businesses. Just Jeremy, given the strong pipelines you cited, I was hoping you can provide some additional color just in terms of what you are hearing from corporate clients, especially in the context of the mild recession scenario you outlined, when you would expect to see some inflection in investment banking activity. And similar question on the trading side, you are facing difficult comps in the coming year. We still have QT, rate volatility proxy still elevated. Do you anticipate a significant moderation in trading activity or not?\nJeremy Barnum: Sure. Thanks Steve. So, let\u2019s do banking first. So, I think the thing that\u2019s interesting about banking right now is that the declines have been so significant, obviously, from very elevated levels. But even relative to just 2019, 2022, was a relatively weak year. And as we look into 2023, it\u2019s possible that the actual economic environment will be worse than it was in 2022. That could conceivably make you pessimistic about the investment banking wallet outlook. And to be sure, it\u2019s not as if we are super optimistic. But it\u2019s important to note that part of the issue here is how quickly things change in 2022, specifically with respect to rates as that affects the debt business and valuations as it affects M&A and DCM as well. And one of the sort of necessary conditions for people to do deals or decide to raise capital is just getting comfortable with valuations in the all of open market. So, I think there is a chance that, that actually winds up helping in 2023 in the investment banking world. Of course, we don\u2019t know. But those are some of the things that we are thinking about. Similarly, on the markets side, obviously, markets had another very strong year, better than we had expected since the numbers were so strong. Coming out of the pandemic, we were expecting more normalization than what we actually saw. And 2022 had a lot of themes. I think the active management community did well. That always helps us a little bit. And we had volatility with relatively orderly and continuing markets. As we look towards 2023, maybe some of those themes will be a little bit less obvious, and that could be a little bit of a headwind. But on the other hand, it\u2019s not like the volatility is going away. And markets seem to continue to be quite orderly. And 4.5%, 5% rate environment is probably one where there is more trading opportunities than the zero percent rate environment. So, of course, we don\u2019t know. We will see. I think you would have to probably expect some normalization there. It\u2019s \u2013 the numbers are really very strong in markets, but we will see and we will see what happens.\nSteve Chubak: That\u2019s really helpful color. And just for my follow-up on finalization of Basel III. Sorry, Jeremy, I couldn\u2019t help myself here. But in December speech, you strongly hinted at capital requirements moving higher for you and peers. You also alluded in your comments or in response to one of the questions that the finalization of Basel III can potentially be very punitive. Given the absence of the proposal, I was really just hoping you could speak to how your scenario planning for the eventual finalization and any additional detail you can offer on the areas of mitigation. I think the one issue or area of confusion is that one of the biggest sources of RWA inflation is op risk, which can\u2019t really be mitigated. What are the actions that you can take to really offset some of those potential headwinds?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. So, Steve, I would love to get into more detail here, but I just think that the question of how to mitigate is really hard to discuss in a lot of detail until we see an actual proposal. And the reason that we talk about potentially punitive increases, I mean you studied this issue closely. It\u2019s just to point out that under the version of the world where you get the worst outcome in all of the different moving parts of this thing, it\u2019s a very significant increase to the capital requirements of the system as a whole. And given how strong the system is today, that just like doesn\u2019t make sense to us. So, we just want to say that. But yes, Jamie, please.\nJamie Dimon: I mean just, look, you guys know that the operators\u2019 capital, the trading book, the CCAR, G-SIFI, all those moving parts, let\u2019s just see what they are. We will deal with them when we get there. And then we will figure out what we have to modify our business and stuff like that. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to increase capital ratio. We are quite clear on that. One of the new numbers we put on the top of the press release was our total loss-absorbing capacity. So, we have now almost $500 billion. I mean really, like at one point, when is $500 billion of that, $1 trillion liquidity, all those thing is enough. And so \u2013 but let\u2019s just see what it is. They are going to work it through their international laws, their international requirements. We are hoping that America is the same as international. That would be nice. G-SIFI is supposed to be corrected. We will see if that happens. So, let\u2019s just see. We don\u2019t have to guess. And if the number is too high, we are going to tell you what we are going to do about it.\nJeremy Barnum: Just a minor expansion to that, just to expand a bit on Jamie\u2019s point that it\u2019s important to be clear, there will be time to adjust, like there is a long road from the NPR to \u2013 so to sort of supports Jamie\u2019s point, let\u2019s see what it is and then we will\u2026\nSteve Chubak: Fair enough. Thanks so much for taking my questions.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of Matthew O\u2019Connor from Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.\nMatthew O\u2019Connor: Good morning. How do you guys think of the managing the securities book, given the outlook of lower deposits? Obviously, the yield curve is quite inverted depending on what part you are looking at or most parts, frankly. And at the same time, the securities book is cash flowing a lot less than it was a couple of years ago just given the rate environment.\nJamie Dimon: Yes. So, remember, the securities book is an outcome of investing, but basically excess deposits. And you have like $2.4 trillion deposits and $1 trillion of loans and things like that. So \u2013 and we manage it to manage interest rate exposure, all these various things. And so \u2013 and then when you say the size of it, we forecast, which I am not going to give you the numbers, we forecast every quarter what we are going to buy, what we are going to sell, how much is coming in, how much we need for liquidity, and we adjust it all the time based upon deposits coming down and loans and stuff like that. Obviously, what you get to invest in is at much higher rates today. And you see JPMorgan\u2019s lost an ACM loan book as the percentage is much lower than most other people. We are kind of conservative there too.\nMatthew O\u2019Connor: I guess a bigger picture question. We have seen such a drop in really 5-year to 10-year part of the curve and even further out. And banks aren\u2019t really buying, as said, you are selling. And I guess I was wondering if you had thoughts on who is buying and what\u2019s driving the rates so much lower than most people thought they should be at?\nJamie Dimon: Yes, we do. But we should get the answer, of course, to get that. We look at it, what everybody is doing, pension plans, governments. We look at every part of the curve. We look at what other banks are doing. I think I have mentioned earlier in this call, banks are in different positions. Some may have to sell securities to finance their loan books. We obviously don\u2019t. So, people are in a different position. And as Jeremy pointed out, it\u2019s very important. That yield curve will not be the same six months from now that is today. While we use that to kind of look forward, it\u2019s not actually our forecast. We know it will be wrong. And with the investment portfolio, we would be invested when there are opportunities. We bought a lot of Ginnie Maes when there is a 60 OAS spread. We have sold \u2013 one of the reasons we take securities losses, because that gives you $10-plus billion you can reinvest it when you think of more attractive securities.\nMatthew O\u2019Connor: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: The final question is coming from the line of Andrew Lim from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. You may proceed.\nAndrew Lim: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So, the first one on credit quality. Thanks for giving us a commentary on the shape of NCOs, I guess, specifically for credit cards topping out at the end of this year. Could you give us a bit more color on how reserve builds should shape out this year, I guess with respect to CECL? I am guessing that it should top out quite soon. That\u2019s my first question. Just assuming all your macro assumptions are unchanged and all the assumptions are unchanged in the property are unchanged and so forth.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. Andrew, well, I think we have talked about CECL like quite a bit, and I think there is some decent color there in terms of Jamie\u2019s $6 billion over a few quarters in a world where the economic outlook is worse than it is today. We are definitely not going to get into the business of giving you an outlook for sequential evolution of the loan loss allowance. But it\u2019s appropriate today and it will evolve as a function of the environment.\nAndrew Lim: Sure. Okay. Let\u2019s drill down into NII then. I just want to square a few comments you made there, Jeremy. So, if I heard you correctly, I think you are still talking about sequential increases in NII. So, I guess looking towards like $20 billion plus for 1Q, maybe even 2Q. So, I guess we are hitting about $40 billion for 1H and then a sharp drop off as, say, deposit costs increase and maybe we get a few Fed fund rate cuts as well. Is that the way we should be thinking about it?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. No. So, let me un-controversially say no there, Andrew, just really wouldn\u2019t doubt. So, my comments about sequential increases were to address the sort of obvious conclusion, which we are somewhat correctly drawing from the slide, which is that in a world where we are exiting the fourth quarter run rate at 81, and we are telling our ADX markets or whatever. And we are telling you 74 for the full year, there are obviously some sequential declines in there somewhere as a function of what plays out. We are simply saying don\u2019t project those into the future in perpetuity. Once things adjust, we will return to normal sequential growth. Does that make sense?\nAndrew Lim: Right. Yes. No. Absolutely, that makes sense. That\u2019s great. Thank you for that.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. Thanks.\nOperator: We have no additional questions in queue. I would now like to hand the call back to Mr. Barnum.\nJeremy Barnum: That\u2019s it. Thank you very much.\nJamie Dimon: Thank you very much. We will talk to you all soon.\nOperator: That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeremy Barnum",
            "content": "Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer on the back. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $11 billion, EPS of $3.57, on revenue of $35.6 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 20%. This quarter, we had two significant items in corporate, a $914 million gain on the sale of Visa B shares, offset by $874 million of net investment securities loss. Touching on a few highlights. Combined credit and debit spend is up 9% year-on-year, with growth in both discretionary and non-discretionary spending. We ended the year ranked at #1 for global IB fees with a wallet share of 8% and credit continues to normalize, but actual performance remains strong across the company. On Page 2, we have more on our fourth quarter results. Revenue of $35.6 billion was up $5.2 billion or 17% year-on-year. NII ex Markets was up $8.4 billion or 72% driven by higher rates. NIR ex Markets was down $3.5 billion or 26%, predominantly driven by lower IB fees as well as management and performance fees in AWM, lower auto lease income and Home Lending production revenue. And Markets revenue was up $382 million or 7% year-on-year. Expenses of $19 billion were up $1.1 billion or 6% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher structural expense and investments. And credit costs of $2.3 billion included net charge-offs of $887 million. The net reserve build of $1.4 billion was driven by updates to the firm's macroeconomic outlook, which now reflects a mild recession in the central case as well as loan growth in card services, partially offset by a reduction in pandemic-related uncertainty. Looking at the full year results on Page 3, the firm reported net income of $37.7 billion, EPS of $12.09 and record revenue of $132.3 billion and we delivered an ROTCE of 18%. On the balance sheet and capital on Page 4, we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.2%, up 70 basis points, primarily driven by the benefit of net income, including the sale of Visa B shares less distributions, AOCI gains and lower RWA. RWA declined approximately $20 billion quarter-on-quarter, reflecting lower RWA in the Markets business, which was partially offset by an increase in lending, primarily in card services. Recall that we had a 13% CET1 target for the first quarter of 2023, which we have now reached one quarter early. So given that, we expect to resume share repurchases this quarter. Now, let's go to our businesses, starting on Page 5. Starting with a quick update on the health of U.S. consumers and small businesses based on our data. They are generally on solid footing, although sentiment for both reflects recessionary concerns not yet fully reflected in our data. Combined debit and credit spend is up 9% year-on-year. Both discretionary and non-discretionary spend are up year-on-year, the strongest growth in discretionary being travel. Retail spend is up 4% on the back of a particularly strong fourth quarter last year. E-commerce spend was up 7%, while in-person spend was roughly flat. Cash buffers for both consumers and small businesses continue to slowly normalize, with lower income segments and smaller businesses normalizing faster. Consumer cash buffers for the lower income segments are expected to be back to pre-pandemic levels by the third quarter of this year. Now moving to financial results. This quarter, CCB reported net income of $4.5 billion on revenue of $15.8 billion, which was up 29% year-on-year. You will notice in our presentation that we renamed Consumer & Business Banking to Banking & Wealth Management. Starting there, revenue was up 56% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. Deposits were down 3% quarter-on-quarter as spend remains strong and the rate cycle plays out, with outflows being partially offset by new relationships. Client investment assets were down 10% year-on-year, driven by market performance, partially offset by net inflows where we are seeing good momentum, including from our deposit customers. Home Lending revenue was down 46% year-on-year, largely driven by lower production revenue. Moving to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher card services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower Auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 19%. Total revolving balances were up 20% and we are now back to pre-pandemic levels. However, revolving balances per account are still below pre-pandemic levels, which should be a tailwind in 2023. And then auto originations were $7.5 billion, down 12%. Expenses of $8 billion were up 3% year-on-year, primarily driven by investments as well as higher compensation, largely offset by auto lease depreciation from lower volumes. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.8 billion, reflecting reserve builds of $800 million in Card and $200 million in Home Lending and net charge-offs of $845 million, up $330 million year-on-year. Next, the CIB on Page 6. CIB reported net income of $3.3 billion on revenue of $10.5 billion for the fourth quarter. Investment Banking revenue of $1.4 billion was down 57% year-on-year. IB fees were down 58%, in line with the market. In Advisory, fees were down 53%, reflecting lower announced activity earlier in the year. Our underwriting businesses were affected by market conditions, resulting in fees down 58% for debt and down 69% for equity. In terms of the outlook, the dynamics remain the same. Pipeline is relatively robust, but conversion is very sensitive to market conditions and sentiment about the economic outlook. Also note that it will be a difficult compare against last year's first quarter. Moving to Markets, revenue was $5.7 billion, up 7% year-on-year, driven by the strength in our macro franchise. Fixed Income was up 12% as elevated volatility drove strong client activity, particularly in rates and currencies in emerging markets, while securitized products continue to be challenged by the market environment. Equity markets was relatively flat against a strong fourth quarter last year. Payments revenue was $2.1 billion, up 15% year-on-year. Excluding the net impact of equity investments, it was up 56% and the year-on-year growth was driven by higher rates. Security Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 9% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher rates, largely offset by lower deposits and market levels. Expenses of $6.4 billion were up 10% year-on-year, predominantly driven by the timing of revenue-related compensation. On a full year basis, expenses of $27.1 billion were up 7% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher structural expense and investments, partially offset by lower revenue-related compensation. Moving to the Commercial Bank on Page 7. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.4 billion. Record revenue of $3.4 billion was up 30% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins, partially offset by lower investment banking revenue and deposit-related fees. Gross Investment Banking revenue of $700 million was down 52% year-on-year, driven by reduced capital markets activity. Expenses of $1.3 billion were up 18% year-on-year.  Deposits were down 14% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter, primarily reflecting attrition of non-operating deposits. Loans were up 14% year-on-year and 3% [ph] sequentially. C&I loans were up 4% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting continued strength in originations and revolver utilization. CRE loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting a slower pace of growth from earlier in the year due to higher rates, which impacts both originations and prepayment activity. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 8. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.1 billion with pre-tax margin of 33%. Revenue of $4.6 billion was up 3% year-on-year driven by higher deposit margins on lower balances, predominantly offset by reductions in management and performance and placement fees linked to this year's market declines. Expenses of $3 billion were up 1% year-on-year, predominantly driven by growth in our Private Banking Advisory teams, largely offset by lower performance-related compensation. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $10 billion, positive across equities and fixed income and $47 billion for the full year. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $33 billion for the quarter and net outflows of $55 billion for the full year. AUM of $2.8 trillion and overall client assets of $4 trillion were down 11% and 6% year-on-year respectively driven by lower market levels. Finally, loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower securities-based lending, while deposits were down 6% sequentially driven by the rising rate environment, resulting in migration to investments and other cash alternatives. Turning to Corporate on Page 9. Corporate reported a net gain of $581 million. Revenue of $1.2 billion was up $1.7 billion year-on-year. NII was $1.3 billion, up $2 billion year-on-year due to the impact of higher rates. NIR was a loss of $115 million and reflects the two significant items I mentioned earlier. And expenses of $339 million were up $88 million year-on-year. With that, let's pivot to the outlook for 2023, which I will cover over the next few pages, starting with NII on Page 10. I will take a sip of water. Okay. We expect total NII to be approximately $73 billion and NII ex Markets to be approximately $74 billion. On the page, we show how the significant increases in quarterly NII throughout 2022 culminated in the $81 billion run-rate for the fourth quarter and how we expect that to evolve for 2023. Going through the drivers. The outlook assumes that rates follow the forward curve. The combination of the annualization of the hike in late December, the hikes expected early in the year and the cuts expected later in the year should be a nice tailwind. Offsetting that tailwind is the impact of deposit repricing, which includes our best guess of rate paid in both wholesale and consumers. In addition, looking at balance sheet growth and mix, we expect solid overall card spend growth as well as further normalization of revolving balances per account and modest loan growth across the rest of the company. We expect that this tailwind will be offset by lower deposit balances given modest attrition in both consumer and wholesale. But it's very important to note that this NII outlook is particularly uncertain. Specifically, Fed funds could deviate from forwards, balance attrition and migration assumptions could be meaningfully different and deposit product and pricing decisions will be determined by customer behavior and competitive dynamics as we focus on maintaining and growing primary bank relationships and maybe quite different from what this outlook assumes. And further, the timing of all these factors could significantly affect the sequential trajectory of NII throughout the year. That said, as we continue executing our strategy of investing to acquire new customers as well as deepen relationships with existing ones and as we see the impact of loan growth, we would expect sequential NII growth to return, all else being equal. And just to finish up on NII. As the guidance indicates, we expect Markets NII for the year to be slightly negative as a result of higher rates, but remember, this is offset in Markets NIR. Now turning to expenses on Page 11, we expect 2023 adjusted expense to be about $81 billion, which includes approximately $500 million from the higher FDIC assessment. Going through some of the other drivers, we expect increases from labor inflation, which, while it seems to be abating on a forward-looking basis, is effectively in the run-rate for 2023. An additional labor-related driver is the annualization of 2022 headcount growth as well as our plans from a modest headcount increase in the year, all of which are primarily in connection with executing our investments. And on investments, while we are continuing to invest consistent with what we told you at Investor Day, it's a more modest increase than last year. The themes remain consistent and we will continue to give you more detail throughout the year, including at Investor Day in May. Of course, as is always true, this outlook includes continuing to generate efficiencies across the company. And finally, while volume and revenue-related expense was ultimately a tailwind for 2022, we are expecting it to be close to flat in 2023, which will be completely market dependent as always. Moving to credit on Page 12, on the page, you can see how exceptionally benign the credit environment was in 2022 for the company across wholesale, card and the rest of consumer. Turning to the 2023 outlook, for card net charge-off rates specifically, Marianne gave quite a bit of detail about this at our recent conference and our outlook hasn't really changed. So to recap that story, the entry to delinquency rate is the leading indicator of future charge-offs. And it is currently around 80% of pre-pandemic levels. We expect that to normalize around the middle of the year, with the associated charge-offs following about 6 months later. As a result, loss rates in 2023 will still be normalizing. So while we anticipate exiting the year around normalized levels, we expect the 2023 card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.6%, up from the historically low rate of 147 basis points in 2022, but still well below fully normalized levels. So let's turn to Page 13 for a brief wrap up before going to Q&A. We are very proud of the 2022 results, producing an 18% ROTCE and record revenue in what was a quite dynamic environment. Throughout my discussion of the outlook, I have emphasized the uncertainty in many of the key drivers of 2023 results. And while we are ready for a range of scenarios, our expectation is for another strong performance. So as we look forward, we expect to continue to produce strong returns in the near-term and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our through-the-cycle target of 17% ROTCE. And with that, operator, let's open up the line for Q&A. Sure, John. I mean I wouldn't take the chart on the bottom left too literally. That's just supposed to give a stylized indication of the fact that relatively small changes in deposit rate paid for the company on average, as we all know, can produce quite significant impacts on the NII and also that there is \u2013 as we have already talked about, a meaningful [Technical Difficulty]. The outlook is our best guess, as Jamie says. And the drivers within that are the usual drivers in wholesale. We would expect to see a little bit of continued attrition, especially of the non-operating type balances. And you are going to see some internal migration there out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing over time. In consumer, CDs are flowing right now and we are seeing good new CD production. We have got a 4% CD in the market as of this morning. And so continued CD production and internal migration there will be a driver. And the rest of it is \u2013 well, of course, as I said in the prepared remarks, we do expect across the company modest deposit attrition as we look forward as a function of QT in the rate cycle and so on. So we have got the best guesses for all of those in the outlook. And of course, the actual outcome will be different in one way or another and we will just run the business this year. Yes, sure. So sort of in the mode of like helping you guys out to put a number in the model. If you sort of look at the way we are seeing things, obviously, we have got another GSIB stuff coming next year. So say, 13.5% target and the sort of using your estimates, organic capital generation, minus dividends, etcetera and all of the elements of uncertainty there, I think a good number to use is something like $12 billion of buybacks for this year for 2023. But you know, of course, that buybacks are always at the end of our capital hierarchy. So if we have better uses for the money, those will come first and the timing and the conditions of how much we do when is entirely at our discretion and also noting that we are potentially going to see a Basel III NPR sometime in the first quarter or maybe the second quarter. And while that will be an NPR and it will only cover part of the surface area and it won't be final, so it's unlikely that it meaningfully shapes short-term decision-making. There will be some information content of that release that could shape our decisions as well. Thanks, Erika. So look, I totally appreciate the desire for more specific guardrails. I would want that too, if I were you. I do think that we're trying to be quite helpful by giving you a full year number which, if we're honest, involves a lot of guessing about how things will evolve throughout the year. I think once you start giving guardrails, you implicitly assume that outcomes outside of the guardrails are very unlikely. And that's just a level of precision that we're just not prepared to get into, especially because in the end, as I said, a lot of the repricing decisions that we will be faced with as a company or respond to data in the moment at a granular level in connection with the strategy, which is about growing and maintaining primary bank relationships rather than chasing every dollar of balances at any cost. So in that context, we do expect modest balance attrition across the company for deposits, as I said. Jamie, on [indiscernible] And Erika, let me just add a very minor clarifying point as I want to be crystal clear about this. So as you know and as we discussed a lot, like through the pandemic in terms of the way we construct and build the allowance, while it's anchored around our economist central case forecast, which is correctly, say, is a mild recession, through the way we weight the different scenarios and a range of other factors, the de facto scenario that's embedded in the forecast is actually more conservative than that from an [allowance] (ph) perspective. So we just want to be clear about. Sure. Let me just do CRE quickly, Ebrahim. As you know, our sort of multifamily commercial term lending business is really quite different from the classic office type business. Our office portfolio is very small Class A best developers, best locations. So the vast majority of the loan balances in commercial real estate are that sort of affordable multifamily housing, commercial term lending stuff, which is really quite secure from a credit perspective for a variety of reasons. So we feel quite comfortable with the loss profile of that business. And so yes, so then you were asking about the assumptions in credit overall. So yes, as I said, like the central case economic forecast has a mild recession and if I remember correctly, unemployment peaking at something like 4.9%. The adjustments that we make to the scenarios to reflect a slightly more conservative outlook have us imply a peak unemployment that's notably higher than that. So I think we have appropriately conservative assumptions about the outlook embedded in our current balances. And the trajectory that we've talked about in the presentation, they are definitely \u2013 can capture something more than a very mild soft lending. But of course, it wouldn't be appropriate to reflect a full-blown hard landing in our current numbers since the probability of that is clearly well below 100%. Yes. So there are definitely still opportunities to optimize. We're continuing to work very hard, and it's a big area of focus. Some of that is reflected in this quarter's numbers, but some of the other drivers of this quarter are what you might call more passive items, particularly in market with RWA. And yes, but we should be clear that although we've said that the effects of capital optimization are not a material economic headwind for the company, they are also not zero. There are real consequences due to the choices that we're making as a result of this capital environment. And in a Basel III outcome, that is unreasonably punitive from a capital perspective. There will be additional consequences to that. We obviously are hoping that's not the case and believe that it's not appropriate, but we will see what happens. Yes. A couple of things there, Glenn. So short answer is we're absolutely open for business there. Terms are better, pricing is better. We have the resources needed. We're fully there. No overhang and no issue. Also, I think there is a bit of a narrative that like activity in the market needs to overcome overhang, we're not convinced that, that's true. We think that the overhang is in the numbers and people need to look forward and the system has the capacity to handle the risks. So I recognize your point. I think it's an interesting point, but we are wide open for business and not particularly concerned about the overhang from the perspective of bank's ability to finance activity. Hi, Gerard. It was a gain last year. It wasn't a write-down this year. Let me make that clear. sorry about that. Sorry, do you want me to take that? Yes, this is a couple of things. So Jamie is right. The headwind year-on-year is primarily a function of the fact that this is an investment that just because of the management alternative accounting standard we were forced to mark up previously. This is an investment that we got payment in kind as part of the sale of some of our internally developed initiatives. So anyway, it's fine. The point is there is a small write-down this quarter. And the important point there is that the core business performing exceptionally well, both because of higher rates, but also because of the strategy that talked a lot at Investor Day paying off across fees and value-added services and so on and so forth. And I guess throughout your question is like private equity in general and how are we feeling about that space? Did I hear that correctly? Yes. I mean I think that's a risk that we manage quite tightly as a company. Our exposure to the sort of non-bank financial sector are probably defined. And of course, as we thought a little bit about what normalized wholesale charge-offs could look like through the cycle. they are obviously higher than effectively zero, which is what we have now. But we feel confident with our credit discipline and what we have on the books. Yes. I mean, I'll give you that answer, but I'm oversimplifying a lot. I would say that. Yes, yes, I know. I got it. The sort of conservatism of the management overlay did not change for all intents and purposes quarter-on-quarter. I think that's the best way to think about that, Gerard. Hey, Ken, maybe just out of interest. Implied to your question might be a little bit, to what extent does this quarter's build sort of is a down payment on the $6 billion? And the answer to that question is much less than all of it because a lot of it was driven by loan growth, but in some of it, as Jamie says, is driven by the flow-through of the downward provision in the central case. You could say, subject to the caveat that this is a little bit or not science, that there is some down payment on that $6 billion. Got it. I mean it's a fair question. It's a good question. I am not going to answer it super specifically. And Jamie may have some views there too. But let me just quickly say, we have kind of said that we feel quite confident about this company's ability to generate 17% in the cycle. And that's incorporating our sense of the current environment, the operating leverage that you talked about and the expectation of higher capital requirements with the 13.5% target in the first quarter of \u201824. The question of whether Basel III end game and other factors increase that number and how much of that we can absorb and still produce those returns is of course, impossible to answer right now. But I would remind you that it's not just denominator of our expansion, unreasonable capital outcomes will increase costs into the real economy, which goes into the numerator too. It's not what we want, but that is the possible outcome. Sure. Thanks Steve. So, let's do banking first. So, I think the thing that's interesting about banking right now is that the declines have been so significant, obviously, from very elevated levels. But even relative to just 2019, 2022, was a relatively weak year. And as we look into 2023, it's possible that the actual economic environment will be worse than it was in 2022. That could conceivably make you pessimistic about the investment banking wallet outlook. And to be sure, it's not as if we are super optimistic. But it's important to note that part of the issue here is how quickly things change in 2022, specifically with respect to rates as that affects the debt business and valuations as it affects M&A and DCM as well. And one of the sort of necessary conditions for people to do deals or decide to raise capital is just getting comfortable with valuations in the all of open market. So, I think there is a chance that, that actually winds up helping in 2023 in the investment banking world. Of course, we don't know. But those are some of the things that we are thinking about. Similarly, on the markets side, obviously, markets had another very strong year, better than we had expected since the numbers were so strong. Coming out of the pandemic, we were expecting more normalization than what we actually saw. And 2022 had a lot of themes. I think the active management community did well. That always helps us a little bit. And we had volatility with relatively orderly and continuing markets. As we look towards 2023, maybe some of those themes will be a little bit less obvious, and that could be a little bit of a headwind. But on the other hand, it's not like the volatility is going away. And markets seem to continue to be quite orderly. And 4.5%, 5% rate environment is probably one where there is more trading opportunities than the zero percent rate environment. So, of course, we don't know. We will see. I think you would have to probably expect some normalization there. It's \u2013 the numbers are really very strong in markets, but we will see and we will see what happens. Yes. So, Steve, I would love to get into more detail here, but I just think that the question of how to mitigate is really hard to discuss in a lot of detail until we see an actual proposal. And the reason that we talk about potentially punitive increases, I mean you studied this issue closely. It's just to point out that under the version of the world where you get the worst outcome in all of the different moving parts of this thing, it's a very significant increase to the capital requirements of the system as a whole. And given how strong the system is today, that just like doesn't make sense to us. So, we just want to say that. But yes, Jamie, please. Just a minor expansion to that, just to expand a bit on Jamie's point that it's important to be clear, there will be time to adjust, like there is a long road from the NPR to \u2013 so to sort of supports Jamie's point, let's see what it is and then we will... Yes. Andrew, well, I think we have talked about CECL like quite a bit, and I think there is some decent color there in terms of Jamie's $6 billion over a few quarters in a world where the economic outlook is worse than it is today. We are definitely not going to get into the business of giving you an outlook for sequential evolution of the loan loss allowance. But it's appropriate today and it will evolve as a function of the environment. Yes. No. So, let me un-controversially say no there, Andrew, just really wouldn't doubt. So, my comments about sequential increases were to address the sort of obvious conclusion, which we are somewhat correctly drawing from the slide, which is that in a world where we are exiting the fourth quarter run rate at 81, and we are telling our ADX markets or whatever. And we are telling you 74 for the full year, there are obviously some sequential declines in there somewhere as a function of what plays out. We are simply saying don't project those into the future in perpetuity. Once things adjust, we will return to normal sequential growth. Does that make sense? Yes. Thanks. That's it. Thank you very much."

            "name": "Jamie Dimon",
            "content": "Erika, thank you. I do want to give a big picture about why and I do not consider 74 conservative. So the Federal Reserve reduced its balance sheet by $400 billion. $1.5 trillion came out of bank deposits. And so investors can invest in fee bills, money market funds. And of course, banks are competing for the cap of money now, and banks are all in different places. And some banks are started competing heavily. Some have a lot of excess cash and maybe compete less. But if you look at prior \u2013 and forget what happened in 2016. I think people make a huge mistake looking at that. We've never had this queued this zero rates. We've never had rates go up this fast. So I expect there will be more migration to CD, more migration to money market funds. A lot of people are competing for it, and we're going to have to change saving rates. Now we can do it at our own pace and look at what other people are doing. We don't know the timing, but it will happen. And I just also want to point out that even at 74, we're earning quite good returns. And that's not \u2013 and we've always pointed out to you that sometimes we're over earning and sometimes are under earning. But I would say, okay, this time we're over earning on NII this quarter. We're maybe over earning on credit. We maybe underearning something else. So these are still very good numbers, and we're going to wait and see and we will report to you, but I don't want to give you false notions how secure it is. Yes, we can. But a lot of factors could turn that. But yes, we can. I think when we do Investor Day in May, we may give you a more interesting number, which is what do we think our ROTC will be if we have a real recession, which I think even in a real recession, it would probably equal the average industrial company, which is good. So we're going to give you some detail around that, and those are still good returns, and we can still grow. And 17% is \u2013 remember 17% is very good if you compound. Some growth is 17%. Those are extraordinary numbers. And I also want to point, we don't know exactly what capital needs to be at this point, and we have to modify that at one point. I think it's the same. You have the Apples, who are basically doing a lot of banking services and Walmart starting theirs. And obviously, higher rates will hurt some of the folks in the fin-tech world and maybe even help some folks. So we expect tough competition going forward. Over simplify. The National Shared Credit thing will not affect our results materially. Yes. So if I just take that one. Just assume we're going to have modest growth in RWA. And in every single businesses, mortgages, loans, derivatives, how we hedge CVA and stuff like that, we take access to manage RWA. Do not \u2013 it does not really affect the business that much. It might 1 day, but it doesn't affect it today. And so we don't build in somehow we lose a little bit of this, a little bit of that. And there \u2013 and the biggest opportunity down the road will be a reopening in the securitization markets. and they are still very tight. And I think 1 day, they will reopen. Can I just make it real simple? The base case, okay, is where it hits almost that 5% unemployment. Then you probability weight other scenarios. That's why Jeremy is saying the reserve is higher than the base case. We didn't change the probabilities in our weighting. But of course, it got worse and the base case got worse. That's all it is, which still is a good benchmark, you'll keep in mind, is if we got to a relative adverse case, all that a 6% unemployment, we \u2013 and then once you get there, you assume the average weighting, you have wins. It could get better or it could get worse. At that case, we would need about $6 billion more. When the base case itself deteriorates, we're moving closer to relative adverse, that's all it is. These are all probabilities and possibilities and hypothetical numbers. And if I review, like just look at charge-offs like actual results. And so \u2013 and we break this out, but it's hard to describe, and every bank does it slightly differently, and every bank has a slightly different base case and slightly different weighting of adverse cases, etcetera. And so we're just trying to make it as simple as possible. And once the any base case gets to where you expect relative adverse, you'd be adding to $6 billion of reserves before you have charge-offs. Hey, Betsy. Sure. So, I mean as we have \u2013 as you know, obviously, we tend to break down our expenses across our three categories. And in some sense, the category that you are addressing is the volume and revenue-related expense, which we highlight because it should pre-symmetrically respond to a better or worse environment and thereby contribute to operating leverage. So, for example, in this year's ultimate outcome, and the number that we want on printing on Page 22, the year-on-year change in volume and revenue-related expense, still we are finding the numbers, we will probably show you more at the Investor Day, but it's probably close to $1 billion. In other words, year-on-year decline, whereas next year, we are assuming something more like flat. So, while the sort of year-on-year dollar change in the outlook sort of \u201821 to \u201822, \u201822 to \u201823 is comparable, the mix is quite different actually. And so for example, if we wound up being long about the type of environment that we are budgeting for, you would expect a significant drop in the volume and revenue-related expense number that's in the current outlook, and that would contribute to operating leverage. For the rest of it, we are always generating efficiency. And we have worked just as hard at that, whether the revenue environment is good or bad. And as you know, we invest through the cycle. And so broadly, our investment plans really should be that sensitive to short-term changes in the environment. Of course, certain types of things like marketing investments in the card business, in particular, the math of what we expect the NPV of those things to be the cycle may change in a downturn. And that could produce lower investment, all else equal. But the core strategic investments that we are making to secure the future of the company are not going to get modified because of the ups and downs of both the environment and... Obviously, Mike, let's say, a very good question, which we always concerned at. We have always talked about complacency and all things like that. So obviously, when you are getting up to bat 300 times a year, you are going to make \u2013 have errors. And we don't want our company to be terrified errors that we don't do anything. And the complacency is then burdened by bureaucracy, which is stasis and depth. So, you have to be very careful when you make an error like you cripple the firm. We are very disciplined and you see that in a lot of different ways. You see in our leverage lending book. You see the success of our investments. You see it in the quality of our products and services. You see it in our \u2013 in all these things. And it's no different for an acquisition. There are \u2013 so the acquisitions are done by the businesses, but it's also a centralized team that does extensive due diligence. So, the business does it. The centralized team does it. We have been doing it for 20 years, like we just started doing something like that. And obviously, there are always lessons learned. And at one point, we will tell you the lesson we learned here when this thing is out of litigation. But we are quite comfortable. And the people who are responsible are the people in the business. So, they \u2013 that business did the acquisition, they are responsible, they report back. And we expect people, when they talk to all of us is the goods, the bad, the ugly. We are never looking for how great everything was. And obviously, this thing in one way or another, it was a huge mistake. So, just to be clarified. So, I would say that Marianne and Jen, when it comes to credit, debit, checks and all the consumer-related stuff and Takis, which I think you saw in the presentation about payments at Investor Day reporting to Daniel, and that is on the wholesale payments, merchant processing, a whole bunch of stuff and those are direct responsibilities, it's quite clear this is an area that counts across the company. So, it's a payments working group that just spends time on that. That working group has not done an acquisition, okay. And if they make \u2013 if they want to invest \u2013 which there are cases, by the way, which you \u2013 and you will see more this year, we decided jointly and all the way up to Daniel and me. Totally and we try to show you guys at Investor Day, every branch we open, for every bank that we hire, for every tech thing we do, we are pretty comfortable. There are certain things that's more like infrastructure, like getting to the cloud, and stuff like that, which you can't identify all of that. But we are pretty comfortable that we \u2013 if they weren't working, we changed them. So, we ask ourselves that question every day with any wealth managers or branches or certain things, so \u2013 and marketing is half of that, not quite half, but half that number. That's a very specific \u2013 for the most part, very specific dollar in, how many dollars out. It's not a guess, and we are pretty accurate at that kind of stuff. And again, if we \u2013 if there is $1 billion that we were spending that didn't give us the return, we cut the $1 billion. I mean just, look, you guys know that the operators' capital, the trading book, the CCAR, G-SIFI, all those moving parts, let's just see what they are. We will deal with them when we get there. And then we will figure out what we have to modify our business and stuff like that. We don't think it's necessary to increase capital ratio. We are quite clear on that. One of the new numbers we put on the top of the press release was our total loss-absorbing capacity. So, we have now almost $500 billion. I mean really, like at one point, when is $500 billion of that, $1 trillion liquidity, all those thing is enough. And so \u2013 but let's just see what it is. They are going to work it through their international laws, their international requirements. We are hoping that America is the same as international. That would be nice. G-SIFI is supposed to be corrected. We will see if that happens. So, let's just see. We don't have to guess. And if the number is too high, we are going to tell you what we are going to do about it. Yes. So, remember, the securities book is an outcome of investing, but basically excess deposits. And you have like $2.4 trillion deposits and $1 trillion of loans and things like that. So \u2013 and we manage it to manage interest rate exposure, all these various things. And so \u2013 and then when you say the size of it, we forecast, which I am not going to give you the numbers, we forecast every quarter what we are going to buy, what we are going to sell, how much is coming in, how much we need for liquidity, and we adjust it all the time based upon deposits coming down and loans and stuff like that. Obviously, what you get to invest in is at much higher rates today. And you see JPMorgan's lost an ACM loan book as the percentage is much lower than most other people. We are kind of conservative there too. Yes, we do. But we should get the answer, of course, to get that. We look at it, what everybody is doing, pension plans, governments. We look at every part of the curve. We look at what other banks are doing. I think I have mentioned earlier in this call, banks are in different positions. Some may have to sell securities to finance their loan books. We obviously don't. So, people are in a different position. And as Jeremy pointed out, it's very important. That yield curve will not be the same six months from now that is today. While we use that to kind of look forward, it's not actually our forecast. We know it will be wrong. And with the investment portfolio, we would be invested when there are opportunities. We bought a lot of Ginnie Maes when there is a 60 OAS spread. We have sold \u2013 one of the reasons we take securities losses, because that gives you $10-plus billion you can reinvest it when you think of more attractive securities. Thank you very much. We will talk to you all soon."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.\nJeremy Barnum: Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. As always, the presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on page 1. The Firm reported net income of $9.7 billion, EPS of $3.12 on revenue of $33.5 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 18%. The only significant item this quarter was discretionary net investment securities losses in Corporate of $959 million as a result of repositioning the portfolio by selling U.S. Treasuries and mortgages. Our strong results this quarter reflect the resilience of the franchise in a dynamic environment. Touching on a few highlights. We had a record third quarter -- we had record third quarter revenue in Markets of $6.8 billion, we ranked number one in retail deposit share based on FDIC data, and credit is still healthy with net charge-offs remaining low. On page 2, we have more detail. Revenue of $33.5 billion was up $3.1 billion or 10% year-on-year. Excluding the net investment securities losses, it was up 13%. NII ex Markets was up $5.7 billion or 51%, driven by higher rates. NIR ex Markets was down $3.2 billion or 24%, largely driven by lower IB fees and the securities losses. And Markets revenue was up $502 million or 8% year-on-year. Expenses of $19.2 billion were up $2.1 billion or 12% year-on-year, driven by higher structural costs and investments. And credit costs of $1.5 billion included net charge-offs of $727 million. The net reserve build of $808 million included a $937 million build in Wholesale, reflecting loan growth and updates to the Firm\u2019s macroeconomic scenarios, partially offset by $150 million release in Home Lending. On the balance sheet and capital on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.5%, up 30 basis points versus the prior quarter, which was primarily driven by the benefit of net income less distributions, partially offset by the impact of AOCI. RWA was down approximately $23 billion quarter-on-quarter, with growth in lending more than offset by continued active balance sheet management and lower market risk RWA. Given our results this quarter, we are well positioned to meet our CET1 targets of 12.5% in the fourth quarter and 13% in the first quarter of 2023. These current targets include a 50 basis-point buffer over the growing regulatory requirements, which provides flexibility over the coming quarters. To conclude on capital, with the future increases in our risk-based requirements, SLR will no longer be our binding capital constraint. So, we announced the call of $5.4 billion in press this quarter and issued $3.5 billion in sub debt to rebalance our capital stack. Now, let\u2019s go to our businesses, starting on page 4. Before I review CCB\u2019s performance, let me provide you with an update on the health of U.S. consumers and small businesses based on our data. Nominal spend is still strong across both discretionary and nondiscretionary categories, with combined debit and credit spend up 13% year-on-year. Cash buffers remain elevated across all income segments. However, with spending growing faster than income, we are seeing a continued decrease in median deposits year-on-year, particularly in the lower income segments. And not surprisingly, small business owners are increasingly focused on the risks and the economic outlook. Now, moving to financial results. This quarter, CCB reported net income of $4.3 billion on revenue of $14.3 billion, which was up 14% year-on-year. In Consumer & Business Banking, revenue was up 30% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. Deposits were up 10% year-on-year and down 1% quarter-on-quarter. We ranked number one in retail deposit share based on FDIC data, up 60% year-on-year, making us the fastest-growing among the top 20 banks. And we are now number one in L.A., in addition to New York and Chicago, making us top ranked in the three largest markets. Client investment assets were down 10% year-on-year, driven by market performance, partially offset by flows, while lending revenue was down 34% year-on-year on lower production margins and volume. Moving to Card & Auto. Revenue was up 9% year-on-year, driven by higher card NII, partially offset by lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 18%. And while revolving balances were up 15%, driven by strong net new account originations and growth in revolving balances per account, they still remain slightly below pre-pandemic levels. And in Auto, originations were $7.5 billion, down 35%, due to lack of vehicle supply and rising rates. Expenses of $8 billion were up 11% year-on-year, driven by the investments we\u2019re making in technology, travel, marketing and branches. In terms of actual credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $529 million, reflecting net charge-offs of $679 million, which were up $188 million year-on-year, largely driven by loan growth in card as well as a reserve release of $150 million in Home Lending. Card delinquencies remain well below pre-pandemic levels, though we continue to see gradual normalization. Next, the CIB on page 5. CIB reported net income of $3.5 billion on revenue of $11.9 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.7 billion was down 43% year-on-year. IB fees were down 47% versus a strong third quarter last year. We maintained our number one rank with a year-to-date wallet share of 8.1%. In Advisory, fees were down 31%, reflecting lower announced activity this year. Underwriting businesses continued to be affected by market volatility, resulting in fees down 40% for debt and down 72% for equity. In terms of the fourth quarter outlook, we expect to be down versus a very strong prior year. And while our existing pipeline is healthy, conversion will, of course, depend on market conditions. Lending revenue of $323 million was up 32% versus the prior year, driven by higher NII on loan growth. Moving to Markets. Revenue was $6.8 billion, up 8% year-on-year. Fixed income was up 22%, as elevated volatility drove strong client activity in the macro franchise, partially offset by a less favorable environment in securitized products. Equity Markets were down 11% against a record third quarter last year. This quarter saw relative strength in derivatives, lower balances in prime and lower cash revenues on lower block activity. Payments revenue was $2 billion, up 22% year-on-year. Excluding the net impact of equity investments, it was up 41%, and the year-on-year growth was driven by higher rates and growth in fees. Securities Services revenue of $1.1 billion was relatively flat year-on-year. Expenses of $6.6 billion were up 13% year-on-year, largely driven by compensation. Credit costs were $513 million, driven by a net reserve build of $486 million. Moving to Commercial Banking on page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $946 million. Record revenue of $3 billion was up 21% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins, partially offset by lower Investment Banking revenue. Gross Investment Banking revenue of $761 million was down 43% year-on-year, driven by reduced capital markets activity. Expenses of $1.2 billion were up 14% year-on-year. Deposits were down 6% year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by attrition of non-operating balances, while our core operating balances have shown stability as payment volumes continue to be robust. Loans were up 13% year-on-year and 4% sequentially. C&I loans were up 7% sequentially, reflecting continued strength in originations and revolver utilization. CRE loans were up 2% sequentially, driven by lower prepayment activity in commercial term lending and real estate banking. Finally, credit costs were $618 million, predominantly driven by a net reserve build of $587 million, while net charge-offs remained low. And then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.2 billion, with pretax margin of 36%. For the quarter, revenue of $4.5 billion was up 6% year-on-year, predominantly driven by deposits and loans on higher margins and balances, largely offset by reductions in management fees linked to this year\u2019s market declines. Expenses of $3 billion were up 10% year-on-year, driven by compensation, including investments in our private banking advisory teams, technology and asset management initiatives. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $12 billion across fixed income, equities and alternatives. AUM of $2.6 trillion and overall client assets of $3.8 trillion were down 13% and 7% year-on-year, respectively, driven by lower market levels, partially offset by continued net inflows. And finally, loans were flat quarter-on-quarter, while deposits were down 6% sequentially, driven by migration to investments, partially offset by client flows. Turning to Corporate on page 8. Corporate reported a net loss of $294 million. Revenue was a net loss of $302 million compared to a net loss of $1.3 billion last year. NII was $792 million, up $1.8 billion year-on-year, driven by the impact of higher rates. NIR was a loss of $1.1 billion, down $852 million, primarily due to the securities losses I mentioned upfront. And expenses of $305 million were higher by $125 million year-on-year. Next, the outlook on page 9. Going forward, we will also provide guidance for total firm-wide NII. For the fourth quarter, we expect it to be approximately $19 billion, implying full year 2022 NII of approximately $66 billion. And we expect NII ex Markets for the fourth quarter to also be about $19 billion, implying that we expect Markets NII to be around zero, which brings the full year to about $61.5 billion. While we\u2019re not giving 2023 NII guidance today, you will recall that at Investor Day, we talked about a fourth quarter 2022 NII ex Markets run rate of $66 billion, with potential upside for the full year 2023. Today\u2019s guidance for the fourth quarter of this year implies an approximate run rate of $76 billion. And from this much higher level, we would now expect some modest decline for the full year 2023. In addition, there\u2019s quite a bit of uncertainty surrounding the trajectory of key drivers, including rates, deposit reprice and loan growth. So, keep both of those things in mind as you update the 2023 estimates in your models. Moving to expenses. Our outlook remains unchanged. And as it relates to the card net charge-off rate, we now expect the full year rate to be approximately 1.5%, below our previous expectations. So to wrap up, we are happy with the strong diversified performance of the quarter as we continue to navigate an environment of elevated uncertainty. With that, I will turn it over to Jamie for some additional remarks.\nJamie Dimon: Jeremy, thank you very much. Hello, everybody. I just wanted to give you a little more insight to how we\u2019re looking at capital and interest rates a little bit. So capital planning, we\u2019re very comfortable with the earnings power of this company, which, you can see, is enormous and the margins and the returns. And more importantly than that is we\u2019re growing franchise value, I think, all around the Firm. And in most areas, we\u2019re up in market share, in a few areas, we\u2019re not, and of course, that disappoints us. But the earnings power gives us a lot of confidence that we\u2019ll get over that 13% in the first quarter. But we always have to keep in mind the volatility and a bunch of other things. So, we know we have to deal with Basel IV. We don\u2019t know when and how this is going to be, and any change in GSIB such as an uncertainty in back of our mind. AOCI: AOCI was traditionally countercyclical, but this kind of environment is more pro-cyclical. So, think of it as rates go up another 100 basis points, that\u2019s $4 billion, easily can handle it just in the back of our mind. CECL: CECL already incorporates a percent of what we think the adverse consequences might be. But obviously, if the environment gets worse, we\u2019ll have to add to reserves. And/or if we change our outlook, meaning that we think the chance of adverse events are higher, we\u2019ll change our reserves. Put in the back of your mind that if unemployment goes to 5% or 6%, you\u2019re probably talking about $5 billion or $6 billion over the course of a couple of quarters. Again, easy to handle, not a big deal. It just doesn\u2019t affect capital a little bit. And then, RWA management, I mean, I think we\u2019re showing that we can easily manage RWA and drive it down in some areas and up in other areas and stuff like that. With that what I would say, a very limited financial effect. And the way you should look at this is, we don\u2019t tell commercial bank or investment bank don\u2019t get new business, don\u2019t serve your clients. So we\u2019re serving clients the way we always do, and you see the loan book growing in a lot of areas, but there are some discretionary things which barely affect us. So, we\u2019re not putting -- conforming mortgage on the balance sheet, whether we originate them or whether correspondents originate the most part, because it makes very low sense to do that in the balance sheet, and we make other choices. And so we\u2019ve got a lot of tools to manage it. Obviously, with the capital requirements going up, we\u2019re going to find ways to reduce RWA. I\u2019m talking about over years strategically, I think without affecting our basic franchises. Interest rates: I think the way to look at it is we\u2019re fairly neutral at this point, interest rates going up or down. Jeremy said the $19 billion, please do not annualize that. There are a lot of uncertainties today. And I\u2019m just going to mention a few. We\u2019re not worried about them. It\u2019s not going to change things dramatically, but does change things. What\u2019s going to be QT\u2019s effect on deposits? How much deposit migration you\u2019re going to have in this new technological environment? And there are pluses and minus from that. And of course, there are lags. There are lags in consumer. There can be some lags in treasury services. There can be some lags in commercial banking. So it\u2019s just on the back of the mind, we\u2019re going to kind of actively manage that. And the other thing I want to point out is that taking investment securities losses for the most part, it could be want to sell our rich securities and replacement chief securities. We don\u2019t want to be locked into something we think will get worse and not take a chance to buy something that we think will get better. So, you might expect to see that taking place now. There may be some securities loss in the future, we can do that. We\u2019re not doing -- we can do this to manage interest rate exposure. But for the most part, we can do that with swaps to or other things. We just do it the most efficient and effective way. I want the people that manage these portfolios to know that we can sell things we don\u2019t want to own and buy things that we do want to own. And other than that, we think it was a very, very good strong quarter across the board. And I guess, we\u2019ll open for questions now.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. Thanks, Jamie. Let\u2019s go ahead and open up for questions.\nOperator: Please stand by. And the first question is coming from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies.\nKen Usdin: Hi, thanks a lot. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the NII and the deposit side to Jamie\u2019s comments there. Obviously, one of the toughest uncertainties is to understand how we think about flows and mix and beta. So just starting to see it, it looks like in terms of deposit costs starting to increase. So, how do you think about it now in this new environment, where we might go to 4.5, maybe higher in terms of how betas might act over the course of this cycle as compared to any prior cycles and previous thoughts? Thanks.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. Thanks, Ken. Good morning. Okay. So, at Investor Day, you\u2019ll recall that Jen said that we expected betas to be low this cycle as they were in the prior cycle, which was a low beta cycle by historical standards. And what we\u2019re now seeing, as we see the rate hikes come through and we see the deposit rate paid develop, is that we\u2019re seeing realized betas being even lower than the prior cycle, just through the actuals. And the question was why is that? And it\u2019s, of course, we don\u2019t really know, but plausible theories include the speed of the hikes, which probably means that some of this is lagged, but also the fact that the system is more better positioned from a liquidity perspective than in prior cycles. So, as we look forward, we know that lags are significant right now. We know that at some point, that will start to come out. Obviously, in wholesale, they come out much faster. That\u2019s probably starting to happen now. But the exact timing of how that develops is going to be very much a function of the competitive environment in the marketplace for deposits, and we\u2019ll see how that plays out.\nKen Usdin: Got it. Okay. And then just the second follow-up on Jamie\u2019s points about, like, okay, if things do look worse ahead -- looking ahead, you might have to build a little bit more understandable over the next couple of years. Can you just help us understand just where you are in your scenario now -- scenarios build and just today, it still looks great, tomorrow, there\u2019s some more uncertainty. So, how do we just get to start to understand how quickly and how you get your handle on that magnitude of ACL delta? And how do you think about it versus either, I don\u2019t know, pandemic peak or day one CECL? It\u2019s very hard for all of us to see this, of course.\nJamie Dimon: Yes. As you know, I think CECL has informed us the bad accounting policy. Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t spend too much time on it because it\u2019s not a real number. It\u2019s a hypothetical probability-based number. And the way I\u2019m trying to make it very simple for you. So, if you look at the pandemic, we put up $15 billion over two quarters, and then we took it down over three or four after that. Okay? And all it did swing all these numbers, and it didn\u2019t change that much. I\u2019m trying to give you a number, obviously, this number to be plus or minus several billion. But if unemployment goes to 60%, [ph] and that becomes the central kind of case, and then you have possibilities it gets better and possibilities it gets worse, we would probably add something like $5 billion or $6 billion. That probably would happen over two or three quarters. I mean, that\u2019s as simple I can make it. Right now, what we have -- right now, we already have a percent in these adverse -- in severe adverse case. We can -- if we change that next quarter, that will be part of that $6 billion I\u2019m talking about.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nEbrahim Poonawala: I guess just following up, Jamie. So I appreciate CECL and the model-based approach. I think you were quoted in the press talking about the potential for a recession in the next 6 to 9 months. Would appreciate any perspective in terms of are you beginning to see cracks, either be it commercial real estate, consumer where it feels like the economic pain from inflation, higher rates is beginning to filter through to your clients? I would appreciate any insights there.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. I\u2019ll take that, Ebrahim. Thanks. The short answer to that question is just no. We just don\u2019t see anything that you could realistically describe as a crack in any of our actual credit performance. I made some comments about this in the prepared remarks on the consumer side. But we\u2019ve done some fairly detailed analysis about different cohorts and early delinquency bucket entry rates and stuff like that. And we do see, in some cases, some tiny increases. But generally, in almost all cases, we think that\u2019s normalization, and it\u2019s even slower than we expect, so.\nJamie Dimon: Yes. I think, we\u2019re in an environment where it\u2019s kind of odd, which is very strong consumer spend. You see it in our numbers, you see it in other people\u2019s numbers, up 10% prior to last year, up 35% pre-COVID. Balance sheets are very good for consumers. Credit card borrowing is normalizing, not getting worse. You might see -- and that\u2019s really good. So, you go in a recession, you\u2019ve got a very strong consumer. However, it\u2019s rather predictable if you look at how they\u2019re spending and inflation. So, inflation is 10% -- reduces that by 10%. And that extra cap -- money they have in the checking accounts will deplete probably by sometime midyear next year. And then, of course, you have inflation, higher rates, higher mortgage rates, oil -- volatility war. So, those things are out there, and that is not a crack in current numbers, it\u2019s quite predictable. It will strain future numbers.\nEbrahim Poonawala: And just tied to that, I think the other thing that investors from the outside worry about is interconnectedness of the systems, be it the UK gilts market, LBOs. How much are you worried about that part of the business in terms of having a meaningful impact in terms of a capital shock at some point over the next year, just given all the QT happening around the world?\nJamie Dimon: I mentioned QT as being one of the uncertainties because it\u2019s a very large change in the flow of funds around the world, who are the buyers and sellers of sovereign debt. There\u2019s a lot of sovereign debt. But I think if you look at -- the tilting [ph] alone is a bump, it\u2019s not going to change what we do or how we do it. And you\u2019re going to see bumps like that because all of the things I already mentioned. It\u2019s inevitable that you\u2019re going to see them. Whether they create systemic risk, I don\u2019t know. I have pointed out, it\u2019s harder for banks to intermediate in that, and that creates a little bit more fragility in the system. That does not mean that you\u2019re going to see a crack of some sort. But again, it\u2019s almost impossible not to have real volatility based on the fact where I told you. Those are large uncertainties that we know about today and in the future.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities.\nJim Mitchell: Hey, Jeremy, at the Investor Day, you noted that expense growth in \u201823 would slow from this year\u2019s level and might be slightly higher than consensus expectations at the time. So, is that -- now that you get closer to next year, does that still hold? And if the economy does get worse than expected, is there some levers to pull, or is it just still investing heavily regardless?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. Thanks, Jim. So broadly, yes, it still holds. No real change on the outlook. Just to remind everyone, at Investor Day, I think the consensus was 79.5 for 2023. We said you were a little low. I think it got revised up to sort of the 80.5 or something like that. And that\u2019s still -- that\u2019s not -- still roughly in the right ballpark. Obviously, we\u2019re going through our budget cycle. We\u2019re looking at the opportunity side and the environment set for next year. So, it\u2019s not in stone. But broadly, on the question of investment, and I\u2019m sure Jamie will agree here that our investment decisions are very much through the cycle decisions. And so, we\u2019re not going to tend to change those just because of a sort of difference in the short-term economic environment. Of course, the volume and revenue-related expense can fluctuate as a function of the environment, as you would expect. \nJamie Dimon: Now, I would just like to add. Obviously, compensations go up or down dramatically. So, you\u2019ll have different estimates about investment banking revenues and markets revenues, and we can\u2019t really adjust for your numbers for that. But I just want to point out the other side of this, we\u2019re making heavy investments and we have among the best margins in the business. I think that\u2019s a very good thing.\nJim Mitchell: Right. And maybe on that front, leverage loan -- were there any leverage loan write-downs this quarter? And is that -- and how do you -- is that market beginning to clear, or are there still overhangs?\nJamie Dimon: There are no real levels of loan write-down this quarter, and that market isn\u2019t yet clear. We own -- our share of it is very small. So, we\u2019re very comfortable.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of John McDonald from Autonomous.\nJohn McDonald: Jeremy, I wanted to ask about your EAR disclosures, what we call your rate sensitivity disclosures. They look a little different than peers. And when we look at the sensitivity to 100 basis points of higher rates beyond the forward curve, it looks like you\u2019re liability-sensitive. Can you give us some context of maybe the limitations of that disclosure and how we should put that in context of the assumptions behind it?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. Thanks, John. And I\u2019d love to have a very long conversation with you about this, but I\u2019m going to keep it short here. It\u2019s really all about lags. So, as our disclosure says, we do not include the impact of reprice lags in our EAR calculation. So, as a result of that, the entire calculation is based on modeled rates paid in the terminal state. As you well know, right now, we\u2019re in the middle of some very significant lags, which are affecting the numbers quite a bit and which we expect to persist for some time. So, as a result of that, what I would expect in the near term is something quite similar to what we\u2019ve experienced this year. As you know, this year, as rates have gone up, we\u2019ve revised our NII outlook from 50 at the beginning of the year to now 61.5. So, as we look forward in the near term from here, I would expect similar type sensitivities or rate fluctuations given the lag environment that we\u2019re in.\nJohn McDonald: And just to follow up on Jamie\u2019s comments about not annualizing the fourth quarter, is that where the risks lie to annualize in the fourth quarter? What are some of the puts and takes that -- you said it might be down a little bit from that fourth quarter annualized?\nJamie Dimon: Yes. I\u2019ve already mentioned, you have a rapidly changing yield curve deposit migration. Everyone does EAR differently. So, one is lag. One is we assume deposit migration. Some people don\u2019t. We assume -- our ECR is included there, some people don\u2019t and all of that. I just think for your models, because of all that kind of stuff, just use a number less than annualized in the 19. So, instead of 76, use a number like 74. Just keep it as simple as possible, and we don\u2019t know. We hope to beat that, but with all the stuff going on, I just -- you just got to be a little cautious and conservative.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of Erika Najarian from UBS.\nErika Najarian: I agree with Ebrahim that your presentation this morning was quite crisp and impactful. So, I\u2019m going to ask the question that I think has been sort of the key debate to the stock all year. So, at Investor Day in May, you mentioned a ROTCE target of 17%, and that was before we found out that the SCB would be higher in June. As we think about -- your capital build is going faster than expected and you think about the revenue power that shows through in this firm, plus or minus what may happen with CECL, do you think you can achieve 17% ROTCE next year?\nJamie Dimon: Yes. That\u2019s obviously a good question. The answer is yes. And one of the things we always look at is normalized ROTCE. So, we\u2019re very honest. We are -- we\u2019re not over earning in NII, maybe a little bit because the lags and stuff like that, but not a lot, but we are over earning on credit. Think of credit card. And the 1.5%, we\u2019ve never seen a number of that low risk. We\u2019re quite conscious of that. So we don\u2019t drag about the 19% this quarter, figure that\u2019s going to continue but it was not. And obviously, we may adjust that 17 a little bit, but it\u2019s not a material adjustment. We\u2019re going to -- we\u2019ve got a lot of great, bright people. We\u2019re going to find a lot of ways to squeeze some of these things down, including like call CCAR is and SCB and liquidate some assets and change business models just a little bit. If you look at our acquisition, for example, they were a non-G-SIFI acquisitions, noncapital, non-G-SIFI, all services and service related. So, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do over time, and we\u2019re pretty comfortable that we\u2019ll get very good returns. So yes, we\u2019re quite -- and next year is totally dependent on what happens in [Technical Difficulty]. But the other thing I would look at, maybe both given this number of other time, is what would we earn in a recession? We would have pretty damn good returns in a recession. I mean -- so I feel very good about that.\nErika Najarian: And this is a super micro question as a follow-up for Jeremy. Why would Markets NII be zero next quarter? And should we expect that to be zero next year?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. Thanks, Erika.\nJamie Dimon: We\u2019re advancing the Markets businesses at the yield curve. So, you\u2019re earning this and you\u2019re paying to finance the training book.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, Erika. I mean, basically, as rates go up, the funding cost goes up. And the offsets on the other side, in many cases, work through derivatives or derivatives like instruments, so it goes through NIR. Fundamentally, we believe the Markets business revenue is rate insensitive. You can see that history through our disclosures this year. So, as you look out to next year with the forward curve implying a much less biased evolution of Fed funds, you shouldn\u2019t expect to see as many changes at least from rates. Of course, we can sometimes see somewhat more unpredictable changes from balances, but that should be unbiased, one way or the other.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo.\nMike Mayo: Jamie, once again, I\u2019m trying to reconcile your actions with your words. You\u2019ve said publicly, you mentioned the hurricane. You mentioned a recession. You mentioned look out, and there are all sorts of risks. I don\u2019t think anyone disagrees with that. On the other hand, your reserves to loans are still well below CECL day one. So, your actions with the reserving don\u2019t seem to reflect your more pessimistic comments about the economy. So, how do I reconcile the two?\nJamie Dimon: Yes. So, the way to do that is in our CECL -- in our reserves today, there is a significant percentage probability that we put on adverse and severe adverse already. So, it\u2019s in there already. A lot of people work in the CECL reserves. Our economists, Jeremy, a lot of other folks. It\u2019s not set by me because I have to think that the odds might be different than other people. And so -- but I conclude as Jeremy saying. But the numbers are very good. We have some of that. I\u2019m trying to be very honest about if things get worse, here\u2019s what it might will mean for reserves. That may be different because, of course, these calculations change a lot of time. But that will be, Michael, which is another thing, which is CECL, the timing of when something happens is very important. So, if it happens, if you said a recession is going to happen in the fourth quarter of next year, that would be very different -- so, it\u2019s going to happen in the first quarter of next year.\nMike Mayo: Yes, I just understood it as the lifetime losses on the loans as opposed to that...\nJamie Dimon: It is. But some loans -- yes, some loans have a short life and some loans have a long life.\nMike Mayo: Let\u2019s just cut to the chase. So, where are you versus three months ago? I mean, is it -- you certainly got headlines with the hurricane comment and all that. And it\u2019s -- look, like as you said, you have Fed tightening, QT, tighter capital rules for banks. You have like the trifecta of tightening by the Fed and then you have wars and everything else. So I don\u2019t think -- and the stock market supports your view and about all the risks out there, but are things better, worse or the same as they were three months ago?\nJamie Dimon: They\u2019re roughly the same. We\u2019re just getting closer to what you and I might consider bad events. So -- in my hurricane, I\u2019ve been very consistent, but looking at probabilities and possibilities. There is still, for example, a possibility of a soft land. We can debate what we think that percentage of yours might be different than mine, but there\u2019s a possibility of a mild recession. Consumers are in very good shape, companies are in a very good shape. And there\u2019s possibility is something worse, mostly because of the war in Ukraine and oil price and all things like that. Those -- I would not change by possibilities and probabilities this quarter versus last quarter, for me. And that\u2019s relatively different point.\nMike Mayo: Yes. Last follow-up. I know your investor cycles. You\u2019ve always done that. You\u2019re consistent. But I mean, your headcount increase is probably going to be the highest in the industry. I mean, headcount from 266,000 to 288,000, your CIB, you\u2019re adding headcount. I mean, you did expect weakness in nine months from now, wouldn\u2019t you wait to hire people, maybe get them a little cheaper?\nJamie Dimon: No.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: A couple of questions. One, just on the investment spend, could you give us a sense as to the areas that you\u2019re leaning in the most, as we should be thinking about into next year? Because you\u2019ve obviously done a lot this year with regard to technology advancement, companies that you\u2019re buying to enhance your digital capabilities and international expansion, in particular on the consumer side. So, just thinking through is this continuation on those themes, or is there something else we should be looking for?\nJamie Dimon: Betsy, it\u2019s exactly what we showed you at Investor Day, almost no change. So, take out that deck, we broke out by business kind of investment. Investment spend in tech is pretty much on track for that.\nBetsy Graseck: And the inflation that drives some of that cost structure, you can deal with through just efficiencies elsewhere. Is that fair?\nJamie Dimon: Believe it or not, that was in the numbers we gave you in May.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. And then separately on the bond restructuring that you did this quarter and the comments around, look, we don\u2019t need to hold stuff we don\u2019t need to hold, we don\u2019t want to hold with that. That kind of suggests to me that there\u2019ll be more bond restructuring as we go through the next quarter. Is there a reason why you didn\u2019t clean the whole thing up this quarter?\nJamie Dimon: No, I think I said we sell rich securities and buy cheap. So, if you look at -- if you looked what happened to mortgage spreads, they gapped out. They gapped in, we bought. They gapped out, we sold and that kind of stuff, you\u2019re getting 2, getting 2.5s. So you can have different point of views. But, I do expect future bond losses going forward. I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s real earnings. So, I think -- but I want our people, our experts in the investment areas to know, if they really want to sell something, we\u2019re going to sell it. We\u2019re not going to sit here and lock ourselves into somebody who\u2019s gotten very, very rich because we feel like we can\u2019t take a bond loss. And remember, it doesn\u2019t affect capital. And in fact, when you reinvest it, which we tend to do, we actually have higher earnings going forward.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI.\nJamie Dimon: And let me just add too, like you saw the CLOs gapped out in Europe. I want our people, when they gapped out -- like 300 or 400 basis points, I want them to be willing to buy. They might sell something to do that, but that is a very smart thing to do.\nGlenn Schorr: Okay. Thank you. So, it\u2019s Glenn. So look, from time to time, where things happen in the market, we get these losses like Arcagos and now this UK pension LDI issue. So, my question for you is, besides that, do you have risk in the derivatives book? And is the situation done? It\u2019s more of when you meet with Risk Committee, are there pockets of leverage that you\u2019re considering on these big market moves, whether it be the dollar or rates where we are not thinking of like us, or do you view the LDI issue as an isolated event?\nJamie Dimon: I\u2019ll mention, and Jeremy, you might have something to add. So, the LDI thing is a bump in the road. And I think the Bank of England is also trying to get through this thing without changing the policy about monetary policy and QT. And I was surprised to see how much leverage there was in some of those pension plans. And my experience in life has been you have things like what we\u2019re going through today, there are going to be other surprises. Someone is going to be off sides. We don\u2019t see anything looks systemic, but there is leverage in certain credit portfolio, there\u2019s leverage for certain companies -- there is leverage. So you\u2019re probably going to see some of that. I do think you see volatile markets. You already see very low liquidity. So, something like the LDI think could cause more issues down the road, if it happens constantly and stuff like that. But so far, it\u2019s a bump in the road. The banking system itself is extraordinarily strong.\nGlenn Schorr: Would the dollar qualify as one of those super strong moves that could put people offsides? And if so, how do you make sure you protect JPMorgan against that?\nJamie Dimon: Well, we\u2019re -- because we\u2019re -- we generally -- we do not -- we\u2019re not taking them. We generally hedge when it comes to big currencies and stuff like that. But yes, dollar flows, QT, emerging markets hedge funds, yes, that would be a category that might -- something might happen there. It wouldn\u2019t be -- it shouldn\u2019t be something that\u2019s going to affect JPMorgan that much. In fact, it usually creates an opportunity for JPMorgan.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, I\u2019m not going to [Technical Difficulty] what was traditionally the case that emerging markets struggle, sovereign struggle with the kind of dollar strength that we\u2019re experiencing right now, but our emerging market franchise folks have been through these cycles before. So, we manage through it.\nGlenn Schorr: Thank you, both. I appreciate it.\nJamie Dimon: Just to add to the strength of the franchise, I remember looking back at our emerging markets results by quarter over a decade, it was shocking to me how few quarters and how few countries we ever lost money. We may have had low returns in some quarters, but it was shocking. We made money in Argentina every -- almost every year for the last 20 years. And I think there was one quarter we put up reserves for one of the oil companies and took them down, but it\u2019s kind of very -- the stability is striking.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets.\nGerard Cassidy: You guys have been talking about the system liquidity with, Jamie, you referenced QT, also the fragility of the system. Can you share with us what are the metrics you guys are looking at to see if the system does have a problem on liquidity? Just this week, you probably saw that the Swiss National Bank upped its reserve, currency swapped lines to $6.3 billion. So, what are some of the things you guys focus in on to see if there\u2019s going to be maybe more -- some liquidity issues that could lead to greater problems?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. I mean, Gerard, broadly, if you just look at standard regulatory reporting of LCR ratios in the U.S. banking system, everyone just has very significant surpluses. And of course, we can go into the question of as QT plays through and how that interacts with RPM loan growth, whether that puts some pressure on banking system deposits, but that\u2019s starting from a very, very strong position. So, there\u2019s a lot of cushion there for that to come down before you start to have a real challenge from a liquidity perspective.\nJamie Dimon: Yes. We look at everything from the Fed repo, deposit tightening to net issuance of treasury, net issuance of mortgages and treasury volatility and treasury bid-ask spreads and treasury markets and all that. We\u2019re looking at all of that. The banking itself is extremely strong, extremely strong. It\u2019s not -- what you\u2019re going to see will not be in the banking. And there may be bankers outside somewhere, but it will be somewhere else. It will be somewhere else. It might be in credit, it might be in emerging margins. It might be in FX, but you\u2019re likely to have something like that, you have events like the ones we\u2019re talking about.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And then, in terms of the investment banking and capital markets businesses, can you guys give us any color into pipelines, how they stood at the end of the third quarter? And as you\u2019re going into the fourth quarter, what you\u2019re seeing in terms of those business lines?\nJamie Dimon: Yes. And I\u2019ve always pointed out to you all, the pipelines come and go, okay? You\u2019ve seen that the size, there never had before. So pipeline is not necessarily to see. I would put in your model lower IB revenues next quarter than this quarter based on what we see today. Markets, we have no idea. Seasonally, it\u2019s generally a low quarter, the fourth quarter, but we don\u2019t know this quarter because there\u2019s so much activity taking place, and your guess is as good as ours.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor from Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Can you guys talk about the outlook for loan growth the next few quarters? And besides some of the obvious areas like leverage lending and correspondent mortgage you already talked about, any areas that you\u2019re tightening around the edges?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. Matt, let me take your last question first. So, in general, no, we underwrite through the cycle. We haven\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t really loosen our underwriting standards in the moment where everything looked great. And so, we don\u2019t see any need to tighten now, really a lot of consistency there. In terms of the actual loan growth outlook, we have said for this year, obviously, only one quarter left, that we\u2019d have high single digits. No meaningful change in that outlook there, probably a little bit of a headwind as a function of rates, as you mentioned, and some of the RWA optimization in mortgages. As we go into next year, we remain very positive and optimistic about the card story across a range of dimensions, in terms of both, outstandings and revolve normalization. But for the rest of the loan growth environment, it\u2019s going to be, I think, very dependent, especially in wholesale on the macro situation. We know that in recession environments, we tend to see lower loan demand. At the same time, we\u2019ve got a lot of great initiatives going and client engagement and new clients. So, we\u2019ll just have to see how that plays out next year.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: And I guess, when we read headlines about home prices going down in some markets and car prices starting to roll, I mean, why doesn\u2019t that drive some tightening in those businesses?\nJamie Dimon: Well, it has. I mean look at the volumes and mortgage have dropped and cars, the quota have dropped and stuff like that. And that\u2019s already in our numbers, and we would expect that to continue that way.\nOperator: The last question is coming from the line of Charles Peabody from Portales Partners.\nCharles Peabody: Yes. I\u2019m just curious in your guidance on NII where you kind of implied fourth quarter would be peak run rate. Next year, do you factor in any impact from a possible treasury buyback program, which could redirect liquidity out of the money market system into the banking system, and therefore, keep your deposit betas lower? Do you think about that at all as a possibility?\nJamie Dimon: Yes. I think I -- I don\u2019t know if you were listening when I said it before. QT, net issuance in mortgages, net issuance in treasuries globally is going to reduce deposits and create certain forms of volatility and absolutely incorporated that our thinking, including lags, the change in the yield curve, change in spreads and all those things in the numbers we gave you. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re being -- trying to be conservative in NII, that while you can annualize the 19 to 76, it\u2019s going have a model, put in 74 and it incorporates all of that.\nOperator: At the moment, there are no further questions on the line.\nJamie Dimon: Well, thank you very much, and we\u2019ll talk to you all next quarter.\nJeremy Barnum: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Everyone, that concludes your conference call for today. You may now disconnect. Thank you all for joining, and enjoy the rest of your day.",

            "name": "Jeremy Barnum",
            "content": "Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. As always, the presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on page 1. The Firm reported net income of $9.7 billion, EPS of $3.12 on revenue of $33.5 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 18%. The only significant item this quarter was discretionary net investment securities losses in Corporate of $959 million as a result of repositioning the portfolio by selling U.S. Treasuries and mortgages. Our strong results this quarter reflect the resilience of the franchise in a dynamic environment. Touching on a few highlights. We had a record third quarter -- we had record third quarter revenue in Markets of $6.8 billion, we ranked number one in retail deposit share based on FDIC data, and credit is still healthy with net charge-offs remaining low. On page 2, we have more detail. Revenue of $33.5 billion was up $3.1 billion or 10% year-on-year. Excluding the net investment securities losses, it was up 13%. NII ex Markets was up $5.7 billion or 51%, driven by higher rates. NIR ex Markets was down $3.2 billion or 24%, largely driven by lower IB fees and the securities losses. And Markets revenue was up $502 million or 8% year-on-year. Expenses of $19.2 billion were up $2.1 billion or 12% year-on-year, driven by higher structural costs and investments. And credit costs of $1.5 billion included net charge-offs of $727 million. The net reserve build of $808 million included a $937 million build in Wholesale, reflecting loan growth and updates to the Firm's macroeconomic scenarios, partially offset by $150 million release in Home Lending. On the balance sheet and capital on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.5%, up 30 basis points versus the prior quarter, which was primarily driven by the benefit of net income less distributions, partially offset by the impact of AOCI. RWA was down approximately $23 billion quarter-on-quarter, with growth in lending more than offset by continued active balance sheet management and lower market risk RWA. Given our results this quarter, we are well positioned to meet our CET1 targets of 12.5% in the fourth quarter and 13% in the first quarter of 2023. These current targets include a 50 basis-point buffer over the growing regulatory requirements, which provides flexibility over the coming quarters. To conclude on capital, with the future increases in our risk-based requirements, SLR will no longer be our binding capital constraint. So, we announced the call of $5.4 billion in press this quarter and issued $3.5 billion in sub debt to rebalance our capital stack. Now, let's go to our businesses, starting on page 4. Before I review CCB's performance, let me provide you with an update on the health of U.S. consumers and small businesses based on our data. Nominal spend is still strong across both discretionary and nondiscretionary categories, with combined debit and credit spend up 13% year-on-year. Cash buffers remain elevated across all income segments. However, with spending growing faster than income, we are seeing a continued decrease in median deposits year-on-year, particularly in the lower income segments. And not surprisingly, small business owners are increasingly focused on the risks and the economic outlook. Now, moving to financial results. This quarter, CCB reported net income of $4.3 billion on revenue of $14.3 billion, which was up 14% year-on-year. In Consumer & Business Banking, revenue was up 30% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. Deposits were up 10% year-on-year and down 1% quarter-on-quarter. We ranked number one in retail deposit share based on FDIC data, up 60% year-on-year, making us the fastest-growing among the top 20 banks. And we are now number one in L.A., in addition to New York and Chicago, making us top ranked in the three largest markets. Client investment assets were down 10% year-on-year, driven by market performance, partially offset by flows, while lending revenue was down 34% year-on-year on lower production margins and volume. Moving to Card & Auto. Revenue was up 9% year-on-year, driven by higher card NII, partially offset by lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 18%. And while revolving balances were up 15%, driven by strong net new account originations and growth in revolving balances per account, they still remain slightly below pre-pandemic levels. And in Auto, originations were $7.5 billion, down 35%, due to lack of vehicle supply and rising rates. Expenses of $8 billion were up 11% year-on-year, driven by the investments we're making in technology, travel, marketing and branches. In terms of actual credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $529 million, reflecting net charge-offs of $679 million, which were up $188 million year-on-year, largely driven by loan growth in card as well as a reserve release of $150 million in Home Lending. Card delinquencies remain well below pre-pandemic levels, though we continue to see gradual normalization. Next, the CIB on page 5. CIB reported net income of $3.5 billion on revenue of $11.9 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.7 billion was down 43% year-on-year. IB fees were down 47% versus a strong third quarter last year. We maintained our number one rank with a year-to-date wallet share of 8.1%. In Advisory, fees were down 31%, reflecting lower announced activity this year. Underwriting businesses continued to be affected by market volatility, resulting in fees down 40% for debt and down 72% for equity. In terms of the fourth quarter outlook, we expect to be down versus a very strong prior year. And while our existing pipeline is healthy, conversion will, of course, depend on market conditions. Lending revenue of $323 million was up 32% versus the prior year, driven by higher NII on loan growth. Moving to Markets. Revenue was $6.8 billion, up 8% year-on-year. Fixed income was up 22%, as elevated volatility drove strong client activity in the macro franchise, partially offset by a less favorable environment in securitized products. Equity Markets were down 11% against a record third quarter last year. This quarter saw relative strength in derivatives, lower balances in prime and lower cash revenues on lower block activity. Payments revenue was $2 billion, up 22% year-on-year. Excluding the net impact of equity investments, it was up 41%, and the year-on-year growth was driven by higher rates and growth in fees. Securities Services revenue of $1.1 billion was relatively flat year-on-year. Expenses of $6.6 billion were up 13% year-on-year, largely driven by compensation. Credit costs were $513 million, driven by a net reserve build of $486 million. Moving to Commercial Banking on page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $946 million. Record revenue of $3 billion was up 21% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins, partially offset by lower Investment Banking revenue. Gross Investment Banking revenue of $761 million was down 43% year-on-year, driven by reduced capital markets activity. Expenses of $1.2 billion were up 14% year-on-year. Deposits were down 6% year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by attrition of non-operating balances, while our core operating balances have shown stability as payment volumes continue to be robust. Loans were up 13% year-on-year and 4% sequentially. C&I loans were up 7% sequentially, reflecting continued strength in originations and revolver utilization. CRE loans were up 2% sequentially, driven by lower prepayment activity in commercial term lending and real estate banking. Finally, credit costs were $618 million, predominantly driven by a net reserve build of $587 million, while net charge-offs remained low. And then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.2 billion, with pretax margin of 36%. For the quarter, revenue of $4.5 billion was up 6% year-on-year, predominantly driven by deposits and loans on higher margins and balances, largely offset by reductions in management fees linked to this year's market declines. Expenses of $3 billion were up 10% year-on-year, driven by compensation, including investments in our private banking advisory teams, technology and asset management initiatives. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $12 billion across fixed income, equities and alternatives. AUM of $2.6 trillion and overall client assets of $3.8 trillion were down 13% and 7% year-on-year, respectively, driven by lower market levels, partially offset by continued net inflows. And finally, loans were flat quarter-on-quarter, while deposits were down 6% sequentially, driven by migration to investments, partially offset by client flows. Turning to Corporate on page 8. Corporate reported a net loss of $294 million. Revenue was a net loss of $302 million compared to a net loss of $1.3 billion last year. NII was $792 million, up $1.8 billion year-on-year, driven by the impact of higher rates. NIR was a loss of $1.1 billion, down $852 million, primarily due to the securities losses I mentioned upfront. And expenses of $305 million were higher by $125 million year-on-year. Next, the outlook on page 9. Going forward, we will also provide guidance for total firm-wide NII. For the fourth quarter, we expect it to be approximately $19 billion, implying full year 2022 NII of approximately $66 billion. And we expect NII ex Markets for the fourth quarter to also be about $19 billion, implying that we expect Markets NII to be around zero, which brings the full year to about $61.5 billion. While we're not giving 2023 NII guidance today, you will recall that at Investor Day, we talked about a fourth quarter 2022 NII ex Markets run rate of $66 billion, with potential upside for the full year 2023. Today's guidance for the fourth quarter of this year implies an approximate run rate of $76 billion. And from this much higher level, we would now expect some modest decline for the full year 2023. In addition, there's quite a bit of uncertainty surrounding the trajectory of key drivers, including rates, deposit reprice and loan growth. So, keep both of those things in mind as you update the 2023 estimates in your models. Moving to expenses. Our outlook remains unchanged. And as it relates to the card net charge-off rate, we now expect the full year rate to be approximately 1.5%, below our previous expectations. So to wrap up, we are happy with the strong diversified performance of the quarter as we continue to navigate an environment of elevated uncertainty. With that, I will turn it over to Jamie for some additional remarks. Yes. Thanks, Jamie. Let's go ahead and open up for questions. Yes. Thanks, Ken. Good morning. Okay. So, at Investor Day, you'll recall that Jen said that we expected betas to be low this cycle as they were in the prior cycle, which was a low beta cycle by historical standards. And what we're now seeing, as we see the rate hikes come through and we see the deposit rate paid develop, is that we're seeing realized betas being even lower than the prior cycle, just through the actuals. And the question was why is that? And it's, of course, we don't really know, but plausible theories include the speed of the hikes, which probably means that some of this is lagged, but also the fact that the system is more better positioned from a liquidity perspective than in prior cycles. So, as we look forward, we know that lags are significant right now. We know that at some point, that will start to come out. Obviously, in wholesale, they come out much faster. That's probably starting to happen now. But the exact timing of how that develops is going to be very much a function of the competitive environment in the marketplace for deposits, and we'll see how that plays out. Yes. I'll take that, Ebrahim. Thanks. The short answer to that question is just no. We just don't see anything that you could realistically describe as a crack in any of our actual credit performance. I made some comments about this in the prepared remarks on the consumer side. But we've done some fairly detailed analysis about different cohorts and early delinquency bucket entry rates and stuff like that. And we do see, in some cases, some tiny increases. But generally, in almost all cases, we think that's normalization, and it's even slower than we expect, so. Yes. Thanks, Jim. So broadly, yes, it still holds. No real change on the outlook. Just to remind everyone, at Investor Day, I think the consensus was 79.5 for 2023. We said you were a little low. I think it got revised up to sort of the 80.5 or something like that. And that's still -- that's not -- still roughly in the right ballpark. Obviously, we're going through our budget cycle. We're looking at the opportunity side and the environment set for next year. So, it's not in stone. But broadly, on the question of investment, and I'm sure Jamie will agree here that our investment decisions are very much through the cycle decisions. And so, we're not going to tend to change those just because of a sort of difference in the short-term economic environment. Of course, the volume and revenue-related expense can fluctuate as a function of the environment, as you would expect. Yes. Thanks, John. And I'd love to have a very long conversation with you about this, but I'm going to keep it short here. It's really all about lags. So, as our disclosure says, we do not include the impact of reprice lags in our EAR calculation. So, as a result of that, the entire calculation is based on modeled rates paid in the terminal state. As you well know, right now, we're in the middle of some very significant lags, which are affecting the numbers quite a bit and which we expect to persist for some time. So, as a result of that, what I would expect in the near term is something quite similar to what we've experienced this year. As you know, this year, as rates have gone up, we've revised our NII outlook from 50 at the beginning of the year to now 61.5. So, as we look forward in the near term from here, I would expect similar type sensitivities or rate fluctuations given the lag environment that we're in. Yes. Thanks, Erika. Yes, Erika. I mean, basically, as rates go up, the funding cost goes up. And the offsets on the other side, in many cases, work through derivatives or derivatives like instruments, so it goes through NIR. Fundamentally, we believe the Markets business revenue is rate insensitive. You can see that history through our disclosures this year. So, as you look out to next year with the forward curve implying a much less biased evolution of Fed funds, you shouldn't expect to see as many changes at least from rates. Of course, we can sometimes see somewhat more unpredictable changes from balances, but that should be unbiased, one way or the other. Yes, I'm not going to [Technical Difficulty] what was traditionally the case that emerging markets struggle, sovereign struggle with the kind of dollar strength that we're experiencing right now, but our emerging market franchise folks have been through these cycles before. So, we manage through it. Yes. I mean, Gerard, broadly, if you just look at standard regulatory reporting of LCR ratios in the U.S. banking system, everyone just has very significant surpluses. And of course, we can go into the question of as QT plays through and how that interacts with RPM loan growth, whether that puts some pressure on banking system deposits, but that's starting from a very, very strong position. So, there's a lot of cushion there for that to come down before you start to have a real challenge from a liquidity perspective. Yes. Matt, let me take your last question first. So, in general, no, we underwrite through the cycle. We haven't -- we didn't really loosen our underwriting standards in the moment where everything looked great. And so, we don't see any need to tighten now, really a lot of consistency there. In terms of the actual loan growth outlook, we have said for this year, obviously, only one quarter left, that we'd have high single digits. No meaningful change in that outlook there, probably a little bit of a headwind as a function of rates, as you mentioned, and some of the RWA optimization in mortgages. As we go into next year, we remain very positive and optimistic about the card story across a range of dimensions, in terms of both, outstandings and revolve normalization. But for the rest of the loan growth environment, it's going to be, I think, very dependent, especially in wholesale on the macro situation. We know that in recession environments, we tend to see lower loan demand. At the same time, we've got a lot of great initiatives going and client engagement and new clients. So, we'll just have to see how that plays out next year. Thank you."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Jamie Dimon",
            "content": "Jeremy, thank you very much. Hello, everybody. I just wanted to give you a little more insight to how we're looking at capital and interest rates a little bit. So capital planning, we're very comfortable with the earnings power of this company, which, you can see, is enormous and the margins and the returns. And more importantly than that is we're growing franchise value, I think, all around the Firm. And in most areas, we're up in market share, in a few areas, we're not, and of course, that disappoints us. But the earnings power gives us a lot of confidence that we'll get over that 13% in the first quarter. But we always have to keep in mind the volatility and a bunch of other things. So, we know we have to deal with Basel IV. We don't know when and how this is going to be, and any change in GSIB such as an uncertainty in back of our mind. AOCI: AOCI was traditionally countercyclical, but this kind of environment is more pro-cyclical. So, think of it as rates go up another 100 basis points, that's $4 billion, easily can handle it just in the back of our mind. CECL: CECL already incorporates a percent of what we think the adverse consequences might be. But obviously, if the environment gets worse, we'll have to add to reserves. And/or if we change our outlook, meaning that we think the chance of adverse events are higher, we'll change our reserves. Put in the back of your mind that if unemployment goes to 5% or 6%, you're probably talking about $5 billion or $6 billion over the course of a couple of quarters. Again, easy to handle, not a big deal. It just doesn't affect capital a little bit. And then, RWA management, I mean, I think we're showing that we can easily manage RWA and drive it down in some areas and up in other areas and stuff like that. With that what I would say, a very limited financial effect. And the way you should look at this is, we don't tell commercial bank or investment bank don't get new business, don't serve your clients. So we're serving clients the way we always do, and you see the loan book growing in a lot of areas, but there are some discretionary things which barely affect us. So, we're not putting -- conforming mortgage on the balance sheet, whether we originate them or whether correspondents originate the most part, because it makes very low sense to do that in the balance sheet, and we make other choices. And so we've got a lot of tools to manage it. Obviously, with the capital requirements going up, we're going to find ways to reduce RWA. I'm talking about over years strategically, I think without affecting our basic franchises. Interest rates: I think the way to look at it is we're fairly neutral at this point, interest rates going up or down. Jeremy said the $19 billion, please do not annualize that. There are a lot of uncertainties today. And I'm just going to mention a few. We're not worried about them. It's not going to change things dramatically, but does change things. What's going to be QT's effect on deposits? How much deposit migration you're going to have in this new technological environment? And there are pluses and minus from that. And of course, there are lags. There are lags in consumer. There can be some lags in treasury services. There can be some lags in commercial banking. So it's just on the back of the mind, we're going to kind of actively manage that. And the other thing I want to point out is that taking investment securities losses for the most part, it could be want to sell our rich securities and replacement chief securities. We don't want to be locked into something we think will get worse and not take a chance to buy something that we think will get better. So, you might expect to see that taking place now. There may be some securities loss in the future, we can do that. We're not doing -- we can do this to manage interest rate exposure. But for the most part, we can do that with swaps to or other things. We just do it the most efficient and effective way. I want the people that manage these portfolios to know that we can sell things we don't want to own and buy things that we do want to own. And other than that, we think it was a very, very good strong quarter across the board. And I guess, we'll open for questions now. Yes. As you know, I think CECL has informed us the bad accounting policy. Honestly, I wouldn't spend too much time on it because it's not a real number. It's a hypothetical probability-based number. And the way I'm trying to make it very simple for you. So, if you look at the pandemic, we put up $15 billion over two quarters, and then we took it down over three or four after that. Okay? And all it did swing all these numbers, and it didn't change that much. I'm trying to give you a number, obviously, this number to be plus or minus several billion. But if unemployment goes to 60%, [ph] and that becomes the central kind of case, and then you have possibilities it gets better and possibilities it gets worse, we would probably add something like $5 billion or $6 billion. That probably would happen over two or three quarters. I mean, that's as simple I can make it. Right now, what we have -- right now, we already have a percent in these adverse -- in severe adverse case. We can -- if we change that next quarter, that will be part of that $6 billion I'm talking about. Yes. I think, we're in an environment where it's kind of odd, which is very strong consumer spend. You see it in our numbers, you see it in other people's numbers, up 10% prior to last year, up 35% pre-COVID. Balance sheets are very good for consumers. Credit card borrowing is normalizing, not getting worse. You might see -- and that's really good. So, you go in a recession, you've got a very strong consumer. However, it's rather predictable if you look at how they're spending and inflation. So, inflation is 10% -- reduces that by 10%. And that extra cap -- money they have in the checking accounts will deplete probably by sometime midyear next year. And then, of course, you have inflation, higher rates, higher mortgage rates, oil -- volatility war. So, those things are out there, and that is not a crack in current numbers, it's quite predictable. It will strain future numbers. I mentioned QT as being one of the uncertainties because it's a very large change in the flow of funds around the world, who are the buyers and sellers of sovereign debt. There's a lot of sovereign debt. But I think if you look at -- the tilting [ph] alone is a bump, it's not going to change what we do or how we do it. And you're going to see bumps like that because all of the things I already mentioned. It's inevitable that you're going to see them. Whether they create systemic risk, I don't know. I have pointed out, it's harder for banks to intermediate in that, and that creates a little bit more fragility in the system. That does not mean that you're going to see a crack of some sort. But again, it's almost impossible not to have real volatility based on the fact where I told you. Those are large uncertainties that we know about today and in the future. Now, I would just like to add. Obviously, compensations go up or down dramatically. So, you'll have different estimates about investment banking revenues and markets revenues, and we can't really adjust for your numbers for that. But I just want to point out the other side of this, we're making heavy investments and we have among the best margins in the business. I think that's a very good thing. There are no real levels of loan write-down this quarter, and that market isn't yet clear. We own -- our share of it is very small. So, we're very comfortable. Yes. I've already mentioned, you have a rapidly changing yield curve deposit migration. Everyone does EAR differently. So, one is lag. One is we assume deposit migration. Some people don't. We assume -- our ECR is included there, some people don't and all of that. I just think for your models, because of all that kind of stuff, just use a number less than annualized in the 19. So, instead of 76, use a number like 74. Just keep it as simple as possible, and we don't know. We hope to beat that, but with all the stuff going on, I just -- you just got to be a little cautious and conservative. Yes. That's obviously a good question. The answer is yes. And one of the things we always look at is normalized ROTCE. So, we're very honest. We are -- we're not over earning in NII, maybe a little bit because the lags and stuff like that, but not a lot, but we are over earning on credit. Think of credit card. And the 1.5%, we've never seen a number of that low risk. We're quite conscious of that. So we don't drag about the 19% this quarter, figure that's going to continue but it was not. And obviously, we may adjust that 17 a little bit, but it's not a material adjustment. We're going to -- we've got a lot of great, bright people. We're going to find a lot of ways to squeeze some of these things down, including like call CCAR is and SCB and liquidate some assets and change business models just a little bit. If you look at our acquisition, for example, they were a non-G-SIFI acquisitions, noncapital, non-G-SIFI, all services and service related. So, that's what we're going to do over time, and we're pretty comfortable that we'll get very good returns. So yes, we're quite -- and next year is totally dependent on what happens in [Technical Difficulty]. But the other thing I would look at, maybe both given this number of other time, is what would we earn in a recession? We would have pretty damn good returns in a recession. I mean -- so I feel very good about that. We're advancing the Markets businesses at the yield curve. So, you're earning this and you're paying to finance the training book. Yes. So, the way to do that is in our CECL -- in our reserves today, there is a significant percentage probability that we put on adverse and severe adverse already. So, it's in there already. A lot of people work in the CECL reserves. Our economists, Jeremy, a lot of other folks. It's not set by me because I have to think that the odds might be different than other people. And so -- but I conclude as Jeremy saying. But the numbers are very good. We have some of that. I'm trying to be very honest about if things get worse, here's what it might will mean for reserves. That may be different because, of course, these calculations change a lot of time. But that will be, Michael, which is another thing, which is CECL, the timing of when something happens is very important. So, if it happens, if you said a recession is going to happen in the fourth quarter of next year, that would be very different -- so, it's going to happen in the first quarter of next year. It is. But some loans -- yes, some loans have a short life and some loans have a long life. They're roughly the same. We're just getting closer to what you and I might consider bad events. So -- in my hurricane, I've been very consistent, but looking at probabilities and possibilities. There is still, for example, a possibility of a soft land. We can debate what we think that percentage of yours might be different than mine, but there's a possibility of a mild recession. Consumers are in very good shape, companies are in a very good shape. And there's possibility is something worse, mostly because of the war in Ukraine and oil price and all things like that. Those -- I would not change by possibilities and probabilities this quarter versus last quarter, for me. And that's relatively different point. No. Betsy, it's exactly what we showed you at Investor Day, almost no change. So, take out that deck, we broke out by business kind of investment. Investment spend in tech is pretty much on track for that. Believe it or not, that was in the numbers we gave you in May. No, I think I said we sell rich securities and buy cheap. So, if you look at -- if you looked what happened to mortgage spreads, they gapped out. They gapped in, we bought. They gapped out, we sold and that kind of stuff, you're getting 2, getting 2.5s. So you can have different point of views. But, I do expect future bond losses going forward. I just don't think that's real earnings. So, I think -- but I want our people, our experts in the investment areas to know, if they really want to sell something, we're going to sell it. We're not going to sit here and lock ourselves into somebody who's gotten very, very rich because we feel like we can't take a bond loss. And remember, it doesn't affect capital. And in fact, when you reinvest it, which we tend to do, we actually have higher earnings going forward. And let me just add too, like you saw the CLOs gapped out in Europe. I want our people, when they gapped out -- like 300 or 400 basis points, I want them to be willing to buy. They might sell something to do that, but that is a very smart thing to do. I'll mention, and Jeremy, you might have something to add. So, the LDI thing is a bump in the road. And I think the Bank of England is also trying to get through this thing without changing the policy about monetary policy and QT. And I was surprised to see how much leverage there was in some of those pension plans. And my experience in life has been you have things like what we're going through today, there are going to be other surprises. Someone is going to be off sides. We don't see anything looks systemic, but there is leverage in certain credit portfolio, there's leverage for certain companies -- there is leverage. So you're probably going to see some of that. I do think you see volatile markets. You already see very low liquidity. So, something like the LDI think could cause more issues down the road, if it happens constantly and stuff like that. But so far, it's a bump in the road. The banking system itself is extraordinarily strong. Well, we're -- because we're -- we generally -- we do not -- we're not taking them. We generally hedge when it comes to big currencies and stuff like that. But yes, dollar flows, QT, emerging markets hedge funds, yes, that would be a category that might -- something might happen there. It wouldn't be -- it shouldn't be something that's going to affect JPMorgan that much. In fact, it usually creates an opportunity for JPMorgan. Just to add to the strength of the franchise, I remember looking back at our emerging markets results by quarter over a decade, it was shocking to me how few quarters and how few countries we ever lost money. We may have had low returns in some quarters, but it was shocking. We made money in Argentina every -- almost every year for the last 20 years. And I think there was one quarter we put up reserves for one of the oil companies and took them down, but it's kind of very -- the stability is striking. Yes. We look at everything from the Fed repo, deposit tightening to net issuance of treasury, net issuance of mortgages and treasury volatility and treasury bid-ask spreads and treasury markets and all that. We're looking at all of that. The banking itself is extremely strong, extremely strong. It's not -- what you're going to see will not be in the banking. And there may be bankers outside somewhere, but it will be somewhere else. It will be somewhere else. It might be in credit, it might be in emerging margins. It might be in FX, but you're likely to have something like that, you have events like the ones we're talking about. Yes. And I've always pointed out to you all, the pipelines come and go, okay? You've seen that the size, there never had before. So pipeline is not necessarily to see. I would put in your model lower IB revenues next quarter than this quarter based on what we see today. Markets, we have no idea. Seasonally, it's generally a low quarter, the fourth quarter, but we don't know this quarter because there's so much activity taking place, and your guess is as good as ours. Well, it has. I mean look at the volumes and mortgage have dropped and cars, the quota have dropped and stuff like that. And that's already in our numbers, and we would expect that to continue that way. Yes. I think I -- I don't know if you were listening when I said it before. QT, net issuance in mortgages, net issuance in treasuries globally is going to reduce deposits and create certain forms of volatility and absolutely incorporated that our thinking, including lags, the change in the yield curve, change in spreads and all those things in the numbers we gave you. And that's why we're being -- trying to be conservative in NII, that while you can annualize the 19 to 76, it's going have a model, put in 74 and it incorporates all of that. Well, thank you very much, and we'll talk to you all next quarter."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.\nJeremy Barnum: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on page 1. The Firm reported net income of $8.6 billion, EPS of $2.76 on revenue of $31.6 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 17%. Touching on a few highlights. We had another quarter of strong performance in Markets, which generated revenue of nearly $8 billion. Credit is still quite healthy, and net charge-offs remain historically low. And there continue to be positive trends in loan growth across our businesses, with average loans up 7% year-on-year and 2% quarter-on-quarter. On page 2, we have some more detail. Revenue of $31.6 billion was up $235 million or 1% year-on-year. NII ex Markets was up $2.8 billion or 26%, driven by higher rates and balance sheet growth. NIR ex Markets was down $3.6 billion or 26%, largely driven by lower IB fees and higher card acquisition costs, and Markets revenue was up $1 billion or 15% year-on-year. Expenses of $18.7 billion were up $1.1 billion or 6% year-on-year, predominantly on higher investments and structural expenses, partially offset by lower volume and revenue-related expenses. And credit costs were $1.1 billion, which included net charge-offs of $657 million and reserve builds of $428 million, reflecting loan growth as well as a modest deterioration in the economic outlook. On to balance sheet and capital on page 3. Let\u2019s start by talking about our plans for capital management over the coming quarters. The new 4% SCB will raise our standardized CET1 requirement to 12% effective in the fourth quarter, and the 4% G-SIB effective in 1Q \u201823 further raises this requirement to 12.5%. At Investor Day, we said that we expected SCB to be higher and made it clear that in the near term, share buybacks would be significantly reduced in order to build capital for the increased requirements. In light of the SCB coming in even higher than expected, we have paused buybacks for the near term. As we discussed at Investor Day and as we show at the bottom of this presentation page, our organic capital generation allows us to rapidly build capital in excess of future requirements with a current target of roughly 12.5% in the fourth quarter. Any access over the regulatory requirements offers us protection against a range of economic scenarios with room to deploy capital in line with our strategic priorities. We have a long established track record of balance sheet discipline across the Company, and this quarter\u2019s RWA reduction shows evidence of this discipline. Turning to this quarter\u2019s results, you can see that our CET1 ratio of 12.2% is up 30 basis points from the prior quarter. Our RWA was down approximately $44 billion with growth in franchise lending being more than offset by the combination of active balance sheet management and the normalization of market risk RWA from the first quarter. CET1 capital was slightly down as earnings were offset by distributions and the impact of AOCI drawdowns in our AFS portfolio. Now let\u2019s go to our businesses, starting with Consumer & Community Banking on page 4. Before I review CCB\u2019s performance, let me touch on what we\u2019re seeing in our data regarding the health of the U.S. consumer. Spend is still healthy with combined debit and credit spend up 15% year-on-year. We see the impact of inflation and higher nondiscretionary spend across income segments. Notably, the average consumer is spending 35% more year-on-year on gas and approximately 6% more on recurring bills and other nondiscretionary categories. At the same time, we have yet to observe a pullback in discretionary spending, including in the lower income segments, with travel and dining growing a robust 34% year-on-year overall. And with spending growing faster than incomes, median deposit balances are down across income segments for the first time since the pandemic started, though cash buffers still remain elevated. With that as a backdrop, this quarter, CCB reported net income of $3.1 billion on revenue of $12.6 billion, which was down 1% year-on-year. In Consumer and Business Banking, revenue was up 9% year-on-year, driven by growth in deposits. Deposits were up 13% year-on-year and 2% quarter-on-quarter. And client investment assets were down 7% year-on-year, driven by market performance, partially offset by flows. Home Lending revenue was down 26% year-on-year as the rate environment drove both, lower production revenue and tighter spreads, partially offset by higher net servicing revenue. And mortgage origination volume of $22 billion was down 45%. Moving to Card & Auto. Revenue was down 6% year-on-year, reflecting higher acquisition costs on strong new card account originations and lower auto lease income, largely offset by higher card NII. Card outstandings were up 16%, and revolving balances were up 9%. And in auto, originations were $7 billion, down 44% from record levels a year ago due to continued lack of vehicle supply and rising rates, while loans were up 2%. Expenses of $7.7 billion were up 9% year-on-year driven by higher investments and structural expenses, partially offset by lower volume and revenue-related expenses. In terms of actual credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $761 million, reflecting net charge-offs of $611 million, down $121 million year-on-year, driven by card and a reserve build of $150 million in card driven by loan growth. Next to CIB on page 5. CIB reported net income of $3.7 billion on revenue of $11.9 billion. There were a number of notable items this quarter, including net markdowns on certain equity investments of approximately $370 million with about $345 million reflected in payments, and markdowns on the bridge book of approximately $250 million in IB revenue. Investment Banking revenue of $1.4 billion was down 61% year-on-year or down 53%, excluding the bridge book markdowns. IB fees were down 54% versus an all-time record quarter last year. We maintained our number one rank with a year-to-date wallet share of 8.1%. In advisory, fees were down 28%, reflecting a decline in announced activity, which started in the first quarter. The volatile market resulted in muted issuance in our underwriting businesses. Underwriting fees were down 53% for debt and down 77% for equity. In terms of outlook, while our existing pipeline remains healthy, conversion of the deal backlog may be challenging if the current headwinds continue. Lending revenue of $410 million was up 79% versus the prior year, driven by gains on mark-to-market hedges as well as higher loan balances. Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $7.8 billion, up 15% year-on-year in both fixed income and equities against a strong quarter last year. In fixed income, elevated volatility drove both, increased client flows and robust trading results in the macro franchise, most notably in currencies and emerging markets. This was partially offset by Credit and Securitized Products in a challenging spread environment. In Equity Markets, we had a strong second quarter, and again, increased volatility produced a strong performance in derivatives. Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $218 million, largely driven by funding spread widening. Payments revenue was $1.5 billion, up 1% year-on-year or up 25%, excluding the markdowns on equity investments. The year-on-year growth was primarily driven by higher rates. Security Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 6% year-on-year, with growth in fees and higher rates more than offsetting the impact of lower market levels. Expenses of $6.7 billion were up 3% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher structural expenses and investments, largely offset by lower revenue-related compensation. Moving to Commercial Banking on page 6. The Commercial Banking reported net income of $1 billion. Revenue of $2.7 billion was up 8% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins, partially offset by lower Investment Banking revenue. Gross Investment Banking revenue of $788 million was down 32%, driven by lower debt and equity underwriting activity. Expenses of $1.2 billion were up 18% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher structural and volume and revenue-related expenses. Deposits were down 5% quarter-on-quarter, driven by migration of non-operating deposits into higher-yielding alternatives, which we expect to continue given the current rate environment. Loans were up 4% sequentially. C&I loans were up 6%, reflecting higher revolver utilization and originations across Middle Market and Corporate Client Banking. CRE loans were up 3%, driven by strong loan originations and funding in commercial term lending and real estate banking. Finally, Credit costs of $209 million were largely driven by loan growth, while net charge-offs remain historically low. And then, to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1 billion with pretax margin of 31%. For the quarter, revenue of $4.3 billion was up 5% year-on-year, driven by growth in deposits and loans as well as higher margins, partially offset by investment valuation losses versus gains in the prior year. In addition, reductions in management fees linked to this year\u2019s market declines have been almost entirely offset by the removal of most money market fund fee waivers. Expenses of $2.9 billion were up 13% year-on-year, largely driven by investments in our private banking advisory teams, technology and asset management as well as higher volume and revenue-related expenses. For the quarter, net long-term inflows of $6 billion were driven by equities. AUM of $2.7 trillion and overall client assets of $3.8 trillion, down 8% and 6% year-on-year, respectively, were predominantly driven by lower market levels, partially offset by net long-term inflows. And finally, loans were up 1% quarter-on-quarter, while deposits were down 7% sequentially, driven by seasonal client tax payments. Turning to Corporate on page 8. Corporate reported a net loss of $174 million. Revenue was $80 million versus a loss in the prior year. NII was $324 million, up $1.3 billion, predominantly due to the impact of higher rates. And expenses of $206 million were lower by $309 million year-on-year. Next, the outlook on page 9. You will recall that at Investor Day, we expected NII ex Markets for 2022 to be in excess of $56 billion. We now expect it to be in excess of $58 billion, reflecting Fed funds reaching 3.5% by year-end. We still expect adjusted expense to be approximately $77 billion and the Card net charge-off rate to be less than 2% for 2022. So to wrap up, the Company\u2019s performance was strong again this quarter in what was a complex operating environment. As we look forward, we are mindful of the elevated uncertainty in the global economy, but we feel confident that we are prepared and well positioned for a broad range of outcomes. With that, operator, please open up the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Please stand by. And the first question is coming from Steve Chubak from Wolfe Research.\nSteve Chubak: Hey. Good morning, Jeremy. Good morning, Jamie. I wanted to start off with a question on capital targets. I don\u2019t believe you\u2019ve provided an update on your firm-wide CET1 target of 12.5% to 13%. And given the new higher SCB, future increases in your G-SIB surcharge to 4.5%, your regulatory minimum is slated to increase beyond 13% by 2024, which is also beyond the horizon reflected on slide 3. And just given that high regulatory minimum, elevated SCB volatility in recent years, what do you believe is an appropriate capital target for you to manage to from here over the long term?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, Steve, good question. So, obviously, you\u2019re right in the sense that we didn\u2019t talk about 2024 on the slide. And as you note, we have two G-SIB bucket increases coming, one in the first quarter of \u201823 and the other one in the first quarter of \u201824. So, we had worked all that out on Investor Day and talked about 12.5% to 13% target, which implies sort of a modest buffer to be used flexibly based on what we expected would be some increase in SCB. Obviously, the increase came in a bit higher than expected. So, for now, we\u2019re really focused on 1Q \u201823. Of course, all else equal, you would assume that that 12.5% to 13% for 2024 would be a little bit higher. But there is another round of SCB, and that\u2019s a long way away. And as you know, and as you can see, there\u2019s a lot of organic capital generation. So, we\u2019ll kind of cross that bridge when we come to it.\nJamie Dimon: We intend to drive that SCB down by reducing the things that created it.\nSteve Chubak: Fair enough. And just for my follow-up on the loan growth outlook. Loan growth continues to surprise positively. Certainly, the tone, Jeremy, that you conveyed was quite constructive, despite the challenging macro backdrop. But with companies just citing higher inventory levels, declining personal savings rates, growing inflationary pressures, whole list of potential headwinds that could negatively impact loan growth from here, I was hoping you could just speak to the outlook for loan growth across some of the different businesses? And what do you see as a sustainable run rate of loan growth over the medium term?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. So, we\u2019ve talked, as you know, Steve, about sort of a mid -- high single digits loan growth expectation for this year. And that outlook is more or less still in place. Obviously, we only have half the year left. We continue to see quite robust C&I growth, both higher revolver utilization and new account origination. We\u2019re also seeing good growth in CRE. And of course, we continue to see very robust card loan growth, which is nice to see. Outlook beyond this year, I\u2019m not going to give now. And obviously, as you know, it\u2019s going to be very much a function of the economic environment, so.\nJamie Dimon: Yes. The only thing I would like to add is that certain loan growth is discretionary and portfolio-based, think of mortgages, and there\u2019s a good chance we\u2019re going to drive it down substantially.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI.\nGlenn Schorr: I wonder if you could just talk to how you balance it all. Meaning JPMorgan is always growth-minded. You underwrite for returns over the cycle. I get that. But given some of the potential bad stuff going on in the world that you\u2019ve noted in some of the articles you\u2019ve been in and at the conference, is there any point where that rougher outlook has you tightened the underwriting box to build capital and liquidity faster, or do you think you can get there just through what you\u2019ve laid out today on the buyback pause?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. No. So, I mean, look, I think all of these things are true at the same time, right? So, first of all, as you can see on page 3, the organic capital generation enables us to build very quickly to get to where we need to be with a nice appropriate buffer on time, if not early. At the same time, as Jamie has noted, obviously, in this moment, we\u2019re going to scrutinize even more aggressively than we always do, elements or lending, which are either low returning or have a low client nexus or both. We do that all the time anyway. But of course, in this moment, we\u2019re going to turn up the heat on that a little bit. In terms of underwriting, as you say, we do underwrite through the cycle. I think we feel comfortable with our risk appetite and our credit box. And I don\u2019t think we expect any particular change there.\nJamie Dimon: And the only thing I would add is that certain, obviously, risks that we take kind of price themselves. So, if you look at our bridge book, it\u2019s smaller than it was because we price our self out of the market. And that was a good thing because a lot of people can lose a lot of money there, and we lost a little. And so, we are very conscious of that kind of thing all the time.\nGlenn Schorr: I appreciate that. And did you all consider a CECL reserve and increasing the probability to the poor scenario in this quarter? And just curious on how you thought about that. Thanks.\nJamie Dimon: Yes, but we didn\u2019t do it. And obviously, what we do in the future quarters will remain to be seen.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. And Glenn, just remember that we did do that last quarter, right? So, we already introduced a sort of skew to the outlook beyond what\u2019s implied by the market to reflect our own slightly more negative view. And in a sense, arguably, we were sort of early on that. So, it really wasn\u2019t necessary this quarter.\nOperator: The next question is coming from John McDonald from Autonomous Research.\nJohn McDonald: Jeremy, I was wondering if you could talk about the deposit trends you\u2019re seeing, the differences between commercial deposits, wealth management and retail in terms of flows and repricing pressures.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, great question, John. And I think you\u2019re right to break it down by the different segments because we are seeing different dynamics there. So, on the wholesale side, you do see some lower deposits, some deposit attrition, and that is entirely expected and part of the plan in the sense that for client reasons, we had slightly higher appetite, especially in parts of the commercial bank for non-operating deposits, knowing fully that our pricing strategy, as rates went up, was going to be to not pay up. And therefore, we expected the attrition from those -- from that client base. And so, we\u2019re seeing that, and that\u2019s actually something that we want, all else equal. And it\u2019s playing out in line with expectations. You do see a little bit of a decline or a little bit of a headwind in wealth management. I think that\u2019s just seasonal tax payments being a little bit higher than usual. And then, on the consumer side, we\u2019re really not seeing much at all. So, that remains strong, not seeing any attrition there. And it\u2019s early in the cycle to really be observing much, one way or the other from a pricing perspective.\nJohn McDonald: Okay. And then, as a follow-up, in terms of the updated NII outlook, you had talked about an exit rate in the fourth quarter of about $66 billion at Investor Day. Just kind of wondering what that looks like and what kind of fading benefit from rate ex you have assumed in your outlook?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. So, the 66 number, if you want kind of to put a number in, you can use something like 68, 68 plus, something like that. Obviously, we\u2019re annualizing one quarter. So, there can always be noise in there, but that seems like a good number to us. That\u2019s consistent with the increase for the full year. And sorry, John, can you repeat your other question?\nJamie Dimon: For \u201823.\nJohn McDonald: \u2026deposit -- yes.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, yes, yes. So, in terms of \u201823, we had talked at Investor Day about how we saw upside into 2023 from that fourth quarter run rate. And that more or less remains true. There is some upside. Obviously, we\u2019re starting from a higher launch point, higher rates and less so after the CPI trend, but there have been moments where there were cuts in the 2023 Fed expectations. So, that could have some impact on the dynamic. Obviously, this is all in an environment very volatile implied, but the core view of some upside from that fourth quarter run rate into 2023 is still in place.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Jamie, you mentioned just on the SCB earlier that you intended to reduce it by reducing the things that caused it to rise. Could you give us a sense as to what you saw in the results that you got that drove that SCB up? Because I talked to folks that say it\u2019s a black box. So, it would be helpful to understand what you see as what the drivers were to that SCB increase.\nJamie Dimon: First of all, it\u2019s public. So, you can actually go see what drives it, the global market shock and credit loss and stuff like that. And we don\u2019t agree with the stress test. It\u2019s inconsistent. It\u2019s not transparent. It\u2019s too volatile. It\u2019s basically capricious arbitrary. We do 100 a week. This is one. And I need to drive capital up and down by 80 basis points. So, we\u2019ll work on it. We haven\u2019t made definitive decisions. But I\u2019ve already mentioned about we dramatically reduced RWA this quarter. We may do that again next quarter. We\u2019re probably going to drive down mortgages, and we\u2019ll probably drive that other credit too that creates SCB. So, I could go into specifics on that. It\u2019s easy for us to do. You\u2019ve seen us do it before. We\u2019re going to drive out non-IP deposits. It creates no risk to us, but as the G-SIFI and all various things. And so, we\u2019re going to manage the balance sheet, get good returns, have great clients and not worry about it. We just want to get there right away. I don\u2019t want to sit there and dawdle. That\u2019s the rule. They gave it to us. We\u2019re going.\nJeremy Barnum: Hey Betsy. Maybe I\u2019ll just jump in a little bit on the black box.\nJamie Dimon: There\u2019s another very important point for shareholders. That number, when they -- that doesn\u2019t even remotely -- the stress loss doesn\u2019t even remotely represent what happened under that kind of scenario. And I\u2019m not saying the Fed says it should or shouldn\u2019t. But I would tell you, we\u2019d make money under that scenario. We wouldn\u2019t lose. I think they had us losing $44 billion. There\u2019s almost no chance that that would be true. And I just -- and I feel bad for the shareholders because people look at that and say, well, what\u2019s going to happen? And there\u2019s good evidence. We didn\u2019t lose money after Lehmann. We didn\u2019t lose money in the great -- what just happened. We didn\u2019t lose money, great financial recession. The Company has got huge underlying earnings power and consistent revenues in CCB, asset management, custody, payment services. And then, we have some kind of fairly volatile streams. Now, we\u2019ve got the CECL, which obviously can go up or down quite a bit. But again, that\u2019s an accounting entry. And so, we feel in very good shape. We just have to hold a higher number now, and we\u2019re going to go there.\nJeremy Barnum: And Betsy, maybe I\u2019ll just comment briefly on the black box point because as Jamie noted, the SCB is quite volatile, and I think you see that across the industry. And it\u2019s -- you have to -- we feel very good about building quickly enough to meet the higher requirements, but there are pretty big changes that come into effect fairly quickly for banks, and I think that\u2019s probably not healthy. And the amount of transparency, there is a lot of information released, as Jamie says. But since the SCB is really a quantity that gets measured to the peak drawdown period, and that information does not get released, it winds up being really very hard at any given moment to understand what\u2019s actually driving it. And that combination of suboptimal transparency and high volatility is really our central criticism, I guess, I would say. But nonetheless, you got capital generation...\nJamie Dimon: This got bad effects for the economy because -- I just said, we\u2019re going to drive down this and drive down. It\u2019s not good for the United States economy. And the mortgage business in particular is bad for lower income mortgages, which hurts lower income, minorities and stuff like that because we haven\u2019t fixed the mortgage business, and now we\u2019re making it worse. There\u2019s no real risk in it, not a benefit to JPMorgan, but it hurts this country, and it\u2019s very unfortunate.\nBetsy Graseck: I hear you on all that. And the mortgage comment you made earlier was about shrinking mortgage growth rates or shrinking the balances of mortgages that you have on the books?\nJamie Dimon: The balance -- well, no, we\u2019ll originate but the balances in the books will probably come down. And look, we reserve the right to change that. But that\u2019s a portfolio decision. And if it doesn\u2019t make sense to own mortgages, we\u2019re not going to own them.\nBetsy Graseck: Yes. And would you reduce the buffer? I mean, in the past, Jamie, you\u2019ve talked about, hey, as these required capital ratios increase relative to the risk in your business, staying more consistent than you\u2019ve said before that you may operate with less of a buffer. Could you unpack that a little bit?\nJamie Dimon: We\u2019re going to keep a buffer -- I\u2019m not even sure what the SCB means at this point. We\u2019re not going to go below any regulatory minimum. And if we have to, we\u2019ll just drive down credit more to where we got to create. It\u2019s a terrible way to run a financial system. And we owe you more on what we think that buffer should be because we have so much -- what I think is so much excess capital. It just causes a huge confusion about what you should be doing with your capital. But keep in mind, one thing, we\u2019re earning 70% of tangible equity. We can continue doing that. The Company is in great shape. We\u2019re going to serve our clients and manage the hell out of the rest of the stuff. We still think we have great businesses and stuff like that. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. Most of this stuff doesn\u2019t create any additional risk at all. It just creates capital.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities.\nJim Mitchell: Maybe just on expenses. If I kind of look at the first half with the slowdown in investment banking, I think you\u2019re annualized less than $76 billion, but you\u2019re still targeting $77 billion. Is that implication of just higher investment spend in the second half or just uncertainty around getting the pipeline completed or not and just assuming it might get done until we know better?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, Jim, good question. We\u2019ve looked at that, too. It\u2019s definitely more of the former than the latter. In other words, $77 billion is the number that we see right now and the number that we believe. And we can see in our outlook a bunch of factors driving up second half expense, including deal, M&A closing and adding to the run rate as well as continued execution of our investment plans, resulting in increased headcount, probably at a faster pace as we kind of have ramped up our hiring capacity and so on. So, I wouldn\u2019t draw any conclusions about lower than $77 billion based on the first half numbers.\nJim Mitchell: Okay, great. And then, just maybe on credit. It continues to look, I guess, very good, whether it\u2019s on the consumer side or commercial side. We don\u2019t really see it, but are you starting to see any initial cracks in credit or strains in the system?\nJeremy Barnum: Look, I think the short answer to that question is no, certainly not in any of our reported actual results for this quarter. The place that everyone...\nJamie Dimon: Excellent.\nJeremy Barnum: Right, exactly. Obviously, running still well below normal levels from the pre-pandemic period. But if you really want to kind of turn up the magnification of the microscope and look really, really, really closely, if you look at cash buffers in the lower income segments and early delinquency roll rates in those segments, you can maybe see a little bit of an early warning signal to the effect that the burn down of excess cash is a little bit faster there, buffers are still above what they were pre pandemic, but coming down, and that absolute numbers for the typical customer are not that high. And you do see those early delinquency buckets still below pre-pandemic levels, but getting closer in the lower income segment. So, if you wanted to try to look for early warning signals, that\u2019s where you would see it. But I think there\u2019s really still a big question about whether that\u2019s simply normalization or whether it\u2019s actually an early warning sign of deterioration. And for us, as you know, our portfolio is really not very exposed to that segment of the market. So, not really very significant for us.\nJim Mitchell: Right. So, prime is still holding up quite well? Thanks.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes.\nJamie Dimon: Even better.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Ken Usdin from Jefferies.\nKen Usdin: Just a follow-up on the point about managing the balance sheet and capital and RWAs. How do you think about your ability to manage the RWA output and dimensionalizing how, if at all, it might impact either the net income outcome or the ROTCE outcome as you look forward?\nJamie Dimon: Just very roughly, we have a tremendous ability to manage it. I can think we do without affecting our ROTC targets and stuff like that. Obviously, it will affect NII a little bit and capital generation a little bit of stuff like that. But all told, we\u2019re going to imagine how it will be fine.\nKen Usdin: Got it. Okay. That\u2019s a fair point. And then just second one on cards. Card revenue rate continues to slip even with the NII benefit. Obviously, you\u2019ve got the denominator increase in there, too and spend versus lend. Can you just help us understand the dynamics underneath card revenue rate and where you expect it to go from here? Thanks.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, sure. So on card revenue rate, we\u2019ve said that we thought 10% was a reasonable number for the full year, and it\u2019s running a little bit lower right now. And I think the current level -- but where is it, Michael, 9.6 or something is probably the right the right number for the full year at this point. And really, the difference is driven by a couple of factors. The main one is that while the growth in revolve is basically still in place, our view that we would see normalization and revolve balances happening towards early -- beginning of next year, that -- starting point of that did get slightly delayed by Omicron by about six weeks. And so that, all else equal\u2019s a little bit of NII headwind relative to what we\u2019d expected, but still obviously very robust\u2026\nJamie Dimon: Can I just add a little bit on -- because I know I\u2019m harping on mortgage a little here, but I just want to explain it. Because -- if you go to Europe, okay, the capital held against mortgage is like a fifth of what we have to hold here. And we can obviously manage that and standardized risk-weighted assets do not represent returns or risk. So, there are a lot of ways to manage it. And we don\u2019t have -- there\u2019s no securitization market today. So, our view would change if there was a securitization market, we might do something different. But by not owning it, buying it, sign it, hedging it, swapping it, there are a million ways to manage it without really affecting a lot of your risk of returns. And so, it\u2019s unfortunate, because I think this is all kind of a waste of time in terms of serving our clients. Our job is to serve clients through thick or thin, good or bad with what they need, how they need it. And now we spend all the time talking about these ridiculous regulatory requirements.\nJeremy Barnum: Right. So, yes, and just to finish on card. So, slightly lower NII just from the Omicron delay. And that slightly better-than-expected new client acquisition is a driver there. And then there\u2019s some subtle kind of funding effects from the higher rate environment contributing to it as well.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities.\nMike Mayo: Could you help me reconcile your words with your actions? After Investor Day, Jamie, you said a hurricane is on the horizon. But today, you\u2019re holding firm, which you\u2019re sending $7 billion expense guidance for 2022. I mean, it\u2019s like you\u2019re acting like there\u2019s sunny skies ahead. You\u2019re out buying kayaks, surfboards, wave runners just before the storm. So, is it tough times or not?\nJamie Dimon: Let me -- first of all, we run the Company -- we\u2019ve always run the Company consistently investing, doing stuff through storms. We don\u2019t like pull in and pull out and go up and go down and go into markets, out of markets through storms. We manage the Company, and you\u2019ve seen us do this consistently since I\u2019ve been at Bank One. We invest, we grow, we expand, we manage through the storm and stuff like that. And so what I -- and I mentioned to all of you on the media call, but there are very good current numbers taking place. Consumers are in good shape. They\u2019re spending money. They have more income. Jobs are plentiful. They\u2019re spending 10% more than last year, almost 30% plus more than pre-COVID. Businesses, you talk to them, they\u2019re in good shape. They\u2019re doing fine. We\u2019ve never seen business credit be better ever like in our lifetimes. And that\u2019s the current environment. The future environment, which is not that far off, involves rates going up, maybe more than people think because of inflation, maybe stagflation, maybe soft -- there might be a soft landing. I\u2019m simply saying there\u2019s a range of potential outcomes from a soft landing to a hard landing, driven by how much rates go up, effect of quantitative tightening, the effect of volatile markets, and obviously, this terrible humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and the war and then the effect of that on food and oil and gas. And we\u2019re simply pointing out, those things make the probabilities and possibilities of these events different. It\u2019s not going to change how we run the Company. The economy will be bigger in 10 years. We\u2019re going to run the Company. We\u2019re going to serve more clients. We\u2019re going to open our branches. We\u2019re going to invest in the things, and we\u2019ll manage through that. We do -- if you look at what we do, our bridge book is way down. That was managing certain exposures. We\u2019re not in subprime fundamentally. That\u2019s managing your exposures. So, we\u2019re quite careful about how we run the risk of the Company. And if there was a reason to cut back on something we would, but not only we think it\u2019s a great business. It\u2019s got great growth prospects. It\u2019s just going to go through a storm. And in fact, going through a storm, we will -- that gives us opportunities, too. I always remind myself the economy will be a lot bigger in 10 years. We\u2019re here to serve clients through a thick or thin, and we will do that.\nMike Mayo: So clearly running the Company for the next 5 to 10 years. If we have a recession in the next 5 to 10 months, how does technology help you manage through that better, whether it\u2019s credit losses, managing for less credit losses, expenses, more flexibility or revenues may be gaining market share? What\u2019s the benefit of all these technology investments if we have a recession over the next...\nJamie Dimon: Mike, I think we gave you some examples at Investor Day, for example, AI, which we spend a lot of money on. We gave you a couple of examples, but one of them is we spent $100 million building certain risk and fraud systems so that when we process payments on the consumer side, losses are down $100 million to $200 million. Volume is way up. That\u2019s a huge benefit. I don\u2019t think it wants to stop doing that because there\u2019s a recession. And so -- and plus, in a recession, certain things get cheaper, branches are enormously -- bank are enormously probably. We\u2019re going to keep on doing those things. And we\u2019ve managed through recessions before. We\u2019ll manage it again. I\u2019m quite comfortable to do it quite well. We stop starting on recruiting or training or technology or a branch, that\u2019s crazy. We don\u2019t do that. We\u2019ve never done that. We didn\u2019t do it in \u201808 and \u201809...\nMike Mayo: The only other thing is just market revenue is a lot weaker, right? I mean the market outlook is worse. And so, we know you\u2019ve had a structural spending. So when all else equal, that would be a little bit less then.\nJamie Dimon: But that\u2019s -- yes, that\u2019s very performance-based too. And again, Mike, the way I look at it a little bit in 15 years, the global GDP -- or 20 years, the global GDP, global financial assets, global companies, companies over 5 -- $1 billion will all double. That\u2019s what we\u2019re building for. We\u2019re not building for like 18 months.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets.\nGerard Cassidy: Jeremy, you touched on the deposit commentary a short while ago. Can you elaborate on QT and the impact that you\u2019ve seen? Now granted that I know June was not full QT of $95 billion a month. But, can you guys give us a flavor? And I think, Jamie, you mentioned that -- if I heard it correctly, that maybe $300 billion to $400 billion of deposits could outflow over time, I am assuming due to QT. But can you guys elaborate what you saw in June? Is it tracking the way you think it\u2019s going to be? And any further outlook for what the deposits could be over the next 12 months due to QT?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. Hey Gerard. So, as you know, QT just started. So, I think it\u2019s not the sort of thing where you can say I expect this exact outcome and then sort of track it sector by sector, because you can see the clear impact on system-wide deposits, but that also interacts with RP and TGA and stuff like that. And so how that flows into the banking system and then to any individual bank across the wholesale and consumer segments is kind of a tricky thing. So, it\u2019s early on that. But, at a high level, and your comments to what Jamie said before are right. The story remains true, which is that depending on how QT interacts with RRP and loan growth, in particular, you could see some decline in deposits in the banking system, and we would see our share of that. But we would expect that to primarily come out of wholesale and primarily come out of the non-operating and sort of less valuable portions of our deposit base. While in consumer, while you could, in theory, have a little bit of a headwind there, we feel pretty good about our ability to keep those levels pretty steady based on the strength of the franchise and the ability to take share.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And then, as a follow-up, I don\u2019t believe you guys disclosed the outstandings in the bridge book. But two questions. And Jamie, you\u2019ve been very clear about this for the last 10 years, how you\u2019ve derisked that balance sheet, and you mentioned that already today. Can you just give us some color on how different it is today from \u201808, \u201809, just so investors know that it is meaningfully different. And second, what caused the write-down in the bridge book this quarter?\nJamie Dimon: So, if you go back to \u201807, I think, the whole Street bridge book was $480 billion. I think the whole Street bridge book today is 100 or under 100.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. It\u2019s like 20%.\nJamie Dimon: Our percent of that bridge book has come down substantially just in the last 12 months. And that\u2019s really just underlying loan by loan by loan, and you win some and you lose some. And if you guys look at high-yield spreads and stuff like that, bonds are down 6%. That\u2019s what you see. So, you have some flex, you don\u2019t have some flex. And we\u2019re big boys. We know that, and there are write-downs of a couple of bridge loans. They\u2019re not huge. They\u2019re just -- I think they were in the investment banking line.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. It\u2019s in the IB revenue line, and there\u2019s a small amount in the commercial bank as well. But as you said, Jamie, and as Daniel also mentioned at Investor Day, I think we made conscious choices here to dial back our risk appetite here and accepted some share losses in leveraged finance. So, we feel good about where we are. We\u2019re still open for business with the right deals at the right risk appetite upside on the right terms, absolutely, but we\u2019ve been careful.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Erika Najarian from UBS.\nErika Najarian: I just had a few follow-up questions. The first is on balance sheet management. Jeremy, the illustrative path that you set forth on slide 3, did that include RWA mitigation? And as we think about the $58 billion-plus in updated NII guide, what kind of deposit growth does that assume? You noted that part of the SCB mitigation is to drive out non-operating deposits. Just wanted to understand what the assumption was there as well, please.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, hey Erika, sure. So first point, you have to turn over your magnifying glass. But if you look at Footnote 5 on page 3, you can see that right at the end of there, it says, assumes flat RWA in the projection, so. And I think within that, who knows what the exact mix will be, and you\u2019ve heard Jamie\u2019s comments on that. But if you look at the table above, you see that you\u2019ve got the usual moving parts. We\u2019ve got organic loan growth that we want, that\u2019s been profitable on its own or part of important relationships that we\u2019d like to see continue to happen. Some of it is a little bit passive. We can\u2019t really control it. It moves up and down as a function of factors like war. And then there\u2019s the mitigation piece of it, which we\u2019re going to turn up the scrutiny quite intensely, as I said before, on lower returning, lower client nexus or both. So across those three bits, we\u2019ll see how it goes. But as Jamie said, we feel pretty confident here. In terms of deposits, at this point, deposit growth is probably less of a driver overall looking forward of the NII outlook. Our deposit outlook remains more or less the same that I said before and that we\u2019ve talked about at Investor Day, which is we do expect to see some attrition in wholesale. We expect consumer to be relatively stable, and we\u2019ll see how it goes.\nErika Najarian: Got it. And my follow-up question is for Jamie. Jamie, we\u2019ve heard your caution about the economy. And I think there\u2019s a bigger debate on how the U.S. consumer is going to be impacted in light or in context of a downturn. The statistics that Jeremy laid out imply a pretty healthy starting point for the consumer that you bank. And the reserve build for loan growth in card and the less than 2% loss rate in card lead us to believe that your consumer is still okay. As you think about the various scenarios and you think about the realistic range of outcomes, how does the U.S. consumer perform? Because it feels like that\u2019s the big wildcard, and we\u2019ve seen the journal term a job for recession. I just wanted to get your thoughts there.\nJamie Dimon: Yes. So first, I just want to point out that on that chart, that\u2019s not a forecast for what it is going to be at the end of the quarter. So, we\u2019re going to -- if you\u2019re going to pencil some of your models, it\u2019s 12.5% on December 31, and it\u2019ll probably be 13% at the end of the first quarter. And because obviously, we use capital for a whole bunch of different reasons. And the consumer -- I feel like a broken record. The consumer right now is in great shape. So, even we go in a recession, they\u2019re entering that recession with less leverage in far better shape than they\u2019ve been -- did in \u201808 and \u201809 and far better shape than they did even in 2020. And jobs are plentiful. Now, of course, jobs may disappear. Things happen. But they\u2019re in very good shape. And obviously, when you have recessions, it affects consumer income and consumer credit. Our credit card portfolio is prime. I mean, it\u2019s exceptional. But again, we\u2019re adults in that. We know that if you have a recession, losses will go up. We prepare for all that, and we\u2019re prepared to take it because we grow the business over time. We\u2019re not going to just immediately run out of it. And so, I think it\u2019s great the consumer is in good shape. And it\u2019s excellent that -- I\u2019d like the fact that wages are going up for people at the low end. I like the fact that jobs are plentiful. I think that\u2019s good for the average American, and we should applaud that. And so, they\u2019re in good shape, right now.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Matt O\u2019Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. The next question is coming from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.\nEbrahim Poonawala: I guess, just one for -- a couple of follow-ups, Jeremy. In terms of the markets have gone very quickly from pricing in a ton of rate hikes to potentially pricing and rate cuts next year, just talk to us like how that\u2019s informing your ALCO balance sheet management as you think about hedging downside risk from lower rates 12 to 18 months out? Like, should we expect you to add duration or do anything synthetic to protect against lower rates?\nJamie Dimon: We\u2019re going to keep that to ourselves.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. But I don\u2019t know, maybe if you want a little bit of general color about how we\u2019re thinking about the portfolio. I do think -- yes, okay. I\u2019ll keep it brief. The -- on duration, I think at this level of rates, also with very quickly cash yields being roughly not that different from 10-year yields, the question of duration adding or not is just generally less important for us. Then, the other piece of it is whether there\u2019s the opportunity to deploy cash into non-HQLA securities broadly into spread product. And obviously, spread product is more attractive right now. But as we\u2019ve been talking about a lot on this call, the priority right now is to build capital. So, that will be something for later, I would say.\nJamie Dimon: And I should just point out, the forward curve has been consistently wrong in my whole lifetime. We don\u2019t necessarily make investments based on the forward curve. And second, we\u2019ve always told you that we use the portfolio and other things to manage the broad range of outcomes, not just to try to add NII. So, if you said add NII next quarter, yes, we could do that. That would be managing the broad outcome of potential outcomes here, which is to protect the Company through all possible outcomes.\nEbrahim Poonawala: That\u2019s helpful. And just one follow-up on credit. I heard your comments on the consumer if we enter some version of a mild recession, like if you had to pick one or two areas, where do you think losses would be driven by? Is it on the commercial side? Is it CRE? Like, how do you expect that downturn to kind of play out?\nJamie Dimon: I think at Investor Day, you had a chart that showed through-the-cycle losses?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes.\nJamie Dimon: Yes. So, I mean I would just go back to that and we show -- we think through-the-cycle, loss would be for credit cards, C&I and a bunch of other things. And obviously, through-the-cycle is an average, and you can kind of double that from...\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. And that showed exceptionally low losses in wholesale. So, whether or not that\u2019s a prediction of the future or not, but yes.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Matt O\u2019Connor from Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Hi. Sorry about that. I got disconnected. Sorry if I missed this, but if we think about provisioning or reserving for a moderate recession, what\u2019s the best guess on how much that might be? I think for COVID, it was around $14 billion ex CECL. But obviously, you alluded to the consumer being better. The loan mix has changed. There\u2019s lots of puts and takes. But, how would you frame kind of total reserve build\u2026\nJamie Dimon: Let me state very simply for you. In COVID, we got to 15% unemployment within three months. And in two quarters, we added $15 billion, which we can easily handle. That is clearly -- I would put that almost out of the worst case. It will clearly be a lot less than that. And you guys can look at the things yourselves. Every 5% is another $500 million or something like that, if you change your odds, and so.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. I mean, we think the current reserve, the current allowance, we think, is conservatively appropriate for a range of scenarios. And as you know, it\u2019s already kind of skewed to the downside and there are probably some other elements of slight conservatism in there. So, we\u2019ll see how it goes. We feel that it\u2019s just appropriate and conservative at this point.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then, separately, you\u2019ve got about $14 billion of losses in OCI. Obviously, most of that flows back to capital as the bonds mature. What\u2019s kind of some good rule of thumb in terms of how quickly that comes back if rates stabilize here?\nJamie Dimon: 10 basis points a year.\nJeremy Barnum: Of CET1, yes.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Right, 10 basis points, you said?\nJeremy Barnum: 10 basis points of CET1 a year.\nJamie Dimon: [Indiscernible]\nJeremy Barnum: After -- yes, after tax.\nJamie Dimon: Basically five years. It kind of bleeds back in over 5 years.\nJeremy Barnum: Weighted average life of four or five years, yes. So, the good rule of thumb on constant rates is about 10 basis points of CET1 accretion a year.\nOperator: At the moment, there are no further questions in the queue.\nJamie Dimon: Folks, everybody, thank you very much. And we\u2019ll be talking to you in a quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Everyone, that concludes your conference call for today. You may now disconnect. Thank you all for joining and enjoy the rest of your day.",

            "name": "Jeremy Barnum",
            "content": "Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on page 1. The Firm reported net income of $8.6 billion, EPS of $2.76 on revenue of $31.6 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 17%. Touching on a few highlights. We had another quarter of strong performance in Markets, which generated revenue of nearly $8 billion. Credit is still quite healthy, and net charge-offs remain historically low. And there continue to be positive trends in loan growth across our businesses, with average loans up 7% year-on-year and 2% quarter-on-quarter. On page 2, we have some more detail. Revenue of $31.6 billion was up $235 million or 1% year-on-year. NII ex Markets was up $2.8 billion or 26%, driven by higher rates and balance sheet growth. NIR ex Markets was down $3.6 billion or 26%, largely driven by lower IB fees and higher card acquisition costs, and Markets revenue was up $1 billion or 15% year-on-year. Expenses of $18.7 billion were up $1.1 billion or 6% year-on-year, predominantly on higher investments and structural expenses, partially offset by lower volume and revenue-related expenses. And credit costs were $1.1 billion, which included net charge-offs of $657 million and reserve builds of $428 million, reflecting loan growth as well as a modest deterioration in the economic outlook. On to balance sheet and capital on page 3. Let's start by talking about our plans for capital management over the coming quarters. The new 4% SCB will raise our standardized CET1 requirement to 12% effective in the fourth quarter, and the 4% G-SIB effective in 1Q \u201823 further raises this requirement to 12.5%. At Investor Day, we said that we expected SCB to be higher and made it clear that in the near term, share buybacks would be significantly reduced in order to build capital for the increased requirements. In light of the SCB coming in even higher than expected, we have paused buybacks for the near term. As we discussed at Investor Day and as we show at the bottom of this presentation page, our organic capital generation allows us to rapidly build capital in excess of future requirements with a current target of roughly 12.5% in the fourth quarter. Any access over the regulatory requirements offers us protection against a range of economic scenarios with room to deploy capital in line with our strategic priorities. We have a long established track record of balance sheet discipline across the Company, and this quarter's RWA reduction shows evidence of this discipline. Turning to this quarter's results, you can see that our CET1 ratio of 12.2% is up 30 basis points from the prior quarter. Our RWA was down approximately $44 billion with growth in franchise lending being more than offset by the combination of active balance sheet management and the normalization of market risk RWA from the first quarter. CET1 capital was slightly down as earnings were offset by distributions and the impact of AOCI drawdowns in our AFS portfolio. Now let's go to our businesses, starting with Consumer & Community Banking on page 4. Before I review CCB's performance, let me touch on what we're seeing in our data regarding the health of the U.S. consumer. Spend is still healthy with combined debit and credit spend up 15% year-on-year. We see the impact of inflation and higher nondiscretionary spend across income segments. Notably, the average consumer is spending 35% more year-on-year on gas and approximately 6% more on recurring bills and other nondiscretionary categories. At the same time, we have yet to observe a pullback in discretionary spending, including in the lower income segments, with travel and dining growing a robust 34% year-on-year overall. And with spending growing faster than incomes, median deposit balances are down across income segments for the first time since the pandemic started, though cash buffers still remain elevated. With that as a backdrop, this quarter, CCB reported net income of $3.1 billion on revenue of $12.6 billion, which was down 1% year-on-year. In Consumer and Business Banking, revenue was up 9% year-on-year, driven by growth in deposits. Deposits were up 13% year-on-year and 2% quarter-on-quarter. And client investment assets were down 7% year-on-year, driven by market performance, partially offset by flows. Home Lending revenue was down 26% year-on-year as the rate environment drove both, lower production revenue and tighter spreads, partially offset by higher net servicing revenue. And mortgage origination volume of $22 billion was down 45%. Moving to Card & Auto. Revenue was down 6% year-on-year, reflecting higher acquisition costs on strong new card account originations and lower auto lease income, largely offset by higher card NII. Card outstandings were up 16%, and revolving balances were up 9%. And in auto, originations were $7 billion, down 44% from record levels a year ago due to continued lack of vehicle supply and rising rates, while loans were up 2%. Expenses of $7.7 billion were up 9% year-on-year driven by higher investments and structural expenses, partially offset by lower volume and revenue-related expenses. In terms of actual credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $761 million, reflecting net charge-offs of $611 million, down $121 million year-on-year, driven by card and a reserve build of $150 million in card driven by loan growth. Next to CIB on page 5. CIB reported net income of $3.7 billion on revenue of $11.9 billion. There were a number of notable items this quarter, including net markdowns on certain equity investments of approximately $370 million with about $345 million reflected in payments, and markdowns on the bridge book of approximately $250 million in IB revenue. Investment Banking revenue of $1.4 billion was down 61% year-on-year or down 53%, excluding the bridge book markdowns. IB fees were down 54% versus an all-time record quarter last year. We maintained our number one rank with a year-to-date wallet share of 8.1%. In advisory, fees were down 28%, reflecting a decline in announced activity, which started in the first quarter. The volatile market resulted in muted issuance in our underwriting businesses. Underwriting fees were down 53% for debt and down 77% for equity. In terms of outlook, while our existing pipeline remains healthy, conversion of the deal backlog may be challenging if the current headwinds continue. Lending revenue of $410 million was up 79% versus the prior year, driven by gains on mark-to-market hedges as well as higher loan balances. Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $7.8 billion, up 15% year-on-year in both fixed income and equities against a strong quarter last year. In fixed income, elevated volatility drove both, increased client flows and robust trading results in the macro franchise, most notably in currencies and emerging markets. This was partially offset by Credit and Securitized Products in a challenging spread environment. In Equity Markets, we had a strong second quarter, and again, increased volatility produced a strong performance in derivatives. Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $218 million, largely driven by funding spread widening. Payments revenue was $1.5 billion, up 1% year-on-year or up 25%, excluding the markdowns on equity investments. The year-on-year growth was primarily driven by higher rates. Security Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 6% year-on-year, with growth in fees and higher rates more than offsetting the impact of lower market levels. Expenses of $6.7 billion were up 3% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher structural expenses and investments, largely offset by lower revenue-related compensation. Moving to Commercial Banking on page 6. The Commercial Banking reported net income of $1 billion. Revenue of $2.7 billion was up 8% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins, partially offset by lower Investment Banking revenue. Gross Investment Banking revenue of $788 million was down 32%, driven by lower debt and equity underwriting activity. Expenses of $1.2 billion were up 18% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher structural and volume and revenue-related expenses. Deposits were down 5% quarter-on-quarter, driven by migration of non-operating deposits into higher-yielding alternatives, which we expect to continue given the current rate environment. Loans were up 4% sequentially. C&I loans were up 6%, reflecting higher revolver utilization and originations across Middle Market and Corporate Client Banking. CRE loans were up 3%, driven by strong loan originations and funding in commercial term lending and real estate banking. Finally, Credit costs of $209 million were largely driven by loan growth, while net charge-offs remain historically low. And then, to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1 billion with pretax margin of 31%. For the quarter, revenue of $4.3 billion was up 5% year-on-year, driven by growth in deposits and loans as well as higher margins, partially offset by investment valuation losses versus gains in the prior year. In addition, reductions in management fees linked to this year's market declines have been almost entirely offset by the removal of most money market fund fee waivers. Expenses of $2.9 billion were up 13% year-on-year, largely driven by investments in our private banking advisory teams, technology and asset management as well as higher volume and revenue-related expenses. For the quarter, net long-term inflows of $6 billion were driven by equities. AUM of $2.7 trillion and overall client assets of $3.8 trillion, down 8% and 6% year-on-year, respectively, were predominantly driven by lower market levels, partially offset by net long-term inflows. And finally, loans were up 1% quarter-on-quarter, while deposits were down 7% sequentially, driven by seasonal client tax payments. Turning to Corporate on page 8. Corporate reported a net loss of $174 million. Revenue was $80 million versus a loss in the prior year. NII was $324 million, up $1.3 billion, predominantly due to the impact of higher rates. And expenses of $206 million were lower by $309 million year-on-year. Next, the outlook on page 9. You will recall that at Investor Day, we expected NII ex Markets for 2022 to be in excess of $56 billion. We now expect it to be in excess of $58 billion, reflecting Fed funds reaching 3.5% by year-end. We still expect adjusted expense to be approximately $77 billion and the Card net charge-off rate to be less than 2% for 2022. So to wrap up, the Company's performance was strong again this quarter in what was a complex operating environment. As we look forward, we are mindful of the elevated uncertainty in the global economy, but we feel confident that we are prepared and well positioned for a broad range of outcomes. With that, operator, please open up the line for Q&A. Yes, Steve, good question. So, obviously, you're right in the sense that we didn't talk about 2024 on the slide. And as you note, we have two G-SIB bucket increases coming, one in the first quarter of \u201823 and the other one in the first quarter of \u201824. So, we had worked all that out on Investor Day and talked about 12.5% to 13% target, which implies sort of a modest buffer to be used flexibly based on what we expected would be some increase in SCB. Obviously, the increase came in a bit higher than expected. So, for now, we're really focused on 1Q \u201823. Of course, all else equal, you would assume that that 12.5% to 13% for 2024 would be a little bit higher. But there is another round of SCB, and that's a long way away. And as you know, and as you can see, there's a lot of organic capital generation. So, we'll kind of cross that bridge when we come to it. Yes. So, we've talked, as you know, Steve, about sort of a mid -- high single digits loan growth expectation for this year. And that outlook is more or less still in place. Obviously, we only have half the year left. We continue to see quite robust C&I growth, both higher revolver utilization and new account origination. We're also seeing good growth in CRE. And of course, we continue to see very robust card loan growth, which is nice to see. Outlook beyond this year, I'm not going to give now. And obviously, as you know, it's going to be very much a function of the economic environment, so. Yes. No. So, I mean, look, I think all of these things are true at the same time, right? So, first of all, as you can see on page 3, the organic capital generation enables us to build very quickly to get to where we need to be with a nice appropriate buffer on time, if not early. At the same time, as Jamie has noted, obviously, in this moment, we're going to scrutinize even more aggressively than we always do, elements or lending, which are either low returning or have a low client nexus or both. We do that all the time anyway. But of course, in this moment, we're going to turn up the heat on that a little bit. In terms of underwriting, as you say, we do underwrite through the cycle. I think we feel comfortable with our risk appetite and our credit box. And I don't think we expect any particular change there. Yes. And Glenn, just remember that we did do that last quarter, right? So, we already introduced a sort of skew to the outlook beyond what's implied by the market to reflect our own slightly more negative view. And in a sense, arguably, we were sort of early on that. So, it really wasn't necessary this quarter. Yes, great question, John. And I think you're right to break it down by the different segments because we are seeing different dynamics there. So, on the wholesale side, you do see some lower deposits, some deposit attrition, and that is entirely expected and part of the plan in the sense that for client reasons, we had slightly higher appetite, especially in parts of the commercial bank for non-operating deposits, knowing fully that our pricing strategy, as rates went up, was going to be to not pay up. And therefore, we expected the attrition from those -- from that client base. And so, we're seeing that, and that's actually something that we want, all else equal. And it's playing out in line with expectations. You do see a little bit of a decline or a little bit of a headwind in wealth management. I think that's just seasonal tax payments being a little bit higher than usual. And then, on the consumer side, we're really not seeing much at all. So, that remains strong, not seeing any attrition there. And it's early in the cycle to really be observing much, one way or the other from a pricing perspective. Yes. So, the 66 number, if you want kind of to put a number in, you can use something like 68, 68 plus, something like that. Obviously, we're annualizing one quarter. So, there can always be noise in there, but that seems like a good number to us. That's consistent with the increase for the full year. And sorry, John, can you repeat your other question? Yes, yes, yes. So, in terms of \u201823, we had talked at Investor Day about how we saw upside into 2023 from that fourth quarter run rate. And that more or less remains true. There is some upside. Obviously, we're starting from a higher launch point, higher rates and less so after the CPI trend, but there have been moments where there were cuts in the 2023 Fed expectations. So, that could have some impact on the dynamic. Obviously, this is all in an environment very volatile implied, but the core view of some upside from that fourth quarter run rate into 2023 is still in place. Hey Betsy. Maybe I'll just jump in a little bit on the black box. And Betsy, maybe I'll just comment briefly on the black box point because as Jamie noted, the SCB is quite volatile, and I think you see that across the industry. And it's -- you have to -- we feel very good about building quickly enough to meet the higher requirements, but there are pretty big changes that come into effect fairly quickly for banks, and I think that's probably not healthy. And the amount of transparency, there is a lot of information released, as Jamie says. But since the SCB is really a quantity that gets measured to the peak drawdown period, and that information does not get released, it winds up being really very hard at any given moment to understand what's actually driving it. And that combination of suboptimal transparency and high volatility is really our central criticism, I guess, I would say. But nonetheless, you got capital generation... Yes, Jim, good question. We've looked at that, too. It's definitely more of the former than the latter. In other words, $77 billion is the number that we see right now and the number that we believe. And we can see in our outlook a bunch of factors driving up second half expense, including deal, M&A closing and adding to the run rate as well as continued execution of our investment plans, resulting in increased headcount, probably at a faster pace as we kind of have ramped up our hiring capacity and so on. So, I wouldn't draw any conclusions about lower than $77 billion based on the first half numbers. Look, I think the short answer to that question is no, certainly not in any of our reported actual results for this quarter. The place that everyone... Right, exactly. Obviously, running still well below normal levels from the pre-pandemic period. But if you really want to kind of turn up the magnification of the microscope and look really, really, really closely, if you look at cash buffers in the lower income segments and early delinquency roll rates in those segments, you can maybe see a little bit of an early warning signal to the effect that the burn down of excess cash is a little bit faster there, buffers are still above what they were pre pandemic, but coming down, and that absolute numbers for the typical customer are not that high. And you do see those early delinquency buckets still below pre-pandemic levels, but getting closer in the lower income segment. So, if you wanted to try to look for early warning signals, that's where you would see it. But I think there's really still a big question about whether that's simply normalization or whether it's actually an early warning sign of deterioration. And for us, as you know, our portfolio is really not very exposed to that segment of the market. So, not really very significant for us. Yes. Yes, sure. So on card revenue rate, we've said that we thought 10% was a reasonable number for the full year, and it's running a little bit lower right now. And I think the current level -- but where is it, Michael, 9.6 or something is probably the right the right number for the full year at this point. And really, the difference is driven by a couple of factors. The main one is that while the growth in revolve is basically still in place, our view that we would see normalization and revolve balances happening towards early -- beginning of next year, that -- starting point of that did get slightly delayed by Omicron by about six weeks. And so that, all else equal's a little bit of NII headwind relative to what we'd expected, but still obviously very robust... Right. So, yes, and just to finish on card. So, slightly lower NII just from the Omicron delay. And that slightly better-than-expected new client acquisition is a driver there. And then there's some subtle kind of funding effects from the higher rate environment contributing to it as well. Yes. Hey Gerard. So, as you know, QT just started. So, I think it's not the sort of thing where you can say I expect this exact outcome and then sort of track it sector by sector, because you can see the clear impact on system-wide deposits, but that also interacts with RP and TGA and stuff like that. And so how that flows into the banking system and then to any individual bank across the wholesale and consumer segments is kind of a tricky thing. So, it's early on that. But, at a high level, and your comments to what Jamie said before are right. The story remains true, which is that depending on how QT interacts with RRP and loan growth, in particular, you could see some decline in deposits in the banking system, and we would see our share of that. But we would expect that to primarily come out of wholesale and primarily come out of the non-operating and sort of less valuable portions of our deposit base. While in consumer, while you could, in theory, have a little bit of a headwind there, we feel pretty good about our ability to keep those levels pretty steady based on the strength of the franchise and the ability to take share. Yes. It's like 20%. Yes. It's in the IB revenue line, and there's a small amount in the commercial bank as well. But as you said, Jamie, and as Daniel also mentioned at Investor Day, I think we made conscious choices here to dial back our risk appetite here and accepted some share losses in leveraged finance. So, we feel good about where we are. We're still open for business with the right deals at the right risk appetite upside on the right terms, absolutely, but we've been careful. Yes, hey Erika, sure. So first point, you have to turn over your magnifying glass. But if you look at Footnote 5 on page 3, you can see that right at the end of there, it says, assumes flat RWA in the projection, so. And I think within that, who knows what the exact mix will be, and you've heard Jamie's comments on that. But if you look at the table above, you see that you've got the usual moving parts. We've got organic loan growth that we want, that's been profitable on its own or part of important relationships that we'd like to see continue to happen. Some of it is a little bit passive. We can't really control it. It moves up and down as a function of factors like war. And then there's the mitigation piece of it, which we're going to turn up the scrutiny quite intensely, as I said before, on lower returning, lower client nexus or both. So across those three bits, we'll see how it goes. But as Jamie said, we feel pretty confident here. In terms of deposits, at this point, deposit growth is probably less of a driver overall looking forward of the NII outlook. Our deposit outlook remains more or less the same that I said before and that we've talked about at Investor Day, which is we do expect to see some attrition in wholesale. We expect consumer to be relatively stable, and we'll see how it goes. Yes. But I don't know, maybe if you want a little bit of general color about how we're thinking about the portfolio. I do think -- yes, okay. I'll keep it brief. The -- on duration, I think at this level of rates, also with very quickly cash yields being roughly not that different from 10-year yields, the question of duration adding or not is just generally less important for us. Then, the other piece of it is whether there's the opportunity to deploy cash into non-HQLA securities broadly into spread product. And obviously, spread product is more attractive right now. But as we've been talking about a lot on this call, the priority right now is to build capital. So, that will be something for later, I would say. Yes. Yes. And that showed exceptionally low losses in wholesale. So, whether or not that's a prediction of the future or not, but yes. Yes. I mean, we think the current reserve, the current allowance, we think, is conservatively appropriate for a range of scenarios. And as you know, it's already kind of skewed to the downside and there are probably some other elements of slight conservatism in there. So, we'll see how it goes. We feel that it's just appropriate and conservative at this point. Of CET1, yes. 10 basis points of CET1 a year. After -- yes, after tax. Weighted average life of four or five years, yes. So, the good rule of thumb on constant rates is about 10 basis points of CET1 accretion a year."

            "name": "Jamie Dimon",
            "content": "We intend to drive that SCB down by reducing the things that created it. Yes. The only thing I would like to add is that certain loan growth is discretionary and portfolio-based, think of mortgages, and there's a good chance we're going to drive it down substantially. And the only thing I would add is that certain, obviously, risks that we take kind of price themselves. So, if you look at our bridge book, it's smaller than it was because we price our self out of the market. And that was a good thing because a lot of people can lose a lot of money there, and we lost a little. And so, we are very conscious of that kind of thing all the time. Yes, but we didn't do it. And obviously, what we do in the future quarters will remain to be seen. For \u201823. First of all, it's public. So, you can actually go see what drives it, the global market shock and credit loss and stuff like that. And we don't agree with the stress test. It's inconsistent. It's not transparent. It's too volatile. It's basically capricious arbitrary. We do 100 a week. This is one. And I need to drive capital up and down by 80 basis points. So, we'll work on it. We haven't made definitive decisions. But I've already mentioned about we dramatically reduced RWA this quarter. We may do that again next quarter. We're probably going to drive down mortgages, and we'll probably drive that other credit too that creates SCB. So, I could go into specifics on that. It's easy for us to do. You've seen us do it before. We're going to drive out non-IP deposits. It creates no risk to us, but as the G-SIFI and all various things. And so, we're going to manage the balance sheet, get good returns, have great clients and not worry about it. We just want to get there right away. I don't want to sit there and dawdle. That's the rule. They gave it to us. We're going. There's another very important point for shareholders. That number, when they -- that doesn't even remotely -- the stress loss doesn't even remotely represent what happened under that kind of scenario. And I'm not saying the Fed says it should or shouldn't. But I would tell you, we'd make money under that scenario. We wouldn't lose. I think they had us losing $44 billion. There's almost no chance that that would be true. And I just -- and I feel bad for the shareholders because people look at that and say, well, what's going to happen? And there's good evidence. We didn't lose money after Lehmann. We didn't lose money in the great -- what just happened. We didn't lose money, great financial recession. The Company has got huge underlying earnings power and consistent revenues in CCB, asset management, custody, payment services. And then, we have some kind of fairly volatile streams. Now, we've got the CECL, which obviously can go up or down quite a bit. But again, that's an accounting entry. And so, we feel in very good shape. We just have to hold a higher number now, and we're going to go there. This got bad effects for the economy because -- I just said, we're going to drive down this and drive down. It's not good for the United States economy. And the mortgage business in particular is bad for lower income mortgages, which hurts lower income, minorities and stuff like that because we haven't fixed the mortgage business, and now we're making it worse. There's no real risk in it, not a benefit to JPMorgan, but it hurts this country, and it's very unfortunate. The balance -- well, no, we'll originate but the balances in the books will probably come down. And look, we reserve the right to change that. But that's a portfolio decision. And if it doesn't make sense to own mortgages, we're not going to own them. We're going to keep a buffer -- I'm not even sure what the SCB means at this point. We're not going to go below any regulatory minimum. And if we have to, we'll just drive down credit more to where we got to create. It's a terrible way to run a financial system. And we owe you more on what we think that buffer should be because we have so much -- what I think is so much excess capital. It just causes a huge confusion about what you should be doing with your capital. But keep in mind, one thing, we're earning 70% of tangible equity. We can continue doing that. The Company is in great shape. We're going to serve our clients and manage the hell out of the rest of the stuff. We still think we have great businesses and stuff like that. And that's what we're going to do. Most of this stuff doesn't create any additional risk at all. It just creates capital. Excellent. Even better. Just very roughly, we have a tremendous ability to manage it. I can think we do without affecting our ROTC targets and stuff like that. Obviously, it will affect NII a little bit and capital generation a little bit of stuff like that. But all told, we're going to imagine how it will be fine. Can I just add a little bit on -- because I know I'm harping on mortgage a little here, but I just want to explain it. Because -- if you go to Europe, okay, the capital held against mortgage is like a fifth of what we have to hold here. And we can obviously manage that and standardized risk-weighted assets do not represent returns or risk. So, there are a lot of ways to manage it. And we don't have -- there's no securitization market today. So, our view would change if there was a securitization market, we might do something different. But by not owning it, buying it, sign it, hedging it, swapping it, there are a million ways to manage it without really affecting a lot of your risk of returns. And so, it's unfortunate, because I think this is all kind of a waste of time in terms of serving our clients. Our job is to serve clients through thick or thin, good or bad with what they need, how they need it. And now we spend all the time talking about these ridiculous regulatory requirements. Let me -- first of all, we run the Company -- we've always run the Company consistently investing, doing stuff through storms. We don't like pull in and pull out and go up and go down and go into markets, out of markets through storms. We manage the Company, and you've seen us do this consistently since I've been at Bank One. We invest, we grow, we expand, we manage through the storm and stuff like that. And so what I -- and I mentioned to all of you on the media call, but there are very good current numbers taking place. Consumers are in good shape. They're spending money. They have more income. Jobs are plentiful. They're spending 10% more than last year, almost 30% plus more than pre-COVID. Businesses, you talk to them, they're in good shape. They're doing fine. We've never seen business credit be better ever like in our lifetimes. And that's the current environment. The future environment, which is not that far off, involves rates going up, maybe more than people think because of inflation, maybe stagflation, maybe soft -- there might be a soft landing. I'm simply saying there's a range of potential outcomes from a soft landing to a hard landing, driven by how much rates go up, effect of quantitative tightening, the effect of volatile markets, and obviously, this terrible humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and the war and then the effect of that on food and oil and gas. And we're simply pointing out, those things make the probabilities and possibilities of these events different. It's not going to change how we run the Company. The economy will be bigger in 10 years. We're going to run the Company. We're going to serve more clients. We're going to open our branches. We're going to invest in the things, and we'll manage through that. We do -- if you look at what we do, our bridge book is way down. That was managing certain exposures. We're not in subprime fundamentally. That's managing your exposures. So, we're quite careful about how we run the risk of the Company. And if there was a reason to cut back on something we would, but not only we think it's a great business. It's got great growth prospects. It's just going to go through a storm. And in fact, going through a storm, we will -- that gives us opportunities, too. I always remind myself the economy will be a lot bigger in 10 years. We're here to serve clients through a thick or thin, and we will do that. Mike, I think we gave you some examples at Investor Day, for example, AI, which we spend a lot of money on. We gave you a couple of examples, but one of them is we spent $100 million building certain risk and fraud systems so that when we process payments on the consumer side, losses are down $100 million to $200 million. Volume is way up. That's a huge benefit. I don't think it wants to stop doing that because there's a recession. And so -- and plus, in a recession, certain things get cheaper, branches are enormously -- bank are enormously probably. We're going to keep on doing those things. And we've managed through recessions before. We'll manage it again. I'm quite comfortable to do it quite well. We stop starting on recruiting or training or technology or a branch, that's crazy. We don't do that. We've never done that. We didn't do it in \u201808 and \u201809... But that's -- yes, that's very performance-based too. And again, Mike, the way I look at it a little bit in 15 years, the global GDP -- or 20 years, the global GDP, global financial assets, global companies, companies over 5 -- $1 billion will all double. That's what we're building for. We're not building for like 18 months. So, if you go back to \u201807, I think, the whole Street bridge book was $480 billion. I think the whole Street bridge book today is 100 or under 100. Our percent of that bridge book has come down substantially just in the last 12 months. And that's really just underlying loan by loan by loan, and you win some and you lose some. And if you guys look at high-yield spreads and stuff like that, bonds are down 6%. That's what you see. So, you have some flex, you don't have some flex. And we're big boys. We know that, and there are write-downs of a couple of bridge loans. They're not huge. They're just -- I think they were in the investment banking line. Yes. So first, I just want to point out that on that chart, that's not a forecast for what it is going to be at the end of the quarter. So, we're going to -- if you're going to pencil some of your models, it's 12.5% on December 31, and it'll probably be 13% at the end of the first quarter. And because obviously, we use capital for a whole bunch of different reasons. And the consumer -- I feel like a broken record. The consumer right now is in great shape. So, even we go in a recession, they're entering that recession with less leverage in far better shape than they've been -- did in \u201808 and \u201809 and far better shape than they did even in 2020. And jobs are plentiful. Now, of course, jobs may disappear. Things happen. But they're in very good shape. And obviously, when you have recessions, it affects consumer income and consumer credit. Our credit card portfolio is prime. I mean, it's exceptional. But again, we're adults in that. We know that if you have a recession, losses will go up. We prepare for all that, and we're prepared to take it because we grow the business over time. We're not going to just immediately run out of it. And so, I think it's great the consumer is in good shape. And it's excellent that -- I'd like the fact that wages are going up for people at the low end. I like the fact that jobs are plentiful. I think that's good for the average American, and we should applaud that. And so, they're in good shape, right now. We're going to keep that to ourselves. And I should just point out, the forward curve has been consistently wrong in my whole lifetime. We don't necessarily make investments based on the forward curve. And second, we've always told you that we use the portfolio and other things to manage the broad range of outcomes, not just to try to add NII. So, if you said add NII next quarter, yes, we could do that. That would be managing the broad outcome of potential outcomes here, which is to protect the Company through all possible outcomes. I think at Investor Day, you had a chart that showed through-the-cycle losses? Yes. So, I mean I would just go back to that and we show -- we think through-the-cycle, loss would be for credit cards, C&I and a bunch of other things. And obviously, through-the-cycle is an average, and you can kind of double that from... Let me state very simply for you. In COVID, we got to 15% unemployment within three months. And in two quarters, we added $15 billion, which we can easily handle. That is clearly -- I would put that almost out of the worst case. It will clearly be a lot less than that. And you guys can look at the things yourselves. Every 5% is another $500 million or something like that, if you change your odds, and so. 10 basis points a year. [Indiscernible] Basically five years. It kind of bleeds back in over 5 years. Folks, everybody, thank you very much. And we'll be talking to you in a quarter."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please standby. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.\nJeremy Barnum: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $8.3 billion, EPS of $2.63 on revenue of $31.6 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 16%. These results include approximately $900 million of credit reserve builds, which I'll cover in more detail shortly, as well as $500 million of losses in Credit Adjustments & Other in CIB. Regarding loan growth. We're continuing to see positive trends with loans up 8% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter ex PPP with the sequential growth driven by a continued pickup in demand in our Wholesale businesses, including ongoing strength in AWM. On Page 2, we have some more detail on our results. Revenue of $31.6 billion was down $1.5 billion or 5% year-on-year. NII ex Markets was up $1 billion or 9% on balance sheet growth and higher rates, partially offset by lower NII from PPP loans. NIR ex Markets was down $2.2 billion or 17% predominantly driven by lower IB fees, lower Home Lending production revenue, losses in Credit Adjustments & Other in CIB as well as investment securities losses in corporate. And Markets revenue was down $300 million or 3% against a record first quarter last year. Expenses of $19.2 billion were up approximately $500 million or 2%, predominantly on higher investments and structural expenses, largely offset by lower volume and revenue-related expenses. Credit costs were $1.5 billion for the quarter. We built $902 million in reserves driven by increasing the probability of downside risks due to high inflation and the war in Ukraine as well as builds for Russia-associated exposures in CIB and AWM. Net charge-offs of $582 million were down year-on-year and comparable to last quarter and remain historically low across our portfolios. On to balance sheet and capital on Page 3. Our CET1 ratio ended at 11.9%, down 120 basis points from the prior quarter. As a reminder, we exited the fourth quarter with an elevated buffer to absorb anticipated changes this quarter, the largest being SA-CCR adoption as well as some pickup in seasonal activity. In addition to those anticipated items, there were a couple of other drivers. The rate sell-off led to AOCI drawdowns in our AFS portfolio. But keep in mind, all else equal, these mark-to-market losses accrete back to capital through time and as securities mature. And price increases across commodities resulted in higher counterparty credit and market risk RWA. While, of course, the environment is uncertain, many of these effects are now in the rearview mirror. And as a result, we believe that our current capital and future earnings profile position us well to continue supporting business growth while meeting increasing capital requirements as we look ahead. With that, let's go to our businesses, starting with Consumer & Community Banking on Page 4. CCB reported net income of $2.9 billion on revenue of $12.2 billion, which was down 2% year-on-year. In Consumer & Business Banking, revenue was up 8%, predominantly driven by growth in deposit balances and client investment assets, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Deposits were up 18% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter, consistent with last quarter. And client investment assets were up 9% year-on-year, largely driven by flows in addition to market performance. In Home Lending, revenue was down 20% year-on-year on lower production revenue from both, lower margins and volumes against a very strong quarter last year, largely offset by higher net servicing revenue. Originations of $24.7 billion declined 37% with the rise in rates. And as a result, mortgage loans were down 3%. Moving to Card & Auto. Revenue was down 8% year-on-year, primarily on strong new card account originations, leading to higher acquisition costs. Card outstandings were up 11%, and revolving balances have continued to grow, ending the quarter above the first quarter of '21 levels. And in Auto, originations were $8.4 billion, down 25% due to the lack of vehicle supply, while loans were up 3%. Touching on consumer spend. Combined credit and debit spend was up 21% year-on-year with growth stronger in credit as we see a continued pickup in travel and dining. And as the quarter progressed, we saw a robust reacceleration of T&E spend, up 64%. Expenses of $7.7 billion were up 7% year-on-year, driven by higher investments and structural expenses, partially offset by lower volume and revenue-related expenses. Next, the CIB on Page 5. CIB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $13.5 billion for the first quarter. Investment Banking revenue of $2.1 billion was down 28% versus the prior year. IB fees were down 31% year-on-year. We maintained our number one rank with a wallet share of 8%. In Advisory, fees were up 18%, and it was the best first quarter ever, benefiting from the closing of deals announced in 2021. Debt underwriting fees were down 20%, primarily driven by leverage finance as issuers contended with market volatility. And in equity underwriting, fees were down 76% on lower issuance activity, particularly in North America and EMEA. Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $8.8 billion, down 3% against a record first quarter last year. Fixed income was relatively flat driven by a decline in securitized products, where rising rates have slowed down the pace of mortgage production, largely offset by growth in currencies and emerging markets and commodities on elevated client activity in a volatile market. Equity markets were down 7% against an all-time record quarter last year. This quarter, however, was our second best with robust client activity across both, derivatives and cash. And prime continued to perform well with client balances hovering around all-time highs. Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $524 million, driven by funding spread widening as well as credit valuation adjustments relating to both, increases in commodities exposures and markdowns of derivatives receivables from Russia-associated counterparties. Let me take a second here to address the widely reported situation in the nickel market as it relates to our results this quarter. We were hedging positions for clients closely linked to nickel producers, who generally sell forward a portion of the coming year's production. The extreme price movements created margin calls, which we and other banks are helping to address. Because this is counterparty related, not trading, it appears in the Credit Adjustments & Other line, where it contributed about $120 million to the reported loss I just mentioned. It also drove approximately half of the increase in market risk RWA that I noted on the capital slide and was a driver of higher reported VaR, which will also be elevated in our upcoming filings. Payments revenue was $1.9 billion, up 33% year-on-year or up 9% excluding net gains on equity investments, driven by continued growth in fees, deposit balances and higher rates. Securities Services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 2% year-on-year, driven by higher rates and growth in fees. Expenses of $7.3 billion were up 3% year-on-year, mostly due to higher structural expenses and investments, largely offset by lower volume and revenue-related expenses. Moving to Commercial Banking on page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $850 million and an ROE of 13%. Revenue of $2.4 billion was flat year-on-year with higher payments revenue and deposit balances, offset by lower Investment Banking revenue. Gross Investment Banking revenue of $729 million was down 35%, driven by both, fewer large deals and less flow activity. Expenses of $1.1 billion were up 17% year-on-year, largely driven by investments in volume and revenue-related expenses. Deposits were down 2% quarter-on-quarter as client balances are seasonally highest at year-end. Loans were up 5% year-on-year and up 3% quarter-on-quarter, excluding PPP. C&I loans were up 3% sequentially ex PPP, reflecting higher revolver utilization and originations across Middle Market and Corporate Client Banking. CRE loans were up 3%, driven by strong loan originations and funding across the portfolio. And then, to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1 billion with a pretax margin of 30%. Revenue of $4.3 billion was up 6% year-on-year as growth in deposits and loans and higher management fees and performance fees and alternative investments were partially offset by deposit margin compression and the absence of investment valuation gains from the prior year. Expenses of $2.9 billion were up 11% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher structural expenses and investments as well as higher volume and revenue-related expenses. For the quarter, net long-term inflows of $19 billion were positive across all channels with strength in equities, multi-asset and alternatives. And in liquidity, we saw net outflows of $52 billion. AUM of $3 trillion and overall client assets of $4.1 trillion, up 4% and 8% year-on-year, respectively, were driven by strong net inflows. And finally, loans were up 3% quarter-on-quarter with continued strength in mortgages and securities-based lending, while deposits were up 9%. Turning to Corporate on page 8. Corporate reported a net loss of $856 million. Revenue was a loss of $881 million, down $408 million year-on-year. NII was up $319 million due to the impact of higher rates, and NIR was down $727 million due to losses on legacy equity investments versus gains last year as well as approximately $400 million of net realized losses on investment securities this quarter. Expenses of $184 million were lower by $692 million year-on-year primarily due to the contribution to the firm's foundation in the prior year. Next, the outlook on page 9. We still expect NII ex Markets to be in excess of $53 billion and adjusted expenses to be approximately $77 billion. And we'll update these and give you more color at Investor Day next month. So to wrap up, once again, this quarter, the Company's performance was strong in a particularly volatile and challenging environment. We helped our clients navigate very difficult markets, provided support to relief efforts and implemented economic sanctions of unprecedented complexity with multiple directives from governments around the world. And of course, our thoughts remain with everyone, including our employees affected by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Looking ahead, the U.S. economy remains robust, but we're watching high inflation, the reversal of QE and rising rates as well as the ongoing effects of the war on the global economy. With that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Please standby. And our first question is coming from John McDonald from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nJohn McDonald: Thank you. Good morning, Jeremy. I was wondering about the net interest income outlook. I know it sounds like we'll get more at Investor Day, but it's very similar to what you gave in mid-February. And obviously, rate expectations have advanced since then. Could you give us a little bit of color on what kind of assumptions are underlying the net interest income ex Markets outlook?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. Good morning, John, good question. And yes, look, obviously, given what's happened in terms of Fed hike expectations and what's getting questioned into the front of the curve, we would actually expect the access part of in excess of $53 billion to be bigger than it was at Credit Suisse. So, to size that, probably a couple of million dollars. But we don't want to get too precise at this point. We want to run our bottoms-up process. We -- there have been very big moves, and we want to get it right. And so, we'll give more detail about that at Investor Day.\nJohn McDonald: Okay. And as my follow-up, could you give us some thoughts about the Markets-related NII? What things should we think about there, whether it's seasonality or how it's affected by rising rates?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. I guess, I would direct you to my comments, I think, one or two quarters ago on this. But generally speaking, that number is pretty correlated to the short-term rate. So, all else equal, you'll see a headwind in there as the Fed hikes come through, which, in general, in the geography, we would tend to expect that to be offset in NIR. But it's noisy. It can shift as a function of obscure balance sheet composition issues, as I've mentioned in the past. And so, that's why we don't focus too much on that number.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nKen Usdin: Jeremy, I just wanted to follow-up on your comments about capital and being able to provide room for organic growth. With a 5.2% SLR, 11.9% CET1 versus your longer-term targets, can you talk about what that means in terms of the buyback potential from here? And do any of the RWA inflation items come back off that you just saw in the first quarter? Thanks.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, thanks. So, let me just give some high-level comments about the CET1 trajectory and so on. So, as you know, we went into the quarter with elevated buffers, knowing that we would have denominator growth as a result of the adoption of SA-CCR. And so, of course, that happened. And we would have expected roughly to be 12.5 right in the middle of the range this quarter. Of course, it was an unusual quarter in a number of ways. And so, we saw RWA inflation from market risk, which we've talked about and the AOCI drawdown and a number of other slightly smaller factors producing the 11.9%. From where we sit here, to your point, a number of these items are, in fact, going to bleed back in relatively quickly, some faster than others. So, we would expect a significant portion of the RWA inflation to bleed out, obviously, to decay out. The AOCI drawdown will obviously come back over time. And probably most importantly, to the prior question, the higher rate outlook is improving the revenue outlook, which will, of course, accrete to capital. So then, if you line that up against the sort of rising minimums, of course, we have the increase in the G-SIB requirement in the first quarter of '23 coming in. And then, there's a question of SCB, where we don't know, obviously, but given the countercyclical nature of the stress and the fact that the unemployment launch point is a lot lower and that the unemployment rate is floored in the Fed scenario, you might expect SCB to be a little bit higher when it's published in June, effective in the fourth quarter. But that gives us time to make any adjustments that we need to make. So, I guess, to summarize, when we put all this together, between improved income generation, some of the denominator to KFX and the various levers that we have available to pull across the dimension of time as soon information comes into play, we really feel quite good about our capital position from here and the trajectory as we look forward and minimums evolve.\nKen Usdin: And just a follow-up there, too. Is there anything you need to consider structurally in terms of like adding preferreds to help bridge the gap, or is it just going to be enough to organically build back with possibly just utilizing less buyback to allow things to just grow back?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. I think, the -- I guess, in general, we haven't wanted to say a lot publicly about our preferred actions. As you know, some of these instruments are callable. And we have choices to make about whether or not we call them to adjust to different situations. So I think that's an example of the types of levers that we have available to pull as the environment evolves. But from where we sit today with the numbers that I'm looking at, we have a pretty clean trajectory to get to where we want to be.\nOperator: The next one is coming from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBetsy Graseck: I had a question for Jamie. In your annual letter, you mentioned how you expect to achieve double-digit market share over time in payments. And what I wanted to understand is if you could unpack that a little bit because when I look at payments, you've got a lot of different sleeves. For example, in consumer credit card, you're at 20%, 25%. In treasury, I think you're at 7%. So, could you give us a sense as to where you think you are in this total payments category you're talking about, what you're expecting in terms of drivers to get to double-digit and what kind of time frame you're thinking about there? Thanks.\nJamie Dimon: Yes. So yes, Betsy, so that number, the double-digit relating just to Wholesale Payments, not to consumer payments, which obviously, we already have a fairly significant share. And we've gone from 4.5% to something a little bit north of 7% over the last five years. And we're just building out. And I gave some examples and I\u2019d give a lot and then you have Investor Day coming up, we're building all the things we need, real-time payments, certain blockchain-type things. While it's a couple of acquisitions, they're building out our Wholesale capabilities to do a far better job for clients globally around the world and supported by what I'd say very good cyber and risk controls, which clients really need too, by the way. So, it's kind of across the board. It's nothing mystical about it, but it's an area we want to win in.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. And getting to double digits is over the same kind of time frame with the same pace going from 4% to 7%, or do you think you can accelerate that? Because I see what...\nJamie Dimon: I wasn't meaning to put a time frame on it, but I would say five years. You'll get more update on this at Investor Day.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. And then, just a follow-up here is on the NII outlook, where you indicated the curve suggests the plus side and is it a couple of billion. And I guess the question I have is historically, you've been looking to reinvest that benefit from rising rates. You did that last cycle as well. What I hear -- what I'm hearing is that maybe you don't want to size it for us right now today because you plan on investing it and explaining that at Investor Day. Is that a fair takeaway?\nJamie Dimon: No, no, no. We don't look at that way like we're reinvesting NII. We -- the investing stuff, we look at all the time we're investing, and we're investing a lot of money for the future kind of across the board. But that's not why you're saying...\nJeremy Barnum: I mean, I think fundamentally, we have had confidence in delivering our 17% ROTCE through the cycle. We talked a little bit over the last couple of quarters about at the time, some short-term headwinds to that, mostly as a function of the rate environment and a couple of other things. The investment plan is a strategic plan that recognizes that sort of confidence in the 17%. The fact that that moment may be getting pulled forward as a result of the Fed's reaction to the economy has no impact on how we think about spending.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Steve Chubak from Wolfe Research.\nSteve Chubak: So, I wanted to start off with a question on QT. In the past, you've spoken about the linkage between Fed balance sheet reduction and deposit outflow expectation for yourselves in the industry. And with the Fed just outlining a more aggressive glide path per balance sheet reduction, how should we be thinking about deposit outflow risk? Any views on how betas may differ versus last cycle, given a more aggressive pace of Fed timing?\nJeremy Barnum: Hey Steve, so this is a fun question. So, let's nerd out a little bit. I'm sure Jamie will jump in. So look, I think we've talked a little bit about what happened in the prior cycle, right? So, you had QE, and then you had big expansion in bank deposits, system-wide expansion. And at the tail end of that cycle, you had RRP come in, and then RRP has gotten sort of quite big as QE finished. And so now, as you look at potentially kind of running that whole thing in reverse, you might actually expect that the first thing that would happen is that RRP would get drained and only later would bank deposits start to shrink. But I think you correctly point out some of the nuances in the Fed minutes. And when you sort of combine all the effects together, you realize that there's a lot of interacting forces here and is really, I think, very intelligent people differ on their predictions about what's going to happen here. And just to outline a couple of those. So, it's worth noting for starters that in general, industry-wide loan growth outlook is quite robust, and that should be a tailwind for system-wide deposit growth. So, as you noted, yes, QT will start in May in all likelihood for the minutes headwind. Then, you just have to look at what's going to happen in the front end of the curve, particularly in bills. So, the treasury has to make decisions about weighted average maturity and what makes sense there. There's obviously a little bit of shortage of short-dated collateral in the market right now. So, that might argue for wanting more supply there. The Fed has to make decisions about portfolio management. They talked in the minutes about using bill maturities to fill in gaps and so on and so forth. And so, those things are going to interact in various ways. I think, one thing that's worth noting though is that if you wind up in the state of the world where bank deposits drain sooner than people might have otherwise thought, in all likelihood, that's going to be the lower value non-operating-type deposits. So, in any case, we'll see. But to simplify it for a second, our base case remains modest growth in deposits for us as a company. And just pivoting away for a second from the system to us, from a share perspective, we've taken share in retail deposits, and we feel great about that. And in Wholesale, we've had some nice wins and a nice pipeline of deals there. So, that's the current thinking on that topic.\nJamie Dimon: So, the answer is we don't know. Okay? And you guys read economies [ph] reports, but the fact is initially probably won't come out of deposits. Over time, it will come out of Wholesale and then maybe consumer. We're prepared for that. It doesn't actually mean that much to us in the short run. And the beta effectively, we don't expect to be that different than was in the past. There are a lot of pluses and minuses. You can argue a whole bunch of different ways, but the fact it won't be that much different, at least the first 100 basis-point increase.\nSteve Chubak: Just one more topic or a follow-up, I should say. Jamie, just in the shareholder letter, you had spoken about how the market is underestimating the number of Fed hikes that might be needed to curb inflation. And what's your expectation around the level of Fed tightening? I know it's difficult to make such predictions, but maybe if you could just help us understand given your own rate outlook, how that's informing how you're managing excess liquidity, given the significant capacity that you have to redeploy some of those proceeds into higher-yielding securities?\nJamie Dimon: Yes. So, I think the implied curve now is like 2.5% at the end of the year and maybe 3% at the end of 2023. And look, no one knows. And obviously, everyone does their forecast. I think it's going to be more than that. Okay? I give you a million different reasons why because of inflation and just about deposits. And we've never been through ever QT like this. So, this is a new thing for the world and I think is more substantially important than other people think because the huge change of flows of funds is going to create as people change their investment portfolio. So, we're going to be fine because we're going to certainly help our customers and gain share. So, what does it do for JPMorgan Chase? JPMorgan Chase, we'll be fine. We got plenty of capital, all great margins. We already have the returns we want and all things like that. So, I just -- I would just be cautious. I think what you should expect is volatile markets. Again, that's okay for us. And the Fed -- we think the Fed needs to do, they need to do to try to manage this economy and try to get to a soft landing, if possible.\nSteve Chubak: And any appetite to deploy the excess liquidity?\nJamie Dimon: No, don't expect that.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nGlenn Schorr: I wonder if you could talk through the changes in the macro assumptions to capture that downside risk in CECL assumptions, just because what I want to get to is where we came from, where we're at now and then we can impose our thoughts on each quarter.\nJamie Dimon: Yes. I don't want to spend a lot of time on CECL. I think it's a complete waste of time. Basically, all we said is the chance of an adverse or severe adverse event is 10% higher than it was before. That's all we did, very basic. And that led to a big...\nJeremy Barnum: It really is that...\nJamie Dimon: And we don't know, and it's a guess. It's probability weighted, hypothetical, multiyear scenarios that -- we do the best we can, but to spend a lot of time on earnings calls about CECL swings is a waste of time. It's got nothing to do with the underlying business. Charge-offs are extraordinarily good, as a matter of fact, way better than they should be. I mean, middle market, 1 basis point, credit card 1.5. We would have told you in the past that the best it'll ever be is 2.5. So, credit is very good. That will get worse. NII is going to get much better. Things are going to normalize. We're still earning 16% or 17% on tangible equity. And obviously, you have -- yes.\nGlenn Schorr: The 10% is what I wanted because your guess is better than my guess. So, I appreciate that.\nJamie Dimon: I don't -- Glenn, with all due respect, I do not believe it is.\nGlenn Schorr: Okay. So, I think you might have just answered it, but I want to make sure I ask it explicitly. The follow-up I have on credit, and I know it's in much better shape, and it depends on the go forward. But are you seeing any stresses in the levered parts of the debt markets, meaning leveraged loan, high-yield, CLO, private credit, anything in there that makes you like turn a side eye?\nJamie Dimon: Just spread widening, a little bit less liquidity.\nGlenn Schorr: That doesn't sound so bad. And...\nJeremy Barnum: I mean, I think, look, we -- no one likes to be complacent about this type of stuff. And obviously, in this environment, everyone's looking very closely everywhere for any risks and trying to see around the corner. But as of right now, we're really not seeing anything of concern in the kind of spot metrics, so to speak.\nGlenn Schorr: Maybe the last quickie on credit is just with everybody having a job and there's wage inflation and excess cash, are there any buckets of income that you're seeing early stage delinquencies picking up?\nJeremy Barnum: In short, no. It is an interesting question as you look across our customer base, particularly in card and you sort of -- that heavily debated question of real income growth and gas prices and what's that doing to consumer balance sheets. And so, we're watching that, especially in the kind of LMI segment of our customer base. But right now, we're not actually seeing anything that gives us reason to worry.\nOperator: The next one is coming from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nGerard Cassidy: Jeremy, can we follow up on your comments about building up the reserves? I think you said it was $902 million that you guys built up and was due to high inflation and the war in the Ukraine. How much was it due to inflation? And when you made that comment, is it because you're concerned about the lower-end consumer spending more money for fuel and food that might lead to greater delinquencies down the road? And how much was it due to the Ukraine situation?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, Glenn (sic) [Gerard], it's really a lot more general than that. So just to repeat, 900 build, 300 name specific, primarily related to Russia-associated individual names. The other 600 is portfolio level. And as Jamie just said, it simply reflects increasing the probability from a very low probability to a slightly higher probability of a -- you might call it, Volcker-style, Fed-induced recession in response to the current inflationary environment, which obviously is in part driven by commodity price increases, which are in part driven by the war in Ukraine, so. But it's not a super micro portfolio level thing, except to the extent that our models handle that. It's a top-down modification of the probabilistic ways.\nJamie Dimon: One of the things I hated when CECL came out is that we spend a lot of time in every call yapping about CECL. I just think it's a huge mistake for all of us to spend too much time on it.\nGerard Cassidy: Understood. And then, as a follow-up, Jeremy, if we look at the AOCI number that you gave us, and you were very clear about it's going to accrete back into the capital as those securities mature. Two things. Is there anything you can do, assuming if the long end of the curve continues to rise and probably giving you maybe a bigger hit on AOCI as we go forward, is there anything you can do to mitigate that, whether to shrink that -- the available-for-sale portfolio, which looks like it was $313 billion at the end of this period, or do you just have to grow the revenue, as you pointed out, as another way of growing your capital?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. I mean, I think that, obviously, we always try to grow revenue sort of independently of anything else. I think the large point here is, yes, there are some things that can be done to mitigate this. But the big picture is that the central case path is one that gets us to where we want to be when we need to be there in terms of CET1 and leverage. And if things don't play out as along the lines of the central case, we have tools and levers available to adjust across a range of dimensions, so.\nOperator: The next one is coming from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nMike Mayo: Hi. I have a question for both, Jeremy and Jamie. Jeremy, I guess the SLR 5.2% close to the minimum, you explained that. But since quarter end, AOCI probably has gotten worse. And I'm guessing your SLR might be very even close to that minimum. So, I understand your central case, it's fine. Your outlook is good. But at what point do you say you stop buybacks, or do you think you'll buy back maybe half of the $30 billion authorization, or does JPMorgan even put on asset caps, given just the amazing asset growth over the last three months? So, that's my question for Jeremy. But the bigger picture is for you, Jamie, your CEO letter. The takeaway was in the eye of the beholder, like Jamie is really worried about a recession this year. Now he's not. So, the first question certainly ties into the second. So Jeremy, plan for buybacks, stopping at asset cap? And then, Jamie, your view of the broader economies and that feeds into your expectations for capital growth. Thank you.\nJeremy Barnum: Okay, Mike. So, let me take this capital one. So first, let's not talk about asset caps. That's just not a meaningful thing. I think that's a distraction, and the terminology is unhelpful. Then, in terms of the leverage ratio, just remember that the denominator of that number is so big that it actually takes like pretty big moves to move the ratio. So, 5.20 is actually still pretty far away from 5%. And of course, there are relatively easy to use tools to address that as well as was alluded to earlier. In addition, I do think it's worth just reminding everyone of how the ERI restrictions work now relative to how they were at the beginning of the crisis. Just briefly, just to remember that based on the redefinition, if you drop into the regulatory buffer zone, you're subject to a 60% restriction, which based on our recent historical net income generation still gives us like ample, ample capacity to pay the dividend and so on. So, it's obviously not part of the plan, but it's just worth remembering that the cliff effects that we had in there at the beginning of the pandemic are no longer there. And then, in terms of buybacks, just a reminder that the $30 billion authorization is a nontime-bounded SEC requirement. It's not the old CCAR standard. So, it's just a signal that we want to have that capacity and that flexibility. But it doesn't really say that much about how much we're actually planning to do in the near term.\nMike Mayo: Are you allowed to say what you're planning to do in the near term? Like just -- like if you're kind of like half the level last year, do you think you can keep that, or does this slow down, or you're not giving guidance?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. Let's talk about buybacks for a second. So in the kind of post-SCB world, we haven't been guiding a lot on the pace of buybacks, mainly because, as you know, they're at the bottom of our capital stack. So, we're focused on investing in the business, providing capital to support growing RWA, acquisitions when they make sense, et cetera, et cetera. And buybacks are -- an output. As we've discussed, in the current environment, the rate of buybacks is clearly going to be less than it was in the 2021 period as a result of the interaction of all those effects. And that's a good thing. It means that we have better uses for the capital. And if things evolve one way or the other, then the rate of buybacks will be an output, but it's one of the tools in the toolkit.\nJamie Dimon: Mike, I would just add, if you look at liquidity and capital, it's extraordinary. And we don't want to have buffers on top of buffers. So, we're going to manage this pretty tightly over time. And obviously, when you have AOCI and earnings and CECL, all that, but being conscious of all of that, we can manage through that. And we've done some acquisitions this year. And so, -- and plus, we are adding -- we're planning to have more capital for the increase in G-SIFI down the road, which reduced stock buyback and -- but the amount -- I look at the amount of liquidity, the earnings, the capital, that's the stuff that really matters. And at the end of the day, it's driving customers. We serve customers, which is why we're here. We don't serve managing SLR. That's kind of an output of stuff we do. And so -- and then your question about -- I think it was about recession basically. Yes, do you want to repeat the question?\nMike Mayo: Yes. No, I mean, if you read your CEO letter, and that's great. You're the Chief Worry Officer. You're the Chief Risk Manager. You're bringing up all the things that keep you up at night, which is great. But you can read it one way and say, hey, Jamie and JPMorgan thinks there's going to be a recession this year. And you can read it in other way, saying, hey, things are fine, but these are some tail risks. So, do you think -- and I'll repeat what Glenn said. Your view is better than mine, and I'm not going to accept anything else. You have a lot of people, a lot of resources. Do you think the U.S. is going to have a recession this year based on everything you know?\nJamie Dimon: Yes, I don't. But I just want to question this. First of all, I can't forecast the future any more than anyone else. And the Fed forecasted and everyone forecasted, and everyone's wrong all the time, and I think it's a mistake. We run the company to serve clients through thick or thin. That's what we do. We know there will be ups. We know there will be down. We know the weather is going to change and all that stuff like that. What I have pointed out in my letter is very strong underlying growth, right now, which will go on. It's not stoppable. The consumer has money. They pay down credit card debt. Confidence isn't high, but the fact that they have money, they're spending their money. They have $2 trillion still in their savings and checking accounts, business are in good shape. Home prices are up. Credit is extraordinarily good. So you have this -- that's one factor. That's going to continue in the second quarter, third quarter. And I -- after that, it's hard to predict. You've got two other very large countervailing factors, which you guys are all completely aware of. One is inflation/QE/QT. You've never seen that before. I'm simply pointing out that we've -- those are storm clouds on the horizon that may disappear, they may not. That's a fact. And I'm quite conscious of that fact, and I do expect that alone will create volatility and concerns and endless printing and endless headlines and stuff like that. And the second is war in Ukraine. I pointed out in my letter that war in Ukraine. Usually wars don't necessarily affect the global economy in the short run. But there are exceptions to that. This may very well be one of them. I don't -- I'm not looking at this on a static basis. Okay? So you're looking at this war in Ukraine and sanctions. Things are unpredictable. Wars are unpredictable. Wars have unpredictable outcome. You've already seen in oil markets. The oil markets are precarious. Okay? So I pointed that out over and over that people don't understand that those things can change dramatically for either physical reasons, cyber reasons or just supply-demand. And so, that's another huge cloud in the horizon, and I -- we're prepared for it. We understand it. We're just -- I can't tell you the outcome of it. I hope those things all disappear and go away. We have a soft landing, and the Board is resolved. Okay? I just wouldn't bet on all that. I just -- and of course, being a risk manager, we're going to get through all that. We're going to serve our clients, and we're going to gain share. We're going to come to that earning tremendous returns on capital like we have in the past.\nOperator: Next one is from Matthew O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMatthew O\u2019Connor: I was hoping you guys could comment on the -- there are some articles on the nickel exposure and how the losses could have been significant if the trades hadn't been canceled and from the actions that were taken. And then, just as a follow-up. You guys have talked about kind of looking at that business and reevaluating how you think about some of the outsized risks, and maybe you can update us on that process.\nJamie Dimon: We've already told you, we're helping our clients get through this. We had a little bit lost this quarter but we manage through it. We\u2019ll do postmortems on both what we think we did wrong and what the LME could do differently later. We're not going to do it now.\nMatthew O\u2019Connor: And then, I guess, I mean, more broadly speaking, given what we just saw where it was probably a several standard deviation event and kind of, as you mentioned, markets might do more of these unusual things. Like, does it make you step back and look at other portfolios, other businesses and try to...\nJamie Dimon: In my life, I've seen so many 10 standard deviation events [indiscernible]. Obviously, we're aware of that all the time in everything we do.\nJeremy Barnum: And I would take it one step further. I think the whole paradigm of saying it's a 10 standard deviation event is na\u00efve, right? We know the returns are not normally distributed. We know that. Regulators know that. The capital framework recognizes that in a broad variety of ways, including things like stress. So I don't think -- of course, you can't predict where and in which asset class and in which particular moment you're going to see these types of fat tail events. But the framework recognizes in a range of ways that that's the case. And that's how we manage risk, and that's how we're...\nJamie Dimon: So, we do CCAR once a year, as you guys see. But we actually run 100 different various stress tests every week with extreme movements and things. And that's what we do. And we're always -- you're always going to be a little surprise somewhere, but we're pretty conscious of those risks. And all events like this, we always look at -- but it doesn't have to happen to us. It can happen to someone else. We still analyze everything that maybe we were on the wrong side of something, too. But at the end of the day, in all of our businesses, we are here to serve clients all the time. That means taking rational, thoughtful, disciplined risk to do that.\nMatthew O\u2019Connor: And then, just separately, you had mentioned earlier that you weren't looking to deploy large amounts of your liquidity. And I guess, the question is, you might get the rate benefit just from Fed funds going up, but is there an opportunity to accelerate that benefit just by moving some cash into shorter-term treasuries? We've also seen a big move in...\nJamie Dimon: Guys, we're just talking about interest rates going up maybe more than 3%. Convexity is going up. AOCI is going up, all these -- there are all these various reasons not to do that. We're not going to do it just to give you a little bit more NII next quarter.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. And Steve (sic) [Matthew], just to -- just go one level deeper there for a second, right? So you talk about deployment. Of course, as Jamie says, we're always going to take relative value opportunities in the portfolio. Mortgage spreads have widened, there's interesting stuff to do. So in that sense, yes, deployment out of cash into various sorts of spread product that looks more interesting, we do that all the time. The high-level simple question of buying duration as Jamie says, balance sheets extended a little bit. That was never -- we were never planning to do that much of that anyway. And frankly, given the timing and expected speed of the rate hikes, increasingly, it just kind of doesn't matter that much. And yes, so I think it's helpful to keep that in mind.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.\nJim Mitchell: Maybe you could just talk about how you're thinking about the trajectory of loan growth from here, where you're seeing the biggest pockets of strength? And specifically in cards, is the significant year-over-year growth driven more by slowing paydowns, or is that increasing demand or a combination of both? Thanks.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, sure. So, you'll remember in the fourth quarter that we talked about the outlook based on sort of high single-digit loan growth for the year. And this quarter, we've roughly seen that. Interestingly, it's a little bit more driven by Wholesale this quarter, which sort of brings us to your question of card. So overall card loan growth is reasonably robust when you adjust for seasonality and so on. And that's really primarily driven by spend, which, as you know, is very robust. The question inside of that is then what's going on with revolve. And I think our core revolve thesis of getting back to the pre-pandemic levels of revolving balances by the end of the year is still in place to a good approximation. At the margin, we probably saw the like takeoff moment delayed by 6 weeks or so because of Omicron. But some of that's reaccelerating now. We see that in some of the March numbers. So, we'll see how it goes. But also just a reminder that there's a very, very close linkage between what we see in revolve and what we see in charge-offs. And so, in the moments where revolve is lagging potentially, certainly that was true throughout the pandemic period relative to what we thought. We also saw exceptionally low charge-offs. So, on a bottom line basis, the run rate performance, there's significant offset there. But the core thesis is still there. Spend is robust. We are seeing spend down some of the cash buffers in the customer segment that tends to revolve. So, more or less as anticipated, I would say.\nJim Mitchell: Okay. And then, maybe just on -- skipping over to trading. Clearly, a stronger quarter, must have finished off strongly in March. So, any confirmation of that? And how do we -- if you're expecting more volatility around Fed in QT, is it -- should we be thinking that this could be a better than normalization year? How are you thinking about trading, I guess, going forward?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. I mean, you know that we're going to be reluctant to like predict the next three quarters of trading performance.\nJim Mitchell: I could try.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, obviously, yes. But just to your point about normalization, right? We've been saying that, of course, we expect some normalization. The question is, if you define normalization as a return to kind of like 2019-type trading run rate levels, we never expected that because there's been a bunch of organic growth in the background, some share gains. And we had said that as we emerge from the pandemic and monetary policy normalized, that was going to add volatility to the markets and that with any luck and good risk management, that would net-net help a little bit mitigate what we might otherwise expect in terms of the drop from the very elevated levels that we saw during the pandemic. So, obviously, there are some particular things that played out this quarter, but one of those was more volatile rate market, and that helps a little bit. So yes, all else equal, the much more dynamic environment right now would mute the normalization you would see otherwise. But our core case is still that the pandemic year period market's performance was -- is not repeatable.\nJamie Dimon: And I'll just add to that. I cannot foresee any scenario at all where you're not going to have a lot of volatility in markets going forward. We've already spoken about the enormous strength of the economy, QT, inflation, war, commodity prices, there's almost no chance that you want to have volatile markets. That could be good or bad for trading, but some [indiscernible] change won't happen. And I think people should be prepared for that.\nOperator: The next one is from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nEbrahim Poonawala: I guess just one more question on the macro outlook. I guess we can debate whether or not we get into a recession over the next year. But Jamie, would love to hear your thoughts around as we think about just the medium term, do you see a better CapEx cycle for the U.S. economy? We've heard a lot about reshoring, labor productivity, how companies are dealing with it. Just given the lens you have in terms of large corporate middle market customers, do you see some pent-up demand for CapEx spending that's going to be a big driver of growth, maybe not for the next six months, but as we think about the medium term, next few years?\nJamie Dimon: Yes, in general because as people are spending money and you need to produce more goods and all that, yes, and generally see CapEx going up. And I forgot the exact number. You better off looking at our great accounting forecast -- than asking me. And we see in the borrowing a little bit\u2026\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, we do see pretty nice loan growth in the commercial bank. I mean, there's a bunch of different factors there, could be some inventory effects and so on, but we'll see. But yes.\nEbrahim Poonawala: And just on that front, like have you seen any improvement in supply chains? And how big a setback was the Russia war to supply chain improvements?\nJamie Dimon: It's very hard to tell. There was some improvement and then there was Ukraine. And now, it's all mixed again. So, it's hard to tell.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. And just one follow-up around you launched the UK digital bank last month. Any early wins in terms of how that's playing out? Any perspective on what the markets are as we think about how that strategy plays out? I'm sure you're going to talk about that at Investor Day, but just wondering any early thoughts.\nJamie Dimon: We'll leave that to Investor Day.\nOperator: And the next question is coming from Erika Najarian from UBS. Please go ahead.\nErika Najarian: Hi. Good morning. My questions have been asked and answered. I'll see you guys at Investor Day.\nJeremy Barnum: All right. Thanks, Erika.\nOperator: And there are no further questions in the queue.\nJamie Dimon: Well, thank you very much.\nJeremy Barnum: Thanks very much.\nJamie Dimon: See you, I guess, at Investor Day.\nJeremy Barnum: May 23rd.\nJamie Dimon: Okay. Goodbye.\nOperator: Thank you so much, everyone. That marks the end of our conference call for today. You may now disconnect. Thank you for joining, and you can enjoy the rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeremy Barnum",
            "content": "Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $8.3 billion, EPS of $2.63 on revenue of $31.6 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 16%. These results include approximately $900 million of credit reserve builds, which I'll cover in more detail shortly, as well as $500 million of losses in Credit Adjustments & Other in CIB. Regarding loan growth. We're continuing to see positive trends with loans up 8% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter ex PPP with the sequential growth driven by a continued pickup in demand in our Wholesale businesses, including ongoing strength in AWM. On Page 2, we have some more detail on our results. Revenue of $31.6 billion was down $1.5 billion or 5% year-on-year. NII ex Markets was up $1 billion or 9% on balance sheet growth and higher rates, partially offset by lower NII from PPP loans. NIR ex Markets was down $2.2 billion or 17% predominantly driven by lower IB fees, lower Home Lending production revenue, losses in Credit Adjustments & Other in CIB as well as investment securities losses in corporate. And Markets revenue was down $300 million or 3% against a record first quarter last year. Expenses of $19.2 billion were up approximately $500 million or 2%, predominantly on higher investments and structural expenses, largely offset by lower volume and revenue-related expenses. Credit costs were $1.5 billion for the quarter. We built $902 million in reserves driven by increasing the probability of downside risks due to high inflation and the war in Ukraine as well as builds for Russia-associated exposures in CIB and AWM. Net charge-offs of $582 million were down year-on-year and comparable to last quarter and remain historically low across our portfolios. On to balance sheet and capital on Page 3. Our CET1 ratio ended at 11.9%, down 120 basis points from the prior quarter. As a reminder, we exited the fourth quarter with an elevated buffer to absorb anticipated changes this quarter, the largest being SA-CCR adoption as well as some pickup in seasonal activity. In addition to those anticipated items, there were a couple of other drivers. The rate sell-off led to AOCI drawdowns in our AFS portfolio. But keep in mind, all else equal, these mark-to-market losses accrete back to capital through time and as securities mature. And price increases across commodities resulted in higher counterparty credit and market risk RWA. While, of course, the environment is uncertain, many of these effects are now in the rearview mirror. And as a result, we believe that our current capital and future earnings profile position us well to continue supporting business growth while meeting increasing capital requirements as we look ahead. With that, let's go to our businesses, starting with Consumer & Community Banking on Page 4. CCB reported net income of $2.9 billion on revenue of $12.2 billion, which was down 2% year-on-year. In Consumer & Business Banking, revenue was up 8%, predominantly driven by growth in deposit balances and client investment assets, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Deposits were up 18% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter, consistent with last quarter. And client investment assets were up 9% year-on-year, largely driven by flows in addition to market performance. In Home Lending, revenue was down 20% year-on-year on lower production revenue from both, lower margins and volumes against a very strong quarter last year, largely offset by higher net servicing revenue. Originations of $24.7 billion declined 37% with the rise in rates. And as a result, mortgage loans were down 3%. Moving to Card & Auto. Revenue was down 8% year-on-year, primarily on strong new card account originations, leading to higher acquisition costs. Card outstandings were up 11%, and revolving balances have continued to grow, ending the quarter above the first quarter of '21 levels. And in Auto, originations were $8.4 billion, down 25% due to the lack of vehicle supply, while loans were up 3%. Touching on consumer spend. Combined credit and debit spend was up 21% year-on-year with growth stronger in credit as we see a continued pickup in travel and dining. And as the quarter progressed, we saw a robust reacceleration of T&E spend, up 64%. Expenses of $7.7 billion were up 7% year-on-year, driven by higher investments and structural expenses, partially offset by lower volume and revenue-related expenses. Next, the CIB on Page 5. CIB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $13.5 billion for the first quarter. Investment Banking revenue of $2.1 billion was down 28% versus the prior year. IB fees were down 31% year-on-year. We maintained our number one rank with a wallet share of 8%. In Advisory, fees were up 18%, and it was the best first quarter ever, benefiting from the closing of deals announced in 2021. Debt underwriting fees were down 20%, primarily driven by leverage finance as issuers contended with market volatility. And in equity underwriting, fees were down 76% on lower issuance activity, particularly in North America and EMEA. Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $8.8 billion, down 3% against a record first quarter last year. Fixed income was relatively flat driven by a decline in securitized products, where rising rates have slowed down the pace of mortgage production, largely offset by growth in currencies and emerging markets and commodities on elevated client activity in a volatile market. Equity markets were down 7% against an all-time record quarter last year. This quarter, however, was our second best with robust client activity across both, derivatives and cash. And prime continued to perform well with client balances hovering around all-time highs. Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $524 million, driven by funding spread widening as well as credit valuation adjustments relating to both, increases in commodities exposures and markdowns of derivatives receivables from Russia-associated counterparties. Let me take a second here to address the widely reported situation in the nickel market as it relates to our results this quarter. We were hedging positions for clients closely linked to nickel producers, who generally sell forward a portion of the coming year's production. The extreme price movements created margin calls, which we and other banks are helping to address. Because this is counterparty related, not trading, it appears in the Credit Adjustments & Other line, where it contributed about $120 million to the reported loss I just mentioned. It also drove approximately half of the increase in market risk RWA that I noted on the capital slide and was a driver of higher reported VaR, which will also be elevated in our upcoming filings. Payments revenue was $1.9 billion, up 33% year-on-year or up 9% excluding net gains on equity investments, driven by continued growth in fees, deposit balances and higher rates. Securities Services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 2% year-on-year, driven by higher rates and growth in fees. Expenses of $7.3 billion were up 3% year-on-year, mostly due to higher structural expenses and investments, largely offset by lower volume and revenue-related expenses. Moving to Commercial Banking on page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $850 million and an ROE of 13%. Revenue of $2.4 billion was flat year-on-year with higher payments revenue and deposit balances, offset by lower Investment Banking revenue. Gross Investment Banking revenue of $729 million was down 35%, driven by both, fewer large deals and less flow activity. Expenses of $1.1 billion were up 17% year-on-year, largely driven by investments in volume and revenue-related expenses. Deposits were down 2% quarter-on-quarter as client balances are seasonally highest at year-end. Loans were up 5% year-on-year and up 3% quarter-on-quarter, excluding PPP. C&I loans were up 3% sequentially ex PPP, reflecting higher revolver utilization and originations across Middle Market and Corporate Client Banking. CRE loans were up 3%, driven by strong loan originations and funding across the portfolio. And then, to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1 billion with a pretax margin of 30%. Revenue of $4.3 billion was up 6% year-on-year as growth in deposits and loans and higher management fees and performance fees and alternative investments were partially offset by deposit margin compression and the absence of investment valuation gains from the prior year. Expenses of $2.9 billion were up 11% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher structural expenses and investments as well as higher volume and revenue-related expenses. For the quarter, net long-term inflows of $19 billion were positive across all channels with strength in equities, multi-asset and alternatives. And in liquidity, we saw net outflows of $52 billion. AUM of $3 trillion and overall client assets of $4.1 trillion, up 4% and 8% year-on-year, respectively, were driven by strong net inflows. And finally, loans were up 3% quarter-on-quarter with continued strength in mortgages and securities-based lending, while deposits were up 9%. Turning to Corporate on page 8. Corporate reported a net loss of $856 million. Revenue was a loss of $881 million, down $408 million year-on-year. NII was up $319 million due to the impact of higher rates, and NIR was down $727 million due to losses on legacy equity investments versus gains last year as well as approximately $400 million of net realized losses on investment securities this quarter. Expenses of $184 million were lower by $692 million year-on-year primarily due to the contribution to the firm's foundation in the prior year. Next, the outlook on page 9. We still expect NII ex Markets to be in excess of $53 billion and adjusted expenses to be approximately $77 billion. And we'll update these and give you more color at Investor Day next month. So to wrap up, once again, this quarter, the Company's performance was strong in a particularly volatile and challenging environment. We helped our clients navigate very difficult markets, provided support to relief efforts and implemented economic sanctions of unprecedented complexity with multiple directives from governments around the world. And of course, our thoughts remain with everyone, including our employees affected by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Looking ahead, the U.S. economy remains robust, but we're watching high inflation, the reversal of QE and rising rates as well as the ongoing effects of the war on the global economy. With that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. Yes. Good morning, John, good question. And yes, look, obviously, given what's happened in terms of Fed hike expectations and what's getting questioned into the front of the curve, we would actually expect the access part of in excess of $53 billion to be bigger than it was at Credit Suisse. So, to size that, probably a couple of million dollars. But we don't want to get too precise at this point. We want to run our bottoms-up process. We -- there have been very big moves, and we want to get it right. And so, we'll give more detail about that at Investor Day. Yes. I guess, I would direct you to my comments, I think, one or two quarters ago on this. But generally speaking, that number is pretty correlated to the short-term rate. So, all else equal, you'll see a headwind in there as the Fed hikes come through, which, in general, in the geography, we would tend to expect that to be offset in NIR. But it's noisy. It can shift as a function of obscure balance sheet composition issues, as I've mentioned in the past. And so, that's why we don't focus too much on that number. Yes, thanks. So, let me just give some high-level comments about the CET1 trajectory and so on. So, as you know, we went into the quarter with elevated buffers, knowing that we would have denominator growth as a result of the adoption of SA-CCR. And so, of course, that happened. And we would have expected roughly to be 12.5 right in the middle of the range this quarter. Of course, it was an unusual quarter in a number of ways. And so, we saw RWA inflation from market risk, which we've talked about and the AOCI drawdown and a number of other slightly smaller factors producing the 11.9%. From where we sit here, to your point, a number of these items are, in fact, going to bleed back in relatively quickly, some faster than others. So, we would expect a significant portion of the RWA inflation to bleed out, obviously, to decay out. The AOCI drawdown will obviously come back over time. And probably most importantly, to the prior question, the higher rate outlook is improving the revenue outlook, which will, of course, accrete to capital. So then, if you line that up against the sort of rising minimums, of course, we have the increase in the G-SIB requirement in the first quarter of '23 coming in. And then, there's a question of SCB, where we don't know, obviously, but given the countercyclical nature of the stress and the fact that the unemployment launch point is a lot lower and that the unemployment rate is floored in the Fed scenario, you might expect SCB to be a little bit higher when it's published in June, effective in the fourth quarter. But that gives us time to make any adjustments that we need to make. So, I guess, to summarize, when we put all this together, between improved income generation, some of the denominator to KFX and the various levers that we have available to pull across the dimension of time as soon information comes into play, we really feel quite good about our capital position from here and the trajectory as we look forward and minimums evolve. Yes. I think, the -- I guess, in general, we haven't wanted to say a lot publicly about our preferred actions. As you know, some of these instruments are callable. And we have choices to make about whether or not we call them to adjust to different situations. So I think that's an example of the types of levers that we have available to pull as the environment evolves. But from where we sit today with the numbers that I'm looking at, we have a pretty clean trajectory to get to where we want to be. I mean, I think fundamentally, we have had confidence in delivering our 17% ROTCE through the cycle. We talked a little bit over the last couple of quarters about at the time, some short-term headwinds to that, mostly as a function of the rate environment and a couple of other things. The investment plan is a strategic plan that recognizes that sort of confidence in the 17%. The fact that that moment may be getting pulled forward as a result of the Fed's reaction to the economy has no impact on how we think about spending. Hey Steve, so this is a fun question. So, let's nerd out a little bit. I'm sure Jamie will jump in. So look, I think we've talked a little bit about what happened in the prior cycle, right? So, you had QE, and then you had big expansion in bank deposits, system-wide expansion. And at the tail end of that cycle, you had RRP come in, and then RRP has gotten sort of quite big as QE finished. And so now, as you look at potentially kind of running that whole thing in reverse, you might actually expect that the first thing that would happen is that RRP would get drained and only later would bank deposits start to shrink. But I think you correctly point out some of the nuances in the Fed minutes. And when you sort of combine all the effects together, you realize that there's a lot of interacting forces here and is really, I think, very intelligent people differ on their predictions about what's going to happen here. And just to outline a couple of those. So, it's worth noting for starters that in general, industry-wide loan growth outlook is quite robust, and that should be a tailwind for system-wide deposit growth. So, as you noted, yes, QT will start in May in all likelihood for the minutes headwind. Then, you just have to look at what's going to happen in the front end of the curve, particularly in bills. So, the treasury has to make decisions about weighted average maturity and what makes sense there. There's obviously a little bit of shortage of short-dated collateral in the market right now. So, that might argue for wanting more supply there. The Fed has to make decisions about portfolio management. They talked in the minutes about using bill maturities to fill in gaps and so on and so forth. And so, those things are going to interact in various ways. I think, one thing that's worth noting though is that if you wind up in the state of the world where bank deposits drain sooner than people might have otherwise thought, in all likelihood, that's going to be the lower value non-operating-type deposits. So, in any case, we'll see. But to simplify it for a second, our base case remains modest growth in deposits for us as a company. And just pivoting away for a second from the system to us, from a share perspective, we've taken share in retail deposits, and we feel great about that. And in Wholesale, we've had some nice wins and a nice pipeline of deals there. So, that's the current thinking on that topic. It really is that... I mean, I think, look, we -- no one likes to be complacent about this type of stuff. And obviously, in this environment, everyone's looking very closely everywhere for any risks and trying to see around the corner. But as of right now, we're really not seeing anything of concern in the kind of spot metrics, so to speak. In short, no. It is an interesting question as you look across our customer base, particularly in card and you sort of -- that heavily debated question of real income growth and gas prices and what's that doing to consumer balance sheets. And so, we're watching that, especially in the kind of LMI segment of our customer base. But right now, we're not actually seeing anything that gives us reason to worry. Yes, Glenn (sic) [Gerard], it's really a lot more general than that. So just to repeat, 900 build, 300 name specific, primarily related to Russia-associated individual names. The other 600 is portfolio level. And as Jamie just said, it simply reflects increasing the probability from a very low probability to a slightly higher probability of a -- you might call it, Volcker-style, Fed-induced recession in response to the current inflationary environment, which obviously is in part driven by commodity price increases, which are in part driven by the war in Ukraine, so. But it's not a super micro portfolio level thing, except to the extent that our models handle that. It's a top-down modification of the probabilistic ways. Yes. I mean, I think that, obviously, we always try to grow revenue sort of independently of anything else. I think the large point here is, yes, there are some things that can be done to mitigate this. But the big picture is that the central case path is one that gets us to where we want to be when we need to be there in terms of CET1 and leverage. And if things don't play out as along the lines of the central case, we have tools and levers available to adjust across a range of dimensions, so. Okay, Mike. So, let me take this capital one. So first, let's not talk about asset caps. That's just not a meaningful thing. I think that's a distraction, and the terminology is unhelpful. Then, in terms of the leverage ratio, just remember that the denominator of that number is so big that it actually takes like pretty big moves to move the ratio. So, 5.20 is actually still pretty far away from 5%. And of course, there are relatively easy to use tools to address that as well as was alluded to earlier. In addition, I do think it's worth just reminding everyone of how the ERI restrictions work now relative to how they were at the beginning of the crisis. Just briefly, just to remember that based on the redefinition, if you drop into the regulatory buffer zone, you're subject to a 60% restriction, which based on our recent historical net income generation still gives us like ample, ample capacity to pay the dividend and so on. So, it's obviously not part of the plan, but it's just worth remembering that the cliff effects that we had in there at the beginning of the pandemic are no longer there. And then, in terms of buybacks, just a reminder that the $30 billion authorization is a nontime-bounded SEC requirement. It's not the old CCAR standard. So, it's just a signal that we want to have that capacity and that flexibility. But it doesn't really say that much about how much we're actually planning to do in the near term. Yes. Let's talk about buybacks for a second. So in the kind of post-SCB world, we haven't been guiding a lot on the pace of buybacks, mainly because, as you know, they're at the bottom of our capital stack. So, we're focused on investing in the business, providing capital to support growing RWA, acquisitions when they make sense, et cetera, et cetera. And buybacks are -- an output. As we've discussed, in the current environment, the rate of buybacks is clearly going to be less than it was in the 2021 period as a result of the interaction of all those effects. And that's a good thing. It means that we have better uses for the capital. And if things evolve one way or the other, then the rate of buybacks will be an output, but it's one of the tools in the toolkit. And I would take it one step further. I think the whole paradigm of saying it's a 10 standard deviation event is nai\u0308ve, right? We know the returns are not normally distributed. We know that. Regulators know that. The capital framework recognizes that in a broad variety of ways, including things like stress. So I don't think -- of course, you can't predict where and in which asset class and in which particular moment you're going to see these types of fat tail events. But the framework recognizes in a range of ways that that's the case. And that's how we manage risk, and that's how we're... Yes. And Steve (sic) [Matthew], just to -- just go one level deeper there for a second, right? So you talk about deployment. Of course, as Jamie says, we're always going to take relative value opportunities in the portfolio. Mortgage spreads have widened, there's interesting stuff to do. So in that sense, yes, deployment out of cash into various sorts of spread product that looks more interesting, we do that all the time. The high-level simple question of buying duration as Jamie says, balance sheets extended a little bit. That was never -- we were never planning to do that much of that anyway. And frankly, given the timing and expected speed of the rate hikes, increasingly, it just kind of doesn't matter that much. And yes, so I think it's helpful to keep that in mind. Yes, sure. So, you'll remember in the fourth quarter that we talked about the outlook based on sort of high single-digit loan growth for the year. And this quarter, we've roughly seen that. Interestingly, it's a little bit more driven by Wholesale this quarter, which sort of brings us to your question of card. So overall card loan growth is reasonably robust when you adjust for seasonality and so on. And that's really primarily driven by spend, which, as you know, is very robust. The question inside of that is then what's going on with revolve. And I think our core revolve thesis of getting back to the pre-pandemic levels of revolving balances by the end of the year is still in place to a good approximation. At the margin, we probably saw the like takeoff moment delayed by 6 weeks or so because of Omicron. But some of that's reaccelerating now. We see that in some of the March numbers. So, we'll see how it goes. But also just a reminder that there's a very, very close linkage between what we see in revolve and what we see in charge-offs. And so, in the moments where revolve is lagging potentially, certainly that was true throughout the pandemic period relative to what we thought. We also saw exceptionally low charge-offs. So, on a bottom line basis, the run rate performance, there's significant offset there. But the core thesis is still there. Spend is robust. We are seeing spend down some of the cash buffers in the customer segment that tends to revolve. So, more or less as anticipated, I would say. Yes. I mean, you know that we're going to be reluctant to like predict the next three quarters of trading performance. Yes, obviously, yes. But just to your point about normalization, right? We've been saying that, of course, we expect some normalization. The question is, if you define normalization as a return to kind of like 2019-type trading run rate levels, we never expected that because there's been a bunch of organic growth in the background, some share gains. And we had said that as we emerge from the pandemic and monetary policy normalized, that was going to add volatility to the markets and that with any luck and good risk management, that would net-net help a little bit mitigate what we might otherwise expect in terms of the drop from the very elevated levels that we saw during the pandemic. So, obviously, there are some particular things that played out this quarter, but one of those was more volatile rate market, and that helps a little bit. So yes, all else equal, the much more dynamic environment right now would mute the normalization you would see otherwise. But our core case is still that the pandemic year period market's performance was -- is not repeatable. Yes, we do see pretty nice loan growth in the commercial bank. I mean, there's a bunch of different factors there, could be some inventory effects and so on, but we'll see. But yes. All right. Thanks, Erika. Thanks very much. May 23rd."

            "name": "Jamie Dimon",
            "content": "Yes. So yes, Betsy, so that number, the double-digit relating just to Wholesale Payments, not to consumer payments, which obviously, we already have a fairly significant share. And we've gone from 4.5% to something a little bit north of 7% over the last five years. And we're just building out. And I gave some examples and I'd give a lot and then you have Investor Day coming up, we're building all the things we need, real-time payments, certain blockchain-type things. While it's a couple of acquisitions, they're building out our Wholesale capabilities to do a far better job for clients globally around the world and supported by what I'd say very good cyber and risk controls, which clients really need too, by the way. So, it's kind of across the board. It's nothing mystical about it, but it's an area we want to win in. I wasn't meaning to put a time frame on it, but I would say five years. You'll get more update on this at Investor Day. No, no, no. We don't look at that way like we're reinvesting NII. We -- the investing stuff, we look at all the time we're investing, and we're investing a lot of money for the future kind of across the board. But that's not why you're saying... So, the answer is we don't know. Okay? And you guys read economies [ph] reports, but the fact is initially probably won't come out of deposits. Over time, it will come out of Wholesale and then maybe consumer. We're prepared for that. It doesn't actually mean that much to us in the short run. And the beta effectively, we don't expect to be that different than was in the past. There are a lot of pluses and minuses. You can argue a whole bunch of different ways, but the fact it won't be that much different, at least the first 100 basis-point increase. Yes. So, I think the implied curve now is like 2.5% at the end of the year and maybe 3% at the end of 2023. And look, no one knows. And obviously, everyone does their forecast. I think it's going to be more than that. Okay? I give you a million different reasons why because of inflation and just about deposits. And we've never been through ever QT like this. So, this is a new thing for the world and I think is more substantially important than other people think because the huge change of flows of funds is going to create as people change their investment portfolio. So, we're going to be fine because we're going to certainly help our customers and gain share. So, what does it do for JPMorgan Chase? JPMorgan Chase, we'll be fine. We got plenty of capital, all great margins. We already have the returns we want and all things like that. So, I just -- I would just be cautious. I think what you should expect is volatile markets. Again, that's okay for us. And the Fed -- we think the Fed needs to do, they need to do to try to manage this economy and try to get to a soft landing, if possible. No, don't expect that. Yes. I don't want to spend a lot of time on CECL. I think it's a complete waste of time. Basically, all we said is the chance of an adverse or severe adverse event is 10% higher than it was before. That's all we did, very basic. And that led to a big... And we don't know, and it's a guess. It's probability weighted, hypothetical, multiyear scenarios that -- we do the best we can, but to spend a lot of time on earnings calls about CECL swings is a waste of time. It's got nothing to do with the underlying business. Charge-offs are extraordinarily good, as a matter of fact, way better than they should be. I mean, middle market, 1 basis point, credit card 1.5. We would have told you in the past that the best it'll ever be is 2.5. So, credit is very good. That will get worse. NII is going to get much better. Things are going to normalize. We're still earning 16% or 17% on tangible equity. And obviously, you have -- yes. I don't -- Glenn, with all due respect, I do not believe it is. Just spread widening, a little bit less liquidity. One of the things I hated when CECL came out is that we spend a lot of time in every call yapping about CECL. I just think it's a huge mistake for all of us to spend too much time on it. Mike, I would just add, if you look at liquidity and capital, it's extraordinary. And we don't want to have buffers on top of buffers. So, we're going to manage this pretty tightly over time. And obviously, when you have AOCI and earnings and CECL, all that, but being conscious of all of that, we can manage through that. And we've done some acquisitions this year. And so, -- and plus, we are adding -- we're planning to have more capital for the increase in G-SIFI down the road, which reduced stock buyback and -- but the amount -- I look at the amount of liquidity, the earnings, the capital, that's the stuff that really matters. And at the end of the day, it's driving customers. We serve customers, which is why we're here. We don't serve managing SLR. That's kind of an output of stuff we do. And so -- and then your question about -- I think it was about recession basically. Yes, do you want to repeat the question? Yes, I don't. But I just want to question this. First of all, I can't forecast the future any more than anyone else. And the Fed forecasted and everyone forecasted, and everyone's wrong all the time, and I think it's a mistake. We run the company to serve clients through thick or thin. That's what we do. We know there will be ups. We know there will be down. We know the weather is going to change and all that stuff like that. What I have pointed out in my letter is very strong underlying growth, right now, which will go on. It's not stoppable. The consumer has money. They pay down credit card debt. Confidence isn't high, but the fact that they have money, they're spending their money. They have $2 trillion still in their savings and checking accounts, business are in good shape. Home prices are up. Credit is extraordinarily good. So you have this -- that's one factor. That's going to continue in the second quarter, third quarter. And I -- after that, it's hard to predict. You've got two other very large countervailing factors, which you guys are all completely aware of. One is inflation/QE/QT. You've never seen that before. I'm simply pointing out that we've -- those are storm clouds on the horizon that may disappear, they may not. That's a fact. And I'm quite conscious of that fact, and I do expect that alone will create volatility and concerns and endless printing and endless headlines and stuff like that. And the second is war in Ukraine. I pointed out in my letter that war in Ukraine. Usually wars don't necessarily affect the global economy in the short run. But there are exceptions to that. This may very well be one of them. I don't -- I'm not looking at this on a static basis. Okay? So you're looking at this war in Ukraine and sanctions. Things are unpredictable. Wars are unpredictable. Wars have unpredictable outcome. You've already seen in oil markets. The oil markets are precarious. Okay? So I pointed that out over and over that people don't understand that those things can change dramatically for either physical reasons, cyber reasons or just supply-demand. And so, that's another huge cloud in the horizon, and I -- we're prepared for it. We understand it. We're just -- I can't tell you the outcome of it. I hope those things all disappear and go away. We have a soft landing, and the Board is resolved. Okay? I just wouldn't bet on all that. I just -- and of course, being a risk manager, we're going to get through all that. We're going to serve our clients, and we're going to gain share. We're going to come to that earning tremendous returns on capital like we have in the past. We've already told you, we're helping our clients get through this. We had a little bit lost this quarter but we manage through it. We'll do postmortems on both what we think we did wrong and what the LME could do differently later. We're not going to do it now. In my life, I've seen so many 10 standard deviation events [indiscernible]. Obviously, we're aware of that all the time in everything we do. So, we do CCAR once a year, as you guys see. But we actually run 100 different various stress tests every week with extreme movements and things. And that's what we do. And we're always -- you're always going to be a little surprise somewhere, but we're pretty conscious of those risks. And all events like this, we always look at -- but it doesn't have to happen to us. It can happen to someone else. We still analyze everything that maybe we were on the wrong side of something, too. But at the end of the day, in all of our businesses, we are here to serve clients all the time. That means taking rational, thoughtful, disciplined risk to do that. Guys, we're just talking about interest rates going up maybe more than 3%. Convexity is going up. AOCI is going up, all these -- there are all these various reasons not to do that. We're not going to do it just to give you a little bit more NII next quarter. And I'll just add to that. I cannot foresee any scenario at all where you're not going to have a lot of volatility in markets going forward. We've already spoken about the enormous strength of the economy, QT, inflation, war, commodity prices, there's almost no chance that you want to have volatile markets. That could be good or bad for trading, but some [indiscernible] change won't happen. And I think people should be prepared for that. Yes, in general because as people are spending money and you need to produce more goods and all that, yes, and generally see CapEx going up. And I forgot the exact number. You better off looking at our great accounting forecast -- than asking me. And we see in the borrowing a little bit... It's very hard to tell. There was some improvement and then there was Ukraine. And now, it's all mixed again. So, it's hard to tell. We'll leave that to Investor Day. Well, thank you very much. See you, I guess, at Investor Day. Okay. Goodbye."

Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go to the live presentation, please standby. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.\nJeremy Barnum: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $9.3 billion, EPS of $3.04 on revenue of $39.9 billion, and delivered an ROTCE of 15%. These results included the $2.9 billion FDIC special assessment and $743 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate. On Page 2, we have more on our fourth quarter results. Similar to prior quarters, we have called out the impact of First Republic, where relevant. You'll also note that we have now allocated certain deposits, which were previously in CCB to the appropriate lines of business. For the quarter, First Republic contributed $1.9 billion of revenue, $890 million of expense, and $647 million of net income. Now, focusing on the firmwide fourth quarter results, excluding First Republic. Revenue of $38.1 billion was up $2.5 billion or 7% year-on-year. NII, ex-Markets was up $2.2 billion or 11%, predominantly driven by higher rates. NIR, ex-Markets was up $139 million or 1% and Markets revenue was up $141 million or 2%. Expenses of $23.6 billion were up $4.6 billion or 24% year-on-year, predominantly driven by the FDIC special assessment and higher compensation, including wage inflation and growth in front office and technology. And credit costs were $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.2 billion, and a net reserve build for $474 million. Net charge-offs were up $1.3 billion, predominantly driven by Card and single-name exposures in Wholesale, which were largely previously reserved. The net reserve build was primarily driven by loan growth in Card and the deterioration in the outlook related to commercial real-estate valuations in the Commercial Banking. Looking at the full-year results on Page 3. The firm reported net income of $50 billion, EPS of $16.23, and revenue of $162 billion, and we delivered an ROTCE of 21%. Onto balance sheet and capital on Page 4. We ended the quarter with CET1 ratio of 15%, up 70 basis points versus the prior quarter, primarily driven by net income, AOCI gains and lower RWA, partially offset by a continued modest pace of capital distributions as the firm builds towards the proposed Basel III Endgame requirements. Now, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 5. Total debit and credit card spend was up 7% year-on-year, driven by strong account growth and consumer spend remained stable. Turning now to the financial results, excluding First Republic. CCB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $17 billion, which was up 8% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 6% year-on-year, reflecting higher NII on higher rates, largely offset by lower deposits, with average balances down 8% year-on-year. Client investment assets were up 25%, driven by market performance and strong net inflows. In fact, it's been a record year for retail net new money. In Home Lending revenue was up $230 million, predominantly driven by the absence of an MSR loss this quarter versus the prior year and higher NII. Moving to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 8% year-on-year, driven by higher card services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 14% due to strong account acquisition and continued normalization of revolve. And in auto, originations were $9.9 billion, up 32% as we gained market share while retaining strong margins. Expenses of $8.7 billion were up 10% year-on-year, largely driven by compensation, including an increase in employees, primarily in bankers, advisors, and technology, and wage inflation, as well as continued investments in marketing and technology. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.2 billion, largely driven by net charge-offs which were up $791 million year-on-year, predominantly due to continued normalization in card. The net reserve build of $538 million reflected loan growth in card. Next, the CIB on Page 6. The CIB reported net income of $2.5 billion on revenue of $11 billion. Investment banking revenue of $1.6 billion was up 13% year-on-year. IB fees were also up 13% year-on-year and we ended the year ranked number one with a wallet share of 8.8%. And advisory fees were up 2%. Underwriting fees were up significantly compared to a weak prior year quarter with debt up 21% and equity up 30%. We are starting the year with a healthy pipeline and we are encouraged by the level of capital markets activity, but announced M&A remains a headwind, and the extent as well as the timing of capital markets normalization remains uncertain. Payments revenue was $2.3 billion, up 10% year-on-year. Excluding equity investments, it was flat as fee growth was predominantly offset by deposit-related client credits. Moving to Markets, total revenue was $5.8 billion, up 2% year-on-year. Fixed income was a record fourth quarter, up 8%. It was another strong quarter in our securitized products business, which was partially offset by lower revenue and rates coming off a strong quarter last year. Equity markets was down 8%, driven by lower revenue in derivatives and cash. Security services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 3% year-on-year. Expenses of $6.8 billion were up 4% year-on-year, predominantly driven by the timing of revenue-related compensation. Credit costs were $210 million, reflecting net charge-offs of $121 million and a net reserve build of $89 million. Moving to the Commercial Bank on Page 7. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.5 billion. Revenue of $3.7 billion was up 7% year-on-year, largely driven by higher NII, where the impact of rates was partially offset by lower deposit balances. Payments revenue of $2 billion was up 2% year-on-year driven by fee growth, largely offset by deposit-related client credits. Gross investment banking and markets revenue of $924 million was up 32% year-on-year, primarily reflecting increased capital markets and M&A activity. Expenses of $1.4 billion were up 9% year-on-year, driven by an increase in employees, including front office and technology investments, as well as higher volume-related expense, including the impact of new client acquisition. Average deposits were down 6% year-on-year, primarily driven by lower non-operating deposits as clients continue to opt for higher-yielding alternatives and flat quarter-on-quarter as client balances are seasonally higher at year-end. Loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were down 2%, reflecting lower revolver utilization and muted demand for new loans as clients remained cautious. And CRE loans were flat as higher rates continued to have an impact on originations and payoff activity. Finally, credit costs were $269 million, including net charge-offs of $127 million and a net reserve build of $142 million, driven by deterioration in our commercial real estate valuation outlook. And then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $925 million with pretax margin of 28%. Revenue of $4.7 billion was up 2% year-on-year, driven by higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, predominantly offset by lower NII. The decrease in NII reflects lower deposit margins and balances partially offset by wider spreads on loans. Expenses of $3.4 billion were up 11% year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, including performance-based incentives, continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, the impact of closing JPMorgan Asset Management China acquisition, and the continued investment in global shares. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $12 billion, positive across equities and fixed income, and $140 billion for the full year. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $49 billion for the quarter and net inflows of $242 billion for the full year. And we had record client asset net inflows of $489 billion for the year. AUM of $3.4 trillion and client assets of $5 trillion were both up 24% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter and deposits were up 7% quarter-on-quarter. Turning to Corporate on Page 9. Corporate reported a net loss of $689 million. Revenue of $1.8 billion was up $597 million year-on-year. NII of $2.5 billion was up $1.2 billion year-on-year due to the impact of higher rates and balance sheet mix. NIR was a net loss of $687 million compared to the net loss of $115 million, and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned upfront. And expenses of $3.4 billion were up $3 billion year-on-year, predominantly driven by the FDIC special assessment. With that, let's pivot to the outlook for 2024, starting with NII on Page 10. We expect 2024 NII ex-Markets to be approximately $88 billion. Going through the drivers, the outlook assumes that rates follow the forward curve, which currently includes six cuts this year. On deposits, we expect balances to be very modestly down from current levels. While lower rates should decrease repricing pressure, we remain asset sensitive, and therefore the lower rates will decrease NII, resulting in more normal deposit margins. We expect strong loan growth in Card to continue, but not at the same pace as 2023. Still, this should help offset some of the impact of lower rates. Outside of Card, loan growth will likely remain muted. It's important to note that we just reported a quarterly NII ex-Markets run rate of $94 billion. Combining that with the full-year guidance of approximately $88 billion implies meaningful sequential quarterly declines throughout 2024, consistent with what we've been telling you for some time. And keep in mind that many of the sources of uncertainty that we've highlighted previously surrounding the NII outlook remain. And on total NII, we expect it to be approximately $90 billion for the full-year, reflecting an increase in Markets NII which, as always, you should think of as largely offset in NIR. Now, let's turn to expenses on Page 11. We expect 2024 adjusted expense to be about $90 billion. You'll see on the slide we provided detail by line of business. Generally, you can see that both in dollar terms and in percentage terms, the expense growth is aligned to where the greatest opportunities are, both in terms of share and available returns. And of course, you'll hear more at Investor Day and between now and then. On the right-hand side of the page, we've highlighted some firmwide drivers. Thematically, the biggest driver is what I might call business growth writ large. Within that, narrowly defined volume and revenue-related growth represents about $1 billion of the increase across the company as a result of an improved NIR outlook, compared to about $400 million in 2023. But in addition, the ongoing growth of the company, which continues to produce share gains and additional profitability, is coming with increased expense across a range of categories. The quantum of investment increase is comparable to last year's increase and is driven by all the same themes, bankers, branches, advisors, technology as well as marketing. Net-net, First Republic produces a modest increase in expenses, but with a significantly lower 2024 exit run rate as the result of business integration efforts. Finally, despite significantly lower inflation outlook in the economy as a whole, we still see some residual effects of inflation flowing through most of our expense categories. It's worth noting that both the general business growth and investment growth include decisions that have been executed both in response to market conditions during 2023 and to support the future growth and profitability of the company. We've included the fourth quarter 2023 exit rate on the page to illustrate that a significant portion of the year-on-year increase in expense is already in the run rate. Now, let's turn to Page 12 and cover credit and wrap up. On credit, we continue to expect the 2024 card net charge-off rate to be below 3.5%, consistent with Investor Day guidance. So in closing, we shouldn't leave 2023 without noting what an outstanding year it was, producing record revenue and net income despite some notable significant items. We're very proud of what we accomplished this year and want to thank everyone who made it possible. At the same time, we emphasized throughout 2023 the extent to which we were over-earning, as indicated by an ROTCE that is 4% above our through-the-cycle target. As we turn to 2024, it shouldn't be surprising that our outlook has us beginning to march down the path towards normalization of our returns. But despite the expected dissipation of the 2023 tailwinds and the presence of significant economic and geopolitical uncertainties, we remain optimistic about this franchise's ability to produce superior returns through a broad range of environments. And this management team remains laser-focused on executing for shareholders, clients, and communities. And with that, let's open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] For our first question, it's coming from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.\nMatt O'Connor: Good morning. Thanks for all the comments on the net interest income. Any updates on that medium-term outlook that you've put out there?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, Matt, not particularly updating. I think you're referring to that $80 billion number that we put out there. And I wouldn't exactly describe that as an outlook. I think it's more just a number that we put out there to try to quantify a little bit the extent of the over-earning. So not particularly necessary to revise the number. But I just would point out again, as we highlighted on the page and as I highlighted in the prepared remarks, that when you look at that $94 billion exit rate and full-year guidance of $88 billion, that implies obviously exiting below $88 billion and some significant sequential decline. So in that sense, you can see us kind of marching on the path to that $80 billion. Whether we ever get to the $80 billion or not and when is maybe a topic for later in the year or next year.\nMatt O'Connor: Okay. And then just separately, you bought back a couple of billion dollars of stock this quarter. What's your thought process on buybacks, given the strong capital generation, but also some uncertainty on regulatory proposals?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, good question. I think you framed it exactly correctly in the sense that we obviously have a lot of buyback capacity in general based on organic capital generation. So the normal capital hierarchy will apply. But for now, we plan to remain on a modest base of buybacks consistent with that kind of $2 billion net buyback, a quarter number that we've talked about and that you've seen us do in light of probably the need to continue building to have a bit of a buffer, as you said, the uncertainty about the finalization of the rules. And also, just as a reminder, the SCB is probably a little bit low right now and has been quite volatile. So that's another factor that we need to keep in mind.\nMatt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you.\nJeremy Barnum: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of John McDonald from Autonomous Research. You may proceed.\nJohn McDonald: Thanks. Jeremy, could you give a little more color on what's baked into the loan loss reserve in terms of kind of weighted average assumptions and how any change in macro outlook played into the dynamics of the reserve builds and releases this quarter?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. Actually, John, this quarter, that's all like pretty quiet. So the weighted average unemployment rate in the numbers still 5.5%. We didn't have any really big revisions in the macro outlook driving the numbers. And our skew remains, as it has been a little bit skewed to the downside, just recognizing that we still see risks being elevated, which obviously you can see that skew, and the difference between the weighted average unemployment of 5.5% and what's in our central outlook, which I think is something like 4.6% peak of the current levels.\nJohn McDonald: Okay. And then just to follow up on the NII, could you give us some sensitivity to that outlook when you flex the amount of Fed cuts, what's the impact of a few Fed cuts, and how much does it matter for the first two versus if you're thinking four, five, six? I know it's complicated, but maybe a little bit of color on how sensitive you are to a couple of cuts might be helpful.\nJeremy Barnum: Sure. Yes. Happy to do that, John. So I think probably the best way to do this is to look at our EAR numbers. So, as you know, we don't update that until the Q, but on an estimated basis, it's going to be a little bit lower, I think something like $1.9 billion as opposed to $2.1 billion. So just round numbers, about $2 billion in EAR. I think empirically the number is maybe a little higher than that, just because even though we do model lags in the EAR, we've been seeing the lag effect be a little bit bigger, but just crudely, I think, as I noted, we do remain asset-sensitive. That's one way to quantify it. I would say the empirical number would maybe be a little higher than that, and hopefully, that gives you enough to work with.\nJohn McDonald: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed.\nJim Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Maybe just a follow-up in a different way on the NII question. Just in deposits, can you, Jeremy, discuss your assumptions on the reprice and migration thoughts? And then layering in, if we do get six cuts, does that start to change the dynamic around growth and deposits? How are you thinking about all that?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, both good questions. So let's do reprice first. So I think all else equal, this more dovish Fed environment and these six cuts has the effect of taking a little bit of pressure off the reprice, especially product level reprice. At the same time, we do continue to expect internal migration, particularly out of checking and savings into CDs, and in wholesale, a little bit of ongoing migration out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing. And that trajectory I would expect to continue even in a lower rate environment. So as a result, if you look at weighted average rate paid, for example, for the consumer deposit franchise, we would actually expect that number to be a little bit higher, just even in a world with six cuts. And that's actually intuitive when you think about it as people continue migrating into CDs. But maybe a little non-intuitive, if you're kind of trying to do beta-type math with change in rates and change in rate pay, it gets a little bit non-intuitive. And then in terms of balances. Yes, you'll note that I said that our outlook is for balances to be very modestly down, which when you consider that QT, despite the various speculations about having it slow down later in the year, continues, and that long growth in the system as a whole is expected to be quite muted. It's a pretty modest decline outlook consistent with the lower rates. So I kind of agree with you that this environment is, at the margin, a little bit more supportive for system-wide deposit balances. And then obviously, we continue to be optimistic about our ability to take share in deposits based on our customer value proposition across all of our different businesses.\nJim Mitchell: Right. Okay. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may proceed.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Hi, good morning. I guess maybe one question, looking at your statement, and I think Jamie is quoted as saying, as he sees the consumer as resilient and the market expecting a soft landing. I would love to hear. I'm not sure if Jamie's on the call, but maybe, Jeremy, I would love to hear your thoughts around do you believe that the outlook for a soft landing has increased. Is the market pricing incorrectly, or when you look at your customer base, are you still worried about the lagged effects of the rate hikes?\nJeremy Barnum: Right. Okay, Ebrahim. So I think a lot of those things aren't actually mutually exclusive. So, statement one, I think it's uncontroversial that the economic outlook has evolved to include a significantly higher probability of a soft landing. That's, I think, the consensus at this point. So whether you believe it or not is a separate issue. But I think that is the consensus. In terms of consumer resilience, I made some comments about this on the press call. The way we see it, the consumer is fine. All of the relevant metrics are now effectively normalized. And the question really, in light of the fact that cash buffers are now also normal, but that that means that consumers have been spending more than they're taking in, is how that spending behavior adjusts as we go into the new year in a world where their cash buffers are less comfortable than they were. So one can speculate about different trajectories that that could take. But I do think it's important to take a step back and remind ourselves that consistent with that soft landing view, just in the central case modeling, obviously we always worry about the tail scenarios is a very strong labor market. And a very strong labor market means all else equal, strong consumer credit. So that's how we see the world.\nEbrahim Poonawala: And maybe just taking that a step further, there has been concern around whether we see some of the CRE pain filtered into multifamily apartments. You all have a pretty large multifamily exposure, high quality. But just give us a sense of one, are you seeing any bleed-through of what we've seen in office in other areas of commercial real estate or any particular parts of C&I lending? Thank you.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. So good question on the multifamily. And the short answer is that for us, it's pretty uncontroversially, no bleed-through. And the reason is that while there is, we do - we are aware of some of the pressure on multifamily that's in kind of different markets from the ones that we are actually big in. So it's higher-end stuff in much less supply-constrained markets that is under more pressure. And as you know, our multifamily portfolio is much more affordable, supply-constrained markets. And so the performance there remains really very robust.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. You may proceed.\nErika Najarian: Hi. Good morning. My first question is a follow-up on Matt's with regarding the buyback. You printed 15% CET1 in the quarter. Your - on a net basis, net to RWA growth, your net income produces 51 basis points every quarter. Again, that's net of RWA growth. I'm wondering what guideposts you're looking for, Jeremy, in terms of that buyback increasing from that $2 billion a quarter. Do we need to wait for B3 finalization, which seems like it could be quite delayed? Or will having clarity in the June DFAST results, you mentioned the SCB sort of be enough that you could reconsider this pace over the medium-term?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, Erika, it's a good question, and I understand what you're asking - why you're asking it. I think the answer is going to be a little bit unsatisfying, which is that this is classic decision-making under uncertainty, and it's kind of a probabilistic cloud of a variety of different factors. But all the ingredients that you've listed are the right ingredients, right? Very strong organic capital generation, uncertainty about the finalization of the rule, uncertainty about the SCB requirements, and obviously our normal capital hierarchy, which is that buybacks are always at the bottom of the hierarchy after we're done using the capital for our other priorities. So I think what I said previously stands, which is that we're sticking with a modest pace for now, but obviously, we have a lot of flexibility to adjust that whenever we want under the current regime, and we may well do that.\nErika Najarian: Thanks. And just as a follow-up, the $90 billion in expenses for 2024, does that contemplate a significant increase or the comeback of investment banking that everybody seems to be expecting for '24?\nJeremy Barnum: A little bit of that is in there. Yes. So you would see that we often talk about the volume and revenue-related category, and I think in my prepared remarks, you will have noted that I talked about $1 billion increase in that category year-on-year as a result of an improved NIR outlook. So the hope and expectation of a continued rebound in the investment banking wallet, and our share of that is part of that.\nErika Najarian: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.\nMike Mayo: Hi. You're guiding to $90 billion of expenses. That's up $7 billion year-over-year. Seems like quite a big increase. And if you could just give some color on that. I know we've been through this before, two years ago with the big increase in expenses and without a lot of visibility. So if you could just upfront give us visibility. How much of that is due to incentive pay? How much is that due to tech? How much is that due to AI? And what are the expected returns to get from that $7 billion pickup? Thanks.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, Mike, thanks for the question. And - yes, and of course, you will, as I noted, be hearing more from us at Investor Day and between now and Investor Day. But I will take a little bit of extra time here to answer your question, because you're right, it's important to give you the transparency. And I'm going to follow the structure that we used on the page and go through each line of business. So starting with CCB, it's the biggest dollar driver overall. It's an 8% increase year-on-year, which is about the same as we had last year. One key driver is the branch strategy and the associated staff for that. In 2023, we built 166 new branches and we're planning about a similar number this year. Marketing is also a driver. We're seeing great opportunities, great demand and engagement in our card products and so that shows up in marketing. And as you well know, our wealth strategy and CCB remains a big focus and priority. I think it's worth noting here, right, that as we've talked about and as you know Mike, some of our investments are designed to produce short-term payoffs and some of them are much longer-term and some of them are just table stakes. But we actually see quite a bit of evidence of current payoffs in our current results in the CCB investment. So for example, in 2023, we had 2 million net new checking accounts, we had an 8% growth in active card accounts, and over the last three years, we've increased deposit market share by 180 basis points. So as we've often said about the company as a whole, we're very happy to be producing very good current returns and growth while investing for the future. In AWM, continued client advisor hiring is a key driver, as well as making sure that both the advisors and all of their new clients have the support that they need. And a little bit to the prior question, in AWM we also have a little bit of volume and revenue-related driver tied to an improved revenue outlook. The Commercial Bank is an interesting story in the sense that about half of it is the exit rate impact of ads that we did in the middle of the year based on market disruption and all the kind of new clients and new loans that we saw and the need to support that across the entire ecosystem, as well as the fact that that created an opportunity in the middle of the year to accelerate our long-standing and pre-existing innovation economy strategy. So we took some opportunities to onboard some key teams in different parts of the franchise. And then as you look into 2024, it's really pretty consistent themes for the ones that we had before, including hiring bankers both domestically and internationally. The CIB story is a little bit different. The percentage growth there is lower, which recognizes, I think, both our very, very strong share positions as a starting point and also the fact that we've been investing quite aggressively for some time in the payments business, which has produced meaningful payoffs already there in terms of significant share gains. So as a result, the biggest driver in the CIB is really generic inflation, including labor, as well as, again, to the prior question, volume and revenue-related increases tied to the improved NIR outlook. And I do want to say for the avoidance of doubt, that despite all of this, our core strategy of looking very granularly at all the areas of strength and weakness and making sure that we're upgrading where appropriate to have absolutely the best talent in the CIB remains fully in effect. Finally, you'll note that I haven't actually talked about technology in any of the businesses. And that's actually because even though all of the businesses in various ways are investing in technology and spending money on it, the drivers are actually very consistent across the entire firm, even though it's very bottoms-up driven. And those drivers are consistent with what they've been, new products, features, and customer platforms, as well as modernization. So that's happening throughout the company, both at the app level and otherwise. And I will say, actually, in closing, talking about technology, which I think is interesting, that to the point about a driver being growth writ large, one of the things that we see is higher volume-related technology expense throughout the company. So thanks for the question, Mike. It was a good opportunity to give you guys a bit more color here.\nMike Mayo: Okay. I have a short follow-up. I'm still here.\nJeremy Barnum: Sure.\nMike Mayo: Yes. Can you just talk about the impact of AI on your technology approach? And I know I asked you this before, and you said you're spending it, you're being careful, you want to see a return on your dollars. But how much difference can this make? How big is your tech budget last year? How much should it be this year? How much should AI make a difference? Just a little bit more meat on the tech bones.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, sure. So let me address the AI point, and I think maybe I won't go into a lot of quantitative detail on this stuff, and I'll save that for Investor Day, if you don't mind. But I will address the AI point. So, as you may be aware, we actually have Teresa Heitsenrether now running the AI strategy for the company as a member of the Operating Committee, which I think is an indication of the priority that we place on this and in partnership with Lori and all of the technology organization. So I think that - I think of this as being a little bit barbelled, where on the one hand, we're very excited about this. There's clearly some very significant opportunities, not for nothing, starting with technology developers themselves, in terms of the opportunity for significantly increased productivity there. At the same time, we're JPMorgan Chase. We're not going to be chasing shiny objects here in AI. We want to do this in an extremely disciplined way. It's very commercial and very linked to tangible outcomes. And so the current focus is on making sure we have a contained, well-chosen list of high-impact use cases and that we're throwing resources at those in the right way that's extremely pragmatic and disciplined, and we're holding ourselves accountable for actual results.\nMike Mayo: All right. Thank you.\nJeremy Barnum: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.\nGerard Cassidy: Hi, Jeremy. How are you?\nJeremy Barnum: Hi, Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy: Jeremy, coming back to your outlook and forecast for net interest income for the upcoming year with the six Fed fund rate cuts that you guys are assuming. Can you give us a little insight why you're assuming six cuts? Is it your customers are telling you that their businesses are weaker, or is it your just economic outlook, the forward curve? Can you give us something behind why you're assuming so many rate cuts?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, Gerard, I wish the answer were more interesting, but it's just our practice. We just always use the forward curve for our outlook, and that's what's in there.\nGerard Cassidy: Okay. Very good. And then as a follow-up, obviously, you pointed out also in the outlook, you're going to have some deposit attrition. You had some, of course, in 2023. Can you guys give us some insights on the impact QT is having on the deposit base for your organization? And second, are you surprised that it hasn't - QT hasn't been more disruptive to the liquidity in the markets?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, good question, Gerard. I mean, I think you've heard Jamie talk about this a lot. QT is obviously a big focus, and one of the complicating elements that we have in the current environment. I think that the math is the math in the sense that QT all else equal is withdrawing from system-wide deposits. In the last six months of this year, that's been offset helpfully by a reduction in the size of RRP. And so that's been supportive of system-wide deposits. As we go into 2024, RRP is at lower levels, and so that may be a little bit less of a tailwind. But it's also the case, as you know, that there's - the market's expectation is that the QT is going to start slowing down at some point this year. So - and we still have reasonable levels of reserves and some cushion from RRP. So that's part of the reason that our outlook is for deposits to be modestly down with the shrinkage in system-wide deposits maybe partially offset by our belief that we can take some share. But also I think the second half of this year is going to be interesting to watch in terms of what the Fed does.\nGerard Cassidy: Great. Thank you.\nJeremy Barnum: Thanks, Gerard.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Manan Gosalia from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\nManan Gosalia: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. There's been a lot of talk about capital markets rebound. You noted you're starting the year with a healthy pipeline. Can you give us some more color on what you're seeing there and how the rate in - how the change in the rate environment is changing the conversations that you're having across M&A, ECM and DCM?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, sure. So, as you know, all else equal, this more dovish rate environment is of course supportive for capital markets. So if you go into the details a little bit, if you start with ECM, that helps higher, and the recent rally in the equity markets helps. I think there have been some modest challenges with the 2023 IPO vintage in terms of post-launch performance or whatever. So that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin in terms of converting the pipeline, but I'm not too concerned about that in general. So I would expect to see rebound there. In DCM, again, all else equal, lower rates are clearly supportive. One of the nuances there is the distinction between the absolute level of rates and the rate of change. So sometimes you see corporates seeing and expecting lower rates and therefore waiting to refinance in the hope of even lower rates. So that can go both ways. And then M&A is a slightly different dynamic. I think there's a couple of nuances there. One, as you obviously know, announced volume was lower this year, and so that will be a headwind in reported revenues in 2024 all else equal. And of course, we are in an environment of M&A regulatory headwinds, as has been heavily discussed. But having said that, I think we're seeing a bit of pickup in deal flow and I would expect the environment to be a bit more supportive.\nManan Gosalia: Great. And on the flip side, in C&I you spoke about lower revolver utilization, more muted demand. What would it take for that to rebound? Do you think it accelerates from here if rates come down, or is there room for this to slow even further if the capital markets open up even more?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, it's a good question. I mean, I think, as you say, it's a little bit of a - I mean, I wouldn't necessarily say that like lack of debt market access in the last year, that was more of an earlier effect in terms of having that driver revolver utilization. I think the main driver there is just a little bit of residual anxiety in the C suites, which increases as the companies get smaller in size. So there's really going to be a function of how 2024 plays out. The softer the landing is, the more supported the utilization should be I would think. If things turn out a little bit worse, I think management teams are going to be incrementally more cautious about CapEx and so on, and so you might see utilization even lower.\nManan Gosalia: Great. Thank you.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. You may proceed.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi. Thank you. So I want to get your perspective on private credit overall. The industry saw a lot of growth, but it's only so big relative to the banking market. I think there's been a lot of share shift in direct lending and middle market lending, but now you're starting to see more in asset-backed finance and you're seeing them raise a lot of money in infrastructure and energy. So my question to you is, how big of a trend is this? How much do you think about it as cyclical versus secular? And most importantly, how does JPMorgan adapt and participate?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. Thanks, Glenn. So I think the last part of your question, as you say, is the most important part, which is, this as an important factor in the competitive dynamic and what is one of the key things that we offer as a company. So it is a meaningful shift in the environment. It's something that we've been watching for some time. We've made some enhancements and some new initiatives to ensure that we can compete effectively both in our traditional syndicated lending businesses, but also go head to head with the private credit providers and these types of unitranche structures, if and when that's what the client actually wants. It tends to be a trade-off between the best possible pricing versus speed and certainty of execution. And we can provide both off our sort of exceptionally strong long-time DCM franchise. So that's been a priority. And we're actually already starting to see some results from that across both the Commercial Bank and the CIB, with certain client segments. And in the bigger picture, of course, in the context of the Basel III Endgame, people talk a lot about the risk of certain lending activity getting pushed out of the regulated perimeter. It's important to be clear, right, these are important clients of ours too. We compete with them. They're also clients. And in the end, our point here is just people, and regulators in particular, should just be aware of the likely consequences of what's happening here and make sure that the results are intentional and that we're looking around the corner a little bit.\nGlenn Schorr: Anything specific on asset back? It's an important part of your business too. Do you see it following the same path as direct lending has?\nJeremy Barnum: It's interesting. I haven't heard much about that, Glenn, so we can look into it for you. But to be honest, the fact that I haven't heard much makes me think that it's maybe not such a big driver right now.\nGlenn Schorr: Okay. Cool. Thank you for that.\nOperator: And for our final question, we'll go to the line of Charles Peabody from Portales Partners. You may proceed.\nCharles Peabody: Thank you. I have a question about the role that First Republic plays in your NII forecast. I'm assuming because you'll have a full year in '24 First Republic, that their contribution of NII will be up, let's say from $3.7 billion this year to $5 billion to $6 billion next year. But given that you're forecasting six rate cuts, is that a detractor to your assumptions of NII from First Republic? Or - I mean, you have that FDIC note, and then you also have a significant amount of adjustable rate mortgages that I assume are repricing upwards. So if you're talking about rate cuts, that would hurt your NII forecast from First Republic, I'm guessing. But if rates stay higher for longer, wouldn't First Republic be a much bigger contributor? So talk about the sensitivities of First Republic there.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. Thanks, Charlie. So one thing that we said when we kind of gave First Republic guidance at Investor Day earlier this year is that while we understood the need to track that, and we've been splitting out First Republic in our reported results in order to improve period on period comparability, we kind of want to stay out of the business of guiding on First Republic. And so we really focused on having our guidance be firm-wide, including First Republic, now that everything is embedded in the franchise. Having said that, let me just react to a couple of things that you said. So again, I don't want to get into like micro validation one way or the other of some of your back-of-the-envelope math, but we did have some accelerated pull to par on some of the accretion of some of the loans that we purchased this year. So I think the annualization that you're doing is maybe a bit high for the 2024 number. And then from a sensitivities perspective, I actually think I can simplify the math for you a little bit and just kind of direct you to the EAR for my response to the prior question, because that EAR fully includes all of the First Republic assets and liabilities with all of their various dynamics. And so I think that's kind of like an easier way to think about it for the company.\nCharles Peabody: Just to make sure I understood what you're saying. So you have NII ex-Markets going from $94 billion to $88 billion. Within that, would the contribution from First Republic be down as well, or up?\nJamie Dimon: It was kind of head-matched the day we did it, so.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. I mean, I can probably answer that question if I think about it for a second, but it sort of violates my prior statement that I really don't want to get into the business of guiding on First Republic. If I do the big picture, right, so big picture, 2023, we had eight months of First Republic NII. 2024, we're going to have 12. So all else equal, there's calendarization in there. What's also true is that in 2023, as a result of the impact of the NII of the pull to par of certain relatively short-dated assets that we fair valued at a meaningful discount as part of the transaction, that sort of - that pulled to par happens quite quickly and therefore probably juice the 2023 number a little bit. So therefore, straight annualization is probably not the right way to think about it. Then you just get into the questions about the FTP and the funding and whatever, and then it's just like too complicated. So I'd rather not go there.\nCharles Peabody: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: And we do have no further questions at this time.\nJeremy Barnum: Okay. Thanks very much, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you all for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time and enjoy the rest of your day.",

            "name": "Jeremy Barnum",
            "content": "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $9.3 billion, EPS of $3.04 on revenue of $39.9 billion, and delivered an ROTCE of 15%. These results included the $2.9 billion FDIC special assessment and $743 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate. On Page 2, we have more on our fourth quarter results. Similar to prior quarters, we have called out the impact of First Republic, where relevant. You'll also note that we have now allocated certain deposits, which were previously in CCB to the appropriate lines of business. For the quarter, First Republic contributed $1.9 billion of revenue, $890 million of expense, and $647 million of net income. Now, focusing on the firmwide fourth quarter results, excluding First Republic. Revenue of $38.1 billion was up $2.5 billion or 7% year-on-year. NII, ex-Markets was up $2.2 billion or 11%, predominantly driven by higher rates. NIR, ex-Markets was up $139 million or 1% and Markets revenue was up $141 million or 2%. Expenses of $23.6 billion were up $4.6 billion or 24% year-on-year, predominantly driven by the FDIC special assessment and higher compensation, including wage inflation and growth in front office and technology. And credit costs were $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.2 billion, and a net reserve build for $474 million. Net charge-offs were up $1.3 billion, predominantly driven by Card and single-name exposures in Wholesale, which were largely previously reserved. The net reserve build was primarily driven by loan growth in Card and the deterioration in the outlook related to commercial real-estate valuations in the Commercial Banking. Looking at the full-year results on Page 3. The firm reported net income of $50 billion, EPS of $16.23, and revenue of $162 billion, and we delivered an ROTCE of 21%. Onto balance sheet and capital on Page 4. We ended the quarter with CET1 ratio of 15%, up 70 basis points versus the prior quarter, primarily driven by net income, AOCI gains and lower RWA, partially offset by a continued modest pace of capital distributions as the firm builds towards the proposed Basel III Endgame requirements. Now, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 5. Total debit and credit card spend was up 7% year-on-year, driven by strong account growth and consumer spend remained stable. Turning now to the financial results, excluding First Republic. CCB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $17 billion, which was up 8% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 6% year-on-year, reflecting higher NII on higher rates, largely offset by lower deposits, with average balances down 8% year-on-year. Client investment assets were up 25%, driven by market performance and strong net inflows. In fact, it's been a record year for retail net new money. In Home Lending revenue was up $230 million, predominantly driven by the absence of an MSR loss this quarter versus the prior year and higher NII. Moving to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 8% year-on-year, driven by higher card services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 14% due to strong account acquisition and continued normalization of revolve. And in auto, originations were $9.9 billion, up 32% as we gained market share while retaining strong margins. Expenses of $8.7 billion were up 10% year-on-year, largely driven by compensation, including an increase in employees, primarily in bankers, advisors, and technology, and wage inflation, as well as continued investments in marketing and technology. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.2 billion, largely driven by net charge-offs which were up $791 million year-on-year, predominantly due to continued normalization in card. The net reserve build of $538 million reflected loan growth in card. Next, the CIB on Page 6. The CIB reported net income of $2.5 billion on revenue of $11 billion. Investment banking revenue of $1.6 billion was up 13% year-on-year. IB fees were also up 13% year-on-year and we ended the year ranked number one with a wallet share of 8.8%. And advisory fees were up 2%. Underwriting fees were up significantly compared to a weak prior year quarter with debt up 21% and equity up 30%. We are starting the year with a healthy pipeline and we are encouraged by the level of capital markets activity, but announced M&A remains a headwind, and the extent as well as the timing of capital markets normalization remains uncertain. Payments revenue was $2.3 billion, up 10% year-on-year. Excluding equity investments, it was flat as fee growth was predominantly offset by deposit-related client credits. Moving to Markets, total revenue was $5.8 billion, up 2% year-on-year. Fixed income was a record fourth quarter, up 8%. It was another strong quarter in our securitized products business, which was partially offset by lower revenue and rates coming off a strong quarter last year. Equity markets was down 8%, driven by lower revenue in derivatives and cash. Security services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 3% year-on-year. Expenses of $6.8 billion were up 4% year-on-year, predominantly driven by the timing of revenue-related compensation. Credit costs were $210 million, reflecting net charge-offs of $121 million and a net reserve build of $89 million. Moving to the Commercial Bank on Page 7. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.5 billion. Revenue of $3.7 billion was up 7% year-on-year, largely driven by higher NII, where the impact of rates was partially offset by lower deposit balances. Payments revenue of $2 billion was up 2% year-on-year driven by fee growth, largely offset by deposit-related client credits. Gross investment banking and markets revenue of $924 million was up 32% year-on-year, primarily reflecting increased capital markets and M&A activity. Expenses of $1.4 billion were up 9% year-on-year, driven by an increase in employees, including front office and technology investments, as well as higher volume-related expense, including the impact of new client acquisition. Average deposits were down 6% year-on-year, primarily driven by lower non-operating deposits as clients continue to opt for higher-yielding alternatives and flat quarter-on-quarter as client balances are seasonally higher at year-end. Loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were down 2%, reflecting lower revolver utilization and muted demand for new loans as clients remained cautious. And CRE loans were flat as higher rates continued to have an impact on originations and payoff activity. Finally, credit costs were $269 million, including net charge-offs of $127 million and a net reserve build of $142 million, driven by deterioration in our commercial real estate valuation outlook. And then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $925 million with pretax margin of 28%. Revenue of $4.7 billion was up 2% year-on-year, driven by higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, predominantly offset by lower NII. The decrease in NII reflects lower deposit margins and balances partially offset by wider spreads on loans. Expenses of $3.4 billion were up 11% year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, including performance-based incentives, continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, the impact of closing JPMorgan Asset Management China acquisition, and the continued investment in global shares. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $12 billion, positive across equities and fixed income, and $140 billion for the full year. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $49 billion for the quarter and net inflows of $242 billion for the full year. And we had record client asset net inflows of $489 billion for the year. AUM of $3.4 trillion and client assets of $5 trillion were both up 24% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter and deposits were up 7% quarter-on-quarter. Turning to Corporate on Page 9. Corporate reported a net loss of $689 million. Revenue of $1.8 billion was up $597 million year-on-year. NII of $2.5 billion was up $1.2 billion year-on-year due to the impact of higher rates and balance sheet mix. NIR was a net loss of $687 million compared to the net loss of $115 million, and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned upfront. And expenses of $3.4 billion were up $3 billion year-on-year, predominantly driven by the FDIC special assessment. With that, let's pivot to the outlook for 2024, starting with NII on Page 10. We expect 2024 NII ex-Markets to be approximately $88 billion. Going through the drivers, the outlook assumes that rates follow the forward curve, which currently includes six cuts this year. On deposits, we expect balances to be very modestly down from current levels. While lower rates should decrease repricing pressure, we remain asset sensitive, and therefore the lower rates will decrease NII, resulting in more normal deposit margins. We expect strong loan growth in Card to continue, but not at the same pace as 2023. Still, this should help offset some of the impact of lower rates. Outside of Card, loan growth will likely remain muted. It's important to note that we just reported a quarterly NII ex-Markets run rate of $94 billion. Combining that with the full-year guidance of approximately $88 billion implies meaningful sequential quarterly declines throughout 2024, consistent with what we've been telling you for some time. And keep in mind that many of the sources of uncertainty that we've highlighted previously surrounding the NII outlook remain. And on total NII, we expect it to be approximately $90 billion for the full-year, reflecting an increase in Markets NII which, as always, you should think of as largely offset in NIR. Now, let's turn to expenses on Page 11. We expect 2024 adjusted expense to be about $90 billion. You'll see on the slide we provided detail by line of business. Generally, you can see that both in dollar terms and in percentage terms, the expense growth is aligned to where the greatest opportunities are, both in terms of share and available returns. And of course, you'll hear more at Investor Day and between now and then. On the right-hand side of the page, we've highlighted some firmwide drivers. Thematically, the biggest driver is what I might call business growth writ large. Within that, narrowly defined volume and revenue-related growth represents about $1 billion of the increase across the company as a result of an improved NIR outlook, compared to about $400 million in 2023. But in addition, the ongoing growth of the company, which continues to produce share gains and additional profitability, is coming with increased expense across a range of categories. The quantum of investment increase is comparable to last year's increase and is driven by all the same themes, bankers, branches, advisors, technology as well as marketing. Net-net, First Republic produces a modest increase in expenses, but with a significantly lower 2024 exit run rate as the result of business integration efforts. Finally, despite significantly lower inflation outlook in the economy as a whole, we still see some residual effects of inflation flowing through most of our expense categories. It's worth noting that both the general business growth and investment growth include decisions that have been executed both in response to market conditions during 2023 and to support the future growth and profitability of the company. We've included the fourth quarter 2023 exit rate on the page to illustrate that a significant portion of the year-on-year increase in expense is already in the run rate. Now, let's turn to Page 12 and cover credit and wrap up. On credit, we continue to expect the 2024 card net charge-off rate to be below 3.5%, consistent with Investor Day guidance. So in closing, we shouldn't leave 2023 without noting what an outstanding year it was, producing record revenue and net income despite some notable significant items. We're very proud of what we accomplished this year and want to thank everyone who made it possible. At the same time, we emphasized throughout 2023 the extent to which we were over-earning, as indicated by an ROTCE that is 4% above our through-the-cycle target. As we turn to 2024, it shouldn't be surprising that our outlook has us beginning to march down the path towards normalization of our returns. But despite the expected dissipation of the 2023 tailwinds and the presence of significant economic and geopolitical uncertainties, we remain optimistic about this franchise's ability to produce superior returns through a broad range of environments. And this management team remains laser-focused on executing for shareholders, clients, and communities. And with that, let's open the line for Q&A. Yes, Matt, not particularly updating. I think you're referring to that $80 billion number that we put out there. And I wouldn't exactly describe that as an outlook. I think it's more just a number that we put out there to try to quantify a little bit the extent of the over-earning. So not particularly necessary to revise the number. But I just would point out again, as we highlighted on the page and as I highlighted in the prepared remarks, that when you look at that $94 billion exit rate and full-year guidance of $88 billion, that implies obviously exiting below $88 billion and some significant sequential decline. So in that sense, you can see us kind of marching on the path to that $80 billion. Whether we ever get to the $80 billion or not and when is maybe a topic for later in the year or next year. Yes, good question. I think you framed it exactly correctly in the sense that we obviously have a lot of buyback capacity in general based on organic capital generation. So the normal capital hierarchy will apply. But for now, we plan to remain on a modest base of buybacks consistent with that kind of $2 billion net buyback, a quarter number that we've talked about and that you've seen us do in light of probably the need to continue building to have a bit of a buffer, as you said, the uncertainty about the finalization of the rules. And also, just as a reminder, the SCB is probably a little bit low right now and has been quite volatile. So that's another factor that we need to keep in mind. Thanks, Matt. Yes. Actually, John, this quarter, that's all like pretty quiet. So the weighted average unemployment rate in the numbers still 5.5%. We didn't have any really big revisions in the macro outlook driving the numbers. And our skew remains, as it has been a little bit skewed to the downside, just recognizing that we still see risks being elevated, which obviously you can see that skew, and the difference between the weighted average unemployment of 5.5% and what's in our central outlook, which I think is something like 4.6% peak of the current levels. Sure. Yes. Happy to do that, John. So I think probably the best way to do this is to look at our EAR numbers. So, as you know, we don't update that until the Q, but on an estimated basis, it's going to be a little bit lower, I think something like $1.9 billion as opposed to $2.1 billion. So just round numbers, about $2 billion in EAR. I think empirically the number is maybe a little higher than that, just because even though we do model lags in the EAR, we've been seeing the lag effect be a little bit bigger, but just crudely, I think, as I noted, we do remain asset-sensitive. That's one way to quantify it. I would say the empirical number would maybe be a little higher than that, and hopefully, that gives you enough to work with. Yes, both good questions. So let's do reprice first. So I think all else equal, this more dovish Fed environment and these six cuts has the effect of taking a little bit of pressure off the reprice, especially product level reprice. At the same time, we do continue to expect internal migration, particularly out of checking and savings into CDs, and in wholesale, a little bit of ongoing migration out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing. And that trajectory I would expect to continue even in a lower rate environment. So as a result, if you look at weighted average rate paid, for example, for the consumer deposit franchise, we would actually expect that number to be a little bit higher, just even in a world with six cuts. And that's actually intuitive when you think about it as people continue migrating into CDs. But maybe a little non-intuitive, if you're kind of trying to do beta-type math with change in rates and change in rate pay, it gets a little bit non-intuitive. And then in terms of balances. Yes, you'll note that I said that our outlook is for balances to be very modestly down, which when you consider that QT, despite the various speculations about having it slow down later in the year, continues, and that long growth in the system as a whole is expected to be quite muted. It's a pretty modest decline outlook consistent with the lower rates. So I kind of agree with you that this environment is, at the margin, a little bit more supportive for system-wide deposit balances. And then obviously, we continue to be optimistic about our ability to take share in deposits based on our customer value proposition across all of our different businesses. Right. Okay, Ebrahim. So I think a lot of those things aren't actually mutually exclusive. So, statement one, I think it's uncontroversial that the economic outlook has evolved to include a significantly higher probability of a soft landing. That's, I think, the consensus at this point. So whether you believe it or not is a separate issue. But I think that is the consensus. In terms of consumer resilience, I made some comments about this on the press call. The way we see it, the consumer is fine. All of the relevant metrics are now effectively normalized. And the question really, in light of the fact that cash buffers are now also normal, but that that means that consumers have been spending more than they're taking in, is how that spending behavior adjusts as we go into the new year in a world where their cash buffers are less comfortable than they were. So one can speculate about different trajectories that that could take. But I do think it's important to take a step back and remind ourselves that consistent with that soft landing view, just in the central case modeling, obviously we always worry about the tail scenarios is a very strong labor market. And a very strong labor market means all else equal, strong consumer credit. So that's how we see the world. Yes. So good question on the multifamily. And the short answer is that for us, it's pretty uncontroversially, no bleed-through. And the reason is that while there is, we do - we are aware of some of the pressure on multifamily that's in kind of different markets from the ones that we are actually big in. So it's higher-end stuff in much less supply-constrained markets that is under more pressure. And as you know, our multifamily portfolio is much more affordable, supply-constrained markets. And so the performance there remains really very robust. Yes, Erika, it's a good question, and I understand what you're asking - why you're asking it. I think the answer is going to be a little bit unsatisfying, which is that this is classic decision-making under uncertainty, and it's kind of a probabilistic cloud of a variety of different factors. But all the ingredients that you've listed are the right ingredients, right? Very strong organic capital generation, uncertainty about the finalization of the rule, uncertainty about the SCB requirements, and obviously our normal capital hierarchy, which is that buybacks are always at the bottom of the hierarchy after we're done using the capital for our other priorities. So I think what I said previously stands, which is that we're sticking with a modest pace for now, but obviously, we have a lot of flexibility to adjust that whenever we want under the current regime, and we may well do that. A little bit of that is in there. Yes. So you would see that we often talk about the volume and revenue-related category, and I think in my prepared remarks, you will have noted that I talked about $1 billion increase in that category year-on-year as a result of an improved NIR outlook. So the hope and expectation of a continued rebound in the investment banking wallet, and our share of that is part of that. Yes, Mike, thanks for the question. And - yes, and of course, you will, as I noted, be hearing more from us at Investor Day and between now and Investor Day. But I will take a little bit of extra time here to answer your question, because you're right, it's important to give you the transparency. And I'm going to follow the structure that we used on the page and go through each line of business. So starting with CCB, it's the biggest dollar driver overall. It's an 8% increase year-on-year, which is about the same as we had last year. One key driver is the branch strategy and the associated staff for that. In 2023, we built 166 new branches and we're planning about a similar number this year. Marketing is also a driver. We're seeing great opportunities, great demand and engagement in our card products and so that shows up in marketing. And as you well know, our wealth strategy and CCB remains a big focus and priority. I think it's worth noting here, right, that as we've talked about and as you know Mike, some of our investments are designed to produce short-term payoffs and some of them are much longer-term and some of them are just table stakes. But we actually see quite a bit of evidence of current payoffs in our current results in the CCB investment. So for example, in 2023, we had 2 million net new checking accounts, we had an 8% growth in active card accounts, and over the last three years, we've increased deposit market share by 180 basis points. So as we've often said about the company as a whole, we're very happy to be producing very good current returns and growth while investing for the future. In AWM, continued client advisor hiring is a key driver, as well as making sure that both the advisors and all of their new clients have the support that they need. And a little bit to the prior question, in AWM we also have a little bit of volume and revenue-related driver tied to an improved revenue outlook. The Commercial Bank is an interesting story in the sense that about half of it is the exit rate impact of ads that we did in the middle of the year based on market disruption and all the kind of new clients and new loans that we saw and the need to support that across the entire ecosystem, as well as the fact that that created an opportunity in the middle of the year to accelerate our long-standing and pre-existing innovation economy strategy. So we took some opportunities to onboard some key teams in different parts of the franchise. And then as you look into 2024, it's really pretty consistent themes for the ones that we had before, including hiring bankers both domestically and internationally. The CIB story is a little bit different. The percentage growth there is lower, which recognizes, I think, both our very, very strong share positions as a starting point and also the fact that we've been investing quite aggressively for some time in the payments business, which has produced meaningful payoffs already there in terms of significant share gains. So as a result, the biggest driver in the CIB is really generic inflation, including labor, as well as, again, to the prior question, volume and revenue-related increases tied to the improved NIR outlook. And I do want to say for the avoidance of doubt, that despite all of this, our core strategy of looking very granularly at all the areas of strength and weakness and making sure that we're upgrading where appropriate to have absolutely the best talent in the CIB remains fully in effect. Finally, you'll note that I haven't actually talked about technology in any of the businesses. And that's actually because even though all of the businesses in various ways are investing in technology and spending money on it, the drivers are actually very consistent across the entire firm, even though it's very bottoms-up driven. And those drivers are consistent with what they've been, new products, features, and customer platforms, as well as modernization. So that's happening throughout the company, both at the app level and otherwise. And I will say, actually, in closing, talking about technology, which I think is interesting, that to the point about a driver being growth writ large, one of the things that we see is higher volume-related technology expense throughout the company. So thanks for the question, Mike. It was a good opportunity to give you guys a bit more color here. Sure. Yes, sure. So let me address the AI point, and I think maybe I won't go into a lot of quantitative detail on this stuff, and I'll save that for Investor Day, if you don't mind. But I will address the AI point. So, as you may be aware, we actually have Teresa Heitsenrether now running the AI strategy for the company as a member of the Operating Committee, which I think is an indication of the priority that we place on this and in partnership with Lori and all of the technology organization. So I think that - I think of this as being a little bit barbelled, where on the one hand, we're very excited about this. There's clearly some very significant opportunities, not for nothing, starting with technology developers themselves, in terms of the opportunity for significantly increased productivity there. At the same time, we're JPMorgan Chase. We're not going to be chasing shiny objects here in AI. We want to do this in an extremely disciplined way. It's very commercial and very linked to tangible outcomes. And so the current focus is on making sure we have a contained, well-chosen list of high-impact use cases and that we're throwing resources at those in the right way that's extremely pragmatic and disciplined, and we're holding ourselves accountable for actual results. Thanks, Mike. Hi, Gerard. Yes, Gerard, I wish the answer were more interesting, but it's just our practice. We just always use the forward curve for our outlook, and that's what's in there. Yes, good question, Gerard. I mean, I think you've heard Jamie talk about this a lot. QT is obviously a big focus, and one of the complicating elements that we have in the current environment. I think that the math is the math in the sense that QT all else equal is withdrawing from system-wide deposits. In the last six months of this year, that's been offset helpfully by a reduction in the size of RRP. And so that's been supportive of system-wide deposits. As we go into 2024, RRP is at lower levels, and so that may be a little bit less of a tailwind. But it's also the case, as you know, that there's - the market's expectation is that the QT is going to start slowing down at some point this year. So - and we still have reasonable levels of reserves and some cushion from RRP. So that's part of the reason that our outlook is for deposits to be modestly down with the shrinkage in system-wide deposits maybe partially offset by our belief that we can take some share. But also I think the second half of this year is going to be interesting to watch in terms of what the Fed does. Thanks, Gerard. Yes, sure. So, as you know, all else equal, this more dovish rate environment is of course supportive for capital markets. So if you go into the details a little bit, if you start with ECM, that helps higher, and the recent rally in the equity markets helps. I think there have been some modest challenges with the 2023 IPO vintage in terms of post-launch performance or whatever. So that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin in terms of converting the pipeline, but I'm not too concerned about that in general. So I would expect to see rebound there. In DCM, again, all else equal, lower rates are clearly supportive. One of the nuances there is the distinction between the absolute level of rates and the rate of change. So sometimes you see corporates seeing and expecting lower rates and therefore waiting to refinance in the hope of even lower rates. So that can go both ways. And then M&A is a slightly different dynamic. I think there's a couple of nuances there. One, as you obviously know, announced volume was lower this year, and so that will be a headwind in reported revenues in 2024 all else equal. And of course, we are in an environment of M&A regulatory headwinds, as has been heavily discussed. But having said that, I think we're seeing a bit of pickup in deal flow and I would expect the environment to be a bit more supportive. Yes, it's a good question. I mean, I think, as you say, it's a little bit of a - I mean, I wouldn't necessarily say that like lack of debt market access in the last year, that was more of an earlier effect in terms of having that driver revolver utilization. I think the main driver there is just a little bit of residual anxiety in the C suites, which increases as the companies get smaller in size. So there's really going to be a function of how 2024 plays out. The softer the landing is, the more supported the utilization should be I would think. If things turn out a little bit worse, I think management teams are going to be incrementally more cautious about CapEx and so on, and so you might see utilization even lower. Yes. Yes. Thanks, Glenn. So I think the last part of your question, as you say, is the most important part, which is, this as an important factor in the competitive dynamic and what is one of the key things that we offer as a company. So it is a meaningful shift in the environment. It's something that we've been watching for some time. We've made some enhancements and some new initiatives to ensure that we can compete effectively both in our traditional syndicated lending businesses, but also go head to head with the private credit providers and these types of unitranche structures, if and when that's what the client actually wants. It tends to be a trade-off between the best possible pricing versus speed and certainty of execution. And we can provide both off our sort of exceptionally strong long-time DCM franchise. So that's been a priority. And we're actually already starting to see some results from that across both the Commercial Bank and the CIB, with certain client segments. And in the bigger picture, of course, in the context of the Basel III Endgame, people talk a lot about the risk of certain lending activity getting pushed out of the regulated perimeter. It's important to be clear, right, these are important clients of ours too. We compete with them. They're also clients. And in the end, our point here is just people, and regulators in particular, should just be aware of the likely consequences of what's happening here and make sure that the results are intentional and that we're looking around the corner a little bit. It's interesting. I haven't heard much about that, Glenn, so we can look into it for you. But to be honest, the fact that I haven't heard much makes me think that it's maybe not such a big driver right now. Yes. Thanks, Charlie. So one thing that we said when we kind of gave First Republic guidance at Investor Day earlier this year is that while we understood the need to track that, and we've been splitting out First Republic in our reported results in order to improve period on period comparability, we kind of want to stay out of the business of guiding on First Republic. And so we really focused on having our guidance be firm-wide, including First Republic, now that everything is embedded in the franchise. Having said that, let me just react to a couple of things that you said. So again, I don't want to get into like micro validation one way or the other of some of your back-of-the-envelope math, but we did have some accelerated pull to par on some of the accretion of some of the loans that we purchased this year. So I think the annualization that you're doing is maybe a bit high for the 2024 number. And then from a sensitivities perspective, I actually think I can simplify the math for you a little bit and just kind of direct you to the EAR for my response to the prior question, because that EAR fully includes all of the First Republic assets and liabilities with all of their various dynamics. And so I think that's kind of like an easier way to think about it for the company. Yes. I mean, I can probably answer that question if I think about it for a second, but it sort of violates my prior statement that I really don't want to get into the business of guiding on First Republic. If I do the big picture, right, so big picture, 2023, we had eight months of First Republic NII. 2024, we're going to have 12. So all else equal, there's calendarization in there. What's also true is that in 2023, as a result of the impact of the NII of the pull to par of certain relatively short-dated assets that we fair valued at a meaningful discount as part of the transaction, that sort of - that pulled to par happens quite quickly and therefore probably juice the 2023 number a little bit. So therefore, straight annualization is probably not the right way to think about it. Then you just get into the questions about the FTP and the funding and whatever, and then it's just like too complicated. So I'd rather not go there. Okay. Thanks very much, everyone."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please standby. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum, and their Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon. Mr. Dimon, please go ahead.\nJamie Dimon: Hey, good morning, everybody. Before we start the actual call, I want to repeat something we just said on the press call. So before we get into the discussion about third-quarter earnings, I just want to say how deeply saddened that we all are about the recent horrific attacks on Israel and the resulting bloodshed and more. Terrorism and hatred have no place in our civilized world and all of our hearts here at JPMorgan Chase go out to all who are suffering.\nJeremy Barnum: Thanks, Jamie, and, of course, I very much echo this sentiment. Now, let's turn to our first-quarter earnings results. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $13.2 billion, EPS of $4.33, and revenue of $40.7 billion, and delivered an ROTCE of 22%. These results included $669 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate and $665 million of Firmwide legal expense. On Page 2, we have some more detail. Similar to last quarter, we have called out the impact of First Republic where relevant. For this quarter, First Republic contributed $2.2 billion of revenue, $858 million of expense, and $1.1 billion of net income. Now, focusing on the Firmwide results, excluding First Republic, revenue of $38.5 billion was up $5 billion or 15% year-on-year. NII, ex-Markets, was up $4.8 billion or 28%, driven by higher rates and higher revolving balances in Card, partially offset by lower deposit balances. NIR, ex-Markets, was up $374 million or 4%, which included lower net investment securities losses than the prior year. And Markets revenue was down $190 million or 3% year-on-year. Expenses of $20.9 billion were up $1.7 billion or 9% year-on-year, primarily driven by ongoing growth and front office and technology staffing, as well as wage inflation and higher legal expense. And credit costs were $1.4 billion, predominantly driven by net charge-offs in Card, and included a $102 million net reserve release, driven by changes in the central scenario, primarily offset by card loan growth. On to balance sheet and capital on Page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 14.3%, up about 50 basis points versus the prior quarter as the benefit of net income less capital distributions was partially offset by AOCI. We had $2 billion of net share repurchases this quarter and the pace of buybacks will likely remain modest in light of the Basel III endgame proposal. In line with our capital hierarchy, we will continue to reassess the buyback trajectory as circumstances evolve or opportunities emerge. And on the topic of the Basel III endgame, you'll see that we added a couple of pages on it. So, let's cover that now, starting on Page 4. Given the significance of this proposal for us, the broader industry as well as households and businesses as end-users, we thought it was important to spend time discussing it. And while we know there is interest in having us quantify the expected impact of this proposal in a lot of granular detail, it's important to start by asking why the proposed increase is so large given the repeated statement over time by policymakers that banks are well-capitalized and well-positioned to deal with stress. Given that context, the absence of detailed analysis supporting a capital increase of this magnitude is disconcerting and there's a lot that does not make sense to us. Starting with RWA, we've already said we expect the firm's RWA to increase by around 30% or $500 billion, which results in capital requirements increasing by about 25% or $50 billion. One immediate thing to point out is that at 4.5% GSIB, a $500 billion increase in RWA requires $22.5 billion of additional capital with no change in our systemic risk footprint. We've been on the record for a long time that GSIB was conceptually flawed and miscalibrated originally. Since implementation, the failure to address economic growth despite the Fed themselves acknowledging this problem at the outset has made matters worse. And now all of those problems are being applied to an additional $500 billion of RWA. Our view is that the combined proposals could have adjusted the surcharge levels to keep dollars of capital associated GSIB buffer constant rather than simply multiplying the RWA increase by the existing surcharges. Another lens on the proposed increases is the introduction of RWA for operational risk and its clear overlap with op risk losses already capitalized through the stress capital Buffer. Although there is limited disclosure from the Fed on this point, we have estimated that we have about $15 billion of operational risk capital embedded in the SCB based on the information the Fed does disclose. Once we capitalize for this new op risk RWA, our required capital will go up by around $30 billion without any change to our portfolio. Now let's turn to Page 5, which shows the impact of the actual and proposed capital rules over the last few years. Zooming out from the details of this most recent proposal, this page reminds us of what's happened since 2017. Since then, SA-CCR and the stress capital buffer have been adopted and our GSIB surcharge will increase to 4.5%. So assuming the Basel III endgame and GSIB proposals are finalized in their current form, we would see a 45% increase in our capital requirements relative to that 2017 starting point. This illustrates again how overcalibrated these proposals are and it's not done yet. We still expect the Fed to incorporate CECL into CCAR, which will likely increase the SCB. And, of course, given the absence of a fix to the GSIB clause, it continues to present a headwind into the indefinite future. And aside from those dynamics, there remains the long-standing issue of procyclicality in the overall capital [Technical Difficulty]. We think it's also important to point out that the agencies did actually have a choice here. While it may technically be true that the proposal is Basel compliant, Basel compliant does not mandate a 25% increase in capital requirements. Implementing the Basel III endgame consistently with how the Europeans have by retaining credit risk modeling and also addressing the compounding effects of GSIB and SCB would have achieved Basel compliance without creating this unnecessary increase in capital requirements. As you would expect, we will continue to engage and forcefully advocate during the comment period and beyond in a great deal of technical detail. For the purposes of this call, we wanted to make the equally important broader plans about both the level of capital increase and the flaws in the construct of the framework itself since coherent design is critical to the framework's durability over time. The current proposal exacerbates existing features that discourage beneficial scale and diversification. If it goes through as written, there will likely be significant impacts on pricing and availability of credit for businesses and consumers. In addition, the ongoing and persistent increase in the regulatory cost of market-making for banks suggests that the regulators want dramatic changes to the current operation of the US capital markets. We believe that well-regulated market makers that are committed to deploying capital to clients on a principal basis are a critical building block supporting the breadth, depth and resilience of the American capital markets, which is vital to the US economy. So, caution is warranted when proposing changes of this magnitude. With that, let\u2019s go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 6. Consumer spend growth has now reverted to pre-pandemic trends with nominal spend per customer stable and relatively flat year-on-year. Cash buffers continue to normalize to pre-pandemic levels with lower-income groups normalizing faster. Turning now to the financial results, excluding First Republic. CCB reported net income of $5.3 billion on revenue of $17 billion, which was up 19% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 30% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. End-of-period deposits were down 3% quarter-on-quarter. We ranked number one in retail deposit share based on FDIC data and continue to solidify our leadership position in key markets. Client investment assets were up 21% year-on-year, driven by market performance and strong net inflows as we continue to capture yield-seeking flows from our consumer banking customers. In Home Lending, revenue was down 2% year-on-year given a smaller market. Originations of $10.3 billion were up slightly quarter-on-quarter, but they remain down 15% year-on-year. Moving to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 7% year-on-year, driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower Auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 16% year-on-year due to strong account acquisition and continued normalization [for both] (ph). And in Auto, originations were $10.2 billion, up 36% year-on-year as we saw competitors pull back and regained market share. Expenses of $8.5 billion were up 7% year-on-year, largely driven by continued investments in staffing, primarily in front office and technology. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.4 billion, driven by net charge-offs, which were up $720 million year-on-year, predominantly due to continued normalization in Card. The net reserve build of $49 million reflected a $301 million build in Card services, primarily offset by a $250 million release in Home Lending. Next to CIB on page seven. CIB reported net income of $3.1 billion and revenue of $11.7 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.6 billion was down 6% year-on-year. IB fees were down 3% year-on-year and ranked number one with a year-to-date wallet share of 8.6%. In advisory, fees were down 10%. Underwriting fees were up 8% for debt and down 6% directly. In terms of the outlook, we're encouraged by the level of capital markets activity in September, and we have a healthy pipeline going into the fourth quarter. Advisory has also picked up compared to the first half, but year-to-date announced M&A remains down significantly, which will continue to be a headwind. Payments revenue was $2.1 billion, up 3% year-on-year. Excluding equity investments, it was up 12%, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $6.6 billion, down 3% year-on-year against a very strong third quarter last year. Fixed income was up 1%, driven by an increase in financing and trading activity and securitized products, as well as improved performance in credit. This was predominantly offset by currencies in emerging markets coming off a very strong quarter last year. Equity Markets was down 10%, reflecting lower revenues across products compared to a strong prior-year quarter as activity was challenged by lower volatility. Securities Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 9% year-on-year, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Expenses of $7.4 billion were up 11% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher legal expense and wage inflation. Credit costs were net benefit of $185 million, driven by a net reserve release of $230 million, reflecting the impact of net lending activity and net charge-offs of $45 million. Moving to the Commercial Bank on Page 8. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.7 billion. Revenue of $3.7 billion was up 20% year-on-year with payments revenue of $2 billion, up 30% year-on-year, driven by higher rates, and gross Investment Banking and Markets revenue of $821 million was up 8% year-on-year, reflecting increased M&A volume. Expenses of $1.4 billion were up 15% year-on-year, largely driven by an increase in headcount including front-office and technology investments, as well as higher-volume related expense, including the impact of new client acquisition. Average deposits were down 7% year-on-year, 5% quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by lower non-operating deposits as clients opt for higher-yielding alternatives. Loans were up 1% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were flat, reflecting continued stabilization in new loan demand and revolver utilization. And CRE loans were up 1%, reflecting funding of prior year originations of real-estate banking as well as lower pay-off activity. Finally, credit costs were $64 million, including net charge-offs of $50 million and a net reserve build of $14 million. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM, on Page 9. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.1 billion with pretax margin of 31%. Revenue of $4.6 billion was relatively flat year-on-year as higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels were offset by lower performance fees and lower NII deposits. Expenses of $3.1 billion were up 3% year-on-year, driven by continued growth in our private banking advisor teams and the impact of closing the JPMorgan Asset Management China and Global Shares acquisitions. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $20 billion, positive across all asset classes led by equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $40 billion. AUM of $3.2 trillion was up 22% year-on-year and client assets of $4.6 trillion were up 21% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels. Finally, loans were flat quarter-on-quarter, while deposits were down 5%, driven by migration to investments, partially offset by client inflows. Turning to Corporate on Page 10. Corporate reported net income of $911 million. Revenue was $1.5 billion, up $1.8 billion compared to last year. NII was $2 billion, up $1.2 billion year-on-year due to the impact of higher rates, and NIR was a net loss of $506 million and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned upfront. Expenses of $456 million were up $151 million year-on-year. To finish, we have the outlook on Page 11. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex-Markets to be approximately $88.5 billion and $89 billion, respectively, with the increase driven by slower reprice than previously assumed. Consistent with what we've been saying throughout the year, while we don't know when it will normalize, we do not consider this level of NII to be sustainable. Our outlook for 2023 adjusted expense is now approximately $84 billion. And as a reminder, this is on an adjusted basis, which excludes legal expense. Also, remember, this outlook excludes the pending FDIC special assessment. And on Credit, we now expect the 2023 Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.5%, mostly driven by denominator effects due to recent balanced growth. So to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating results. Throughout the year, we've been pointing out the various sources of significant uncertainty in all of those, including the geopolitical situation, economic outlook, rate environment, deposit reprice and the impact of the Basel III endgame proposal are as prominent now as they have been in the recent past. But as always, we continue to prepare for a range of scenarios and are focused on being there for our clients and customers when they need us most. And with that, let's open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. Please stand by. Our first question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. You may proceed.\nJohn McDonald: Hi, good morning. Jeremy, I was wondering if you could give us a little more color on what you're seeing so far on deposit reprice and migration, what's been better than expected so far on that front? And how do you see higher for longer rates potentially impacting deposit reprice pressure?\nJeremy Barnum: Sure. Thanks, John. I think the themes are pretty much the same as we've seen in prior quarters. So as we talked a little bit about on the press call, we've been trying to be a little bit cautious about recognizing that we don't think the current levels are sustainable. And we do think that we'll have to reprice in some pockets to some degree, maybe with tiering or whatever at some point in the future. And of course, that hasn't happened yet this year. So that's one factor. In the meantime, the CD strategy is working well. We're getting -- continue to get very good feedback from the field and we're capturing money in motion. And so we're seeing -- the sort of internal migration and the associated slow increase in deposit rate paid as a result of CD migration, but that's sort of working as we would have hoped. And so everything is kind of playing out according to plan, I would say. In terms of higher for longer, I think it just means that there will continue to be upward pressure on deposit pricing, both from internal migration and possibly from other effects. And at the end, as we always say, we're going to price products as a function of the competitive market environment.\nJohn McDonald: And just as a follow-up, it seems like you've done some securities repositioning in the last couple of quarters. How are you positioning the balance sheet in terms of cash in the securities portfolio, given your outlook for rates?\nJeremy Barnum: Yeah. I think I would say that while we're not predicting higher rates, I'm sure Jamie will have something to say here, we believe in being prepared for it. And that's been our position for some time. And of course, that's produced good results, and we continue to try to position ourselves. So neither significantly higher rates nor significant lower rates present a particularly large challenge to the company. So probably at the margin, we're still a little bit biased for slightly higher rates. But do keep in mind that when modeling the duration of the balance sheet, higher rates do extend the duration or rather shorten the duration on the deposit side. So that can be a factor as well.\nJohn McDonald: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.\nSteven Chubak: Hey, good morning.\nJeremy Barnum: Hey, Steve.\nSteven Chubak: Jeremy, I was hoping to just inquire about capital market outlook. You cited improved activity levels in September. But given persistently higher rates, geopolitical tensions and just poor performance of recent IPOs, how you're thinking about the outlook over the near to medium term? And how are you thinking about just the timing of an inflection in activity?\nJeremy Barnum: Yeah, good question. I mean, as you know, obviously, the current levels in Investment Banking remain quite depressed, certainly relative to the very elevated levels that we saw during the pandemic but even relative to sort of 2019, which is what you might consider the last normal year. We do eventually think we'll recover to those levels and hopefully recover to above those levels, recognizing that by the time it happens, you will have had many years of economic growth in the meantime. And to be fair, while the current environment is a little bit complicated in mix and there are some headwinds, as you pointed out, things have improved a little bit. And I think I would say our banking team is a little bit more optimistic than they were last quarter. So it feels to me like a little bit of a slow grind with some positive momentum, but obviously, significant uncertainty in the outlook and some structural headwinds, given lower levels of announced M&A and some regulatory headwinds on that side.\nSteven Chubak: Thanks for the color. And just for my follow-up on some of the regulatory commentary you provided, certainly a lot of helpful color on the slide. So thank you for that. If the proposal were to go through as written, what proportion of the inflation do you believe can be mitigated over time? And I was also hoping you could provide some context as to the quantum of how you think CECL inclusion could potentially impact the SCB and CCAR.\nJeremy Barnum: Yeah. Those are all good questions, Steve. I think it's probably too early to try to provide that level of quantification on either front. If I start first with the Basel III endgame proposal, from our perspective, we're currently focused on advocating as aggressively as possible for the necessary changes, some of which are what you might call philosophical in nature or some of the things I highlighted in my prepared remarks. But some of them are very technical in nature, including things that we think might actually be mistakes on the proposal. And so talking a lot about optimizing away stuff that might change just feels like a bit premature at this point. I would point out that given how significant operational risk RWA is as part of the proposal, that is -- you can think of that sort of as a generic tax across the entire spectrum. And it's therefore, in some sense, non-optimizable. So we feel that it's important to manage expectations about the level of optimization that's possible once the rule is finalized and hopefully some of the technical items are addressed. Also, it depends on your definition of optimization. There's what I -- sometimes I use the term costless optimization, where it's just technical fixes that don't affect revenue and don't require you to exit businesses. I think that type of optimization will be harder to find than it has been in the past. But as we pointed out, we may simply need to exit things. And that will be because it is better than the alternative, which would be to do activity that's shareholder value disruptive, but it won't be costless. A good example of that is the renewable energy tax credit investment business, which as a result of the quadrupling of the risk weight, may no longer make sense. Now that's one that we hope will be changed but is tricky because those are very long-duration assets. So between now and the rule is finalized, it raises some questions whether we want to put that stuff on the balance sheet. So sorry, a bit of a long answer. But then, yeah, on quantifying CECL and CCAR, I think we've got to wait for that one because given the relative lack of transparency that we have into the Fed's exact modeling in terms of which quarter is the peak and so on and so forth, it's a little bit hard to predict what the exact impact of putting CECL and CCAR is going to be. We just know probabilistically that it will, like everything else these days, tend to push capital higher.\nSteven Chubak: Very helpful color, Jeremy. Thanks for taking my questions.\nJeremy Barnum: Yep.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. You may proceed.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Hey, good morning. Just first question, Jeremy, on credit. I think you mentioned some of the reserve release was tied to the change in the central scenario. Could you just talk to us, remind us what the central scenario is today, what changed? And then in terms of fundamentally on credit, like, where are you seeing softness either on the consumer or the commercial side?\nJeremy Barnum: Yeah. So on the central scenario, you should read the research that gets put out by our competitors and our excellent research team. No, but in all seriousness, I think our US economists had their central case outlook to include a very mild recession with, I think, two quarters of negative 0.5% of GDP growth in the fourth quarter and first quarter of this year. And that then got revised out early this quarter to now have sort of modest growth, I think, around 1% for a few quarters into 2024. So just flowing that through our process while acknowledging that we're still skewed to the downside, we're still reserved to a significantly higher unemployment rate on a weighted average basis than is in the central case outlook. So that number we\u2019ve sometimes given you is 5.5% this quarter. So it's really not much more complicated than that. We're just kind of following the process. And I think your other question was, where am I seeing softness in credit. And I think the answer to that is actually nowhere roughly or certainly nowhere that's not expected, meaning we continue to see the normalization story play out in consumer more or less exactly as expected. And then, of course, we are seeing a trickle of charge-offs coming through the office space. You see that in the charge-off number of the Commercial Bank. But the numbers are very small and more or less just the realization of the allowance that we've already built there.\nEbrahim Poonawala: That's helpful. And just going back to the details you laid out on Basel endgame. Maybe on the philosophical side, I think Jamie was speaking last month said, doesn't -- we don't expect any changes. But at the same time, you make everything that makes sense in terms of the pushback. Is it all falling on deaf ears from a shareholder perspective? Are we resigned to the fact that we are going to see more towards the worst-case outcome play out? Or is there some level of sort of meeting in the middle of the road as this thing gets finalized?\nJeremy Barnum: Yeah. So I'll let Jamie speak for himself on that point, but our job is to advocate. We're not going to guess what the sentiment is in Washington. It's a 1,000-page rule proposal as you know. We've got a big team of very smart people studying it very closely. Interestingly, we noted recently that in some of the analysis that they did about the impact on lending, they sort of forgot about like $1 billion of the Fed and their preamble, they forgot about $1 billion of operational risk RWA. So it just highlights that there is a possibility or seem to have forgotten. They simply omitted the impact of the operational risk RWA on fees. So anyway, the point is it's long, it's complicated, it's technical. We do think there are probably some technical mistakes and they are going to forcefully advocate on all of those. And while we disagree with a lot of this stuff, these are technical issues that should be, in some sense, resolved technically. And hopefully, they'll listen.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. Thank you.\nJeremy Barnum: Sorry, I'm just getting a correction in the room. I meant to say trillion.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Yeah, no, I got that. I got the trillion dollars. Yep. [indiscernible] Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\nRyan Kenny: Hey, good morning. I want to dig in on the NII side. So you raised the 2023 NII markets guidance by $2 billion for this year. So I know your comments in the press release suggests JPMorgan's overearning. So I just want to triangulate there. What does normalized NII look like? And do we get to normalize next year or later on?\nJeremy Barnum: Yeah, a couple of things. So let me do the timing question first. So we're being very clear that we are not predicting when it's going to be a function of the marketplace and the rate environment and competitive dynamics and so on and so forth. So we're just really just trying to remind everyone not bank on the current run rate, which we just don't fundamentally think are sustainable. You'll be aware that before Investor Day last -- earlier this year, we tried to quantify what we thought that kind of normalized range might look like, and we put a sort of mid-70s type number out there. And at Investor Day, we talked about how the acquisition of First Republic was going to push that number up a little bit, although there were some overlaps and so on and so forth. So anyway, with the benefit of time and having everything settled in a little bit, if you sort of push us for that kind of what does that number now look like, we think it's probably closer to about 80 with all the obvious caveats that this is a guess and we don't know when. But we're just trying to point out that it's a bit lower than the current run rate.\nRyan Kenny: Got it.\nJamie Dimon: Inside the company, some people think it will happen sooner, i.e., me. Some people think it will happen later, i.e., Jen and Marianne and Jeremy.\nJeremy Barnum: There was no way that I was in that camp, actually, but I don't know. I'm not sure I have an opinion on it.\nRyan Kenny: And then on the loan growth side, industry loan growth has slowed significantly this year. What demand are you seeing for loan growth across the different categories? And I know it might be too early to talk about next year, but directionally, how should we think about loan growth, given where we are in the cycle and the higher capital requirements coming?\nJeremy Barnum: Yeah, sure. So on loan growth, the story is pretty consistent with what we've been saying all year. So we were seeing very robust loan growth in Card, and that's coming from both spending growth and the normalization of revolving balances. As we look forward, we're still optimistic about that, but it will probably be a little bit more muted than it has been during this normalization period. In Auto, we've also seen pretty robust loan growth recently, both as a function of slightly more competitive pricing on our side as the industry was a little bit slow to raise rates. And so we lost some share previously, and that's come back now. And generally, the supply chain situation is better. So that's been supported. As we look forward there, it should be a little bit more muted. And I think generally in wholesale, the loan growth story is going to be driven just by the economic environment. So depending on what you believe about soft landing, mild recession, no lending, we have slightly lower or slightly higher loan growth, but in any case, I would expect it to be relatively muted. And of course, Home Lending remains fairly constrained both by rates and market conditions. But also, and I think this is true across the board, we will be managing things actively as mentioned in light of Basel III, which may not change originations, but it will change what we retain.\nRyan Kenny: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. You may proceed.\nGerard Cassidy: Good morning, Jeremy. How are you?\nJeremy Barnum: Hey, Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy: Jeremy, you guys have put up a really strong ROTC number of 22% for the quarter. And when you dive into your different segments, what really jumps out at us is the 40% ex-First Republic ROE in Consumer and Community Banking. I know you and Jamie have talked about your over-earning on credit, we get that. But in view of all of these fintechs and all these other non-bank competitors that were all supposed to pick away at everybody's market share, you guys have put up great numbers here. What's the drivers behind an ROE, even when you take that credit over-earning out, what's driving this business profitability at such high levels?\nJeremy Barnum: Yeah, Gerard, I'd say a couple of things there. So first, it's not just credit, it's also deposit margin, right? So when we talk about over-earning on NII, a disproportionate amount of that is coming out of the consumer franchise for all the reasons that we've talked about. But I would also point out, sometimes we don't like the word overearning because right now, customers are happy, and they're doing CDs. And the broader answer to your question about why we're able to compete effectively really comes back to a decade, two-decade long history of investing for the future and recognizing that there's a holistic value proposition here that includes branches and the app and all the online services and the entire suite of products and services that is around this enterprise, which drives engagement and customer loyalty. And we're seeing some of the benefits of that now, although we're not complacent. The competition is still there, the fintechs are still there, and we know we need to continue investing to preserve the value. And it's also true that the particular circumstances of the current rate and credit environment means that the earnings are a little bit above normal, but that core franchise is extremely robust.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And then as a follow-up, which ties into your answer on the deposit margin and consumer and your earlier comments, you and Jamie, about the internal debate inside JPMorgan about the migration of rates going higher on the funding side. Your noninterest-bearing deposits, I think, are around 28% of total deposits, which is slightly above the 26% you guys had back in 2018 or 2019 or pre-pandemic. Is this expectation that you're going to see more of the noninterest-bearing deposits going to interest-bearing or is it just the repricing of interest-bearing deposits that have some of your folks inside JPMorgan a little more cautious on that net interest income number?\nJeremy Barnum: That\u2019s a good question, Gerard. I think it's a little bit bigger picture than that. And I'm not sure. I get your question. It's a good question, but I'm not sure that the reported interest-bearing, noninterest-bearing split is the best one to look at this through for a couple of reasons. So first, like between wholesale and retail, we've got some amount of noninterest-bearing in wholesale that's sort of the ECR product, and so you see some dynamics there that play out. And in consumer, in a world where savings is paying a relatively low rate paid across checking and savings, the migration dynamics are probably not that different right now. But then, of course, even within consumer across both consumers and small businesses, you've got slightly different dynamics in terms of how people manage their operating balances. So I would tend to zoom out a little bit and see this as a holistic answer that's driven by internal migration from checking, savings, to CDs, from ECR to interest-bearing and wholesale. And then our potential response to the rate environment, the competitive environment, the overall level of system-wide deposits in terms of product-level reprice that may or may not happen at the moment in the future.\nGerard Cassidy: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. You may proceed.\nErika Najarian: Hi, good morning. Jeremy, my first question is for you. Again, sort of maybe re-asking the question a different way. Your new guide for net interest income for this year would imply an exit run-rate of $22.9 billion in the fourth quarter. As we think about the dynamics in higher for longer, on one hand, your fixed rate assets will continue to reprice. On the other, you've been asked a lot about the deposit dynamics that could continue to creep higher. How do you think about those puts and takes as we think about that relative to that exit rate of $22.9 billion in the fourth quarter?\nJeremy Barnum: Yeah. So, Erika, I think the simple answer to your question is those -- I believe that fourth quarter exit number equates to a $90 billion run rate ex-Markets. And we're kind of saying that\u2026\nJamie Dimon: It was [$2.5 billion] (ph).\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, it's not what I meant to say.\nJamie Dimon: She said $22.9 billion.\nJeremy Barnum: I didn't hear that. Okay. Anyway, so call it $90 billion run rate on an exit rate basis, and we're saying that we think something a bit more normal is closer to $80 billion. So that's one building block. Underneath that, I think one thing that's interesting actually, is that as the percentage of the deposits which are CDs increases, the sort of balance between internal migration and betas and rate and volume is a little bit less binary and a little bit smoother. So when we look at this type of stuff and we model migration, balances, product-level reprice, as you get out of that lower zero bound with 0% CD mix world, things get a little bit smoother, I would say, overall. So it will be interesting to watch that, but it's obviously one of the most important things for us as a company right now. And we think we can manage it, but it's also worth remembering that the big picture point is just the client franchise. And we've often said, we're very focused on primary bank relationships, and we didn't lose any of those in the last cycle. We're not planning to lose any in this cycle, and that's what sort of a long-term focus means for us.\nJamie Dimon: And I would just say quantitative tightening there. That will be a large number, and we don't exactly know the effect where wholesale, consumer -- remember also the Fed has the RRP program, which is also sucking money into the Fed directly reducing deposits. That's still [$1 trillion, too] (ph).\nErika Najarian: Thank you. And my second question is on maybe zooming out on the Basel III endgame impacts. It's clearly complex, overly complex. And I completely agree with you that it is unnecessary at this point and very backward-looking. I guess what is not complex is the fact that you generated 75 basis points of CET1 this quarter while your RWAs are down. And I guess my question here is, is that, I understand that we're in the public advocacy process. I hear you loud and clear in terms of how this could have harm in terms of pricing for Main Street and dislocating the pipes in American capital markets. But for JPMorgan, has this changed your natural return profile of 17%? Jamie, I know you lingered a little bit on 14% when you were at Barclays in September. But at the end of the day, it feels like for your -- for the portfolio managers that own JPMorgan through the cycle, this Basel III endgame really harm your natural earnings power and returns.\nJeremy Barnum: Yeah. Okay. That's a good question, Erika. I think there's a couple of pieces in there. So let me take the most important piece first, which is the 17% through the cycle target. Are we keeping that or not in light of the Basel III endgame proposal? So short answer is we're not going to change that number today. But when you look at what we've disclosed about a 25% increase in capital, it's not -- you have to start by acknowledging that, that is a major headwind to returns. In simple terms, you talk about earnings power and returns, but they're two different things, right? We have to be a little bit pedantic and do numerator, denominator here. Okay. So say the numerator doesn't change, if you just dilute down the numerator by the increased capital, that's a significantly lower return number. I would say that, that's probably the lower bound in terms of the impact of the Basel III endgame for a couple of reasons. One is we are hoping for changes. Two is, once the rule is final, we will seek to reprice in the places where we can. And that will be different in consumer and in wholesale. Some of it will be product level, some of it will be relationship level. But that hopefully can mitigate some of it. But of course, the flip side of that is that's cost getting passed into the real economy, and that's part of the point that we've made about lowering availability of products and services and lending. There may be some opportunities for costless optimization. I'm personally a little bit more pessimistic about those, but we surprised ourselves on those points in the past. So we'll see. And then finally, yeah, we may stop doing certain things, and we may exit things. But I wouldn't necessarily assume that, that's going to do a lot to preserve returns at the 17%. That's going to be about exiting things that are shareholder disruptive but not necessarily producing much higher returns if you know what I mean. So that's that. And then the other part of your question implicitly was talking about organic capital generation, and I think it's just very important to separate impacts on the economy and impacts on long-term returns from our ability to meet the requirements. Of course, as Jamie always says, JPMorgan is going to be fine. And we're building a lot of capital, and we were managing capital conservatively. And we'll be able to build the necessary capital in order to achieve on time or early compliance, which is always what we strive to do. But that doesn't really have any particular bearing on the question of what the long-term return target is or the impact on the real economy.\nErika Najarian: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. You may proceed.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thank you. So I very much appreciate the comments in the release on the big picture things of what's going on in the world and the potential impact on markets, on crude market, global trade, everything that you mentioned. And sadly, agree about the most dangerous time in decades. The question I have is, does it surprise you that markets are hanging in that you yourself have green shoots or still green shoots type of mindset about banking while that's going on? And then maybe more importantly, if you believe what -- obviously, what you wrote, what are you doing about it? How do you manage yourself conservatively? How do you prepare for tougher times?\nJamie Dimon: Yes. Go ahead, Jeremy. Do you want to start?\nJeremy Barnum: Okay. So I mean, on green shoots, you'll just note that our comments are cautious. I mean, there is momentum. I do think we are a little bit more optimistic than we were. But obviously, markets have been bumpy, both equity markets and rate markets have been very whippy recently. So we don't want to get too carried away with optimism here. We are coming on off a very low base. And so there's a hope and an expectation that we are on the path to normalization and improvement. And of course, the overall economic picture, at least currently, looks solid. The sort of immaculate disinflation trade is actually happening. So those are all reasons to be a little bit optimistic in the near term, but it's tempered with quite a bit of caution.\nJamie Dimon: So I would add caution. There has been an extraordinary amount of fiscal monetary stimulus still in the system. And you can't look at -- and of course, it can drive markets and sentiment and sales and profits and all that, but it can't stay like this forever. Between Q2, if you've never had, and how much the fiscal stimulus is going to continue at this rate before you have kind of [indiscernible] kind of factors. So I just -- I think you have to be very cautious. And of course, the dealer policies, I think, is just an extraordinary issue we have to deal with. How do you prepare the company for that? We do 100 stress tests a week. And we do multiple views of it, including geopolitical problems or interest rate problems. But usually, geopolitics presents itself as usually as a deep recession or a mild recession, a recession part of the world or markets going down a lot. And because markets do well is not a reason ever to say they're going to continue to do well. If you don't believe me, remember 1987, 1990, 1994, the year 2000, the year 2009, and people don't predict those inflection points. I just -- but my caution is that we are facing so many uncertainties out there. You just got to be very cautious [what you\u2019re] (ph) facing. And like I said, the other thing about the green shoots regardless of that, we try to run the company so that we serve the clients day in and day out with better products and better services, securely, safely and all those things. And that's the ultimate goal. We know there are going to be bad times. That's not a surprise as there are going to be bad times. We don't always know how they're coming and where they're coming from, but we keep on serving clients, doing good for clients, you can build a good business kind of separate from what it does to your returns. That's a slightly different issue at this point. But we'll deal with that, too, when we figure out what to do.\nGlenn Schorr: Thank you for all that.\nJeremy Barnum: Thanks, Glenn.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.\nMike Mayo: Hi. I understand the NII strategy benefited from First Republic asset sensitivity, TD strategy, money in motion. And I'm curious to how much is the NII increase and the deposit benefits a function of the 67 million digital banking customers. Do you have more digital banking customers and branch customers now? If you can just refresh that? And then a more general question, I guess, the first one for Jeremy, and the second one for Jamie. You have record tech spend. What's the benefit of having record tech spend? If you can kind of mark to market your thoughts there as it relates to AI as it relates to maybe wasted spending, your outlook for next year? And does it really help to be the biggest tech spender of the banking industry?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. Let me do digital banking, Mike. I spent some time on this actually a couple of weeks ago. And it's interesting to note the sort of extent to which the growth in digitally engaged consumers is higher than the overall growth in consumer accounts, meaning that we're continuing to increase the percentage of our consumers that are digitally engaged. And it sort of goes back to my prior point about...\nJamie Dimon: The percent who are digital-only is much lower than that.\nJeremy Barnum: For sure, for sure, which actually links to the broader point that what -- in terms of your question about how much is this helping the current NII story, it goes to the larger point of it holistic, through the cycle, multi-channel, fully engaged customer strategy, which requires a lot of investment in branches, obviously, but also in digital services of all sorts. So in many ways, you can see the current environment as a little bit of a payoff of that investment, but that's not like, therefore, we stop investing, obviously. So I guess that's part of the answer. And I guess, your other question is the benefits of being the biggest tech spender. I just think like it's sort of mandatory right? I mean, we're big and very technology-centric business, and the world is competitive. And everything is changing. Younger generations have different expectations, and we have to be nimble, and we have to be on our front foot. And otherwise, we risk getting severely disrupted. So I don't know if Jamie wants to add anything.\nJamie Dimon: And just the competition, we look at it as, it\u2019s Wells. It was coming back, which I'm happy for you guys. It's obviously [Marcus, it's Apple. It's Chime, it's Dave] (ph). There\u2019s a lot of people coming up with these businesses in different ways. Some have been quite successful, like Stripe in payments. And so we want to be very good and very competitive. Some of that tech spending is things which are almost a sine qua non, which is cybersecurity, data center resiliency, regulatory requirements and things like that, which we simply are going to do and be very, very good at to protect the company.\nMike Mayo: As it relates to AI specifically, which is the talk of the town, I guess the consensus among people outside the banking industry is that banks will not win that battle, including JPMorgan. You won't control the front end. What are you doing with AI to make a difference now? Or is this simply a moonshot?\nJamie Dimon: Well, I don't agree with that statement. Banks have an extraordinary amount of proprietary data in addition to when you do like a large language model, that's public data. It's looking at everything in the Internet or everything that's ever been published or something like that. But AI is an extraordinarily good tool to use. We just put a woman who is running at our table. So it's data analytics, AI, et cetera. And there are multiple types of AI. So we use AI for risk, fraud, marketing, prospecting. And the management team is getting better and better and say, how can we use data to do a better job to reduce errors, to serve clients better, to have a salesperson have co-pilots. They know why even the clients calling us something like that. And so we simply have to do it. Does it create opportunity for disruptors to come in? Yeah, of course. That\u2019s always been true with technology and -- but we'll be quite good at it.\nMike Mayo: And then lastly, I think you had made a mention at a conference about investment spend or tech spend over the next year. Where do you stand on that?\nJeremy Barnum: Yeah. No, because you did ask a little bit about the expense outlook for next year. So I think at the conference, we said I think the consensus was $88 billion, but we're still going through budget process, et cetera, et cetera. So that's still true. I think we're still kind of in the ballpark, but I would say at the margin, there's going to be a little bit of upward...\nJamie Dimon: First Republic too, or no?\nJeremy Barnum: This is all now including First Republic. And I think there'll be a little bit of upward pressure on that as we sort of do our usual thing and look at all the opportunities that we see and the investments that we want to make. So no surprise in that sense that we're going to invest prudently. Nothing dramatic, but probably a little bit of upward pressure on the margin.\nMike Mayo: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. You may proceed.\nJim Mitchell: Hey, good morning. Jeremy, do you think there's any receptivity among regulators regarding the double counting, not only of operational risk, but I think you alluded to this earlier in the Markets business, but there's clearly double counting and market risk in the trading book. Is there any receptivity?\nJamie Dimon: Can I just answer real quickly? We don't really know. It's a one-sided conversation generally. They say put in your comments. So everyone's going to put in extensive comments kind of like you heard from Jeremy, and we don't really know. We don't really know what's going on inside the Fed, how many people get involved. In my view, it's become a very politicized process as opposed to the technical analysis, I think that\u2019s required to do it exactly right. So we'll see.\nJim Mitchell: Okay. And then if it weren't to change, and you talked about the potential impact on liquidity in the Markets business, specifically, is that a JPM pulling out of certain business type of event? Or is that -- is it more a comment that there'll be fewer providers of liquidity as less scaled players exit? And maybe that's all else equal, a market share gain opportunity for JPMorgan in a smaller business?\nJamie Dimon: I think -- so if you look at Markets alone, it's a huge, I think, 60% increase in capital. And if you look at it, you can do that by product, for some products it worth it than for others. But generally, it's bad across all products. And market make -- but the really important thing is market making is a critical function. And if you look at the world, only so many large market makers who can make markets for governments, hospitals, cities, schools, states, IMF, World Bank, BlackRock, Blackstone and all those various things to buy and sell for their clients in size, and market makers have a different function than hedge funds. And I don't know what the real intent was with this, this is another one, I think, needs to be really thought through. What are you trying to accomplish? We do market making quite safe. We've never lost the kind of money that people talk about in market making in the global market [shock] (ph) or something like that. But the other thing about market making, I do agree it could actually force some people out. It will force lower positions, which is why I think it's a little risky, but it may also force more consolidation. And so clients, since they need it so much, there may be consolidation in unintended way in market making and obviously more volatile markets because with all the constraints for the LCR, SLR, capital, et cetera, you will constantly be up against limitations on what you can do.\nJeremy Barnum: Yeah. And I think that last point of Jamie's is particularly important because, sure, if you want, you can construct as what I would consider a very optimistic argument that the higher cost of doing business will lead smaller-scale players to exit, and that's a share gain opportunity for us. But I refer back to the comments about the disincentives to beneficial diversification and scale. Getting bigger, especially in Markets, it's quite expensive from, for example, a GSIB perspective. And so you wind up kind of hemmed in on all sides, which is one of the reasons why we're sort of highlighting that it does seem like the only way out sometimes when you look at the cumulative effect of everything that's happened in Markets over the last 15 years is a fundamentally very different system. And well, obviously...\nJamie Dimon: Great opportunity for European market makers. I mean, a great opportunity. Like they can do repo and FX and swaps and credit and stuff with 30% less capital. That is a big difference in that kind of business.\nJim Mitchell: Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Hi, good morning. You talked about increased investment spend in some areas in response to an earlier question, but just how do you think about cost control overall looking at the medium term? The outlook for revenue is obviously pressured at least on net interest income, fees might help. But the backdrop is for potentially declining revenue or at least flattish revenue for a couple of few years. So I know you always say you want to invest for the cycle, and it's really paid off over time, but how are you thinking about cost control in the next few years?\nJeremy Barnum: Yeah. I mean, I wish I had sort of an answer that fit better into your framework, but in some fundamental sense, we just don't agree with the framework, in the sense that -- and we've been through this over the last couple of years, right? In a world where rates drop very suddenly and recover like quite dramatically and credit becomes abnormally good and then rebounds, and you see these very significant fluctuations in capital markets. We saw that 2021 going into 2022 where the revenue environment can change a lot in the short term for reasons that can be largely out of your control. And while, of course, there are parts of our expense base, which are in the short term, directly sensitive to the revenue environment, and some of those adjust naturally and some of them we adjust more forcefully as a function of volumes. But other things are much more structural. And the goal is to make sure that those other things are sized appropriately to what we believe sustainable through cycle returns are. So we're always very focused on cost. You can be rest assured of that. That discipline internally is as aggressive as ever as we go through the budget cycle, but they're long-term plays. And you really shouldn't expect us to see trying to generate cosmetically lower cost in response to a lower revenue environment, where we didn't balloon the cost when the revenue became, as we've argued, unsustainably high.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Yeah. Fair enough. And then if I could just squeeze in on First Republic. Obviously, the contribution there is coming in at multiples higher than expected. How do you think about the puts and takes in terms of -- I think there's probably some runoff of loans still to come, but also opportunities to deepen the relationships there?\nJeremy Barnum: Yeah. So you're right about the contribution and about the runoff of loans and it is notable, the net income, the First Republic-related net income that we printed this quarter. So the first thing to say is that we don't think that, that First Republic-related net income number from this quarter is a sustainable indicator of the future run rate. Some of the same dynamics that we just talked about, in particular, overearning on deposits or sort of above-normal deposit margins also apply to First Republic franchise to some degree. So we would expect that to normalize. And probably more significantly, as I think you alluded to, we do have some accelerated pull-to-par on some of the commitments that we took on at a fair value discount as part of the acquisition. And so that's a short-term tailwind in the revenue that will come out of that over the next few quarters. And yeah, in terms of how it's going overall and deepening the relationships, that remains a focus. And I think more of that will happen as we continue the integration and we continue stabilizing. And yeah, I think, as I said, I think, on the press call, things are going well, arguably a little bit better than we had sort of modeled as part of the acquisition, and we're happy to see that.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions.\nJamie Dimon: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeremy Barnum",
            "content": "Thanks, Jamie, and, of course, I very much echo this sentiment. Now, let's turn to our first-quarter earnings results. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $13.2 billion, EPS of $4.33, and revenue of $40.7 billion, and delivered an ROTCE of 22%. These results included $669 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate and $665 million of Firmwide legal expense. On Page 2, we have some more detail. Similar to last quarter, we have called out the impact of First Republic where relevant. For this quarter, First Republic contributed $2.2 billion of revenue, $858 million of expense, and $1.1 billion of net income. Now, focusing on the Firmwide results, excluding First Republic, revenue of $38.5 billion was up $5 billion or 15% year-on-year. NII, ex-Markets, was up $4.8 billion or 28%, driven by higher rates and higher revolving balances in Card, partially offset by lower deposit balances. NIR, ex-Markets, was up $374 million or 4%, which included lower net investment securities losses than the prior year. And Markets revenue was down $190 million or 3% year-on-year. Expenses of $20.9 billion were up $1.7 billion or 9% year-on-year, primarily driven by ongoing growth and front office and technology staffing, as well as wage inflation and higher legal expense. And credit costs were $1.4 billion, predominantly driven by net charge-offs in Card, and included a $102 million net reserve release, driven by changes in the central scenario, primarily offset by card loan growth. On to balance sheet and capital on Page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 14.3%, up about 50 basis points versus the prior quarter as the benefit of net income less capital distributions was partially offset by AOCI. We had $2 billion of net share repurchases this quarter and the pace of buybacks will likely remain modest in light of the Basel III endgame proposal. In line with our capital hierarchy, we will continue to reassess the buyback trajectory as circumstances evolve or opportunities emerge. And on the topic of the Basel III endgame, you'll see that we added a couple of pages on it. So, let's cover that now, starting on Page 4. Given the significance of this proposal for us, the broader industry as well as households and businesses as end-users, we thought it was important to spend time discussing it. And while we know there is interest in having us quantify the expected impact of this proposal in a lot of granular detail, it's important to start by asking why the proposed increase is so large given the repeated statement over time by policymakers that banks are well-capitalized and well-positioned to deal with stress. Given that context, the absence of detailed analysis supporting a capital increase of this magnitude is disconcerting and there's a lot that does not make sense to us. Starting with RWA, we've already said we expect the firm's RWA to increase by around 30% or $500 billion, which results in capital requirements increasing by about 25% or $50 billion. One immediate thing to point out is that at 4.5% GSIB, a $500 billion increase in RWA requires $22.5 billion of additional capital with no change in our systemic risk footprint. We've been on the record for a long time that GSIB was conceptually flawed and miscalibrated originally. Since implementation, the failure to address economic growth despite the Fed themselves acknowledging this problem at the outset has made matters worse. And now all of those problems are being applied to an additional $500 billion of RWA. Our view is that the combined proposals could have adjusted the surcharge levels to keep dollars of capital associated GSIB buffer constant rather than simply multiplying the RWA increase by the existing surcharges. Another lens on the proposed increases is the introduction of RWA for operational risk and its clear overlap with op risk losses already capitalized through the stress capital Buffer. Although there is limited disclosure from the Fed on this point, we have estimated that we have about $15 billion of operational risk capital embedded in the SCB based on the information the Fed does disclose. Once we capitalize for this new op risk RWA, our required capital will go up by around $30 billion without any change to our portfolio. Now let's turn to Page 5, which shows the impact of the actual and proposed capital rules over the last few years. Zooming out from the details of this most recent proposal, this page reminds us of what's happened since 2017. Since then, SA-CCR and the stress capital buffer have been adopted and our GSIB surcharge will increase to 4.5%. So assuming the Basel III endgame and GSIB proposals are finalized in their current form, we would see a 45% increase in our capital requirements relative to that 2017 starting point. This illustrates again how overcalibrated these proposals are and it's not done yet. We still expect the Fed to incorporate CECL into CCAR, which will likely increase the SCB. And, of course, given the absence of a fix to the GSIB clause, it continues to present a headwind into the indefinite future. And aside from those dynamics, there remains the long-standing issue of procyclicality in the overall capital [Technical Difficulty]. We think it's also important to point out that the agencies did actually have a choice here. While it may technically be true that the proposal is Basel compliant, Basel compliant does not mandate a 25% increase in capital requirements. Implementing the Basel III endgame consistently with how the Europeans have by retaining credit risk modeling and also addressing the compounding effects of GSIB and SCB would have achieved Basel compliance without creating this unnecessary increase in capital requirements. As you would expect, we will continue to engage and forcefully advocate during the comment period and beyond in a great deal of technical detail. For the purposes of this call, we wanted to make the equally important broader plans about both the level of capital increase and the flaws in the construct of the framework itself since coherent design is critical to the framework's durability over time. The current proposal exacerbates existing features that discourage beneficial scale and diversification. If it goes through as written, there will likely be significant impacts on pricing and availability of credit for businesses and consumers. In addition, the ongoing and persistent increase in the regulatory cost of market-making for banks suggests that the regulators want dramatic changes to the current operation of the US capital markets. We believe that well-regulated market makers that are committed to deploying capital to clients on a principal basis are a critical building block supporting the breadth, depth and resilience of the American capital markets, which is vital to the US economy. So, caution is warranted when proposing changes of this magnitude. With that, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 6. Consumer spend growth has now reverted to pre-pandemic trends with nominal spend per customer stable and relatively flat year-on-year. Cash buffers continue to normalize to pre-pandemic levels with lower-income groups normalizing faster. Turning now to the financial results, excluding First Republic. CCB reported net income of $5.3 billion on revenue of $17 billion, which was up 19% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 30% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. End-of-period deposits were down 3% quarter-on-quarter. We ranked number one in retail deposit share based on FDIC data and continue to solidify our leadership position in key markets. Client investment assets were up 21% year-on-year, driven by market performance and strong net inflows as we continue to capture yield-seeking flows from our consumer banking customers. In Home Lending, revenue was down 2% year-on-year given a smaller market. Originations of $10.3 billion were up slightly quarter-on-quarter, but they remain down 15% year-on-year. Moving to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 7% year-on-year, driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower Auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 16% year-on-year due to strong account acquisition and continued normalization [for both] (ph). And in Auto, originations were $10.2 billion, up 36% year-on-year as we saw competitors pull back and regained market share. Expenses of $8.5 billion were up 7% year-on-year, largely driven by continued investments in staffing, primarily in front office and technology. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.4 billion, driven by net charge-offs, which were up $720 million year-on-year, predominantly due to continued normalization in Card. The net reserve build of $49 million reflected a $301 million build in Card services, primarily offset by a $250 million release in Home Lending. Next to CIB on page seven. CIB reported net income of $3.1 billion and revenue of $11.7 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.6 billion was down 6% year-on-year. IB fees were down 3% year-on-year and ranked number one with a year-to-date wallet share of 8.6%. In advisory, fees were down 10%. Underwriting fees were up 8% for debt and down 6% directly. In terms of the outlook, we're encouraged by the level of capital markets activity in September, and we have a healthy pipeline going into the fourth quarter. Advisory has also picked up compared to the first half, but year-to-date announced M&A remains down significantly, which will continue to be a headwind. Payments revenue was $2.1 billion, up 3% year-on-year. Excluding equity investments, it was up 12%, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $6.6 billion, down 3% year-on-year against a very strong third quarter last year. Fixed income was up 1%, driven by an increase in financing and trading activity and securitized products, as well as improved performance in credit. This was predominantly offset by currencies in emerging markets coming off a very strong quarter last year. Equity Markets was down 10%, reflecting lower revenues across products compared to a strong prior-year quarter as activity was challenged by lower volatility. Securities Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 9% year-on-year, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Expenses of $7.4 billion were up 11% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher legal expense and wage inflation. Credit costs were net benefit of $185 million, driven by a net reserve release of $230 million, reflecting the impact of net lending activity and net charge-offs of $45 million. Moving to the Commercial Bank on Page 8. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.7 billion. Revenue of $3.7 billion was up 20% year-on-year with payments revenue of $2 billion, up 30% year-on-year, driven by higher rates, and gross Investment Banking and Markets revenue of $821 million was up 8% year-on-year, reflecting increased M&A volume. Expenses of $1.4 billion were up 15% year-on-year, largely driven by an increase in headcount including front-office and technology investments, as well as higher-volume related expense, including the impact of new client acquisition. Average deposits were down 7% year-on-year, 5% quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by lower non-operating deposits as clients opt for higher-yielding alternatives. Loans were up 1% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were flat, reflecting continued stabilization in new loan demand and revolver utilization. And CRE loans were up 1%, reflecting funding of prior year originations of real-estate banking as well as lower pay-off activity. Finally, credit costs were $64 million, including net charge-offs of $50 million and a net reserve build of $14 million. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM, on Page 9. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.1 billion with pretax margin of 31%. Revenue of $4.6 billion was relatively flat year-on-year as higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels were offset by lower performance fees and lower NII deposits. Expenses of $3.1 billion were up 3% year-on-year, driven by continued growth in our private banking advisor teams and the impact of closing the JPMorgan Asset Management China and Global Shares acquisitions. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $20 billion, positive across all asset classes led by equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $40 billion. AUM of $3.2 trillion was up 22% year-on-year and client assets of $4.6 trillion were up 21% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels. Finally, loans were flat quarter-on-quarter, while deposits were down 5%, driven by migration to investments, partially offset by client inflows. Turning to Corporate on Page 10. Corporate reported net income of $911 million. Revenue was $1.5 billion, up $1.8 billion compared to last year. NII was $2 billion, up $1.2 billion year-on-year due to the impact of higher rates, and NIR was a net loss of $506 million and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned upfront. Expenses of $456 million were up $151 million year-on-year. To finish, we have the outlook on Page 11. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex-Markets to be approximately $88.5 billion and $89 billion, respectively, with the increase driven by slower reprice than previously assumed. Consistent with what we've been saying throughout the year, while we don't know when it will normalize, we do not consider this level of NII to be sustainable. Our outlook for 2023 adjusted expense is now approximately $84 billion. And as a reminder, this is on an adjusted basis, which excludes legal expense. Also, remember, this outlook excludes the pending FDIC special assessment. And on Credit, we now expect the 2023 Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.5%, mostly driven by denominator effects due to recent balanced growth. So to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating results. Throughout the year, we've been pointing out the various sources of significant uncertainty in all of those, including the geopolitical situation, economic outlook, rate environment, deposit reprice and the impact of the Basel III endgame proposal are as prominent now as they have been in the recent past. But as always, we continue to prepare for a range of scenarios and are focused on being there for our clients and customers when they need us most. And with that, let's open the line for Q&A. Sure. Thanks, John. I think the themes are pretty much the same as we've seen in prior quarters. So as we talked a little bit about on the press call, we've been trying to be a little bit cautious about recognizing that we don't think the current levels are sustainable. And we do think that we'll have to reprice in some pockets to some degree, maybe with tiering or whatever at some point in the future. And of course, that hasn't happened yet this year. So that's one factor. In the meantime, the CD strategy is working well. We're getting -- continue to get very good feedback from the field and we're capturing money in motion. And so we're seeing -- the sort of internal migration and the associated slow increase in deposit rate paid as a result of CD migration, but that's sort of working as we would have hoped. And so everything is kind of playing out according to plan, I would say. In terms of higher for longer, I think it just means that there will continue to be upward pressure on deposit pricing, both from internal migration and possibly from other effects. And at the end, as we always say, we're going to price products as a function of the competitive market environment. Yeah. I think I would say that while we're not predicting higher rates, I'm sure Jamie will have something to say here, we believe in being prepared for it. And that's been our position for some time. And of course, that's produced good results, and we continue to try to position ourselves. So neither significantly higher rates nor significant lower rates present a particularly large challenge to the company. So probably at the margin, we're still a little bit biased for slightly higher rates. But do keep in mind that when modeling the duration of the balance sheet, higher rates do extend the duration or rather shorten the duration on the deposit side. So that can be a factor as well. Hey, Steve. Yeah, good question. I mean, as you know, obviously, the current levels in Investment Banking remain quite depressed, certainly relative to the very elevated levels that we saw during the pandemic but even relative to sort of 2019, which is what you might consider the last normal year. We do eventually think we'll recover to those levels and hopefully recover to above those levels, recognizing that by the time it happens, you will have had many years of economic growth in the meantime. And to be fair, while the current environment is a little bit complicated in mix and there are some headwinds, as you pointed out, things have improved a little bit. And I think I would say our banking team is a little bit more optimistic than they were last quarter. So it feels to me like a little bit of a slow grind with some positive momentum, but obviously, significant uncertainty in the outlook and some structural headwinds, given lower levels of announced M&A and some regulatory headwinds on that side. Yeah. Those are all good questions, Steve. I think it's probably too early to try to provide that level of quantification on either front. If I start first with the Basel III endgame proposal, from our perspective, we're currently focused on advocating as aggressively as possible for the necessary changes, some of which are what you might call philosophical in nature or some of the things I highlighted in my prepared remarks. But some of them are very technical in nature, including things that we think might actually be mistakes on the proposal. And so talking a lot about optimizing away stuff that might change just feels like a bit premature at this point. I would point out that given how significant operational risk RWA is as part of the proposal, that is -- you can think of that sort of as a generic tax across the entire spectrum. And it's therefore, in some sense, non-optimizable. So we feel that it's important to manage expectations about the level of optimization that's possible once the rule is finalized and hopefully some of the technical items are addressed. Also, it depends on your definition of optimization. There's what I -- sometimes I use the term costless optimization, where it's just technical fixes that don't affect revenue and don't require you to exit businesses. I think that type of optimization will be harder to find than it has been in the past. But as we pointed out, we may simply need to exit things. And that will be because it is better than the alternative, which would be to do activity that's shareholder value disruptive, but it won't be costless. A good example of that is the renewable energy tax credit investment business, which as a result of the quadrupling of the risk weight, may no longer make sense. Now that's one that we hope will be changed but is tricky because those are very long-duration assets. So between now and the rule is finalized, it raises some questions whether we want to put that stuff on the balance sheet. So sorry, a bit of a long answer. But then, yeah, on quantifying CECL and CCAR, I think we've got to wait for that one because given the relative lack of transparency that we have into the Fed's exact modeling in terms of which quarter is the peak and so on and so forth, it's a little bit hard to predict what the exact impact of putting CECL and CCAR is going to be. We just know probabilistically that it will, like everything else these days, tend to push capital higher. Yep. Yeah. So on the central scenario, you should read the research that gets put out by our competitors and our excellent research team. No, but in all seriousness, I think our US economists had their central case outlook to include a very mild recession with, I think, two quarters of negative 0.5% of GDP growth in the fourth quarter and first quarter of this year. And that then got revised out early this quarter to now have sort of modest growth, I think, around 1% for a few quarters into 2024. So just flowing that through our process while acknowledging that we're still skewed to the downside, we're still reserved to a significantly higher unemployment rate on a weighted average basis than is in the central case outlook. So that number we've sometimes given you is 5.5% this quarter. So it's really not much more complicated than that. We're just kind of following the process. And I think your other question was, where am I seeing softness in credit. And I think the answer to that is actually nowhere roughly or certainly nowhere that's not expected, meaning we continue to see the normalization story play out in consumer more or less exactly as expected. And then, of course, we are seeing a trickle of charge-offs coming through the office space. You see that in the charge-off number of the Commercial Bank. But the numbers are very small and more or less just the realization of the allowance that we've already built there. Yeah. So I'll let Jamie speak for himself on that point, but our job is to advocate. We're not going to guess what the sentiment is in Washington. It's a 1,000-page rule proposal as you know. We've got a big team of very smart people studying it very closely. Interestingly, we noted recently that in some of the analysis that they did about the impact on lending, they sort of forgot about like $1 billion of the Fed and their preamble, they forgot about $1 billion of operational risk RWA. So it just highlights that there is a possibility or seem to have forgotten. They simply omitted the impact of the operational risk RWA on fees. So anyway, the point is it's long, it's complicated, it's technical. We do think there are probably some technical mistakes and they are going to forcefully advocate on all of those. And while we disagree with a lot of this stuff, these are technical issues that should be, in some sense, resolved technically. And hopefully, they'll listen. Sorry, I'm just getting a correction in the room. I meant to say trillion. Yeah, a couple of things. So let me do the timing question first. So we're being very clear that we are not predicting when it's going to be a function of the marketplace and the rate environment and competitive dynamics and so on and so forth. So we're just really just trying to remind everyone not bank on the current run rate, which we just don't fundamentally think are sustainable. You'll be aware that before Investor Day last -- earlier this year, we tried to quantify what we thought that kind of normalized range might look like, and we put a sort of mid-70s type number out there. And at Investor Day, we talked about how the acquisition of First Republic was going to push that number up a little bit, although there were some overlaps and so on and so forth. So anyway, with the benefit of time and having everything settled in a little bit, if you sort of push us for that kind of what does that number now look like, we think it's probably closer to about 80 with all the obvious caveats that this is a guess and we don't know when. But we're just trying to point out that it's a bit lower than the current run rate. There was no way that I was in that camp, actually, but I don't know. I'm not sure I have an opinion on it. Yeah, sure. So on loan growth, the story is pretty consistent with what we've been saying all year. So we were seeing very robust loan growth in Card, and that's coming from both spending growth and the normalization of revolving balances. As we look forward, we're still optimistic about that, but it will probably be a little bit more muted than it has been during this normalization period. In Auto, we've also seen pretty robust loan growth recently, both as a function of slightly more competitive pricing on our side as the industry was a little bit slow to raise rates. And so we lost some share previously, and that's come back now. And generally, the supply chain situation is better. So that's been supported. As we look forward there, it should be a little bit more muted. And I think generally in wholesale, the loan growth story is going to be driven just by the economic environment. So depending on what you believe about soft landing, mild recession, no lending, we have slightly lower or slightly higher loan growth, but in any case, I would expect it to be relatively muted. And of course, Home Lending remains fairly constrained both by rates and market conditions. But also, and I think this is true across the board, we will be managing things actively as mentioned in light of Basel III, which may not change originations, but it will change what we retain. Hey, Gerard. Yeah, Gerard, I'd say a couple of things there. So first, it's not just credit, it's also deposit margin, right? So when we talk about over-earning on NII, a disproportionate amount of that is coming out of the consumer franchise for all the reasons that we've talked about. But I would also point out, sometimes we don't like the word overearning because right now, customers are happy, and they're doing CDs. And the broader answer to your question about why we're able to compete effectively really comes back to a decade, two-decade long history of investing for the future and recognizing that there's a holistic value proposition here that includes branches and the app and all the online services and the entire suite of products and services that is around this enterprise, which drives engagement and customer loyalty. And we're seeing some of the benefits of that now, although we're not complacent. The competition is still there, the fintechs are still there, and we know we need to continue investing to preserve the value. And it's also true that the particular circumstances of the current rate and credit environment means that the earnings are a little bit above normal, but that core franchise is extremely robust. That's a good question, Gerard. I think it's a little bit bigger picture than that. And I'm not sure. I get your question. It's a good question, but I'm not sure that the reported interest-bearing, noninterest-bearing split is the best one to look at this through for a couple of reasons. So first, like between wholesale and retail, we've got some amount of noninterest-bearing in wholesale that's sort of the ECR product, and so you see some dynamics there that play out. And in consumer, in a world where savings is paying a relatively low rate paid across checking and savings, the migration dynamics are probably not that different right now. But then, of course, even within consumer across both consumers and small businesses, you've got slightly different dynamics in terms of how people manage their operating balances. So I would tend to zoom out a little bit and see this as a holistic answer that's driven by internal migration from checking, savings, to CDs, from ECR to interest-bearing and wholesale. And then our potential response to the rate environment, the competitive environment, the overall level of system-wide deposits in terms of product-level reprice that may or may not happen at the moment in the future. Yeah. So, Erika, I think the simple answer to your question is those -- I believe that fourth quarter exit number equates to a $90 billion run rate ex-Markets. And we're kind of saying that... Yes, it's not what I meant to say. I didn't hear that. Okay. Anyway, so call it $90 billion run rate on an exit rate basis, and we're saying that we think something a bit more normal is closer to $80 billion. So that's one building block. Underneath that, I think one thing that's interesting actually, is that as the percentage of the deposits which are CDs increases, the sort of balance between internal migration and betas and rate and volume is a little bit less binary and a little bit smoother. So when we look at this type of stuff and we model migration, balances, product-level reprice, as you get out of that lower zero bound with 0% CD mix world, things get a little bit smoother, I would say, overall. So it will be interesting to watch that, but it's obviously one of the most important things for us as a company right now. And we think we can manage it, but it's also worth remembering that the big picture point is just the client franchise. And we've often said, we're very focused on primary bank relationships, and we didn't lose any of those in the last cycle. We're not planning to lose any in this cycle, and that's what sort of a long-term focus means for us. Yeah. Okay. That's a good question, Erika. I think there's a couple of pieces in there. So let me take the most important piece first, which is the 17% through the cycle target. Are we keeping that or not in light of the Basel III endgame proposal? So short answer is we're not going to change that number today. But when you look at what we've disclosed about a 25% increase in capital, it's not -- you have to start by acknowledging that, that is a major headwind to returns. In simple terms, you talk about earnings power and returns, but they're two different things, right? We have to be a little bit pedantic and do numerator, denominator here. Okay. So say the numerator doesn't change, if you just dilute down the numerator by the increased capital, that's a significantly lower return number. I would say that, that's probably the lower bound in terms of the impact of the Basel III endgame for a couple of reasons. One is we are hoping for changes. Two is, once the rule is final, we will seek to reprice in the places where we can. And that will be different in consumer and in wholesale. Some of it will be product level, some of it will be relationship level. But that hopefully can mitigate some of it. But of course, the flip side of that is that's cost getting passed into the real economy, and that's part of the point that we've made about lowering availability of products and services and lending. There may be some opportunities for costless optimization. I'm personally a little bit more pessimistic about those, but we surprised ourselves on those points in the past. So we'll see. And then finally, yeah, we may stop doing certain things, and we may exit things. But I wouldn't necessarily assume that, that's going to do a lot to preserve returns at the 17%. That's going to be about exiting things that are shareholder disruptive but not necessarily producing much higher returns if you know what I mean. So that's that. And then the other part of your question implicitly was talking about organic capital generation, and I think it's just very important to separate impacts on the economy and impacts on long-term returns from our ability to meet the requirements. Of course, as Jamie always says, JPMorgan is going to be fine. And we're building a lot of capital, and we were managing capital conservatively. And we'll be able to build the necessary capital in order to achieve on time or early compliance, which is always what we strive to do. But that doesn't really have any particular bearing on the question of what the long-term return target is or the impact on the real economy. Okay. So I mean, on green shoots, you'll just note that our comments are cautious. I mean, there is momentum. I do think we are a little bit more optimistic than we were. But obviously, markets have been bumpy, both equity markets and rate markets have been very whippy recently. So we don't want to get too carried away with optimism here. We are coming on off a very low base. And so there's a hope and an expectation that we are on the path to normalization and improvement. And of course, the overall economic picture, at least currently, looks solid. The sort of immaculate disinflation trade is actually happening. So those are all reasons to be a little bit optimistic in the near term, but it's tempered with quite a bit of caution. Thanks, Glenn. Yes. Let me do digital banking, Mike. I spent some time on this actually a couple of weeks ago. And it's interesting to note the sort of extent to which the growth in digitally engaged consumers is higher than the overall growth in consumer accounts, meaning that we're continuing to increase the percentage of our consumers that are digitally engaged. And it sort of goes back to my prior point about... For sure, for sure, which actually links to the broader point that what -- in terms of your question about how much is this helping the current NII story, it goes to the larger point of it holistic, through the cycle, multi-channel, fully engaged customer strategy, which requires a lot of investment in branches, obviously, but also in digital services of all sorts. So in many ways, you can see the current environment as a little bit of a payoff of that investment, but that's not like, therefore, we stop investing, obviously. So I guess that's part of the answer. And I guess, your other question is the benefits of being the biggest tech spender. I just think like it's sort of mandatory right? I mean, we're big and very technology-centric business, and the world is competitive. And everything is changing. Younger generations have different expectations, and we have to be nimble, and we have to be on our front foot. And otherwise, we risk getting severely disrupted. So I don't know if Jamie wants to add anything. Yeah. No, because you did ask a little bit about the expense outlook for next year. So I think at the conference, we said I think the consensus was $88 billion, but we're still going through budget process, et cetera, et cetera. So that's still true. I think we're still kind of in the ballpark, but I would say at the margin, there's going to be a little bit of upward... This is all now including First Republic. And I think there'll be a little bit of upward pressure on that as we sort of do our usual thing and look at all the opportunities that we see and the investments that we want to make. So no surprise in that sense that we're going to invest prudently. Nothing dramatic, but probably a little bit of upward pressure on the margin. Yeah. And I think that last point of Jamie's is particularly important because, sure, if you want, you can construct as what I would consider a very optimistic argument that the higher cost of doing business will lead smaller-scale players to exit, and that's a share gain opportunity for us. But I refer back to the comments about the disincentives to beneficial diversification and scale. Getting bigger, especially in Markets, it's quite expensive from, for example, a GSIB perspective. And so you wind up kind of hemmed in on all sides, which is one of the reasons why we're sort of highlighting that it does seem like the only way out sometimes when you look at the cumulative effect of everything that's happened in Markets over the last 15 years is a fundamentally very different system. And well, obviously... Yeah. I mean, I wish I had sort of an answer that fit better into your framework, but in some fundamental sense, we just don't agree with the framework, in the sense that -- and we've been through this over the last couple of years, right? In a world where rates drop very suddenly and recover like quite dramatically and credit becomes abnormally good and then rebounds, and you see these very significant fluctuations in capital markets. We saw that 2021 going into 2022 where the revenue environment can change a lot in the short term for reasons that can be largely out of your control. And while, of course, there are parts of our expense base, which are in the short term, directly sensitive to the revenue environment, and some of those adjust naturally and some of them we adjust more forcefully as a function of volumes. But other things are much more structural. And the goal is to make sure that those other things are sized appropriately to what we believe sustainable through cycle returns are. So we're always very focused on cost. You can be rest assured of that. That discipline internally is as aggressive as ever as we go through the budget cycle, but they're long-term plays. And you really shouldn't expect us to see trying to generate cosmetically lower cost in response to a lower revenue environment, where we didn't balloon the cost when the revenue became, as we've argued, unsustainably high. Yeah. So you're right about the contribution and about the runoff of loans and it is notable, the net income, the First Republic-related net income that we printed this quarter. So the first thing to say is that we don't think that, that First Republic-related net income number from this quarter is a sustainable indicator of the future run rate. Some of the same dynamics that we just talked about, in particular, overearning on deposits or sort of above-normal deposit margins also apply to First Republic franchise to some degree. So we would expect that to normalize. And probably more significantly, as I think you alluded to, we do have some accelerated pull-to-par on some of the commitments that we took on at a fair value discount as part of the acquisition. And so that's a short-term tailwind in the revenue that will come out of that over the next few quarters. And yeah, in terms of how it's going overall and deepening the relationships, that remains a focus. And I think more of that will happen as we continue the integration and we continue stabilizing. And yeah, I think, as I said, I think, on the press call, things are going well, arguably a little bit better than we had sort of modeled as part of the acquisition, and we're happy to see that."

            "name": "Jamie Dimon",
            "content": "Hey, good morning, everybody. Before we start the actual call, I want to repeat something we just said on the press call. So before we get into the discussion about third-quarter earnings, I just want to say how deeply saddened that we all are about the recent horrific attacks on Israel and the resulting bloodshed and more. Terrorism and hatred have no place in our civilized world and all of our hearts here at JPMorgan Chase go out to all who are suffering. Inside the company, some people think it will happen sooner, i.e., me. Some people think it will happen later, i.e., Jen and Marianne and Jeremy. It was [$2.5 billion] (ph). She said $22.9 billion. And I would just say quantitative tightening there. That will be a large number, and we don't exactly know the effect where wholesale, consumer -- remember also the Fed has the RRP program, which is also sucking money into the Fed directly reducing deposits. That's still [$1 trillion, too] (ph). Yes. Go ahead, Jeremy. Do you want to start? So I would add caution. There has been an extraordinary amount of fiscal monetary stimulus still in the system. And you can't look at -- and of course, it can drive markets and sentiment and sales and profits and all that, but it can't stay like this forever. Between Q2, if you've never had, and how much the fiscal stimulus is going to continue at this rate before you have kind of [indiscernible] kind of factors. So I just -- I think you have to be very cautious. And of course, the dealer policies, I think, is just an extraordinary issue we have to deal with. How do you prepare the company for that? We do 100 stress tests a week. And we do multiple views of it, including geopolitical problems or interest rate problems. But usually, geopolitics presents itself as usually as a deep recession or a mild recession, a recession part of the world or markets going down a lot. And because markets do well is not a reason ever to say they're going to continue to do well. If you don't believe me, remember 1987, 1990, 1994, the year 2000, the year 2009, and people don't predict those inflection points. I just -- but my caution is that we are facing so many uncertainties out there. You just got to be very cautious [what you're] (ph) facing. And like I said, the other thing about the green shoots regardless of that, we try to run the company so that we serve the clients day in and day out with better products and better services, securely, safely and all those things. And that's the ultimate goal. We know there are going to be bad times. That's not a surprise as there are going to be bad times. We don't always know how they're coming and where they're coming from, but we keep on serving clients, doing good for clients, you can build a good business kind of separate from what it does to your returns. That's a slightly different issue at this point. But we'll deal with that, too, when we figure out what to do. The percent who are digital-only is much lower than that. And just the competition, we look at it as, it's Wells. It was coming back, which I'm happy for you guys. It's obviously [Marcus, it's Apple. It's Chime, it's Dave] (ph). There's a lot of people coming up with these businesses in different ways. Some have been quite successful, like Stripe in payments. And so we want to be very good and very competitive. Some of that tech spending is things which are almost a sine qua non, which is cybersecurity, data center resiliency, regulatory requirements and things like that, which we simply are going to do and be very, very good at to protect the company. Well, I don't agree with that statement. Banks have an extraordinary amount of proprietary data in addition to when you do like a large language model, that's public data. It's looking at everything in the Internet or everything that's ever been published or something like that. But AI is an extraordinarily good tool to use. We just put a woman who is running at our table. So it's data analytics, AI, et cetera. And there are multiple types of AI. So we use AI for risk, fraud, marketing, prospecting. And the management team is getting better and better and say, how can we use data to do a better job to reduce errors, to serve clients better, to have a salesperson have co-pilots. They know why even the clients calling us something like that. And so we simply have to do it. Does it create opportunity for disruptors to come in? Yeah, of course. That's always been true with technology and -- but we'll be quite good at it. First Republic too, or no? Can I just answer real quickly? We don't really know. It's a one-sided conversation generally. They say put in your comments. So everyone's going to put in extensive comments kind of like you heard from Jeremy, and we don't really know. We don't really know what's going on inside the Fed, how many people get involved. In my view, it's become a very politicized process as opposed to the technical analysis, I think that's required to do it exactly right. So we'll see. I think -- so if you look at Markets alone, it's a huge, I think, 60% increase in capital. And if you look at it, you can do that by product, for some products it worth it than for others. But generally, it's bad across all products. And market make -- but the really important thing is market making is a critical function. And if you look at the world, only so many large market makers who can make markets for governments, hospitals, cities, schools, states, IMF, World Bank, BlackRock, Blackstone and all those various things to buy and sell for their clients in size, and market makers have a different function than hedge funds. And I don't know what the real intent was with this, this is another one, I think, needs to be really thought through. What are you trying to accomplish? We do market making quite safe. We've never lost the kind of money that people talk about in market making in the global market [shock] (ph) or something like that. But the other thing about market making, I do agree it could actually force some people out. It will force lower positions, which is why I think it's a little risky, but it may also force more consolidation. And so clients, since they need it so much, there may be consolidation in unintended way in market making and obviously more volatile markets because with all the constraints for the LCR, SLR, capital, et cetera, you will constantly be up against limitations on what you can do. Great opportunity for European market makers. I mean, a great opportunity. Like they can do repo and FX and swaps and credit and stuff with 30% less capital. That is a big difference in that kind of business. Thank you very much."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go to the live presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.\nJeremy Barnum: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer on the back. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $14.5 billion, EPS of $4.75 on revenue of $42.4 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 25%. These results included the First Republic bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion and credit reserve build for the First Republic lending portfolio $1.2 billion as well as $900 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate. Touching on a few highlights, CCB Client investment assets were up 18% year-on-year, we had record long-term inflows in AWM and we ranked Number One in IB Fee wallet share. Before giving you more detail on financials, let me give you a brief updates on the status of the First Republic integration on Page 2. The settlement process with the FDIC is on schedule, the number of key milestone being recently completed. Systems integration is also proceeding at pace and we are targeting being substantially complete by mid-2024. First Republic employees have formally joined us as of July 2, and we're pleased to have had very-high acceptance rates on our offers. And although it's still early days, as we get the sales force back in the market, we are happy to see the client retention is strong with about a $6 billion of net deposit inflows since the acquisition. Now, turning back to this quarter's results on Page 3. You'll see that in various parts of the presentation, we have specifically called out the impact of First Republic where relevant. To make things easier. I'm going to start by discussing the overall impact of First Republic on this quarter's results at the firm-wide level. Then, for the rest of the presentation, I will generally exclude the impact of First Republic, in order to improve comparability with prior periods. With that in mind, in this quarter, First Republic contributed $4 billion of revenue, $599 million of expense and $2.4 billion of net income. As noted on the first page, this includes $2.7 billion of bargain purchase gain, which is reflected in NIR in the Corporate segment as well as $1.2 billion of allowance build. And remember that the deal happened on May 1, so the First Republic numbers only represent two months of results. You'll see in the line-of-business results that we are showing First Republic revenue as allowance in CCB, CB and AWM. And for the purposes of this quarter's results, all of the deposits are in CCB and substantially all of the expenses are in Corporate. As the integration continues, some of those items will get allocated across the segments. Now turning back to firm-wide results excluding First Republic. Revenue of $38.4 billion was up $6.7 billion or 21% year-on-year. NII, ex-markets, was up $7.8 billion or 57%, driven by higher rates. NIR ex-markets was down $293 million, largely driven by the net investment securities losses I mentioned earlier, partially offset by a number of less notable items, primarily in the prior year. And Markets revenue was down $772 million or 10% year-on year. Expenses of $20.2 billion were up $1.5 billion or 8% year-on year, primarily driven by higher compensation expense including wage inflation and higher legal expense. And credit costs of $1.7 billion included net charge-offs of $1.4 billion, predominantly in card. The net reserve build included a $389 million build in the commercial bank and $200 million build in card and a $243 million release in corporate, all of which I will cover in more detail later. On to balance sheet and capital on Page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio at 13.8%, flat versus the prior quarter as the benefit of net income less distributions was offset by the impact of First Republic. And as you can see in the two charts on the page, we've given you some information about the impact of the transaction on both RWA and the CET1 ratio. And as you know, we completed CCAR a couple of weeks ago. Our new indicative SCB is 2.9% versus our current requirements of 4% and it goes into effect in 4Q '23. The new SCB also reflects the Board's intention to increase the dividend to $1.05 per share in the third quarter. On liquidity, our bank LCR for the second quarter ended at 129%, in line with what we anticipated at Investor Day. About half of the reduction is associated with the First Republic transaction. And while we're on the balance sheet, as we previewed in the 10-K, we will be updating our earnings at-risk model to incorporate the impact of deposit repricing lags. So when we released this quarter's 10-Q, you will see the up 100 basis point parallel shift scenario will be about positive $2.5 billion, whereas in the absence of the change, it would have been about negative $1.5 billion. Now, let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on Page 5. Both U.S. Consumers and Small Businesses remained resilient and we haven't observed any meaningful changes to the trends in our data we discussed at Investor Day. Turning now to the financial results, which I will speak to excluding the impact of First Republic for CCB, CB and AWM. CCB reported net income of $5 billion on revenue of $16.4 billion, which was up 31% year-on year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 59% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. End-of-period deposits were down 4% quarter-on-quarter, as customers continue to spend down their cash buffers, including for seasonal tax payments and seek higher-yielding products. Client investment assets were up 18% year-on year, driven by market performance and strong net inflows across our adviser and digital channels. In Home Lending, revenue was down 23% year-on-year, driven by lower NII and higher loan spreads and lower servicing and production revenue. Originations were up quarter-on-quarter, driven by seasonality, although still down 54% year-on-year. Moving to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 5%, largely driven by higher card services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 18% year-on-year, which was the result of revolve normalization and strong new account growth. And in Auto, originations were up $12 billion, up 71% year-on-year as competitors pulled back and inventories continue to slowly recover. Expenses of $8.3 billion were up 8% year-on-year, driven by compensation, predominantly due to wage inflation and headcount growth as we continue to invest in our front office and technology staffing as well as marketing. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.5 billion, reflecting the reserve build of $203 million, driven by loan growth in Card Services. Net charge-offs were $1.3 billion, up $640 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card as 30 day past delinquencies have returned to pre-pandemic levels, in line with our expectations. Next, the CIB on Page 6. CIB reported net income of $4.1 billion on revenue of $12.5 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.5 billion was up 11% year-on-year or down 7% excluding bridge book markdowns in the prior year. IB fees were down 6% year-on-year and we ranked Number One with year-to-date wallet share of 8.4%. In advisory, fees were down 19%. Underwriting fees were down 6% for debt and up 30% for equity with more positive momentum in the last month of the quarter. In terms of the second-half outlook, we have seen encouraging signs of activity in capital markets, and July should be a good indicator for the remainder of the year. However, year-to-date announced M&A is down significantly, which will be a headwind. Moving to Markets, total revenue was $7 billion, down 10% year-on-year. Fixed-income was down 3%. As expected, the macro franchise substantially normalized from last year's elevated levels of volatility and client flows. This was largely offset by improved performance in the Securitized Products Group and Credit. Equity markets was down 20% against a very strong prior year quarter, particularly in derivatives. Payments revenue was $2.5 billion, up 61% year-on-year. Excluding equity investments, it was up 32%, predominantly driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Security services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 6% year-on-year, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower fees. Expenses of $6.9 billion were up 1% year-on-year, driven by higher non-compensation expense as well as wage inflation and headcount growth, largely offset by lower revenue-related compensation. Moving to the Commercial Bank on Page 7. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.5 billion. Revenue of $3.8 billion was up 42% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins. Payments revenue of $2.2 billion was up 79% year-on-year, driven by higher rates. Gross Investment Banking and Markets revenue of $767 million was down 3% year-on-year, primarily driven by fewer large M&A deals. Expenses of $1.3 billion were up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation expense, including fun office hiring and technology investments, as well as higher volume-related expense. Average deposits were up 3% quarter-on-quarter driven by inflows related to new client acquisition, partially offset by continued attrition in non-operating deposits. Loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were up 2%, reflecting stabilization in new loan demand and revolver utilization in the current economic environment as well as pockets of growth in areas where we are investing. CRE loans were also up 1%, reflecting funding on prior year originations for construction loans and real-estate banking as well as increased affordable housing activity. Finally, credit costs were $489 million. Net charge-offs were $100 million, including $82 million in the office real-estate portfolio and the net reserve build of $389 million was driven by updates to certain assumptions related to the office real-estate market as well as net downgrade activity in Middle Market banking. Then, to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 8. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.1 billion with pretax margin of 32%. Revenue of $4.6 billion was up 8% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins on lower balances and higher management fees on strong net inflows. Expenses of $3.2 billion were up 8% year-on-year, driven by higher compensation, including growth in our private banking advisor teams, higher revenue-related compensation and the impact of Global Shares and JPMorgan Asset Management China, both of which closed within the last year. For the quarter, record net long-term inflows were $61 billion, positive across all channels, regions and asset classes, led by fixed-income and equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $60 billion. AUM of $3.2 trillion was up 16% year-on-year and overall client assets of $4.6 trillion were up 20% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows, higher market levels and the impact of the acquisition of Global Shares. And finally, loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower securities-based lending and deposits were down 6%. Turning to Corporate on Page 9. As I noted upfront, we are reporting the First Republic bargain purchase gain and substantially all of the expenses in Corporate. Excluding those items, Corporate reported net income of $339 million; revenue was $985 million, up $905 million compared to last year; NII was $1.8 billion, up $1.4 billion year-on-year due to the impact of higher rates; NIR was a net loss of $782 million and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned upfront. Expenses of $590 million were up $384 million year-on year, largely driven by higher legal expense. And credit costs were a net benefit of $243 million, reflecting reserve release of the deposit placed with First Republic in the first quarter was eliminated as part of the transaction. Next, the outlook on Page 10. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex-markets to be approximately $87 billion, the increase driven by higher rates coupled with slower deposit repricing than previously assumed across both consumer and wholesale. And I should take the opportunity to remind you once again that significant sources of uncertainty remained and we do expect the NII run rate to be substantially below this quarter's run-rate at some point in the future, as competition for deposits plays out. Our expense outlook for 2023 remains approximately $84.5 billion. And on credit, we continue to expect the 2023 card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.6%. So, to wrap up, we are proud of the exceptionally strong operating results this quarter. As we look forward, we remain focused on the significant uncertainties relating to the economic outlook, competition for deposits and the impact on capital from the pending finalization of the Basel III rules. Nonetheless, despite the likely headwinds ahead, we remain optimistic about the Company's ability to continue delivering excellent performance through a range of scenarios. With that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: The first question is coming from the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed.\nJim Mitchell: Thanks. Good morning. Hey Jeremy, you talked about NII guidance. Clearly, Fed funds futures are up, so it makes some sense. But maybe, I guess first, could you kind of discuss, I guess, comment on deposit behavior broadly around betas and mix and what you're seeing there? So far, it seems to be coming in a little better expected. And then secondly and probably more importantly, can you help us think about the implications of higher for longer rates on the outlook for NII next year and beyond. I guess the intermediate term outlook that you guys have talked about.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, sure. Thanks, Jim. So -- yes, so when we talk about the drivers of the upward revision, as I said, it's higher rates coupled with lower deposit reprice, hard to untangle the two. And specifically, I think when you look at Consumer, the combination of the passage of time and the positive feedback we're getting from the field and the CD offerings in particular has meant that it's quite a stable environment from that perspective. And similarly in wholesale, we're just seeing slower internal migrations. You asked about mix. I think that obviously, we're seeing the CD mix increase and we would continue to expect -- we would continue to -- we would expect that to continue to take place, probably even past the peak of the rate cycle into next year as we continue to capture money in motion. But as you say, the most important point is the fact that, as I said earlier, we don't consider this level of NII generation to be sustainable and we talked previously about the medium-term run-rate in the mid-70s that was before First Republic and you know you could argue that maybe that number should be a little higher, but whatever it is, it's a lot lower than the current number. We don't know when that's going to happen. We're not going to predict the exact moment. That's going to be a function of competitive dynamics in the marketplace, but we want to be clear that we do expect it at some point.\nJim Mitchell: Okay. But, I guess I just one to follow-up on that, just if we don't get rate cuts until middle of next year or later, does that sort of give some confidence to the outlook for next year or are you still worried about significant reprice?\nJeremy Barnum: I wouldn't necessarily assume that the evolution from the current run-rate into that mid-70s number is that sensitive to the rate outlook in particular. When we put that number out there, we looked at a range of different types of rate environments and the reprice that we think would be associated with that. It was really meant to capture more of what we consider to be a through-the-cycle sustainable number. So, I wouldn't think of it as being particularly rate dependent.\nJim Mitchell: Okay, great. Thanks.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. You may proceed.\nErika Najarian: Hi, good morning, Jeremy. And I'm just laughing to myself, because I said to you at Investor Day, do you have any more NII rabbits to pull out of the hat and I guess you do. So I guess, I want to ask a broader question really here, and maybe Jamie I'd like to get your thoughts. So you earned 23% ROTCE on 13.8% CET1 and we hear you loud and clear that your more normalized NII generation is not $87 billion. That being said and fully taking into account the potential haircut from Basel III end game, is it possible that your natural ROTCE is maybe above that 17% through-the-cycle rate when rates aren't zero, because when you first introduced that ROTCE target, we were in a different role from a rate scenario and everybody is talking about, even if the Fed cuts, the natural sort of bottom in Fed funds is not going to be zero. So, any input on that would be great.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. Thanks, Erika. I mean it's a good question. There is a lot in there obviously. I guess I would start by saying that when we talk about 17% through-the-cycle ROTCE, even though we may have introduced that in a moment where we brought the lowest eurobond, it was always premised on a sort of normalized rate environment. And at some level, that remains true today. Furthermore -- you didn't ask this explicitly, but in the context of the proposed Basel III end-game, one relevant question might be, if you have a lot more capital in the denominator, what happens to that target. So, I think -- as I said in my prepared remarks, we feel very confident about the Company's ability to produce excellent returns through the cycle. There's a lot of moving parts right now in that. Some of them could be good, some of them could be bad. Narrowly on the capital one, the one thing to point out is that the straight-up math, simply diluting down the ROTCE by expand the denominator misses the possibility of reprice, you know repricing on products and services, which of course goes back to our point that these capital increases do have impacts on the real economy. So, I'm not suggesting that we can price our way out of it, but we obviously need to get the right returns on products and services, and where we have pricing power, we will adjust to the higher capital. So lot of moving parts in there, but I think the important point is that through a range of scenarios, we feel good about our ability to deliver the results and we'll see how the mix of all the various factors plays out, especially after we see the Basel III proposal and it goes through the common period.\nJamie Dimon: Erika, I'll say one thing. Of course we have a mix of businesses that earn from like 0% ROTCE to a 100%. We have some which are very capital-intensive, so we look at kind of all of them and I think 17% is a good number and a good target. The other thing we're earning on is credit. We've been over in credit for a substantial amount of time now, we're quite cautious about it. We know that it's going to kick-off just as a normalized it will be, considering more than that is now. Look, we would consider credit card normalized to be closer to 3.5%.\nErika Najarian: And, so my follow-up question there, maybe Jeremy, could you remind us what unemployment rate has embedded in your ACL ratio as of the second quarter?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, it's still 5.8%.\nErika Najarian: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of John McDonald from Autonomous Research. You may proceed.\nJohn McDonald: Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, wanted to ask about capital in the wake of the par speech, we don't have the details yet, but just kind of want to ask about options that you have and strategies for mitigation, both on RWA and potentially on the G-SIB front as well as you contemplate what you heard recently?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, thanks, John. So, obviously, we're thinking about that a lot. On the other hand, as much as there have been a lot of very detailed rumors out there that might lead you to start to try to do some planning, it does seem like this time it's real and we are actually going to get a proposal, ultimately sometime this month or something. So sooner or not, we'll get to see something actually on paper and we can stop kind of the guesswork. Having said that, indulging in a little bit of guesswork, it does seem like the biggest single driver of the increase that people are talking about including Chair, Powell's 20% number or Vice Chair Barr's 2% of RWA which runs up being roughly the same, is just the way operational risk is getting introduced into the standardized pillar. And that is a little bit of a straight-up across-the-board tax on everything. It's kind of hard to optimize your way out of that, with the exception, obviously, of the fact that you can simply increase price, assuming you have pricing power, but that's obviously not what we want and that's what we sort of mean by impacts on the real economy. So there are details, there is a lot of the FRTB stuff, we can get way into the weeds there within the markets business and we do have a good track-record of adjusting and optimizing. But this time around, it may be a more fundamental set of questions around business mix as opposed to the ability to sort of optimizing in a very technical way.\nJohn McDonald: Okay, that's helpful. And with a number of years for this to phase-in and you generating capital at a high level, even if the ROTCE comes down a bit. How should we think about your pace of building capital for these new changes versus doing your everyday course of investing and buybacks and things like that over the next couple of years?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. I mean, I guess I'm sort of tempted to give you our standard capital hierarchy here. I mean, we're not going to stack back investments, right, that won't come as a surprise to you. Generally speaking, we're always going to try to comply with new requirements early. So, when we know the requirements, I mean when we have visibility, obviously given how much organic capital we're generating right now, whatever the answer winds up being, it will be pretty easy to comply, narrowly speaking. But that's not the same as saying that there won't be consequences to returns or to pricing. And if for whatever reason, things aren't exactly as we're anticipating, I don't see us sacrificing investments that we see are strategically critical in order to comply with higher capital requirements ahead of the formal timing or whatever.\nJohn McDonald: Okay, and there is some room for buybacks?\nJeremy Barnum: Unlikely, obviously, that would be an unlikely outcome.\nJohn McDonald: Okay, thank you.\nJeremy Barnum: Sorry, John, go ahead. Did you have a follow-up?\nJohn McDonald: Yes. No, just do buybacks play a role in the next couple of years, strategically, just episodically you buyback?\nJeremy Barnum: I mean, capital hierarchy again, right. In the end, when we have nothing else to do with the money, we'll do buybacks and we've talked about the $12 billion for this year. Obviously, lot of new moving parts there, although all else equal, given what we've done so far, that's still probably a reasonable number for the full year. But, yes, that's always going to be at the end of the list, but, yes.\nJohn McDonald: Got it. Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Next we'll go to the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. You may proceed.\nKen Usdin: Well, thanks, good morning. I just wanted to ask a little bit about, how you're feeling about the trade-off between like the commercial economy and what might come through in terms of future loan growth versus kind of green shoots that people are talking about in the investment banking pipeline, and just how it feels in terms of like reopening of markets and the trade-off between getting similar to those fees in versus what's happening on the loan demand side. Thanks.\nJeremy Barnum: Sure. A good question, Ken. So I think in terms of investment banking end markets, yes, better-than-expected last month. Well we talked about green shoots, especially in capital markets generally still definitely some headwinds in M&A, lower amounts activity, some regulatory headwinds there. So we'll see -- I think it's a little too early to call a trend there based on recent results, but we'll see. In terms of the broader economy and loan growth expectations. Generally, we do still expect reasonably robust card loan growth. But away from that, for a variety of different reasons at different products, whether it'd be mortgage or C&I, after revolver normalization, and especially if we see a little bit of a cooling off of the economy, I would expect loan demand to be relatively modest there. So we're not really expecting meaningful growth away from card. But of course, we're there for the right deals, right products, right terms, we went through-the-cycle. So, I see that as more of a demand-driven narrative, which will be a function of the economy rather than any tightening on our side.\nKen Usdin: That makes sense. And as a follow-up to that. On the consumer side, you mentioned that consumers continue to spend, albeit a little more slowly and you mentioned that consumers are also using their excess deposits, a little bit more as well. Could you just elaborate a little bit more on just your feeling about the state-of-the consumer and is that is that car growth continued to be driven by people needing to revolve as opposed to wanting to have more in their deposits just kind of what the trade-off on that side to.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. I mean to us, I think we still see this as a normalization not deterioration story when we talk about consumer products. Actually revolve per account has still not gotten to pre pandemic levels actually. So, I would definitely say there's a wanting rather than needing at least for our portfolio at this point. And yes, I think that consumer continues to surprise on the upside here.\nKen Usdin: Got it. Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Next we'll go to the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nGerard Cassidy: Good morning, Jeremy and good morning, Jamie. Jeremy, can you give us your view on how you're measuring the treasury functions and the asset-liability of your balance sheet as we go forward versus the way you guys were positioning and managing it a year-ago in view of the fact that it looks like maybe we're approaching the terminal rate on Fed funds rates?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. Gerard, I would say, honestly, not much change there actually, no. We've been pretty consistently concerned about the risk of higher rates. Of course, we always try to position things to produce reasonable outcomes across a broad range of scenarios. But at the margin, we've been biased towards higher rates and that maybe a little less true at these levels than it was before, although lot of that is just the consequence of deposit comp actually playing out in modeling. But in any case, all else equal, I think we are going to continue to focus on making sure we're fine in a higher-rate scenario, while staying balanced across a range of scenarios. So not really a lot of change in our positioning and that's obviously, including the fact that we took on First Republic, which even net of some of the liabilities, had a long structural interest rate position. We did not actually want to get longer as part of the deal, and so as a result, we took actions to ensure that now we are still about the same as we were last quarter.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And then as a follow-up, you mentioned in giving us the read-through on the Commercial Banking segment of the business that you'd had some reserve building tied to some office real-estate and also some downgrades in the middle-market area. Can you go a little deeper? What are you guys seeing in this area of both commercial real estate but at also the C&I loans, what's happening in that segment as well?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, so. I would caution you from drawing too broad a conclusion from this. I mean. I think that when we talk about office versus, for example. Our portfolio, as you know is quite small, and our exposure to sort of so-called urban dense office is even smaller. The vast majority of our overall portfolio is multiply lending. So as resolved like our sample size observed valuations on office properties is quite small, but you know, we'd like to be sort of ahead of the cycle. And based on everything that we saw this quarter. So it's reasonable to build a little bit there to get to what felt like a comfortable coverage ratio. Across the rest of the Middle Market segment, we saw downgrades and excess of upgrades. But, I don't see that as sort of necessarily indicative of anything terribly significant in the broader read-across.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you.\nOperator: Next we'll go to the line of Steve Chubak from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steve you there? It looks like his line dropped. Next we'll go to the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. You may proceed.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Good morning. I guess just first question, following-up on the outlook for the economy, like we've all been worried about a recession for year and there is a debate about the lag effects of the Fed rate hike cycle when you think about -- Jeremy, I think you mentioned you have an unemployment outlook relatively similar today versus a quarter ago. How worried should we be in terms of the credit cycle six months to 12 months from now or are you leaning towards concluding that maybe U.S. businesses, consumers have absorbed the late-cycle a lot better than we expected a year ago.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. So I am sure, Jamie has some views here. But in my in my view, I would just caution against jumping to too many super positive conclusions based on a couple of recent trends. And I think generally our point is less about trying to predict a particular outcome and more about trying to make sure that we don't get too much euphoria that over concentrates people on one particular predictions when we know that there is a range of outcomes out there. So obviously, we were talking a lot about the potential for a soft lending right now. No lending, neither, it's inflation or whatever and -- whether our own views on that have changed meaningfully. I don't know, but the broader point is we continue to be quite focused on, Jamie's prior comments that loss rates still have time to -- room to normalize even both pandemics we're probably over-earning on credit a little bit Obviously, we've talked about the expectation that the NII is going to come down quite a bit, so even, forgetting about whether you've got some surprisingly negative outcomes on the economy is always today even in the central case, you just need to recognize that there should be some significant normalization.\nJamie Dimon: Yes. I would just add, the 5.8% is not our prediction, that is the average of the unemployment under multiple scenarios that we have to use which hypothetical for CECL. Asset predictions on something different and we don't know the outcome. We trying to be really clear here, the consumer in good shape, their spending down their excess cash. That's all. Tailwinds. If we go into recession, we're going with rather good condition, low borrowings and good, our price-value still but the headwinds are substantial and somewhat unprecedented. There is more Ukraine Oil Gas, market, timing, unprecedented fiscal, needs of governments, few team which we've never experienced before, I just think people should take a deep breath of that and we don't know those things because the soft landing in mild recession for our recession. And obviously, sure we will be the best.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. And just a follow-up on the upcoming Basel reforms. Two questions. You've talked about the impact of the U.S. economy like others have said the same at this point is that falling on deaf ears. And secondly, maybe, Jeremy. If you can touch upon. This structural changes that you expect to make in the capital markets business because of FRTB . Thank you.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, so on your first point. I mean, I think you can just read Vice-Chair of our speech right. He addressed that point early directly. He clearly doesn't agree as this is right. So we'll see what happens. We continue to feel that all else equal, higher capital requirements, definitely are going to increase the cost of credit, which is bad for the economy. So we'll see what happens on that. On an FRTB, it's really very nuanced, it's probably like to much detail for this call to be honest, but just to give you like one immaterial and insignificant but useful example, one-product under FRTB has yield curve spread options and if the FRTB proposal goes through, as currently written, that product becomes not viable. So obviously, if we need to stop doing that product, no one really cares, but it's just one example of the way, sometimes when you're really disciplined about allocating capital thoroughly, all the way down to new products and responding accordingly. You can wind-up having to change our business mix there. Obviously, more significant products that matter much more of a real economy like mortgage where, the layering on of the operational risk in the way it's being proposed, especially if some of the other beneficial elements of the proposal don't come through, you're once again, making the product even harder to offer the homeowners, so we'll see, we'll see what happens.\nJamie Dimon: And I would just add to that even though the product doesn't make money, you might do it for clients who are great clients. The advantage by-product, by client by effectively business mix and further adjustments. Whilst these loans don't make sense for your balance sheet as a whole, almost anyone. We just need to keep up to recognize that and we just managed through all the various complications here and you're going to the other do.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Next we'll go to the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.\nMike Mayo: Hi. I had another question on Vice-Chair Bar's speech from this week. I do except the capital ratios do go up 20% for you. And perhaps others to what degree would you think about changing your business model in terms of remixing, will you do business repricing or simply removing activities that used to do it. Kind of ironic, or maybe it's not ironic though, Apollo hit an all-time stock price high at the same week as to speech. So does that -- how much business they have JPMorgan or the industry capital ratios to go up as much as potentially proposed.\nJamie Dimon: Yes. Before Jeremy answer that question, this is great news for hedge funds, private-equity, private credit, Apollo, Blackstone and the gas industries.\nJeremy Barnum: Exactly. I was going to say Mike, yes to everything. So, rename, re-pricing, yes, definitely. To the extent that we have pricing power and higher capital requirements, mean that we're not generating the right returns for shareholders, we will try to reprice and we'll see how that sticks and how that flows into economy and how that affects demand for products. And if the repricing is not las, successful then in some cases, we will have to remix that means getting out of certain products and services. And as Jim points out, that probably means that those products and services we have the regulated perimeter and go into elsewhere and that's fine, as Jamey pointed out, those people are clients and I think that point was addressed also in Vice-Chair Bar speech. So, but in our traditionally, having risky activities we have a regulated perimeter has had some negative consequences. So these are all important things to consider.\nMike Mayo: All right. And separate question, I appreciate the Investor Day. It gives a little bit more color on the degree that your investment may or may not pan-out. We are still watching that closely. Having said that you've just increased revenue guidance by $10 billion for NII, between this quarter and the first quarter without changing expense guidance by even one dollar. Are you tempted to spend a little bit more, why not then more if you're gaining share and I'm not saying you should. I'm just wondering like, aren't you tempted to do so. You've $10 billion more revenues, you're not spending one dollar more of expenses like why not?\nJamie Dimon: Mike, let me get this right, you're actually complaining that our expenses aren't high enough, is that right?\nMike Mayo: Wait, just to be clear, it's just a part of the question I asked for two years, going back, whether or not, but.\nJeremy Barnum: I appreciate the balance. Now in all seriousness, we've always been pretty clear right that our spending is through-the-cycles funding, based on through this cycle investment, through-the-cycle spending based on our through-the-cycle view of the earnings generating power of the company and the goal to produce the right returns. So broadly speaking, NII tends to flow straight-through to the bottom-line, both fund is growing up, and by the way, when it's going down too and we've been through those moments, as you will remember. So, whether or not there are opportunities to deploy some more dollars into marketing and stuff like that, we have actually looked at that recently. I don't see that being a meaningful item this year, which is part of why we have not revised the expense guidance so far. But this is about investing through-the-cycle and being honest and disciplined about which revenue items flow, carried expense loading and which item don't.\nMike Mayo: And then last quick follow-up.\nJamie Dimon: I think we're kind of running as fast as we can. So you actually set down the risk credit compliance, audit market bankers recruiter trainers -- this is it. We're a full effort right now. And we want to make sure we get things right and get things thoughtful and careful. So it's not just the money, it's the people and how many things can change all the once and add to all at once.\nMike Mayo: And then one quick follow-up to that. Your efficiency ratio this quarter is the lowest we've seen in a long, long-time. I guess you're saying don't extrapolate this efficiency ratio because NII will come down at some point, but when you just simply look at you benchmark yourself against the low-cost providers. Where do you think, you're there now and where it can you still go because extrapolate this quarter you're getting closer?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. I mean, you or yourself right? You definitely can't extrapolate the current numbers, but. I think more broadly on benefiting our benchmarking ourselves too low-cost providers that sort of speaks to an area that you've been interested in for a long-time, which is all of the investment that we're doing in technology to improve generally scalability and get more of our cost base to be variable versus fixed. In terms of how we respond to volumes that's a big part of the reason that we're doing the investments that we're doing and modernization and cloud and AI and all that type of stuff that we're talking about, so. I think we feel really good about our efficiency as a company, but there definitely is room for improvement.\nMike Mayo: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Next we'll go to the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. You may proceed.\nSteve Chubak: Hi, thanks for taking the question and apologies for the technical issues earlier. Wanted to ask on the deposit outlook, just with signs at recent liquidity drawdown has come predominantly out of our versus industry deposits. I just wanted to get your thoughts on what expectations you have for deposit growth in the second-half, both for you and even the broader industry, especially as treasury issuance really begins to ramp-in earnest. Yes, good question, Steve if. So, let me say a couple things about this. So obviously our deposit numbers have bounced around a little bit as a function of some of the turmoil that we saw in regional banks, as well as obviously the public transaction, but now if you look at our kind of end-of-period deposits this quarter and project forward. Our core view is that we would expect a sort of modest downward trend to reassert itself from this higher starting point broadly as a function of QTS with the system. But, noting that we do have some hope for offset by taking share, just to get a couple of examples like in consumer. We've got some of our branch expansion markets seasoning. And so their share over increase their and in wholesale, we've obviously invested a lot in products and services. And so we think we have compelling offerings that are helping us win mandates. And so there are potentially some share offsets there. but broadly we are core view remains modest deposit declines across the franchise. Within that, you know, the same thing, we have noted that as we got through the desk fueling and the CGA build it has come into effect a lot of bill issuance. The big question in the market about whether that was going to come out of reserves have come out of RFP. And so-far, with most of the GTA, they're on I guess the targeting 600, and they're at 550 or something almost done.\nJeremy Barnum: You know more of it and some people feared has kind of RFPs. So, as you say. I think that's a relatively good sign and highlights. So the system works better when you've got ample supply of short video collateral the front-end of the yield curve. So that whole RFP TGI reserve dynamics is going to continue to be significant, but it is good to see RFPs coming down.\nSteve Chubak: Helpful color. And just follow-up on card income revenues were muted in the quarter. I was hoping you could unpack just the sources of pressure, maybe more specifically, how much of a drag is associated with batch 91 versus some other factors.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, so actually that card income number Steve has a little bit of a one-off thing. So we had a rewards liability adjustment this quarter kind of a technical thing. So that's just a temporary headwind and also the sequential comparison is also getting hurt by a small positive one-off item in the prior periods. So and obviously, I know you guys look better the card income is sort of thing that we look at that much ourselves.\nSteve Chubak: Can you size the reward liability impact?\nJeremy Barnum: Why don't you get Michael to get that to you. It's not that significant, but it's enough to just make the sequential number look a little bit lumpy. .\nSteve Chubak: Great, thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. You may proceed.\nGlenn Schorr: Thank you. Just want to follow up on this pricing power conversation. Because you've been consistent over time that you have a limited ability to sustain pricing power due to the competitive landscape. But I guess my question is, if not now when, meaning a lot has changed on the institutional side, the European bank side, the regional bank side -- and I would think that there'd be certain businesses that you have a greater ability and willingness to push price on? And then maybe you could tie that to your comments in the press release on what are the material -- what are the real-world consequences for markets and end users that you're referring to when talking about material regulatory changes? Thanks a lot.\nJeremy Barnum: Sure. So look, on pricing power, you're right. It really depends on the product, and it depends on the competitive landscape across different banks. And so it's very granular. It's very product specific. And in some cases -- we'll have more pricing power than in other cases. I think the overall point that we're trying to make in connection with Basel end game is just that like we think the capital increases are excessive. Does it put pressure on returns, all else equal that obviously puts pressure on us to increase price where we can. That is generally a bad thing for the real economy. -- and how all of that plays out in detail across different products and services remains to be seen. Importantly, since we don't actually have the proposal yet. So we need those details. I'm sorry, Glenn, I forgot the second half of your question. What was it?\nGlenn Schorr: Actually, I think you hit on it. So I'll just do a follow-up on a related -- so the notion of private credit doing large traditional investment-grade lending activity, it may be part of the competitive landscape that limits the ability to push price in Jamie's letter, you talked about the downside or my question is, what's the downside if more of the mortgage credit asset-backed intermediation business is pushed out of the banking system?\nJeremy Barnum: I mean, I guess it depends on what you mean by downside, but I just think societally speaking, I think we've seen in recent history that when home lending is happening outside the regulated perimeter and things get bad, when you have economic downturns, it purchases bad outcomes for individuals and homeowners on as a whole. So I mean, Jamie has written about this extensively. Beyond that, financially, we've talked about how mortgage lending -- I mean, the profitability swings obviously is reasonably cyclical. And in the recent past, it's actually very profitable, then it was less so like the correspondent channel right now is actually picking up a little bit. But it's a thin margin business. It's challenging. And when you increase the Cap requirements, it makes it even harder. So that just becomes one of the areas where you're in that tension between remixing versus pricing power that we talked about a second ago. And it might impact me in that we do less credit available for homeowners and more regulatory risk as the activity moves outside the perimeter.\nGlenn Schorr: Appreciate. Thanks, Jeremy.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning. Yes, I just wanted to unpack a little bit more the drivers of the change you outlined that's coming in the 10-Q, Jeremy, regarding the asset sensitivity going from liability sensitive to asset sensitive, at least that's the way I read it. I just wanted to understand what the drivers of that is?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, sure. Betsy. I mean, as you know, -- that's always been a challenging number. It's manages a risk management measure of store, so that's also somewhat limited in that respect. And it has been an uneven usefulness in terms of potential to be able to predict our NII trajectory when rates change. But as we looked at that and tried to improve it and spoken to all of you through this latest rate hiking cycle, we've come to the conclusion that it would improve the usefulness of the disclosure, if we included in the modeling the effect of deposit repricing lags -- and so we've done that, and that just has the effect that I talked about, it increases the EAR number by about $4 billion from minus $1.5 billion, which is roughly what it was last quarter and what it would have been this quarter without the change to something more like $2.5 billion. But all the usual caveat supply, right? I mean it's never - the answer is going to hold for any given change in rates, the change in our NII is always going to be for one reason or another different from what that disclosure shows. But we do our best to...\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. And so is it fair for me to think about that change as a mark-to-market to where we are today. And when I think about your forward guide here, longer term, you're saying, look, deposit betas are accelerating. So as I go through the 10-Qs over the next four or five quarters, I should expect that, that 2.5% should come down because deposit betas you're anticipating are going to be accelerating from here? I'm just trying to put those two things together.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, it's a good question. It's quite a technical issue. So I think in the past, the way this number was constructed was to assume through the cycle betas and all the deposits. And so your notion that like the number would include deposit beta acceleration would not have been the case because it would have been using essentially terminal deposit betas for the based on the forward curve and then based on a 100% shock to the forward curve. The nuance that we've introduced now is to recognize that given the shock, the reprice at the beta predicts will not be instantaneous. And so you get sort of just the mathematical consequences of that. But I think translating that into a statement about our expectation for beta for the next 12 months relative to our NII guide might be a bridge too far. I'm not sure you can actually draw that thing.\nBetsy Graseck: Right. But you were saying earlier, deposit betas you do anticipate are going to be accelerating from here, and that's part of the outlook for NII longer term to normalize in the mid-70s. Is that right?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. Go ahead, James. Yes.\nJamie Dimon: I mean basically, yes, as you have - if the next round is going to be the beta built from 30 to 40 to 50, whatever the product is, yes, that's the latter. And the 2.5 will go down over time as that actually happens if rates actually go up. The rates don't actually go up to 2.5 billion is exactly 2.5 again.\nJeremy Barnum: And what I was going to say, as is just that the projection of the 87 coming down to a significantly lower number contains both the element of internal migration, as well as the potential, which is by no means guaranteed, at product level reprice. And furthermore, then obviously, the dynamics are a little bit different in the different business segments as we move from large corporate wholesale to consumer.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. All right. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.\nMatt O'Connor: All right. Good morning. So I mean your came eventually consumers will want more deposit rate sensitivity here. I guess what would make you change your rates meaningfully? So the top two banks have about 50% consumer market share, loan-to-deposit ratios are low. Your outlook for loan growth, and I think others is fairly sluggish at least outside of card. So I get that it's common sense, and that's what we've seen historically, but there really is this kind of big divergence among big banks and everybody else where the big banks just don't need to pay that much for deposits for the reason. So what would make you change that?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. In the end Matt, it's just feedback from the field. It's competition and feedback from the field.\nJamie Dimon: I think every bank is in a different position about what they need. And so, you have a whole range of outcomes. But remember, we do this also by city. So you have different competition. Arizona and Phoenix then we have Chicago, Illinois, and we do have high interest rate products. So it's a combination of all those things. I wouldn't call it a big bank or a small bank, and you're going to see whenever we report who kind of payable the more things and who did and things like that. So look, I would take you to give - I think it's going to say there is very little pricing power in most of our business and betas are going to go up. You take it as a given - there is no circumstance that we've ever seen in the history of banking where rates didn't get to a certain point that you had to have competing products and they go through migration or a direct rate or move into CDs or money market funds. And we're going to have to compete for that. You already see it in parts of our business and not in other parts.\nJeremy Barnum: Matters just that it's really just our primary bank relationships. And that's the core of the strategy.\nMatt O'Connor: Yes. I mean, again, I 100% agree, but we've never seen kind of loan-to-deposit ratios for banks like yours this low. So you could just let deposits run off at a modest amount for quite some time to make the decision not to pay up. I mean I assume that's a trade-off that eventually you'll.\nJamie Dimon: That's a little more complicated because that - a lot of that loan to value ratio is lower because of regulatory stuff, LCR, capital ratio, et cetera.\nMatt O'Connor: Got it. All right. Thank you.\nJeremy Barnum: Thanks.\nOperator: And for our final question, we'll go to Charles Peabody from Fortalis Partners. You may proceed.\nCharles Peabody: Good morning. Jeremy, on Page 4 of your presentation, you showed some liquidity metrics. And there's been a meaningful deterioration or I shouldn't say deteriorating depletion of some of that excess liquidity obviously for First Republic primarily. So my question is how quickly do you want to rebuild that liquidity because as I look out towards '24, there's probably a half dozen variables that are going to make liquidity a premium event to have excess liquidity, so that's my first question is what's your plans for replenishing that liquidity?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, Charles. So I know we talked about this a little bit at Investor Day, right? So as I said in my prepared remarks, yes, when you think about half of the change in the bank LCR number is consequence to First Republic. And the rest of it is just the expected decrease in to someone deposits flowing through into our HQLA balances and the bank LCR ratio. So that's all entirely as expected. And therefore, I think that the replenishing notion is not correct. In fact, obviously, we still have ample of liquidity. Now if you want to project trends forward, that's a different story, but that's sort of the business of banking, we'll adjust accordingly in terms of our asset and liability mix across different products and to ensure compliance ratios and quarter's balance sheet principles as you would expect from us.\nJamie Dimon: And I would just add that just look at the at the top of the page in the press release, $1.4 trillion of cash and marketable securities even we get down to no excess, we're going to have like I've got the exact number, $1.2 trillion. I think we have excess liquidity. And the liquidity ratio is slightly some difference. I think the studies according to system and of course, we do multiple things to change this overnight in one or two.\nCharles Peabody: So sort of wrapped into that as a follow-up. If you take your $87 billion forecast for NII this year and that implies at least one quarter of maybe $22 billion of NII, and you take your eventual forecast of mid-$70 billion of NII at some point in the future, that would imply at least one quarter of $18 billion of NII. So that's about an 18% drop. And if you hold the balance sheet steady, you're talking about a 30 basis point drop in your margin - your NIM to get to that from $22 billion to $18 billion. I mean what is driving - is it really the deposit? Or are you thinking in terms of interest reversals as credit deteriorates? Or is it rebuilding of liquidity? I'm just trying to get a better sense of what the impact?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, Charlie, I would think about that as being really entirely a deposit story. It's not that complicated, right? I think we did this. I think it was either in the fourth quarter or in the first quarter, but we put a little chart on the page just in very simple terms, it shows like what the dollar consequences are whatever, like a 10 basis point change in deposit rate paid in terms of NII run rate. So whether it's as a consequence of migration from lower-yielding to higher-yielding going from 0% to 4% CD is obviously a big impact on margin or whether it's because savings reprices relatively small changes in rates there are kind of a lot of money when you've got a couple of trillion dollars of deposits. So it's really not any more complicated than that. And that's why we're being so forceful about reminding people about what we expect that trajectory to be\nCharles Peabody: Thank you.\nOperator: And we have no further questions at this time.\nJamie Dimon: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you all for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time. And have a great rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeremy Barnum",
            "content": "Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer on the back. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $14.5 billion, EPS of $4.75 on revenue of $42.4 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 25%. These results included the First Republic bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion and credit reserve build for the First Republic lending portfolio $1.2 billion as well as $900 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate. Touching on a few highlights, CCB Client investment assets were up 18% year-on-year, we had record long-term inflows in AWM and we ranked Number One in IB Fee wallet share. Before giving you more detail on financials, let me give you a brief updates on the status of the First Republic integration on Page 2. The settlement process with the FDIC is on schedule, the number of key milestone being recently completed. Systems integration is also proceeding at pace and we are targeting being substantially complete by mid-2024. First Republic employees have formally joined us as of July 2, and we're pleased to have had very-high acceptance rates on our offers. And although it's still early days, as we get the sales force back in the market, we are happy to see the client retention is strong with about a $6 billion of net deposit inflows since the acquisition. Now, turning back to this quarter's results on Page 3. You'll see that in various parts of the presentation, we have specifically called out the impact of First Republic where relevant. To make things easier. I'm going to start by discussing the overall impact of First Republic on this quarter's results at the firm-wide level. Then, for the rest of the presentation, I will generally exclude the impact of First Republic, in order to improve comparability with prior periods. With that in mind, in this quarter, First Republic contributed $4 billion of revenue, $599 million of expense and $2.4 billion of net income. As noted on the first page, this includes $2.7 billion of bargain purchase gain, which is reflected in NIR in the Corporate segment as well as $1.2 billion of allowance build. And remember that the deal happened on May 1, so the First Republic numbers only represent two months of results. You'll see in the line-of-business results that we are showing First Republic revenue as allowance in CCB, CB and AWM. And for the purposes of this quarter's results, all of the deposits are in CCB and substantially all of the expenses are in Corporate. As the integration continues, some of those items will get allocated across the segments. Now turning back to firm-wide results excluding First Republic. Revenue of $38.4 billion was up $6.7 billion or 21% year-on-year. NII, ex-markets, was up $7.8 billion or 57%, driven by higher rates. NIR ex-markets was down $293 million, largely driven by the net investment securities losses I mentioned earlier, partially offset by a number of less notable items, primarily in the prior year. And Markets revenue was down $772 million or 10% year-on year. Expenses of $20.2 billion were up $1.5 billion or 8% year-on year, primarily driven by higher compensation expense including wage inflation and higher legal expense. And credit costs of $1.7 billion included net charge-offs of $1.4 billion, predominantly in card. The net reserve build included a $389 million build in the commercial bank and $200 million build in card and a $243 million release in corporate, all of which I will cover in more detail later. On to balance sheet and capital on Page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio at 13.8%, flat versus the prior quarter as the benefit of net income less distributions was offset by the impact of First Republic. And as you can see in the two charts on the page, we've given you some information about the impact of the transaction on both RWA and the CET1 ratio. And as you know, we completed CCAR a couple of weeks ago. Our new indicative SCB is 2.9% versus our current requirements of 4% and it goes into effect in 4Q '23. The new SCB also reflects the Board's intention to increase the dividend to $1.05 per share in the third quarter. On liquidity, our bank LCR for the second quarter ended at 129%, in line with what we anticipated at Investor Day. About half of the reduction is associated with the First Republic transaction. And while we're on the balance sheet, as we previewed in the 10-K, we will be updating our earnings at-risk model to incorporate the impact of deposit repricing lags. So when we released this quarter's 10-Q, you will see the up 100 basis point parallel shift scenario will be about positive $2.5 billion, whereas in the absence of the change, it would have been about negative $1.5 billion. Now, let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on Page 5. Both U.S. Consumers and Small Businesses remained resilient and we haven't observed any meaningful changes to the trends in our data we discussed at Investor Day. Turning now to the financial results, which I will speak to excluding the impact of First Republic for CCB, CB and AWM. CCB reported net income of $5 billion on revenue of $16.4 billion, which was up 31% year-on year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 59% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. End-of-period deposits were down 4% quarter-on-quarter, as customers continue to spend down their cash buffers, including for seasonal tax payments and seek higher-yielding products. Client investment assets were up 18% year-on year, driven by market performance and strong net inflows across our adviser and digital channels. In Home Lending, revenue was down 23% year-on-year, driven by lower NII and higher loan spreads and lower servicing and production revenue. Originations were up quarter-on-quarter, driven by seasonality, although still down 54% year-on-year. Moving to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 5%, largely driven by higher card services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 18% year-on-year, which was the result of revolve normalization and strong new account growth. And in Auto, originations were up $12 billion, up 71% year-on-year as competitors pulled back and inventories continue to slowly recover. Expenses of $8.3 billion were up 8% year-on-year, driven by compensation, predominantly due to wage inflation and headcount growth as we continue to invest in our front office and technology staffing as well as marketing. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.5 billion, reflecting the reserve build of $203 million, driven by loan growth in Card Services. Net charge-offs were $1.3 billion, up $640 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card as 30 day past delinquencies have returned to pre-pandemic levels, in line with our expectations. Next, the CIB on Page 6. CIB reported net income of $4.1 billion on revenue of $12.5 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.5 billion was up 11% year-on-year or down 7% excluding bridge book markdowns in the prior year. IB fees were down 6% year-on-year and we ranked Number One with year-to-date wallet share of 8.4%. In advisory, fees were down 19%. Underwriting fees were down 6% for debt and up 30% for equity with more positive momentum in the last month of the quarter. In terms of the second-half outlook, we have seen encouraging signs of activity in capital markets, and July should be a good indicator for the remainder of the year. However, year-to-date announced M&A is down significantly, which will be a headwind. Moving to Markets, total revenue was $7 billion, down 10% year-on-year. Fixed-income was down 3%. As expected, the macro franchise substantially normalized from last year's elevated levels of volatility and client flows. This was largely offset by improved performance in the Securitized Products Group and Credit. Equity markets was down 20% against a very strong prior year quarter, particularly in derivatives. Payments revenue was $2.5 billion, up 61% year-on-year. Excluding equity investments, it was up 32%, predominantly driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Security services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 6% year-on-year, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower fees. Expenses of $6.9 billion were up 1% year-on-year, driven by higher non-compensation expense as well as wage inflation and headcount growth, largely offset by lower revenue-related compensation. Moving to the Commercial Bank on Page 7. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.5 billion. Revenue of $3.8 billion was up 42% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins. Payments revenue of $2.2 billion was up 79% year-on-year, driven by higher rates. Gross Investment Banking and Markets revenue of $767 million was down 3% year-on-year, primarily driven by fewer large M&A deals. Expenses of $1.3 billion were up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation expense, including fun office hiring and technology investments, as well as higher volume-related expense. Average deposits were up 3% quarter-on-quarter driven by inflows related to new client acquisition, partially offset by continued attrition in non-operating deposits. Loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were up 2%, reflecting stabilization in new loan demand and revolver utilization in the current economic environment as well as pockets of growth in areas where we are investing. CRE loans were also up 1%, reflecting funding on prior year originations for construction loans and real-estate banking as well as increased affordable housing activity. Finally, credit costs were $489 million. Net charge-offs were $100 million, including $82 million in the office real-estate portfolio and the net reserve build of $389 million was driven by updates to certain assumptions related to the office real-estate market as well as net downgrade activity in Middle Market banking. Then, to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 8. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.1 billion with pretax margin of 32%. Revenue of $4.6 billion was up 8% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins on lower balances and higher management fees on strong net inflows. Expenses of $3.2 billion were up 8% year-on-year, driven by higher compensation, including growth in our private banking advisor teams, higher revenue-related compensation and the impact of Global Shares and JPMorgan Asset Management China, both of which closed within the last year. For the quarter, record net long-term inflows were $61 billion, positive across all channels, regions and asset classes, led by fixed-income and equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $60 billion. AUM of $3.2 trillion was up 16% year-on-year and overall client assets of $4.6 trillion were up 20% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows, higher market levels and the impact of the acquisition of Global Shares. And finally, loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower securities-based lending and deposits were down 6%. Turning to Corporate on Page 9. As I noted upfront, we are reporting the First Republic bargain purchase gain and substantially all of the expenses in Corporate. Excluding those items, Corporate reported net income of $339 million; revenue was $985 million, up $905 million compared to last year; NII was $1.8 billion, up $1.4 billion year-on-year due to the impact of higher rates; NIR was a net loss of $782 million and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned upfront. Expenses of $590 million were up $384 million year-on year, largely driven by higher legal expense. And credit costs were a net benefit of $243 million, reflecting reserve release of the deposit placed with First Republic in the first quarter was eliminated as part of the transaction. Next, the outlook on Page 10. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex-markets to be approximately $87 billion, the increase driven by higher rates coupled with slower deposit repricing than previously assumed across both consumer and wholesale. And I should take the opportunity to remind you once again that significant sources of uncertainty remained and we do expect the NII run rate to be substantially below this quarter's run-rate at some point in the future, as competition for deposits plays out. Our expense outlook for 2023 remains approximately $84.5 billion. And on credit, we continue to expect the 2023 card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.6%. So, to wrap up, we are proud of the exceptionally strong operating results this quarter. As we look forward, we remain focused on the significant uncertainties relating to the economic outlook, competition for deposits and the impact on capital from the pending finalization of the Basel III rules. Nonetheless, despite the likely headwinds ahead, we remain optimistic about the Company's ability to continue delivering excellent performance through a range of scenarios. With that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. Yes, sure. Thanks, Jim. So -- yes, so when we talk about the drivers of the upward revision, as I said, it's higher rates coupled with lower deposit reprice, hard to untangle the two. And specifically, I think when you look at Consumer, the combination of the passage of time and the positive feedback we're getting from the field and the CD offerings in particular has meant that it's quite a stable environment from that perspective. And similarly in wholesale, we're just seeing slower internal migrations. You asked about mix. I think that obviously, we're seeing the CD mix increase and we would continue to expect -- we would continue to -- we would expect that to continue to take place, probably even past the peak of the rate cycle into next year as we continue to capture money in motion. But as you say, the most important point is the fact that, as I said earlier, we don't consider this level of NII generation to be sustainable and we talked previously about the medium-term run-rate in the mid-70s that was before First Republic and you know you could argue that maybe that number should be a little higher, but whatever it is, it's a lot lower than the current number. We don't know when that's going to happen. We're not going to predict the exact moment. That's going to be a function of competitive dynamics in the marketplace, but we want to be clear that we do expect it at some point. I wouldn't necessarily assume that the evolution from the current run-rate into that mid-70s number is that sensitive to the rate outlook in particular. When we put that number out there, we looked at a range of different types of rate environments and the reprice that we think would be associated with that. It was really meant to capture more of what we consider to be a through-the-cycle sustainable number. So, I wouldn't think of it as being particularly rate dependent. Yes. Thanks, Erika. I mean it's a good question. There is a lot in there obviously. I guess I would start by saying that when we talk about 17% through-the-cycle ROTCE, even though we may have introduced that in a moment where we brought the lowest eurobond, it was always premised on a sort of normalized rate environment. And at some level, that remains true today. Furthermore -- you didn't ask this explicitly, but in the context of the proposed Basel III end-game, one relevant question might be, if you have a lot more capital in the denominator, what happens to that target. So, I think -- as I said in my prepared remarks, we feel very confident about the Company's ability to produce excellent returns through the cycle. There's a lot of moving parts right now in that. Some of them could be good, some of them could be bad. Narrowly on the capital one, the one thing to point out is that the straight-up math, simply diluting down the ROTCE by expand the denominator misses the possibility of reprice, you know repricing on products and services, which of course goes back to our point that these capital increases do have impacts on the real economy. So, I'm not suggesting that we can price our way out of it, but we obviously need to get the right returns on products and services, and where we have pricing power, we will adjust to the higher capital. So lot of moving parts in there, but I think the important point is that through a range of scenarios, we feel good about our ability to deliver the results and we'll see how the mix of all the various factors plays out, especially after we see the Basel III proposal and it goes through the common period. Yes, it's still 5.8%. Yes, thanks, John. So, obviously, we're thinking about that a lot. On the other hand, as much as there have been a lot of very detailed rumors out there that might lead you to start to try to do some planning, it does seem like this time it's real and we are actually going to get a proposal, ultimately sometime this month or something. So sooner or not, we'll get to see something actually on paper and we can stop kind of the guesswork. Having said that, indulging in a little bit of guesswork, it does seem like the biggest single driver of the increase that people are talking about including Chair, Powell's 20% number or Vice Chair Barr's 2% of RWA which runs up being roughly the same, is just the way operational risk is getting introduced into the standardized pillar. And that is a little bit of a straight-up across-the-board tax on everything. It's kind of hard to optimize your way out of that, with the exception, obviously, of the fact that you can simply increase price, assuming you have pricing power, but that's obviously not what we want and that's what we sort of mean by impacts on the real economy. So there are details, there is a lot of the FRTB stuff, we can get way into the weeds there within the markets business and we do have a good track-record of adjusting and optimizing. But this time around, it may be a more fundamental set of questions around business mix as opposed to the ability to sort of optimizing in a very technical way. Yes. I mean, I guess I'm sort of tempted to give you our standard capital hierarchy here. I mean, we're not going to stack back investments, right, that won't come as a surprise to you. Generally speaking, we're always going to try to comply with new requirements early. So, when we know the requirements, I mean when we have visibility, obviously given how much organic capital we're generating right now, whatever the answer winds up being, it will be pretty easy to comply, narrowly speaking. But that's not the same as saying that there won't be consequences to returns or to pricing. And if for whatever reason, things aren't exactly as we're anticipating, I don't see us sacrificing investments that we see are strategically critical in order to comply with higher capital requirements ahead of the formal timing or whatever. Unlikely, obviously, that would be an unlikely outcome. Sorry, John, go ahead. Did you have a follow-up? I mean, capital hierarchy again, right. In the end, when we have nothing else to do with the money, we'll do buybacks and we've talked about the $12 billion for this year. Obviously, lot of new moving parts there, although all else equal, given what we've done so far, that's still probably a reasonable number for the full year. But, yes, that's always going to be at the end of the list, but, yes. Sure. A good question, Ken. So I think in terms of investment banking end markets, yes, better-than-expected last month. Well we talked about green shoots, especially in capital markets generally still definitely some headwinds in M&A, lower amounts activity, some regulatory headwinds there. So we'll see -- I think it's a little too early to call a trend there based on recent results, but we'll see. In terms of the broader economy and loan growth expectations. Generally, we do still expect reasonably robust card loan growth. But away from that, for a variety of different reasons at different products, whether it'd be mortgage or C&I, after revolver normalization, and especially if we see a little bit of a cooling off of the economy, I would expect loan demand to be relatively modest there. So we're not really expecting meaningful growth away from card. But of course, we're there for the right deals, right products, right terms, we went through-the-cycle. So, I see that as more of a demand-driven narrative, which will be a function of the economy rather than any tightening on our side. Yes. I mean to us, I think we still see this as a normalization not deterioration story when we talk about consumer products. Actually revolve per account has still not gotten to pre pandemic levels actually. So, I would definitely say there's a wanting rather than needing at least for our portfolio at this point. And yes, I think that consumer continues to surprise on the upside here. Yes. Gerard, I would say, honestly, not much change there actually, no. We've been pretty consistently concerned about the risk of higher rates. Of course, we always try to position things to produce reasonable outcomes across a broad range of scenarios. But at the margin, we've been biased towards higher rates and that maybe a little less true at these levels than it was before, although lot of that is just the consequence of deposit comp actually playing out in modeling. But in any case, all else equal, I think we are going to continue to focus on making sure we're fine in a higher-rate scenario, while staying balanced across a range of scenarios. So not really a lot of change in our positioning and that's obviously, including the fact that we took on First Republic, which even net of some of the liabilities, had a long structural interest rate position. We did not actually want to get longer as part of the deal, and so as a result, we took actions to ensure that now we are still about the same as we were last quarter. Yes, so. I would caution you from drawing too broad a conclusion from this. I mean. I think that when we talk about office versus, for example. Our portfolio, as you know is quite small, and our exposure to sort of so-called urban dense office is even smaller. The vast majority of our overall portfolio is multiply lending. So as resolved like our sample size observed valuations on office properties is quite small, but you know, we'd like to be sort of ahead of the cycle. And based on everything that we saw this quarter. So it's reasonable to build a little bit there to get to what felt like a comfortable coverage ratio. Across the rest of the Middle Market segment, we saw downgrades and excess of upgrades. But, I don't see that as sort of necessarily indicative of anything terribly significant in the broader read-across. Yes. So I am sure, Jamie has some views here. But in my in my view, I would just caution against jumping to too many super positive conclusions based on a couple of recent trends. And I think generally our point is less about trying to predict a particular outcome and more about trying to make sure that we don't get too much euphoria that over concentrates people on one particular predictions when we know that there is a range of outcomes out there. So obviously, we were talking a lot about the potential for a soft lending right now. No lending, neither, it's inflation or whatever and -- whether our own views on that have changed meaningfully. I don't know, but the broader point is we continue to be quite focused on, Jamie's prior comments that loss rates still have time to -- room to normalize even both pandemics we're probably over-earning on credit a little bit Obviously, we've talked about the expectation that the NII is going to come down quite a bit, so even, forgetting about whether you've got some surprisingly negative outcomes on the economy is always today even in the central case, you just need to recognize that there should be some significant normalization. Yes, so on your first point. I mean, I think you can just read Vice-Chair of our speech right. He addressed that point early directly. He clearly doesn't agree as this is right. So we'll see what happens. We continue to feel that all else equal, higher capital requirements, definitely are going to increase the cost of credit, which is bad for the economy. So we'll see what happens on that. On an FRTB, it's really very nuanced, it's probably like to much detail for this call to be honest, but just to give you like one immaterial and insignificant but useful example, one-product under FRTB has yield curve spread options and if the FRTB proposal goes through, as currently written, that product becomes not viable. So obviously, if we need to stop doing that product, no one really cares, but it's just one example of the way, sometimes when you're really disciplined about allocating capital thoroughly, all the way down to new products and responding accordingly. You can wind-up having to change our business mix there. Obviously, more significant products that matter much more of a real economy like mortgage where, the layering on of the operational risk in the way it's being proposed, especially if some of the other beneficial elements of the proposal don't come through, you're once again, making the product even harder to offer the homeowners, so we'll see, we'll see what happens. Exactly. I was going to say Mike, yes to everything. So, rename, re-pricing, yes, definitely. To the extent that we have pricing power and higher capital requirements, mean that we're not generating the right returns for shareholders, we will try to reprice and we'll see how that sticks and how that flows into economy and how that affects demand for products. And if the repricing is not las, successful then in some cases, we will have to remix that means getting out of certain products and services. And as Jim points out, that probably means that those products and services we have the regulated perimeter and go into elsewhere and that's fine, as Jamey pointed out, those people are clients and I think that point was addressed also in Vice-Chair Bar speech. So, but in our traditionally, having risky activities we have a regulated perimeter has had some negative consequences. So these are all important things to consider. I appreciate the balance. Now in all seriousness, we've always been pretty clear right that our spending is through-the-cycles funding, based on through this cycle investment, through-the-cycle spending based on our through-the-cycle view of the earnings generating power of the company and the goal to produce the right returns. So broadly speaking, NII tends to flow straight-through to the bottom-line, both fund is growing up, and by the way, when it's going down too and we've been through those moments, as you will remember. So, whether or not there are opportunities to deploy some more dollars into marketing and stuff like that, we have actually looked at that recently. I don't see that being a meaningful item this year, which is part of why we have not revised the expense guidance so far. But this is about investing through-the-cycle and being honest and disciplined about which revenue items flow, carried expense loading and which item don't. Yes. I mean, you or yourself right? You definitely can't extrapolate the current numbers, but. I think more broadly on benefiting our benchmarking ourselves too low-cost providers that sort of speaks to an area that you've been interested in for a long-time, which is all of the investment that we're doing in technology to improve generally scalability and get more of our cost base to be variable versus fixed. In terms of how we respond to volumes that's a big part of the reason that we're doing the investments that we're doing and modernization and cloud and AI and all that type of stuff that we're talking about, so. I think we feel really good about our efficiency as a company, but there definitely is room for improvement. You know more of it and some people feared has kind of RFPs. So, as you say. I think that's a relatively good sign and highlights. So the system works better when you've got ample supply of short video collateral the front-end of the yield curve. So that whole RFP TGI reserve dynamics is going to continue to be significant, but it is good to see RFPs coming down. Yes, so actually that card income number Steve has a little bit of a one-off thing. So we had a rewards liability adjustment this quarter kind of a technical thing. So that's just a temporary headwind and also the sequential comparison is also getting hurt by a small positive one-off item in the prior periods. So and obviously, I know you guys look better the card income is sort of thing that we look at that much ourselves. Why don't you get Michael to get that to you. It's not that significant, but it's enough to just make the sequential number look a little bit lumpy. . Sure. So look, on pricing power, you're right. It really depends on the product, and it depends on the competitive landscape across different banks. And so it's very granular. It's very product specific. And in some cases -- we'll have more pricing power than in other cases. I think the overall point that we're trying to make in connection with Basel end game is just that like we think the capital increases are excessive. Does it put pressure on returns, all else equal that obviously puts pressure on us to increase price where we can. That is generally a bad thing for the real economy. -- and how all of that plays out in detail across different products and services remains to be seen. Importantly, since we don't actually have the proposal yet. So we need those details. I'm sorry, Glenn, I forgot the second half of your question. What was it? I mean, I guess it depends on what you mean by downside, but I just think societally speaking, I think we've seen in recent history that when home lending is happening outside the regulated perimeter and things get bad, when you have economic downturns, it purchases bad outcomes for individuals and homeowners on as a whole. So I mean, Jamie has written about this extensively. Beyond that, financially, we've talked about how mortgage lending -- I mean, the profitability swings obviously is reasonably cyclical. And in the recent past, it's actually very profitable, then it was less so like the correspondent channel right now is actually picking up a little bit. But it's a thin margin business. It's challenging. And when you increase the Cap requirements, it makes it even harder. So that just becomes one of the areas where you're in that tension between remixing versus pricing power that we talked about a second ago. And it might impact me in that we do less credit available for homeowners and more regulatory risk as the activity moves outside the perimeter. Yes, sure. Betsy. I mean, as you know, -- that's always been a challenging number. It's manages a risk management measure of store, so that's also somewhat limited in that respect. And it has been an uneven usefulness in terms of potential to be able to predict our NII trajectory when rates change. But as we looked at that and tried to improve it and spoken to all of you through this latest rate hiking cycle, we've come to the conclusion that it would improve the usefulness of the disclosure, if we included in the modeling the effect of deposit repricing lags -- and so we've done that, and that just has the effect that I talked about, it increases the EAR number by about $4 billion from minus $1.5 billion, which is roughly what it was last quarter and what it would have been this quarter without the change to something more like $2.5 billion. But all the usual caveat supply, right? I mean it's never - the answer is going to hold for any given change in rates, the change in our NII is always going to be for one reason or another different from what that disclosure shows. But we do our best to... Yes, it's a good question. It's quite a technical issue. So I think in the past, the way this number was constructed was to assume through the cycle betas and all the deposits. And so your notion that like the number would include deposit beta acceleration would not have been the case because it would have been using essentially terminal deposit betas for the based on the forward curve and then based on a 100% shock to the forward curve. The nuance that we've introduced now is to recognize that given the shock, the reprice at the beta predicts will not be instantaneous. And so you get sort of just the mathematical consequences of that. But I think translating that into a statement about our expectation for beta for the next 12 months relative to our NII guide might be a bridge too far. I'm not sure you can actually draw that thing. Yes. Go ahead, James. Yes. And what I was going to say, as is just that the projection of the 87 coming down to a significantly lower number contains both the element of internal migration, as well as the potential, which is by no means guaranteed, at product level reprice. And furthermore, then obviously, the dynamics are a little bit different in the different business segments as we move from large corporate wholesale to consumer. Yes. In the end Matt, it's just feedback from the field. It's competition and feedback from the field. Matters just that it's really just our primary bank relationships. And that's the core of the strategy. Thanks. Yes, Charles. So I know we talked about this a little bit at Investor Day, right? So as I said in my prepared remarks, yes, when you think about half of the change in the bank LCR number is consequence to First Republic. And the rest of it is just the expected decrease in to someone deposits flowing through into our HQLA balances and the bank LCR ratio. So that's all entirely as expected. And therefore, I think that the replenishing notion is not correct. In fact, obviously, we still have ample of liquidity. Now if you want to project trends forward, that's a different story, but that's sort of the business of banking, we'll adjust accordingly in terms of our asset and liability mix across different products and to ensure compliance ratios and quarter's balance sheet principles as you would expect from us. Yes, Charlie, I would think about that as being really entirely a deposit story. It's not that complicated, right? I think we did this. I think it was either in the fourth quarter or in the first quarter, but we put a little chart on the page just in very simple terms, it shows like what the dollar consequences are whatever, like a 10 basis point change in deposit rate paid in terms of NII run rate. So whether it's as a consequence of migration from lower-yielding to higher-yielding going from 0% to 4% CD is obviously a big impact on margin or whether it's because savings reprices relatively small changes in rates there are kind of a lot of money when you've got a couple of trillion dollars of deposits. So it's really not any more complicated than that. And that's why we're being so forceful about reminding people about what we expect that trajectory to be"

            "name": "Jamie Dimon",
            "content": "Erika, I'll say one thing. Of course we have a mix of businesses that earn from like 0% ROTCE to a 100%. We have some which are very capital-intensive, so we look at kind of all of them and I think 17% is a good number and a good target. The other thing we're earning on is credit. We've been over in credit for a substantial amount of time now, we're quite cautious about it. We know that it's going to kick-off just as a normalized it will be, considering more than that is now. Look, we would consider credit card normalized to be closer to 3.5%. Yes. I would just add, the 5.8% is not our prediction, that is the average of the unemployment under multiple scenarios that we have to use which hypothetical for CECL. Asset predictions on something different and we don't know the outcome. We trying to be really clear here, the consumer in good shape, their spending down their excess cash. That's all. Tailwinds. If we go into recession, we're going with rather good condition, low borrowings and good, our price-value still but the headwinds are substantial and somewhat unprecedented. There is more Ukraine Oil Gas, market, timing, unprecedented fiscal, needs of governments, few team which we've never experienced before, I just think people should take a deep breath of that and we don't know those things because the soft landing in mild recession for our recession. And obviously, sure we will be the best. And I would just add to that even though the product doesn't make money, you might do it for clients who are great clients. The advantage by-product, by client by effectively business mix and further adjustments. Whilst these loans don't make sense for your balance sheet as a whole, almost anyone. We just need to keep up to recognize that and we just managed through all the various complications here and you're going to the other do. Yes. Before Jeremy answer that question, this is great news for hedge funds, private-equity, private credit, Apollo, Blackstone and the gas industries. Mike, let me get this right, you're actually complaining that our expenses aren't high enough, is that right? I think we're kind of running as fast as we can. So you actually set down the risk credit compliance, audit market bankers recruiter trainers -- this is it. We're a full effort right now. And we want to make sure we get things right and get things thoughtful and careful. So it's not just the money, it's the people and how many things can change all the once and add to all at once. I mean basically, yes, as you have - if the next round is going to be the beta built from 30 to 40 to 50, whatever the product is, yes, that's the latter. And the 2.5 will go down over time as that actually happens if rates actually go up. The rates don't actually go up to 2.5 billion is exactly 2.5 again. I think every bank is in a different position about what they need. And so, you have a whole range of outcomes. But remember, we do this also by city. So you have different competition. Arizona and Phoenix then we have Chicago, Illinois, and we do have high interest rate products. So it's a combination of all those things. I wouldn't call it a big bank or a small bank, and you're going to see whenever we report who kind of payable the more things and who did and things like that. So look, I would take you to give - I think it's going to say there is very little pricing power in most of our business and betas are going to go up. You take it as a given - there is no circumstance that we've ever seen in the history of banking where rates didn't get to a certain point that you had to have competing products and they go through migration or a direct rate or move into CDs or money market funds. And we're going to have to compete for that. You already see it in parts of our business and not in other parts. That's a little more complicated because that - a lot of that loan to value ratio is lower because of regulatory stuff, LCR, capital ratio, et cetera. And I would just add that just look at the at the top of the page in the press release, $1.4 trillion of cash and marketable securities even we get down to no excess, we're going to have like I've got the exact number, $1.2 trillion. I think we have excess liquidity. And the liquidity ratio is slightly some difference. I think the studies according to system and of course, we do multiple things to change this overnight in one or two. Thank you very much."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the [JPMorgan Chase\u2019s] First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.\nJeremy Barnum: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on page 1. The Firm reported net income of $12.6 billion, EPS of $4.10 on revenue of $39.3 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 23%. These results included $868 million of net investment securities losses in corporate. Before reviewing our results for the quarter, let\u2019s talk about the recent bank failures. Jamie has addressed a number of the important themes in his shareholder letter and the recent televised interview. So, I will go straight to the specific impacts on the Firm. As you would expect, we saw significant new account opening activity and meaningful deposit and money market fund inflows, most significantly in the Commercial Bank, Business Banking and AWM. Regarding the deposit inflows, at the Firm-wide level, average deposits were down 3% quarter-on-quarter, while end-of-period deposits were up 2% quarter-on-quarter, implying an intra-quarter reversal of the recent outflow trend as a consequence of the March events. We estimate that we have retained approximately $50 billion of these deposit inflows at quarter-end. It\u2019s important to note that while the sequential period-end deposit increase is higher than we would have otherwise expected, our current full year NII outlook, which I will address at the end, still assumes modest deposit outflows from here. We expect these outflows to be driven by the same factors as last quarter as well as the expectation that we will not retain all of this quarter\u2019s inflows. Now back to the quarter touching on a few highlights. We grew our IB fee wallet share. Consumer spending remained solid with combined debit and credit card spend up 10% year-on-year. And credit continues to normalize, but actual performance remains strong across the Company. On Page 2, we have some more detail. Revenue of $39.3 billion was up $7.7 billion or 25% year-on-year. NII ex markets was up $9.2 billion or 78%, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. NIR ex markets was down $1.1 billion or 10% driven by the securities losses previously mentioned as well as lower IB fees and lower auto lease income on lower volume. And markets revenue was down $371 million or 4% year-on-year. Expenses of $20.1 billion were up $916 million or 5% year-on-year, driven by compensation-related costs, reflecting the annualization of last year\u2019s headcount growth and wage inflation. These results include the impact of the higher FDIC assessment I mentioned last quarter, which, of course, is unrelated to recent events. And credit costs of $2.3 billion included net charge-offs of $1.1 billion, predominantly in card. The net reserve build of $1.1 billion was largely driven by deterioration in our weighted average economic outlook. Onto balance sheet and capital on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.8%, up about 60 basis points, which was primarily driven by the benefit of net income less distributions and AOCI gains. And in line with what we previously said, we resumed stock buybacks this quarter and distributed a total of $1.9 billion and net repurchases back to shareholders. Now, let\u2019s go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 4. Touching quickly on the health of U.S. consumers and small businesses based on our data. Both continue to show resilience and remain on the path to normalization as expected, but we continue to monitor their activity closely. Spend remains solid, and we have not observed any notable pullback throughout the quarter. Moving to financial results. CCB reported net income of $5.2 billion on revenue of $16.5 billion, which was up 35% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 67% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. Average deposits were down 2% quarter-on-quarter, in line with recent trends. Throughout the quarter, we continued to see customer flows to higher-yielding products, as you would expect, but were encouraged by what we are capturing in CDs and our Wealth Management offerings. Client investment assets were down 1% year-on-year, but up 7% quarter-on-quarter, driven by market performance as well as strong net inflows. In Home Lending, revenue was down 38% year-on-year, largely driven by lower net interest income from tighter loan spreads and lower production revenue. Moving to Card Services & Auto. Revenue was up 14% year-on-year, largely driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower auto lease income. Credit card spend was up 13% year-on-year. Card outstandings were up 21%, driven by strong new account growth and revolve normalization. And in Auto, originations were $9.2 billion, up 10% year-on-year. Expenses of $8.1 billion were up 5% year-on-year, reflecting the impact of wage inflation and higher headcount. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.4 billion, reflecting reserve builds of $300 million in card and $50 million in Home Lending. Net charge-offs were $1.1 billion, up about $500 million year-on-year, in line with expectations as delinquency levels continue to normalize across portfolios. Next, the CIB on Page 5. CIB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $13.6 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.6 billion was down 24% year-on-year. IB fees were down 19%. We ranked number 1 with first quarter wallet share of 8.7%. In advisory, fees were down 6% compared to a strong first quarter last year. Our underwriting businesses continued to be affected by market conditions with fees down 34% for debt and 6% for equity. In terms of the outlook, the dynamics remain the same. Our pipeline is relatively robust, but conversion is sensitive to market conditions and the economic outlook. We expect the second quarter and the rest of the year to remain challenging. Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $8.4 billion, down 4% year-on-year. Fixed income was flat. Rates was strong during the rally early in the quarter as well as through the elevated volatility in March. Credit was up on the back of higher client flows and currencies in emerging markets was down relative to a very strong first quarter in the prior year. Equity Markets was down 12%, driven by lower revenues in derivatives relative to a strong first quarter in the prior year and lower client activity and cash. Payments revenue was $2.4 billion, up 26% year-on-year. Excluding the net impact of equity investments, primarily a gain in the prior year, it was up 55%, with the growth driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Securities Services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 7% year-on-year, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances and market levels. Expenses of $7.5 billion were up 2% year-on-year as higher headcount and wage inflation were largely offset by lower revenue-related compensation. Moving to the Commercial Bank on page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.3 billion. Revenue of $3.5 billion was up 46% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins. Payments revenue of $2 billion was up 98% year-on-year driven by higher rates. And gross Investment Banking revenue of $881 million was up 21% year-on-year on increased M&A and bond underwriting from large deal activity. Expenses of $1.3 billion were up 16% year-on-year largely driven by higher compensation expense, including front office hiring and technology investments as well as higher volume-related expense. Average deposits were down 16% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on-quarter, predominantly driven by continued attrition and non-operating deposits as well as seasonally lower balances. Loans were up 13% year-on-year and 1% sequentially. C&I loans were up 1% quarter-on-quarter with somewhat different dynamics based on client size. In middle market banking, higher rates and recession concerns have decreased new loan demand and utilization, which is also leading to weakness in CapEx spending. In Corporate Client Banking, utilization rates increased modestly quarter-on-quarter as capital market conditions led more clients to opt for bank debt. CRE loans were also up 1% sequentially with higher rates creating headwinds for both originations and prepayments. And given the recent focus on commercial real estate, let me remind you that our office sector exposure is less than 10% of our portfolio and is focused in the urban dense markets, and nearly two-thirds of our loans are multifamily, primarily in supply-constrained markets. Finally, credit costs of $417 million included a net reserve build of $379 million, predominantly driven by what I mentioned upfront. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.4 billion, pretax margin of 35%. Revenue of $4.8 billion was up 11% year-on-year driven by higher deposit margins on lower balances and a valuation gain on our initial investment triggered by taking full ownership of our asset management joint venture in China, partially offset by the impact of lower average market levels on management fees and lower performance fees. Expenses of $3.1 billion were up 8% year-on-year, predominantly driven by compensation, reflecting growth in our private banking advisory teams, higher revenue-related compensation and the run rate impact of acquisitions. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $47 billion, led by fixed income and equities. And then liquidity, we saw net inflows of $93 billion, inclusive of our ongoing deposit migration. AUM of $3 trillion was up 2% year-on-year and overall client assets of $4.3 trillion were up 6%, driven by continued net inflows into liquidity and long-term products. And finally, loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower securities-based lending, while average deposits were down 5%. Turning to Corporate on page 8. Corporate reported net income of $244 million. Revenue was $985 million compared to a net loss of $881 million last year. NII was $1.7 billion, up $2.3 billion year-on-year due to the impact of higher rates. NIR was a loss of $755 million compared with a loss of $345 million in the prior year and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned earlier. Expenses of $160 million were down $24 million year-on-year. And credit costs of $370 million were driven by reserve builds on a couple of single name exposures. Next, the outlook on page 9. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex-markets to be approximately $81 billion. This increase in guidance is primarily driven by lower rate paid assumptions across both consumer and wholesale in light of the expectation of Fed cuts later in the year as well as slightly higher card revolving balances. Note that in line with my comments at the outset, recent deposit balance increases are not a meaningful contributor to the upward revision in the NII outlook, given that we expect a meaningful portion of the recent inflows to reverse later in the year. I would point out that this outlook still embeds significant reprice lags. We think a more sustainable NII ex-markets run rate in the medium term is well below this quarter\u2019s $84 billion as well as below the $80 billion that is implied for the rest of the year by our full year guidance. And while we don\u2019t know exactly when this lower run rate will be reached, when it happens, we believe it will be around the mid-70s. And of course, as we mentioned last quarter, this NII outlook remains highly sensitive to the uncertainty associated with the timing and the extent of deposit reprice, investment portfolio decisions, the dynamics of QT and RRP, the trajectory of Fed funds as well as the broader macroeconomic environment, including its impact on loan growth. Separately, it\u2019s worth noting that markets NII may start to trend slightly positive towards the end of the year as a function of mix and rate effects. Moving to expenses. Our outlook for 2023 continues to be about $81 billion. Importantly, this does not currently include the impact of the pending FDIC special assessment. And on credit, we continue to expect the 2023 card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.6%. So to wrap up, our strong results this quarter once again highlight the earnings power of this diversified franchise. We have benefited from our fortress principles and commitment to invest, which we will continue to do as we head into an increasingly uncertain environment. With that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] From the line of Steve Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteve Chubak: So, Jamie, I was actually hoping to get your perspective on how you see the recent developments with SVB impacting the regulatory landscape for the big banks. In your letter, you spent a fair amount of time highlighting the consequences of overly stringent capital requirements, the risk of steering more activities to the less regulated nonbanks. What are some of the changes that your scenario planning for, whether it\u2019s higher capital, increase in FDIC assessment fees? And along those same lines, how you\u2019re thinking about the buyback given continued strong capital build, but a lot of macro uncertainty at the moment?\nJamie Dimon: Well, I think you already kind of complete with answering your own question there. Look, we\u2019re hoping that everyone just takes a deep breath and looks at what happened, and the breadth and depth of regulations already in place. Obviously, when something happens like this, you should adjust, think about it. So I think down the road, there may be some limitations on held to maturity, maybe more TLAC for certain type size banks and more scrutiny and history exposure, stuff like that. But it doesn\u2019t have to be a revamp of the whole system. It\u2019s just recalibrating things the right way. I think it should be done knowing what you want the outcome to be. The outcome you should want is very strong community and regional banks. And certain actions are taking, which are drastic, it could actually make them weaker. So, that\u2019s all it is. We do expect higher capital from Basel IV effectively. And obviously, there\u2019s going to be an FDIC assessment. That will be what it is.\nSteve Chubak: And just in terms of appetite for the buyback, just given some of the elevated macro uncertainty?\nJamie Dimon: Well, we\u2019ve told you -- I think we\u2019ve told you that we\u2019re kind of penciled in $12 billion for this year. Obviously, capital is more than that, but -- and we did a little bit of buyback this quarter. We\u2019re going to wait and see. We don\u2019t mind keeping our powder dry. And you\u2019ve seen us do that with investment portfolios, and we\u2019re also willing to do with capital.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.\nKen Usdin: Hey, Jeremy, I was just wondering if you can just give us a little bit more detail on those lower funding expectation points that you made. Just in terms of -- is it because of like what you can offer the client that might allow you to kind of keep that beta lower? And maybe you can just kind of wrap it into what your overall beta expectations are in that revised update. Thank you.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, sure. So let me just summarize the drivers of the change in the outlook. So the primary driver really is lower deposit rate paid expectations across both consumer and wholesale which, as you mentioned, is driven by a couple of factors. So the change in the rate environment with cuts coming sooner in the outlook, all else equal, does take some pressure off the reprice. And as you said, we\u2019re getting a lot of positive feedback from field on our product offerings. The short-term CD, in particular, is really getting a lot of positive feedback from our folks in the branches. It\u2019s been very attractive to yield-seeking customers. So, that\u2019s kind of working well. And then on the asset side, we are seeing a little bit higher card revolve, which is helping. And I\u2019ll just remind you that at a conference in February, I suggested that we were already starting to feel like some of the uncertainties we mentioned when giving the guidance had started all moving in the same direction. And that was one of the things that contributed to the upward revision, like all the uncertainty kind of went through the same way. But as Jamie has pointed out, like those uncertainties are all still there. We highlight them on the page. And as we look forward to this year and into next year in the medium-term, we remain very focused on those.\nKen Usdin: Yes. And as a follow-up on the point about rate expectations coming now in and potentially getting cut sooner, how do you take a look at what that might mean just for the broader economy? Is that -- do you think it\u2019s more just because inflation is coming down? Do you think it\u2019s because the Fed has just got to react to an even tougher economy and still some of those storm clouds that might be out there? Just kind of -- just your general thinking about the other read-throughs of what lower rates quicker will mean for the broader economy.\nJamie Dimon: Well, I would -- first of all, I don\u2019t quite believe it. So, the rate curve -- the Fed has the rate curve -- the forward short-term rate curve, almost 1% higher than what the market has. So one of the things you got to always prepare for is it could be anything. We don\u2019t know what the rate curve is going to be in the year. And so, we\u2019re quite cautious in that and quite thoughtful about that. Obviously, the short-term read is higher recessionary risk, but -- and then inflation coming down. So I think inflation will come down a little bit. It could easily be stickier than people think, and therefore, the rate curve will have to go up a little bit.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research.\nJohn McDonald: Jeremy, I wanted to follow-up again on the drivers of the NII revision and the lower rates paid assumption. You mentioned the Fed cuts coming sooner and positive feedback on the customer offers. What about the March events? Do the bank failures there that happened in March, in your view, do they slow the reprice intensity because folks are moving other than price reasons, or they intensify it industry-wide, because smaller banks have to reprice to keep their deposits? How do those events influence your view of the reprice?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. John, it\u2019s a really good question, and we\u2019ve obviously thought about that. But as we sit here today, I guess I have two answers to that. One is, it doesn\u2019t -- it\u2019s not meaningfully affecting our current outlook. We don\u2019t see it as a major driver. And I think in terms of the larger dynamics that you lay out, it\u2019s just a little too early to tell. But from where we are right now, the base case is no real impact.\nJohn McDonald: Okay. And then, I wanted to ask Jamie, there\u2019s a narrative out there that the industry could see a credit crunch. Banks are going to stop lending. Even Jay Powell mentioned that as a risk. Do you see that in terms of anything you look at in terms of lending that -- and is that a reaction that makes sense that banks might be retrenching a lot here? Do you worry about that for the economy in terms of credit crunch? Thanks.\nJamie Dimon: I wouldn\u2019t use the word credit crunch, if I were you. Obviously, there\u2019s going to be a little bit of tightening. And most of that will be around certain real estate things. You\u2019ve heard it from real estate investors already. So I just look at that as a kind of a thumb on the scale. It just makes the finance conditions will be a little bit tighter, increases the odds of a recession. That\u2019s what that is. It\u2019s not like a credit crunch.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS.\nErika Najarian: My first question is you mentioned that your reserve build was driven mostly by worse economic assumptions. I\u2019m wondering if you could update us on what unemployment rate you\u2019re assuming in your reserves.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. So Erika, as you know, we take -- I can\u2019t go into a lot of detail here. But we take the outlook from our economists. We run a bunch of different scenarios and we probably weigh those. The central case outlook from our research team hasn\u2019t actually changed. But we felt that in line with what Jamie just said in terms of a little bit of tightening as a result of the event of March, it made sense to add a little bit of weight to our relative adverse case. So we did that, which changed the weighted average expectation. And I think the weighted average peak unemployment that we\u2019re using now is something like 5.8%.\nErika Najarian: So, as we think about all of what you\u2019ve just told us, so $81 billion of NII this year, and who knows when medium term is going to happen is mid-70s, the clear strength of the franchise producing 23% ROTCE in a quarter where your CET1 was 13.8% and a reserve that already reflects 5.8% unemployment. As we think about recession and what JPMorgan can earn in a recession, do you think you can hit 17% ROTCE even in 2024, assuming we do have a recession in \u201824 as everybody is expecting, given all these revenue dynamics and how prepared you are on the reserve?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. I mean, that\u2019s an interesting question, Erika. I guess, I\u2019ll say a couple of things.\nJamie Dimon: It\u2019s a great question. Jeremy answers it.\nJeremy Barnum: Okay. Let\u2019s take a crack. Let\u2019s see what the boss thinks. I think, number one, we believe, have said and continue to believe that this is fundamentally a 17% through the cycle ROTCE franchise. So number one. Number two, as Jamie always says, we run this company for all different scenarios and to have it be as resilient as possible across all different scenarios. On the particular question of ROTCE expectations in 2024, contingent on the particular economic outlook, obviously, it depends a lot on the nature of the recession. I think we feel really good about how the Company is positioned for a recession, but we\u2019re a bank. A very serious recession is, of course, going to be a headline -- a headwind for returns. But we think even in a fairly severe recession, we\u2019ll deliver very good returns, whether that\u2019s 17% or not is too much detail for now.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities.\nJim Mitchell: Maybe just a little bit on the deposit, your thought process there. You\u2019ve seen some inflows. What\u2019s your -- why do you think they -- you lose them going forward? And just maybe talk a little bit about the dynamic in pricing. Do you feel like given the inflows, do you see some pricing power for the larger banks?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. A couple of things there. So first of all, we don\u2019t know, right? The deposits just come in. We don\u2019t know. We\u2019re guessing. Number two, the deposits just came in. So by definition, these are somewhat flighty deposits because they just came into us. So, it\u2019s prudent and appropriate for us to assume that they won\u2019t be particularly stable. Number three, there\u2019s a natural amount of internal migration of deposits to money funds. So, you have to overweigh that, and that\u2019s embedded in our assumptions. And number four, it\u2019s a competitive market. And it\u2019s entirely possible that people temporarily come to us and then over time, decide to go elsewhere. So for all of those reasons, we\u2019re just being realistic about the stickiness of that.\nJamie Dimon: Probably to add, I wouldn\u2019t -- there is -- I would say, category, there\u2019s no pricing power that the bigger banks have. Because if you look at the pricing, and we look at pricing sheets all the time, every bank is in a slightly different position, and every bank is competing in 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, savings rates. And then you have the online banks, you got treasury bills, you got money market funds. There\u2019s no pricing power for the bank, but obviously, we\u2019ll have different franchises as well as slightly different position.\nJim Mitchell: All fair points. And maybe just a follow-up on John\u2019s question on the lending environment. You talked about the industry likely pulling back. Are you changing your underwriting standards in any way? Just trying to think through, is there a potential for some market share gains given your strength of capital and liquidity, or how are you thinking about the loan environment?\nJamie Dimon: We say very modestly, but we look at that all the time.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. And we always say, right, we underwrite through the cycle. And I think notably, we don\u2019t loosen our underwriting standards when all the numbers looked crazy good during the pandemic. And we\u2019re not going to like overreact now and tighten unreasonably. Some of that correction happens naturally. Credit metrics deteriorate for borrowers, whether in consumer or wholesale and that might make them leave our pre-existing risk appetite. But we\u2019re not running around aggressively tightening standards right now.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.\nGerard Cassidy: In your comments about your CET1 ratio, obviously, came in strong at 13.8%. You\u2019ve got the G-SIB buffers obviously going up next year. And we have the stress test coming this summer or in June, the results, which maybe will lead to banks including yours having a higher stress capital buffer. Where should we think about that CET1 ratio being by the end of the year, do you think?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. So a few things on there, Gerard. So we have previously said that we were targeting 13.5% in the first quarter of \u201824 as a function of assuming an unchanged SCB, the increased G-SIB stab and operating with a 50 basis point buffer. So the point that Jamie made a second ago, in light of the environment, Basel IV, dry powder, who knows how we\u2019ll tweak that going forward. But that\u2019s still our base case assumption. Specifically, on the stress test, I\u2019ll -- contrary to what I\u2019ve heard some people argue, our ability to predict the SCB ahead of time from running our own process is actually quite limited. And you\u2019ll remember last year that even though we did predict an increase, we were off by almost a factor of 2 in terms of how big it wound up being and that was a big surprise for the whole industry. So we want to be quite humble about our ability to predict the SCB. But having said that, for right now, we are assuming it will be unchanged. There are some tailwinds in there through the OCI, but we believe there will likely be some offsets in harsher credit shocks in the numbers. So for planning purposes right now, we\u2019re assuming flat for SCB and we\u2019ll know soon enough what that actual number is.\nGerard Cassidy: Sure. And then just as a follow-up, if I heard you correctly, can you give us a little more color? I think you mentioned in building the loan loss reserve this quarter, you identified some one-off credits. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s how you said it. There\u2019s some larger credits. Were they commercial real estate orientated? Were they commercial? Any more color there?\nJeremy Barnum: No, it wasn\u2019t commercial real estate. It was just a couple of single name items in the Corporate segment.\nGerard Cassidy: Leveraged loan type items or just regular corporate credits?\nJamie Dimon: Regular corporate credits. I\u2019d rather not get into too much detail\u2026\nGerard Cassidy: Okay, very good.\nJamie Dimon: Gerard, sorry. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nEbrahim Poonawala: I guess, maybe one question, Jeremy, you reminded us of the relatively low office exposure for JPM, but obviously, you\u2019re big players in the CRE market. So give us a sense of when you look at the two pressure points on CRE 1, how much is oversupply, and that probably goes beyond office into apartments, how much of an issue is oversupply in the market as we think about the next few years going into a weakening economy? And how much of a risk is higher for long gates in that, if the central banks can\u2019t cut rates in the next year or two, we will see a ton of more pain because of the refi wall that\u2019s coming up?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. Ebrahim, let me sort of respond narrowly in connection with our portfolio and our exposure, right? So really, the large majority of our commercial real estate exposure is multifamily lending in supply-constrained markets. And I think it\u2019s quite important to recognize the difference between that and sort of higher-end, higher price point, non-rent-controlled, not supply-constrained markets. So, our space is really quite different in that respect. And I think that\u2019s a big part of the reason the performance has been so good for so long. So, of course, we watch it very carefully, and we don\u2019t assume that past performance predicts future results here. But I think our multifamily lending portfolio is quite low risk in the scheme of things.\nJamie Dimon: Just to add also, housing is in short supply in America. So, it\u2019s not massively oversupplied like you saw in 2008.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. And then, in terms of the office space, as you know, our exposure is quite small. Yes, Jamie has also mentioned all the refi dynamics that you mentioned too are something that the office space is processing one way or the other. Our office exposure is quite modest, very concentrated in Class A buildings and sort of dense urban locations where the return to the office narrative is one of the drivers is generally in favor of high occupancy. So again, launching it. There are obviously specific things here and there to pay attention to, but in the scheme of things, for us, not a big issue.\nEbrahim Poonawala: And just as a follow-up, I think the other risk from higher for longer rates, I think, is just the ability of the economy, the financial markets to sustain a 5% plus Fed fund for a long period of time. Like what are the other areas you\u2019re watching, if duration mismatch and bank balance sheet, being one, CRE market being one. Are you worrying -- worried about nonbanks that have grown exponentially over the last decade in terms of risks at the nonbanks if rates don\u2019t get cut? And if you can talk to the transmission mechanism of that coming back and hitting banks given the leverage that banks provide to the nonbanks?\nJamie Dimon: Yes. So, I\u2019d like to answer that. So, there is a risk of higher rates for longer. And don\u2019t just think of just the Fed funds rate because I think you should -- for our planning, I\u2019d be thinking more about, it could be 6 and don\u2019t -- and then think about the 5- and 10-year rate, which could be 5. And I think if those things happen, I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re going to happen. I just think people should prepare for them. They saw what just happened when rates went up beyond people\u2019s expectations. You had the guilt problem in London. You had some of the banks here. People need to be prepared for the potential of higher rates for longer. If and when that happens, it will address problems in the economy for those who are too exposed to floating rates or those who are too exposed to refi risk. Those exposures will be in multiple parts of the economy. So now that -- I say to all of our clients, now would be the time to fix it. Do not put yourself in a position where that risk is excessive for your company, your business, your investment pools, et cetera. That\u2019s answer number one. Number two is it will not come back to JPMorgan. Okay? While we do provide credit to what you call shadow banks, it is very -- we think it\u2019s very, very secure. That does not mean it won\u2019t come back to other credit providers.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMike Mayo: Hey, Jeremy, you mentioned a degree of reintermediation to the lending markets. You said capital markets activity has gone to bank lending. And I\u2019m just wondering, as part of your $7 billion increased NII guide, are you assuming better loan spreads? And on the topic of the loan pricing, why aren\u2019t your credit card yields going higher than where they are today? Thanks.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, Mike. So on the -- so I think, yes, you\u2019re referring to my comments that I made in the Commercial Bank about the fact that the larger corporate segment within the Commercial Bank that would generally have access to capital markets, but also access to bank lending that the margin is choosing to draw down on revolvers right now rather than access to capital markets. That is not a particularly meaningful driver of the increase in NII guidance. There\u2019s a lot of odds and ends in there, but the major drivers are the ones that I called out. And to be honest, I haven\u2019t actually, specifically, checked what\u2019s happening with card yields. I would imagine that they\u2019ve gone up a little bit in line with rates. But I don\u2019t know. We should follow up.\nMike Mayo: All right. And then one for you, Jamie. I guess, taking the 10,000-foot level, I guess, when you look at asset liability management or AUM, you could call this Nightmare on Elm Street, and you\u2019ve seen some big problems at banks. And I guess, how would you evaluate yourself, I guess, with this $7 billion higher NII guide? Probably is good. But to what degree are you willing to sacrifice JPM shareholder money to help rescue problem banks that do not get their asset liability management correctly?\nJamie Dimon: Well, there\u2019s two really different questions. So, we\u2019ve been quite cautious on interest rates for quite a while, and how we invest in our portfolio, what our expectations are, our stress testing. The stress test -- the CCAR stress test, as you know, had rates going down. I always looked at rates going up and being prepared to -- whether or not anything is going to happen. So, we\u2019ve been quite conservative ourselves. And we don\u2019t mind continuing to do that because I remind people that having excess capital, you haven\u2019t lost it. It\u2019s kind of earnings in store. You get to deploy it later and maybe at a more opportune time when the time comes. And we\u2019re not -- look, we\u2019d like to help the system when it needs to help if we can reasonably. And we\u2019re not the only ones. You saw a lot of banks do that. And I was proud of them. I was proud of them. I think all of us did the right thing, whether ultimately, it works out or not, you could second guess that when it happens. But the fact is I think people want to help the system. And this whole banking theme is bad for banks. And I knew that the second I saw the headline. And you have Credit Suisse. We want healthy community banks. We want healthy regional banks. We want to help them get through this. We have -- remember, Mike, as you pointed out, we have the best financial system the world has ever seen. That does not mean it won\u2019t have problems. It doesn\u2019t mean there shouldn\u2019t be changes made, but I think it\u2019s reasonable for people to help each other in times of need. And we all did that during -- all of us did that during COVID. All of us did that -- if you could, those you could did it during the great financial crisis, and I would expect people do that going forward.\nMike Mayo: Jamie, your CEO letter said the banking crisis isn\u2019t over. So, what do you mean by that, or was that dated 2 weeks later and talking contagion or what?\nJamie Dimon: So it\u2019s just -- the number of banks off-sites, you can count in your hands in terms of like too much interest rate exposure, too much ATM, too much uninsured deposits. And so there may be additional bank deposits -- I mean, bank failure, something like that, which we don\u2019t know. But you\u2019re going to see next week regional banks have pretty good numbers. A lot of people are going to have -- can take actions to remediate some of the issues they may have going forward. You\u2019ve already seen things calm down quite a bit, particularly in deposit flows. Warren Buffett was on TV talking about that he would bet $1 million, I don\u2019t know if you saw that, that no depositor will lose money in America. [Indiscernible] own money, of course you know, he is a very bright man. So, this crisis is not away. It will pass. And the one thing I pointed out is that when I answered the question just before about interest rates, people need to be prepared. They shouldn\u2019t pray that they don\u2019t go up. They should prepare for them going up. And if it doesn\u2019t happen, serendipity.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: I do want to unpack the question here on the possibility of higher for longer rates and how that impacts you in your non-markets NII...\nJeremy Barnum: Betsy, did we just lose you? I feel like you just dropped.\nBetsy Graseck: Now you hear me? Hello?\nJamie Dimon: Yes, you\u2019re back now. You\u2019re back.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. So I just wanted to unpack the higher for longer rate possibility as to how it impacts your NII because your NII guide is assuming the forward curve, if I understand correctly. So in the event that you get that higher for longer, just how much does that impact the NII ex-markets? Because I\u2019m trying to triangulate here about maybe you lose some deposits, but if we have higher for longer, shouldn\u2019t we expect the trajectory goes up from this quarter as opposed to down? Is that -- that\u2019s the question.\nJamie Dimon: Go ahead, Jeremy. And I\u2019ll...\nJeremy Barnum: Sure. So, Betsy, your question is very good. And I would say that as the -- like if you look at the evolution of our outlook last year, it was pretty clear that we were very asset-sensitive certainly in terms of sort of one-year forward EIR-type measure. You also obviously know that our current EIR actually shows a slight negative number, so it tiny bit liability sensitive, and I won\u2019t get into all the nuances about why that may or may not be a great predictor in the short term. But the point is that the level of rates now is, of course, very different from what it was last year. And at this level of rates, the relationship between our short-term NII evolution and the curve is not always going to be clear in any given moment. It\u2019s quite tricky and it can behave in somewhat wonky ways as a function of, again, what I\u2019ve alluded to a couple of times on this call, the competitive environment for deposits, which is not, in fact, a sort of mathematically predictable thing as a function of the rate curve. So, that\u2019s why we\u2019re emphasizing all the different drivers of uncertainty in the NII outlook.\nJamie Dimon: Yes. So, I would just add, so next quarter, we kind of know already, two quarters out, we know a little bit less, three quarters out, we know a little bit less, and \u201824, we know very little. That number, you can imagine, this is a little inside baseball now, the number that we\u2019re talking about for 2024 is not based upon an implied curve. It\u2019s based upon us looking at multiple potential scenarios, leveling them kind of out and saying this is kind of a range. And you\u2019re absolutely correct. You could have an environment of higher for longer that might be better than that. But remember, higher for longer comes with a lot of other things attached to it, like maybe a recession, taxation, lower volume. So I wouldn\u2019t look at that as higher flows a positive. It might be a slight positive in that line. It probably be negative in other lines.\nBetsy Graseck: Yes. Got it. Okay. That\u2019s super helpful to understand how you think through that. And then the follow-up is just on the buybacks. So, do I take your comments to mean that you\u2019re on pause now? And if that\u2019s the case, what would be the driver of restarting?\nJamie Dimon: Yes. No, we\u2019re not on pause now. We\u2019re doing a little bit now. We obviously have a lot of excess capital. We also like to buy our stock when it\u2019s cheap, not just when it\u2019s available. And we\u2019re also peering ahead, looking at those a little bit of storm cloud, so we\u2019re going to be kind of cautious. So we\u2019re going to make this decision every day. We also don\u2019t like to tell the market what we\u2019re doing, just so you know.\nBetsy Graseck: Yes. And then can you give us any sense of what Basel IV endgame means to you in your RWAs? How much should we be baking in for this?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. Betsy, we really don\u2019t have any new information there, right? I mean I think, clearly, if you go back like a year, we were maybe a little bit more optimistic that it might be across all the different levers and all the different pieces of it closer to capital neutral. I think now it feels like it\u2019s likely to be worse than that. Hopefully, it\u2019s not too much worse than that. And I would just remind you that there are a lot of different levers. So in any -- when the NPR comes, that\u2019s only going to be part of it. There\u2019s going to be other pieces, the holistic review, and it\u2019s going to take a lot of time to phase in, and we\u2019re going to have time to adjust. So, we\u2019ll know when we know.\nJamie Dimon: I just remember, they were supposed to be positive in there about how they looked at banks relative to the global economy, which are getting smaller and G-SIB is supposed to be adjusted for that. So it may vary. We\u2019re expecting to go up, but there are a lot of reasons why it shouldn\u2019t go up. And JPMorgan, it\u2019s not -- there\u2019s so much capital. I mean, so you can\u2019t look at JPMorgan and say, well it\u2019s a capital issue. And even the banks, by the way, when you look at it -- even though in some of the banks who have plenty of capital, the issue wasn\u2019t capital. It was other things. And so I\u2019m just hoping regulators are very thoughtful. And the other thing is they should [ph] decide what they want on the banking at this point. Because I made it clear, I can look at the banking system today and say that no bank should keep a loan, if possible. That\u2019s how much capital is now being required for loans. The loans\u2026.\nBetsy Graseck: \u2026on the current rule set.\nJamie Dimon: Yes, because the market is pricing -- it holds -- the market would take loans at much lower capital ratios than banks are being forced to hold for them. I\u2019m talking about just loans only. And so that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing a lot of capital go to -- I mean a lot of the credit go to nonbanks and dramatically, by the way, rapidly and dramatically. And so if you\u2019re a regulator, if you look at it and saying, do I want that? Is that a good thing for the system? If you believe it\u2019s a good thing for the system, raise the capital, more credit will go out of the system. That\u2019s fine. If that\u2019s what they want, that\u2019s fine. But they should do it with a forethought, not accidentally.\nBetsy Graseck: I like the NII from loans better than the gain on sale. So I\u2019ll prefer the former, not the latter. But thanks, appreciate it.\nJamie Dimon: Yes.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.\nGlenn Schorr: So, you talked about in your letter about the regulators avoiding the knee-jerk reaction, which you addressed earlier. I\u2019m curious on your thoughts around how customers have reacted and should react. Now -- and my point -- my question is, consumers can move excess cash balances if they want more insurance. They can do that in a lot of different ways. Move it, treasuries, money markets, extra accounts, whatever. The issue -- the question I have for you is on the corporate side. Have you seen big changes in how corporate treasurers or CFOs are adapting their cash balances and working capital? And should they need to? And I\u2019ll say your Warren Buffet comments.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, Glenn, and sure, we really haven\u2019t seen big changes to speak of. And I do think it\u2019s just worth saying, I think you\u2019re sort of hinting at this a little bit when you talk about the behavior of corporates. But when we talk about responses to the recent events through the lens of uninsured deposits, that\u2019s obviously very different if you\u2019re talking about large balances of nonoperating uninsured deposits from financial institutions or de facto financial institutions versus normal large corporate operating balances which is of course, like core banking business for all of us.\nJamie Dimon: When you saw it in Commercial Banking, Payments, Investment Banking and custody, you did see money move -- what I would call, excess cash has moved out. So they have options. What I would call more like operational cash, I think even if small companies, middle market companies, et cetera, that tends to be fairly sticky because you have your loans there, you have your money there. You get more and more competitive in rates. And that\u2019s why I think you see a lot of regional banks. They\u2019ve got sticky middle market deposits. If I lent you $30 million and you have $10 million, you\u2019re probably going to be leaving in my bank. And they also are more competitive on the rate for that. So I think you shouldn\u2019t be looking at deposits like one class. They just -- there\u2019s a whole bunch of different types and analytically, you go through each one and try to figure out what the stickiness is and what the stickiness is and et cetera. And so -- but I think they\u2019ve already -- as the Fed has raised rates, you\u2019ve already seen -- that\u2019s the reason we expected outflows, both from consumers and corporate customers.\nGlenn Schorr: Interesting. Just a follow-up. The other thing that caught my eye in the letter is you mentioned that you\u2019re exploring new capital optimization strategies, including partnerships and securitizations. What\u2019s different than what you\u2019ve already been doing for the last 30 years?\nJamie Dimon: We\u2019ve got our smartest people figure out every angle to reduce capital requirements for JPMorgan. That\u2019s the difference. And we\u2019ve been doing it, but there are securitizations, there are partnerships. You\u2019ve seen a lot of the private equity do the life insurance companies. And I expect that we\u2019re going to come up with a whole bunch of different things over time. And we\u2019ll shed certain assets, too.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: You guys talked about one of the drivers of the higher net interest income guide this year is due to likely higher credit card balances. And was just wondering if you could flesh out what changed there on the outlook, say, versus three months ago? And I guess, is that a good or bad thing that those balances will be higher than you thought?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. So the story there is kind of the same story we\u2019ve been talking about for a while. It\u2019s just a matter of degree. So we had revolving balances obviously drop a lot during the pandemic period, and then we talked about having them recover in absolute dollar terms to the same level as we had pre-pandemic. So I think happened last quarter. And then the remaining narrative is just the further normalization of the revolve per account because we also have seen some account growth, and that continues to happen. And so -- and yes, we also, to Mike\u2019s question earlier, we\u2019re seeing higher yield there as well, so. And on your question of whether it\u2019s good or bad, obviously, there is a point at which the consumers have too much leverage. We don\u2019t see that yet, so.\nJamie Dimon: It\u2019s normalization. That\u2019s a good thing for us.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then just separately to squeeze in. You guys took some security losses again this quarter. And in the past, you\u2019ve talked about really just going security by security, looking for kind of pricing opportunities. Is that kind of what drove it again this quarter, or is there some kind of broader overarching...\nJamie Dimon: That will be every quarter for the rest of our lives. So we find rich and we buy what we think is dear.\nOperator: We have no further questions.\nJamie Dimon: Excellent. Well, thank you very much.\nOperator: That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeremy Barnum",
            "content": "Thanks, and good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on page 1. The Firm reported net income of $12.6 billion, EPS of $4.10 on revenue of $39.3 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 23%. These results included $868 million of net investment securities losses in corporate. Before reviewing our results for the quarter, let's talk about the recent bank failures. Jamie has addressed a number of the important themes in his shareholder letter and the recent televised interview. So, I will go straight to the specific impacts on the Firm. As you would expect, we saw significant new account opening activity and meaningful deposit and money market fund inflows, most significantly in the Commercial Bank, Business Banking and AWM. Regarding the deposit inflows, at the Firm-wide level, average deposits were down 3% quarter-on-quarter, while end-of-period deposits were up 2% quarter-on-quarter, implying an intra-quarter reversal of the recent outflow trend as a consequence of the March events. We estimate that we have retained approximately $50 billion of these deposit inflows at quarter-end. It's important to note that while the sequential period-end deposit increase is higher than we would have otherwise expected, our current full year NII outlook, which I will address at the end, still assumes modest deposit outflows from here. We expect these outflows to be driven by the same factors as last quarter as well as the expectation that we will not retain all of this quarter's inflows. Now back to the quarter touching on a few highlights. We grew our IB fee wallet share. Consumer spending remained solid with combined debit and credit card spend up 10% year-on-year. And credit continues to normalize, but actual performance remains strong across the Company. On Page 2, we have some more detail. Revenue of $39.3 billion was up $7.7 billion or 25% year-on-year. NII ex markets was up $9.2 billion or 78%, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. NIR ex markets was down $1.1 billion or 10% driven by the securities losses previously mentioned as well as lower IB fees and lower auto lease income on lower volume. And markets revenue was down $371 million or 4% year-on-year. Expenses of $20.1 billion were up $916 million or 5% year-on-year, driven by compensation-related costs, reflecting the annualization of last year's headcount growth and wage inflation. These results include the impact of the higher FDIC assessment I mentioned last quarter, which, of course, is unrelated to recent events. And credit costs of $2.3 billion included net charge-offs of $1.1 billion, predominantly in card. The net reserve build of $1.1 billion was largely driven by deterioration in our weighted average economic outlook. Onto balance sheet and capital on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.8%, up about 60 basis points, which was primarily driven by the benefit of net income less distributions and AOCI gains. And in line with what we previously said, we resumed stock buybacks this quarter and distributed a total of $1.9 billion and net repurchases back to shareholders. Now, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 4. Touching quickly on the health of U.S. consumers and small businesses based on our data. Both continue to show resilience and remain on the path to normalization as expected, but we continue to monitor their activity closely. Spend remains solid, and we have not observed any notable pullback throughout the quarter. Moving to financial results. CCB reported net income of $5.2 billion on revenue of $16.5 billion, which was up 35% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 67% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. Average deposits were down 2% quarter-on-quarter, in line with recent trends. Throughout the quarter, we continued to see customer flows to higher-yielding products, as you would expect, but were encouraged by what we are capturing in CDs and our Wealth Management offerings. Client investment assets were down 1% year-on-year, but up 7% quarter-on-quarter, driven by market performance as well as strong net inflows. In Home Lending, revenue was down 38% year-on-year, largely driven by lower net interest income from tighter loan spreads and lower production revenue. Moving to Card Services & Auto. Revenue was up 14% year-on-year, largely driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower auto lease income. Credit card spend was up 13% year-on-year. Card outstandings were up 21%, driven by strong new account growth and revolve normalization. And in Auto, originations were $9.2 billion, up 10% year-on-year. Expenses of $8.1 billion were up 5% year-on-year, reflecting the impact of wage inflation and higher headcount. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.4 billion, reflecting reserve builds of $300 million in card and $50 million in Home Lending. Net charge-offs were $1.1 billion, up about $500 million year-on-year, in line with expectations as delinquency levels continue to normalize across portfolios. Next, the CIB on Page 5. CIB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $13.6 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.6 billion was down 24% year-on-year. IB fees were down 19%. We ranked number 1 with first quarter wallet share of 8.7%. In advisory, fees were down 6% compared to a strong first quarter last year. Our underwriting businesses continued to be affected by market conditions with fees down 34% for debt and 6% for equity. In terms of the outlook, the dynamics remain the same. Our pipeline is relatively robust, but conversion is sensitive to market conditions and the economic outlook. We expect the second quarter and the rest of the year to remain challenging. Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $8.4 billion, down 4% year-on-year. Fixed income was flat. Rates was strong during the rally early in the quarter as well as through the elevated volatility in March. Credit was up on the back of higher client flows and currencies in emerging markets was down relative to a very strong first quarter in the prior year. Equity Markets was down 12%, driven by lower revenues in derivatives relative to a strong first quarter in the prior year and lower client activity and cash. Payments revenue was $2.4 billion, up 26% year-on-year. Excluding the net impact of equity investments, primarily a gain in the prior year, it was up 55%, with the growth driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Securities Services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 7% year-on-year, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances and market levels. Expenses of $7.5 billion were up 2% year-on-year as higher headcount and wage inflation were largely offset by lower revenue-related compensation. Moving to the Commercial Bank on page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.3 billion. Revenue of $3.5 billion was up 46% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins. Payments revenue of $2 billion was up 98% year-on-year driven by higher rates. And gross Investment Banking revenue of $881 million was up 21% year-on-year on increased M&A and bond underwriting from large deal activity. Expenses of $1.3 billion were up 16% year-on-year largely driven by higher compensation expense, including front office hiring and technology investments as well as higher volume-related expense. Average deposits were down 16% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on-quarter, predominantly driven by continued attrition and non-operating deposits as well as seasonally lower balances. Loans were up 13% year-on-year and 1% sequentially. C&I loans were up 1% quarter-on-quarter with somewhat different dynamics based on client size. In middle market banking, higher rates and recession concerns have decreased new loan demand and utilization, which is also leading to weakness in CapEx spending. In Corporate Client Banking, utilization rates increased modestly quarter-on-quarter as capital market conditions led more clients to opt for bank debt. CRE loans were also up 1% sequentially with higher rates creating headwinds for both originations and prepayments. And given the recent focus on commercial real estate, let me remind you that our office sector exposure is less than 10% of our portfolio and is focused in the urban dense markets, and nearly two-thirds of our loans are multifamily, primarily in supply-constrained markets. Finally, credit costs of $417 million included a net reserve build of $379 million, predominantly driven by what I mentioned upfront. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.4 billion, pretax margin of 35%. Revenue of $4.8 billion was up 11% year-on-year driven by higher deposit margins on lower balances and a valuation gain on our initial investment triggered by taking full ownership of our asset management joint venture in China, partially offset by the impact of lower average market levels on management fees and lower performance fees. Expenses of $3.1 billion were up 8% year-on-year, predominantly driven by compensation, reflecting growth in our private banking advisory teams, higher revenue-related compensation and the run rate impact of acquisitions. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $47 billion, led by fixed income and equities. And then liquidity, we saw net inflows of $93 billion, inclusive of our ongoing deposit migration. AUM of $3 trillion was up 2% year-on-year and overall client assets of $4.3 trillion were up 6%, driven by continued net inflows into liquidity and long-term products. And finally, loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower securities-based lending, while average deposits were down 5%. Turning to Corporate on page 8. Corporate reported net income of $244 million. Revenue was $985 million compared to a net loss of $881 million last year. NII was $1.7 billion, up $2.3 billion year-on-year due to the impact of higher rates. NIR was a loss of $755 million compared with a loss of $345 million in the prior year and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned earlier. Expenses of $160 million were down $24 million year-on-year. And credit costs of $370 million were driven by reserve builds on a couple of single name exposures. Next, the outlook on page 9. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex-markets to be approximately $81 billion. This increase in guidance is primarily driven by lower rate paid assumptions across both consumer and wholesale in light of the expectation of Fed cuts later in the year as well as slightly higher card revolving balances. Note that in line with my comments at the outset, recent deposit balance increases are not a meaningful contributor to the upward revision in the NII outlook, given that we expect a meaningful portion of the recent inflows to reverse later in the year. I would point out that this outlook still embeds significant reprice lags. We think a more sustainable NII ex-markets run rate in the medium term is well below this quarter's $84 billion as well as below the $80 billion that is implied for the rest of the year by our full year guidance. And while we don't know exactly when this lower run rate will be reached, when it happens, we believe it will be around the mid-70s. And of course, as we mentioned last quarter, this NII outlook remains highly sensitive to the uncertainty associated with the timing and the extent of deposit reprice, investment portfolio decisions, the dynamics of QT and RRP, the trajectory of Fed funds as well as the broader macroeconomic environment, including its impact on loan growth. Separately, it's worth noting that markets NII may start to trend slightly positive towards the end of the year as a function of mix and rate effects. Moving to expenses. Our outlook for 2023 continues to be about $81 billion. Importantly, this does not currently include the impact of the pending FDIC special assessment. And on credit, we continue to expect the 2023 card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.6%. So to wrap up, our strong results this quarter once again highlight the earnings power of this diversified franchise. We have benefited from our fortress principles and commitment to invest, which we will continue to do as we head into an increasingly uncertain environment. With that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. Yes, sure. So let me just summarize the drivers of the change in the outlook. So the primary driver really is lower deposit rate paid expectations across both consumer and wholesale which, as you mentioned, is driven by a couple of factors. So the change in the rate environment with cuts coming sooner in the outlook, all else equal, does take some pressure off the reprice. And as you said, we're getting a lot of positive feedback from field on our product offerings. The short-term CD, in particular, is really getting a lot of positive feedback from our folks in the branches. It's been very attractive to yield-seeking customers. So, that's kind of working well. And then on the asset side, we are seeing a little bit higher card revolve, which is helping. And I'll just remind you that at a conference in February, I suggested that we were already starting to feel like some of the uncertainties we mentioned when giving the guidance had started all moving in the same direction. And that was one of the things that contributed to the upward revision, like all the uncertainty kind of went through the same way. But as Jamie has pointed out, like those uncertainties are all still there. We highlight them on the page. And as we look forward to this year and into next year in the medium-term, we remain very focused on those. Yes. John, it's a really good question, and we've obviously thought about that. But as we sit here today, I guess I have two answers to that. One is, it doesn't -- it's not meaningfully affecting our current outlook. We don't see it as a major driver. And I think in terms of the larger dynamics that you lay out, it's just a little too early to tell. But from where we are right now, the base case is no real impact. Yes. So Erika, as you know, we take -- I can't go into a lot of detail here. But we take the outlook from our economists. We run a bunch of different scenarios and we probably weigh those. The central case outlook from our research team hasn't actually changed. But we felt that in line with what Jamie just said in terms of a little bit of tightening as a result of the event of March, it made sense to add a little bit of weight to our relative adverse case. So we did that, which changed the weighted average expectation. And I think the weighted average peak unemployment that we're using now is something like 5.8%. Yes. I mean, that's an interesting question, Erika. I guess, I'll say a couple of things. Okay. Let's take a crack. Let's see what the boss thinks. I think, number one, we believe, have said and continue to believe that this is fundamentally a 17% through the cycle ROTCE franchise. So number one. Number two, as Jamie always says, we run this company for all different scenarios and to have it be as resilient as possible across all different scenarios. On the particular question of ROTCE expectations in 2024, contingent on the particular economic outlook, obviously, it depends a lot on the nature of the recession. I think we feel really good about how the Company is positioned for a recession, but we're a bank. A very serious recession is, of course, going to be a headline -- a headwind for returns. But we think even in a fairly severe recession, we'll deliver very good returns, whether that's 17% or not is too much detail for now. Yes. A couple of things there. So first of all, we don't know, right? The deposits just come in. We don't know. We're guessing. Number two, the deposits just came in. So by definition, these are somewhat flighty deposits because they just came into us. So, it's prudent and appropriate for us to assume that they won't be particularly stable. Number three, there's a natural amount of internal migration of deposits to money funds. So, you have to overweigh that, and that's embedded in our assumptions. And number four, it's a competitive market. And it's entirely possible that people temporarily come to us and then over time, decide to go elsewhere. So for all of those reasons, we're just being realistic about the stickiness of that. Yes. And we always say, right, we underwrite through the cycle. And I think notably, we don't loosen our underwriting standards when all the numbers looked crazy good during the pandemic. And we're not going to like overreact now and tighten unreasonably. Some of that correction happens naturally. Credit metrics deteriorate for borrowers, whether in consumer or wholesale and that might make them leave our pre-existing risk appetite. But we're not running around aggressively tightening standards right now. Yes. So a few things on there, Gerard. So we have previously said that we were targeting 13.5% in the first quarter of \u201824 as a function of assuming an unchanged SCB, the increased G-SIB stab and operating with a 50 basis point buffer. So the point that Jamie made a second ago, in light of the environment, Basel IV, dry powder, who knows how we'll tweak that going forward. But that's still our base case assumption. Specifically, on the stress test, I'll -- contrary to what I've heard some people argue, our ability to predict the SCB ahead of time from running our own process is actually quite limited. And you'll remember last year that even though we did predict an increase, we were off by almost a factor of 2 in terms of how big it wound up being and that was a big surprise for the whole industry. So we want to be quite humble about our ability to predict the SCB. But having said that, for right now, we are assuming it will be unchanged. There are some tailwinds in there through the OCI, but we believe there will likely be some offsets in harsher credit shocks in the numbers. So for planning purposes right now, we're assuming flat for SCB and we'll know soon enough what that actual number is. No, it wasn't commercial real estate. It was just a couple of single name items in the Corporate segment. Yes. Ebrahim, let me sort of respond narrowly in connection with our portfolio and our exposure, right? So really, the large majority of our commercial real estate exposure is multifamily lending in supply-constrained markets. And I think it's quite important to recognize the difference between that and sort of higher-end, higher price point, non-rent-controlled, not supply-constrained markets. So, our space is really quite different in that respect. And I think that's a big part of the reason the performance has been so good for so long. So, of course, we watch it very carefully, and we don't assume that past performance predicts future results here. But I think our multifamily lending portfolio is quite low risk in the scheme of things. Yes. And then, in terms of the office space, as you know, our exposure is quite small. Yes, Jamie has also mentioned all the refi dynamics that you mentioned too are something that the office space is processing one way or the other. Our office exposure is quite modest, very concentrated in Class A buildings and sort of dense urban locations where the return to the office narrative is one of the drivers is generally in favor of high occupancy. So again, launching it. There are obviously specific things here and there to pay attention to, but in the scheme of things, for us, not a big issue. Yes, Mike. So on the -- so I think, yes, you're referring to my comments that I made in the Commercial Bank about the fact that the larger corporate segment within the Commercial Bank that would generally have access to capital markets, but also access to bank lending that the margin is choosing to draw down on revolvers right now rather than access to capital markets. That is not a particularly meaningful driver of the increase in NII guidance. There's a lot of odds and ends in there, but the major drivers are the ones that I called out. And to be honest, I haven't actually, specifically, checked what's happening with card yields. I would imagine that they've gone up a little bit in line with rates. But I don't know. We should follow up. Betsy, did we just lose you? I feel like you just dropped. Sure. So, Betsy, your question is very good. And I would say that as the -- like if you look at the evolution of our outlook last year, it was pretty clear that we were very asset-sensitive certainly in terms of sort of one-year forward EIR-type measure. You also obviously know that our current EIR actually shows a slight negative number, so it tiny bit liability sensitive, and I won't get into all the nuances about why that may or may not be a great predictor in the short term. But the point is that the level of rates now is, of course, very different from what it was last year. And at this level of rates, the relationship between our short-term NII evolution and the curve is not always going to be clear in any given moment. It's quite tricky and it can behave in somewhat wonky ways as a function of, again, what I've alluded to a couple of times on this call, the competitive environment for deposits, which is not, in fact, a sort of mathematically predictable thing as a function of the rate curve. So, that's why we're emphasizing all the different drivers of uncertainty in the NII outlook. Yes. Betsy, we really don't have any new information there, right? I mean I think, clearly, if you go back like a year, we were maybe a little bit more optimistic that it might be across all the different levers and all the different pieces of it closer to capital neutral. I think now it feels like it's likely to be worse than that. Hopefully, it's not too much worse than that. And I would just remind you that there are a lot of different levers. So in any -- when the NPR comes, that's only going to be part of it. There's going to be other pieces, the holistic review, and it's going to take a lot of time to phase in, and we're going to have time to adjust. So, we'll know when we know. Yes, Glenn, and sure, we really haven't seen big changes to speak of. And I do think it's just worth saying, I think you're sort of hinting at this a little bit when you talk about the behavior of corporates. But when we talk about responses to the recent events through the lens of uninsured deposits, that's obviously very different if you're talking about large balances of nonoperating uninsured deposits from financial institutions or de facto financial institutions versus normal large corporate operating balances which is of course, like core banking business for all of us. Yes. So the story there is kind of the same story we've been talking about for a while. It's just a matter of degree. So we had revolving balances obviously drop a lot during the pandemic period, and then we talked about having them recover in absolute dollar terms to the same level as we had pre-pandemic. So I think happened last quarter. And then the remaining narrative is just the further normalization of the revolve per account because we also have seen some account growth, and that continues to happen. And so -- and yes, we also, to Mike's question earlier, we're seeing higher yield there as well, so. And on your question of whether it's good or bad, obviously, there is a point at which the consumers have too much leverage. We don't see that yet, so."

            "name": "Jamie Dimon",
            "content": "Well, I think you already kind of complete with answering your own question there. Look, we're hoping that everyone just takes a deep breath and looks at what happened, and the breadth and depth of regulations already in place. Obviously, when something happens like this, you should adjust, think about it. So I think down the road, there may be some limitations on held to maturity, maybe more TLAC for certain type size banks and more scrutiny and history exposure, stuff like that. But it doesn't have to be a revamp of the whole system. It's just recalibrating things the right way. I think it should be done knowing what you want the outcome to be. The outcome you should want is very strong community and regional banks. And certain actions are taking, which are drastic, it could actually make them weaker. So, that's all it is. We do expect higher capital from Basel IV effectively. And obviously, there's going to be an FDIC assessment. That will be what it is. Well, we've told you -- I think we've told you that we're kind of penciled in $12 billion for this year. Obviously, capital is more than that, but -- and we did a little bit of buyback this quarter. We're going to wait and see. We don't mind keeping our powder dry. And you've seen us do that with investment portfolios, and we're also willing to do with capital. Well, I would -- first of all, I don't quite believe it. So, the rate curve -- the Fed has the rate curve -- the forward short-term rate curve, almost 1% higher than what the market has. So one of the things you got to always prepare for is it could be anything. We don't know what the rate curve is going to be in the year. And so, we're quite cautious in that and quite thoughtful about that. Obviously, the short-term read is higher recessionary risk, but -- and then inflation coming down. So I think inflation will come down a little bit. It could easily be stickier than people think, and therefore, the rate curve will have to go up a little bit. I wouldn't use the word credit crunch, if I were you. Obviously, there's going to be a little bit of tightening. And most of that will be around certain real estate things. You've heard it from real estate investors already. So I just look at that as a kind of a thumb on the scale. It just makes the finance conditions will be a little bit tighter, increases the odds of a recession. That's what that is. It's not like a credit crunch. It's a great question. Jeremy answers it. Probably to add, I wouldn't -- there is -- I would say, category, there's no pricing power that the bigger banks have. Because if you look at the pricing, and we look at pricing sheets all the time, every bank is in a slightly different position, and every bank is competing in 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, savings rates. And then you have the online banks, you got treasury bills, you got money market funds. There's no pricing power for the bank, but obviously, we'll have different franchises as well as slightly different position. We say very modestly, but we look at that all the time. Regular corporate credits. I'd rather not get into too much detail... Gerard, sorry. Thanks. Just to add also, housing is in short supply in America. So, it's not massively oversupplied like you saw in 2008. Yes. So, I'd like to answer that. So, there is a risk of higher rates for longer. And don't just think of just the Fed funds rate because I think you should -- for our planning, I'd be thinking more about, it could be 6 and don't -- and then think about the 5- and 10-year rate, which could be 5. And I think if those things happen, I'm not saying they're going to happen. I just think people should prepare for them. They saw what just happened when rates went up beyond people's expectations. You had the guilt problem in London. You had some of the banks here. People need to be prepared for the potential of higher rates for longer. If and when that happens, it will address problems in the economy for those who are too exposed to floating rates or those who are too exposed to refi risk. Those exposures will be in multiple parts of the economy. So now that -- I say to all of our clients, now would be the time to fix it. Do not put yourself in a position where that risk is excessive for your company, your business, your investment pools, et cetera. That's answer number one. Number two is it will not come back to JPMorgan. Okay? While we do provide credit to what you call shadow banks, it is very -- we think it's very, very secure. That does not mean it won't come back to other credit providers. Well, there's two really different questions. So, we've been quite cautious on interest rates for quite a while, and how we invest in our portfolio, what our expectations are, our stress testing. The stress test -- the CCAR stress test, as you know, had rates going down. I always looked at rates going up and being prepared to -- whether or not anything is going to happen. So, we've been quite conservative ourselves. And we don't mind continuing to do that because I remind people that having excess capital, you haven't lost it. It's kind of earnings in store. You get to deploy it later and maybe at a more opportune time when the time comes. And we're not -- look, we'd like to help the system when it needs to help if we can reasonably. And we're not the only ones. You saw a lot of banks do that. And I was proud of them. I was proud of them. I think all of us did the right thing, whether ultimately, it works out or not, you could second guess that when it happens. But the fact is I think people want to help the system. And this whole banking theme is bad for banks. And I knew that the second I saw the headline. And you have Credit Suisse. We want healthy community banks. We want healthy regional banks. We want to help them get through this. We have -- remember, Mike, as you pointed out, we have the best financial system the world has ever seen. That does not mean it won't have problems. It doesn't mean there shouldn't be changes made, but I think it's reasonable for people to help each other in times of need. And we all did that during -- all of us did that during COVID. All of us did that -- if you could, those you could did it during the great financial crisis, and I would expect people do that going forward. So it's just -- the number of banks off-sites, you can count in your hands in terms of like too much interest rate exposure, too much ATM, too much uninsured deposits. And so there may be additional bank deposits -- I mean, bank failure, something like that, which we don't know. But you're going to see next week regional banks have pretty good numbers. A lot of people are going to have -- can take actions to remediate some of the issues they may have going forward. You've already seen things calm down quite a bit, particularly in deposit flows. Warren Buffett was on TV talking about that he would bet $1 million, I don't know if you saw that, that no depositor will lose money in America. [Indiscernible] own money, of course you know, he is a very bright man. So, this crisis is not away. It will pass. And the one thing I pointed out is that when I answered the question just before about interest rates, people need to be prepared. They shouldn't pray that they don't go up. They should prepare for them going up. And if it doesn't happen, serendipity. Yes, you're back now. You're back. Go ahead, Jeremy. And I'll... Yes. So, I would just add, so next quarter, we kind of know already, two quarters out, we know a little bit less, three quarters out, we know a little bit less, and \u201824, we know very little. That number, you can imagine, this is a little inside baseball now, the number that we're talking about for 2024 is not based upon an implied curve. It's based upon us looking at multiple potential scenarios, leveling them kind of out and saying this is kind of a range. And you're absolutely correct. You could have an environment of higher for longer that might be better than that. But remember, higher for longer comes with a lot of other things attached to it, like maybe a recession, taxation, lower volume. So I wouldn't look at that as higher flows a positive. It might be a slight positive in that line. It probably be negative in other lines. Yes. No, we're not on pause now. We're doing a little bit now. We obviously have a lot of excess capital. We also like to buy our stock when it's cheap, not just when it's available. And we're also peering ahead, looking at those a little bit of storm cloud, so we're going to be kind of cautious. So we're going to make this decision every day. We also don't like to tell the market what we're doing, just so you know. I just remember, they were supposed to be positive in there about how they looked at banks relative to the global economy, which are getting smaller and G-SIB is supposed to be adjusted for that. So it may vary. We're expecting to go up, but there are a lot of reasons why it shouldn't go up. And JPMorgan, it's not -- there's so much capital. I mean, so you can't look at JPMorgan and say, well it's a capital issue. And even the banks, by the way, when you look at it -- even though in some of the banks who have plenty of capital, the issue wasn't capital. It was other things. And so I'm just hoping regulators are very thoughtful. And the other thing is they should [ph] decide what they want on the banking at this point. Because I made it clear, I can look at the banking system today and say that no bank should keep a loan, if possible. That's how much capital is now being required for loans. The loans.... Yes, because the market is pricing -- it holds -- the market would take loans at much lower capital ratios than banks are being forced to hold for them. I'm talking about just loans only. And so that's why you're seeing a lot of capital go to -- I mean a lot of the credit go to nonbanks and dramatically, by the way, rapidly and dramatically. And so if you're a regulator, if you look at it and saying, do I want that? Is that a good thing for the system? If you believe it's a good thing for the system, raise the capital, more credit will go out of the system. That's fine. If that's what they want, that's fine. But they should do it with a forethought, not accidentally. Yes. When you saw it in Commercial Banking, Payments, Investment Banking and custody, you did see money move -- what I would call, excess cash has moved out. So they have options. What I would call more like operational cash, I think even if small companies, middle market companies, et cetera, that tends to be fairly sticky because you have your loans there, you have your money there. You get more and more competitive in rates. And that's why I think you see a lot of regional banks. They've got sticky middle market deposits. If I lent you $30 million and you have $10 million, you're probably going to be leaving in my bank. And they also are more competitive on the rate for that. So I think you shouldn't be looking at deposits like one class. They just -- there's a whole bunch of different types and analytically, you go through each one and try to figure out what the stickiness is and what the stickiness is and et cetera. And so -- but I think they've already -- as the Fed has raised rates, you've already seen -- that's the reason we expected outflows, both from consumers and corporate customers. We've got our smartest people figure out every angle to reduce capital requirements for JPMorgan. That's the difference. And we've been doing it, but there are securitizations, there are partnerships. You've seen a lot of the private equity do the life insurance companies. And I expect that we're going to come up with a whole bunch of different things over time. And we'll shed certain assets, too. It's normalization. That's a good thing for us. That will be every quarter for the rest of our lives. So we find rich and we buy what we think is dear. Excellent. Well, thank you very much."

Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. The presentation is available on JPMorgan Chase's website. Please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward-looking statements. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.\nJeremy Barnum: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Starting on page one, the firm reported net income of $12.9 billion, EPS of $4.37 and revenue of $43.3 billion with an ROTCE of 19%. Touching on a couple of highlights. In CCB, we ranked number one in retail deposit share for the fourth straight year. In CIB, both IB fees and markets revenue were notably up year-on-year reflecting strength across the franchise. In AWM, we had record quarterly revenues and record long-term flows. Now turning to page two for the firm wide results. The firm reported revenue of $43.3 billion, up $2.6 billion or 6% year-on-year. NII ex-markets was up $274 million or 1%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securities reinvestment, higher revolving balances in card and higher wholesale deposit balances, predominantly offset by lower deposit balances in banking and wealth management and deposit margin compression. NIR ex-markets was up $1.8 billion or 17%, but excluding the prior year's net investment securities losses, it was up 10% on higher asset management and investment banking fees and markets revenue was up $535 million or 8% year-on-year. Expenses of $22.6 billion were up $808 million or 4% year-on-year, driven by compensation including revenue related compensation and growth in employees, partially offset by lower legal expense. And credit costs were $3.1 billion, reflecting net charge offs of $2.1 billion and a net reserve bill of $1 billion, which included $882 million in consumer, primarily in card and $144 million in wholesale. Net charge offs were up $590 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by card. On to balance sheet and capital on page three. We ended the quarter with the CET1 ratio of 15.3% flat versus the prior quarter as net income and OCI gains were offset by capital distributions and higher RWA. This quarter's RWA reflects higher lending activity, as well as higher client activity and market moves on the trading side. We added $6 billion of net common share repurchases this quarter, which in part reflects the deployment of the proceeds from the share from the sale of Visa shares as we have previously mentioned. Now let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on page four. CCB reported net income of $4 billion on revenue of $17.8 billion, which was down 3% year-on-year. In Banking and Wealth Management, revenue was down 11% year-on-year, reflecting deposit margin compression and lower deposits partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenue. Average deposits were down 8% year-on-year and 2% sequentially. We are seeing a slowdown in customer yield seeking activity including CD volumes and expect deposits to be relatively flat for the remainder of the year. Client investment assets were up 21% year-on-year, driven by market performance and we continue to see strong referrals of new wealth management clients from our branch network. In home lending, revenue was up 3% year-on-year driven by higher NII partially offset by lower servicing and production revenue. Turning to Card Services and Auto. Revenue was up 11% year-on-year, driven by higher card NII on higher revolving balances. Card outstandings were up 11% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve. And in Auto, originations were $10 billion, down 2%, while maintaining strong margins and high quality credit. Expenses of $9.6 billion were up 5% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher field and technology compensation, as well as growth in marketing. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.8 billion driven by card and reflected net charge offs of $1.9 billion, up $520 million year-on-year and a net reserve build of $876 million predominantly from higher revolving balances. Next the Commercial and Investment Bank on page five. The CIB reported net income of $5.7 billion on revenue of $17 billion. IB fees were up 31% year-on-year and we ranked number one with year-to-date wallet share of 9.1%. In advisory, fees were up 10% benefiting from the closing of a few large deals. Underwriting fees were up meaningfully with debt up 56% and equity up 26%, primarily driven by favorable market conditions. In light of the positive momentum throughout the year, we're optimistic about our pipeline, but the M&A regulatory environment and geopolitical situation are continued sources of uncertainty. Payments revenue was $4.4 billion, up 4% year-on-year, driven by fee growth and higher deposit balances, largely offset by margin compression. Moving to markets, total revenue was $7.2 billion, up 8% year-on-year. Fixed income was flat reflecting outperformance in currencies and emerging markets and lower revenue and rates. Equities was up 27%, reflecting strong performance across regions largely driven by a supportive trading environment in the U.S. and increased late quarter activity in Asia. Securities Services revenue was $1.3 billion, up 9% year-on-year largely driven by fee growth on higher market levels and volumes. Expenses of $8.8 billion were down 1% year-on-year with lower legal expense predominantly offset by higher revenue related compensation, and growth in-place, as well as higher technology spend. Average banking and payments loans were down 2% year-on-year and down 1% sequentially. In the middle market and large corporate client segments, we continue to see softness in both new loan demand and revolver utilization in part due to clients' access to receptive capital markets. In multifamily, while we are seeing encouraging signs in loan originations as long term rates fall, we expect overall growth to remain muted in the near-term as originations are offset by payoff activity. Average client deposits were up 7% year-on-year and 3% sequentially, primarily driven by growth from large corporates in payments and security services. Finally, credit costs were $316 million, driven by higher net lending activity, including in markets and downgrades, partially offset by improved macroeconomic variables. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page six. Asset and wealth management reported net income of $1.4 billion with pre-tax margin of 33%. For the quarter, revenue of $5.4 billion was up 9% year-on-year, driven by growth and management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows, investment valuation gains, compared to losses in the prior year, and higher brokerage activity, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $3.6 billion or up 16% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, as well as higher distribution fees and legal expense. For the quarter, long-term net inflows were $72 billion, led by fixed income inequities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $34 billion. AUM of $3.9 trillion and client assets of $5.7 trillion were both up 23%, driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows. And finally, loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter, and deposits were up 4% quarter-on-quarter. Turning to corporate on page seven. Corporate reported net income of $1.8 billion. Revenue was $3.1 billion, up $1.5 billion year-on-year. NII was $2.9 billion, up $932 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securities reinvestment, including from prior quarters. NIR was a net gain of $155 million, compared with a net loss of $425 million in the prior year, predominantly driven by lower net investment securities losses this quarter. Expenses of $589 million were down $107 million year-on-year. To finish up, let's turn to the outlook on page eight. We now expect 2024 NII ex-markets to be approximately $91.5 billion and total NII to be approximately $92.5 billion. Our outlook for adjusted expense is now about $91.5 billion. And given where we are in the year, we included on the page the implied fourth quarter guidance for NII and adjusted expense. And note that the NII numbers imply about $800 million of markets NII in the fourth quarter. On credit, we continue to expect the 2024 Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 3.4%. So to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating performance. As we look ahead to the next few quarters, we expect results will be somewhat challenged as normalization continues. But we remain upbeat and focused on executing in order to continue delivering excellent returns through the cycle. And with that, let's open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. Please stand by. Our first question will come from the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed.\nJim Mitchell: Hey, good morning. So, Jeremy, as you highlighted, full-year NII guidance implies a sizable drop in Q4 NII ex-markets, about 6%. So can you just maybe discuss what are the largest drivers of the sequential decline, including any initial thoughts on deposit behavior and pricing since the 50 basis point cut? And since it's related, I'll just throw out my follow-up question. I realize the forward curve is moving around a lot, but since Dan brought it up a month ago, can you frame how you're thinking about the NII trajectory for \u201825? Thanks.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, sure, Jim. I'll try to answer both questions together, the best of my ability. So as we sit here today, the biggest single driver is of the sequential declines is in fact, that we're expecting, is in fact the yield curve. So that yield curve has changed a little bit since Daniel made his comments at the conference earlier in the quarter, but not that significantly. In terms of deposit balances, which is obviously another important factor here in light of the starting the cutting cycle. It feels to us like right now, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks for consumer, we're pretty much in the trough right now as we speak. When you look at yield seeking behavior, that has come down quite a bit. So that's no longer as much of a headwind all else being equal. And then if you look at checking account balances, those have been pretty stable for some time, which we see as an indication that consumers are kind of done spending another cash buffers. So that's kind of supportive for consumer deposit balances. And in that context, the other relevant point is the CD mix, where with the rate cuts coming, we expect CD balances to price down with pretty high betas and probably the CD mix actually peaking around now. And then as you move to wholesale, we've actually already been seeing a little bit of growth there. And when you combine that with the sort of increasing view that many people in the market have that it's likely that the end of Q2 will be announced sometime soon, that's also a little bit supportive for deposit balances. So maybe I'll, well I guess then you also asked me a little bit about next year. So I guess one thing to say, right, is that we did have a sequential increase in NII this quarter. And as you may recall at Investor Day, I said that there was some chance that we would see sequential increases followed by sequential declines and that people should avoid kind of drawing the conclusion that we'd hit the trough when that happened. So that's essentially exactly what we're seeing now. But from where we sit now, given the yield curve, assuming the yield curve materializes, obviously, we do see a pretty clear picture of sequential declines at NII ex-markets. But the trough may be happening sometime in the middle of next year, at which point the combination of balances, card revolve growth, and other factors can return us to sequential growth. Obviously, we're guessing it's pretty far out in the future, and we'll give you formal guidance on all this stuff next quarter, but I think that gives you, you know, a bit of a framework to work with.\nJim Mitchell: All right. Thanks a lot.\nJeremy Barnum: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.\nSteven Chubak: Hi, good morning. So Jeremy. Hi, how are you? So I did want to ask on expenses just in light of some of the comments that Daniel had made recently, just noting that contentious expense forecast for next year looked a little bit too light. I believe at the time it was just below $94 billion. If we adjust for the one-timers this year, that would suggest a core expense base that's just below $90 billion. So a pretty healthy step up in expenses. I know you've always had a strong commitment and discipline around investment. Just want to better understand where those incremental dollars are being deployed and just which investments are being prioritized in particular looking out to next year?\nJeremy Barnum: Sure. So, good question and I agree with your numbers. I agree with the way you've normalized this year for the one-time type of significant items, and also where the consensus was when Daniel made his comments. And while we're at it, I would also just remind you on the NII comments at the time, the consensus for this year was $91.5 billion, and for next year it was $90 billion. So that was implying at the time a sequential decline of $1.5 billion. And it was because we thought that decline wasn't big enough that we made the comments that we made. So I'm happy to expand more on that. But anyway, to expenses, yes, so if you start for the sake of argument with a base of $90 billion, obviously inflation is normalizing and obviously we're always trying to generate efficiencies to offset inflation. But, you know, that having been said, if you assume 3% for the sake of argument on that base, that's a few billion dollars right out of the gates that we're working against, so that's one thing. The other thing is that we have continued to execute on our growth strategies this year, so there's a not insignificant amount of annualization. You can't quite see that in the fourth quarter numbers, because of the seasonality of incentive comp, but if you were to strip that out, you would see probably some sequential increases and so there's some manualization as an additional headwind. The other thing that's worth noting is that we do expect fees and volume-related businesses to grow next year. And so all else being equal, that would come with a higher expense loading. So when you assemble all those, that goes a long way to explain why sort of that consensus number that is slightly below $94 billion just seemed light. In terms of priorities and investments, really nothing has changed. Like the strategy hasn't changed. The strategy hasn't changed and the plans haven't changed and we're just kind of executing with the same long-term perspective that we've always had. I would note that relative to NII, obviously we're in the third quarter now and not the fourth quarter. In the old days, we did used to give you the guidance until investor day in late February. So we will give you formal expense guidance next quarter for both well for expenses and NII next quarter, but especially on expenses we are in the middle of the budget cycle right now so we probably have a little less visibility there than we do at the margin on the NII.\nJamie Dimon: And can you just give you a view of expense a little bit? You call expenses very often. I call investments. And if you actually go back to investor day, that you'll see that we're adding private bankers in asset wealth management. We're adding ETF in asset wealth management. We're adding private bankers in international private banking. We're growing chase wealth management. We've added some branches across the United States of America. We think there are huge opportunities in the innovation economy that takes bankers and certain technologies, stuff like that. Our goal is to gain share, and everything we do, we get really good returns on it. So I look at that, these are opportunities for us. These are not expenses that we have to actually punish ourself on. And we do get, and we show you kind of extensively, you know, the cost and productivity on various things. And also AI is going to go up a little bit. And I would put that as a category that's going to generate great stuff over time.\nSteven Chubak: No, thank you both for the color. Just a quick follow-up from me just drilling down into NII. It appears you redeployed a fair amount of cash or excess reserves at the Fed into securities. We saw the yield expand, which was encouraging despite the pressure at both the long end and SOFR contraction in the corridor. I was hoping you could just speak to your appetite to extend duration in this environment? I know that you've had some aversion to that in the past, but do you anticipate redeploying additional access liquidity just amid the expectation for deeper rate cuts?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, sure. So on extending duration, Steve, you know this obviously, but I just think it's important to say that all SQL, extending duration doesn't change expected NII if you assume that the policy rate follows the forwards, right? So point one. Point two, I think the curve remains inverted and so even if you don't believe that the policy rate follows the forwards, extending right now is actually a headwind to short-term NII. Like, that's not, that wouldn't be a consideration for us either way, but I just think that's worth saying for the broader audience, it's quite different from the situation that you have with the numbers.\nJamie Dimon: More than 6%. So like\u2026\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. Now, so when we think about the question of extending duration and really managing duration right now, a couple of things to say. So obviously a lot of different versions of duration, but one number that we disclose is the EAR. When the 10-Q comes out, you'll see that that number is a little bit lower. It'll come down from 2.8 to about 2.1 if our current estimates are correct. That's for a number of reasons, some of which are passive, but some of those are active choices to extend duration a little bit. And in the end, the choice to manage and extend duration is really about balancing the volatility of NII against protecting the company from extreme scenarios on either side. And so right now, if we wanted to expand as a result of different factors, we certainly could. We have the capacity inside the portfolio. But, you know, for now, we're comfortable with where we are.\nJamie Dimon: And the one thing I can assure you is the forward curve will not be the same forward curve in six months.\nSteven Chubak: Well said. Well, thank you so much for taking my questions.\nJeremy Barnum: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. You may proceed.\nErika Najarian: My first question, and thank you very much for answering all the NII questions so far, Jeremy, is just I guess another follow-up. As you can imagine, once Daniel said what he said on stage in September, everyone's trying to figure out the over-under for net interest income next year? So maybe a two-part first question. The second being inspired by what Jamie just said number one, you know, NII is expected to be down 6% sequentially in fourth quarter. I think year-over-year in \u201825, consensus has it down 4% from your new level. So it sounds like consensus still has room to come down and based on the forward curve, Jeremy, it could be a little bit worse year-over-year than the fourth quarter sequential rate. But that being said, as Jamie noted, like we have no idea what the curve is going to look like, right? I mean, it's gyrated so much. And so, as we think about the curve, is it better for JPMorgan to have more cuts in the short end, but steepness or less cuts but a little bit of a flatter curve?\nJeremy Barnum: Right, okay. You threw a curveball at the end there, Erika. I wasn't expecting that to be the end of your question. But let me answer the beginning of your question and then I'll also answer the end of your question. So we see the current 2025 consensus for NII ex-markets to be currently at 87%, which is obviously lower than it was at the conference earlier in the quarter. So we're happy to see that move a little bit more in line to us. That still looks a little toppy, but it's definitely in the ballpark. Now, that consists of, I already mentioned previously, that we sort of expect the NII trough sometime in the middle of the year. So you can kind of assemble the parts. You've got a fourth quarter run rate. You've got some sequential declines. You've got a trough in the middle of the year, and you've got a rough ballpark for the full-year. So you can imagine that the trough probably is a little lower than those numbers and then to the extent that growth revolves, resumed in the back half of the year, both deposit balances and the ongoing tailwind of card revolve over that tailwind will be a little bit less than you might have otherwise thought I mean sorry a little bit less than it was this year, but still a tailwind. You know obviously the mix of those things will play out in different ways and as you point out who knows what the yield curve will wind up doing. But on our current assumptions, on the current yield curve, and remembering that we're in the third quarter now, so we're doing this kind of early, that's what we think. Now\u2026\nJamie Dimon: Could I just say some -- next time, we should give you the number. I don't want to spend all time in these calls like going through what they're guessing what NII is going to be next year. And I just -- can I just also point out that NII, all things being equal, is a number, but all things are never equal. And the yield curve -- if you have a recession, the effect of the yield curve will be very different than you have continued growth. And there are decisions that are made non-stop by us and the thing that happened in the marketplace. And I just -- I think we spend too much time on just this relevancy. So you get a model -- a number in your model. And so it's going to be less than 87% next year, probably not a lot, we don't know and we don't know the environment.\nJeremy Barnum: Good. Okay. Now, to your question about the EAR. So a few things to say in there. So as I already mentioned, we -- when that comes out, it will show a number of around $2.1 billion. A very important thing to say is, as you know, the experience of this rate cycle has been that our empirical EAR is meaningfully higher than our modeled EAR, which is what we disclosed. And the main reason for that is that retail deposit betas are -- have -- in actuality, even lower than the modeled deposit beta. So as a starting point, you have to kind of adjust that EAR number to be bigger than the reported number for those and a few other reasons actually, there's some nuances around how the dollar, non-dollar sensitivity interact. And then there's your question, which is a little bit about the front end versus the back end. So what you see is that actually the front end EAR has gotten smaller and most of the EAR is now in the back end. So it's definitely the case that, all else being equal, a steeper curve is better for us. But I think what I would also say is that this kind of empirical versus theoretical adjustment is disproportionately in the front end. So therefore, in order to answer your question, I would say, yes we want a steeper curve, but having the Fed cut more than what's currently in the yield curve is definitely at the margin from the context of next year's numbers, a headwind -- would be a headwind for us. We remain asset-sensitive to Fed cuts.\nErika Najarian: And if I can ask my second question, and Jamie, I completely understand your frustration. And to be fair, your long-term shareholders really don't care about whether it's 87% or 85%, right? They care about your return on equity. To that end, I mean, it's insane how much capital you generate each quarter, 72 basis points this quarter. And so beyond the standard boilerplate questions you're going to get on buyback and organic growth, yada, yada, dividend increases, how should we think about JPMorgan deploying this capital? I mean, the world is generally your oyster, right? You're dominant already and you could use this capital to further enhance your business. And again, beyond that boilerplate conversation that you always get every quarter, how should your shareholders think about how you're thinking about the opportunities to deploy this capital?\nJamie Dimon: Okay. So first of all, when you say, dominant I'd be very careful on that. We've got some very tough competition. Different, different countries, different around the world, fintech companies, direct lenders and MSP, I want to give you a very specific comment on direct lending and stuff like that. So our goal is always to serve our clients. And when I talk about some of these expenses, that is a deployment of capital. And it's a deployment in a different way because you open branches, you initially experience an expense, but down the road, you need capital supports, the deposits and same for the innovation economy, same for private bankers, et cetera. If you look at it roughly, we have about a minimum $30 billion of excess capital. And for me, it's not burning a hole in my pocket. I look at it as you own the whole company and you can't properly deploy it now is perfectly reasonable to wait. And I've been quite clear that I think things -- the future could be quite turbulent and asset prices in my view and you -- in life, you've got to take a view sometimes, are inflated. I don't know if they're extremely inflated or a little bit, but I prefer to wait. We will be able to deploy it. Our shareholders will be very well-served by just waiting. And same thing with deploying capital, we can buy -- we can go buy $100 billion, 6% mortgages, increase our net income by a couple of billion tomorrow. We don't make decisions like that. The most important thing we do is serve our clients well, build the technology and do things like that. And we also know what the real excess capital is yet. So we're a little patient. We're going to be a little patient and wait, and it will be fine. And so that's where we are and that's not going to change. And if it changes, we'll let you know, right? And we do talk to a lot of shareholders and they understand buying stock back at more than two times tangible book value is not necessarily the best thing to do, because we think we'll have better opportunities to redeploy it or to buy back at cheaper prices at one point. Markets do not stay high forever.\nErika Najarian: Thank you.\nJamie Dimon: And one last thing. Cash is a very valuable asset sometimes in a turbulent world. And you see my friend Warren Buffett stockpiling cash right now. I mean, people should be a little more thoughtful about how we're trying to navigate in this world and grow for the long-term for our company.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. You may proceed.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thanks very much. So glad Jamie didn't say what he's about to say because that's the answer to this question. So we've seen a couple more banks entering partnerships with alternative managers. We've seen limited loan growth for a few years now, market-related also. Limited flows into fixed income funds, yet plenty of growth in private credit in general. And you're one of the best asset managers on the planet, but in my view, less dominant in all things private credit. So maybe you could talk about what things you're working on and why that's too narrow, the view of your ability to serve all parts of clients' lending needs, not just the public markets and public lending side. Thanks.\nJamie Dimon: Yes. So let me take time to cover this one because obviously, it is very -- become very important. People are talking about how they're growing and partnering, and things like that. And so first and foremost -- I'm going to talk about very strategic and then very tactical. I think they're both important. First and foremost, we are here to give our clients an agnostic view of the world and what the best products and services are for them. Therefore, when a client comes in, we will offer them both direct lending on ourselves and syndicated lending or other specialized kind of lending. And they all have pluses and minuses. Direct lending could be done faster, maybe simpler covenants, unit tranche. It is more expensive and you're seeing little things go back and forth between syndicated lending and direct lending, but we're going to offer the clients basically what's in their best interest and tell them what those products are across the things. We mentioned before in the past that we allocated $10 billion of capital to make direct loans. We've actually deployed a lot of capital, some of this already been paid-off, some are done. So we are going to do it directly and we are going at $10 billion, could be $20 million or $30 billion, not limited today. I will say today we're extending -- we will do $500 million, we will do $1 billion, we will do more billion, we'll do it sole-handed or do it with partners. Very importantly, we are not going to allocate ourselves to one partner. So we have -- and I think we've announced a bunch of co-lenders, but that just creates more flexibility and more size. We're not going to use that flexibility to slow it down, have to get permission for everybody because like I said, JPMorgan could underwrite it and own it like a bridge loan and syndicate it after the fact. So you could -- and we're going to use our own risk measures and stuff like that. Again, all in the service of the client and making sure what we're offering them are the best thing. And we're going to different strategy. We're not going to tie ourselves exclusively to one capital provider. I think that would limit what we could offer our clients. Probably we could be more price-competitive. We can do some of the very specific thing and not the solution that fits the third-party capital provider. That's our strategy. We're going to be there, we're going to do it. And we're going to do it in spite of the fact there's capital arbitrage taking place. So if you look at the arbitrage today, where the bank has to hold for things, with the insurance guys, they are dramatically different. That's a disadvantage, but we've had those disadvantages in other business for a long time. We are going to do what's right for the client. Remember, when we do business with the client, we also get other revenues often. So it isn't just the loan, we look at the whole relationship. So we're quite comfortable we can compete. I just announced much bigger lending platforms and sizes and stuff like that. So I hope if any of the press is on, they heard this too.\nGlenn Schorr: All right, thanks for all that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nGerard Cassidy: Good morning, Jeremy, and good morning, Jamie. Jeremy when you guys look at your current capital ratios, they're obviously very healthy. Can you guys give us some color on the new Basel III? We don't know what the specifics are, but as Vice Chair Barr touched on some of the specifics, it looks like capital requirements for yourself and your peers will come down a fair amount from the original proposal. How are you guys thinking about that? Do you have any insights on how much it may fall from the original proposal to where you are today?\nJamie Dimon: Yes. When I said we're at $30 billion excess, that is assuming Barr speech that the $20 billion goes $12 billion wherever it is more. But it will be more than that because there are other factors involved. Now I would just give you the minimum excess capital. In my view, it would be more, but it is what it is, and we'll wait to see the final numbers.\nJeremy Barnum: But Gerard, maybe to give you a bit of color. So yes, obviously, everyone paid a lot of attention to that speech. It was an important speech. But in the end, we actually just really need to see the proposal, because the details matter a lot for this stuff. And so our focus is on hoping to see the proposal, so that we can process the detail and continue advocating as appropriate. I note that you talk about requirements coming down relative to what was originally proposed, which is obviously true, part of the speech. But I do think we need to be a little bit careful not to fall into the trap of saying that, that's like progress just because the original proposal was so dramatically higher than what anyone thought was reasonable. And I would remind you, what you obviously know that before this proposal came out, it was our position strongly felt that our then prevailing capital requirements were, if anything, already more than we needed. So we've got a long way to go here. And I think our position, which Jamie has been articulating very consistently, is that they need to get it right, the right amount of work and importantly, do it holistically. So it's not just RWA, it's RWA, it's G-SIB, it's SCB, it's CCAR. So that's really what we feel strong.\nJamie Dimon: We just want the numbers to be done right and justified. If they had to go up, we'll be fine with that, too. I just think they should be done with real diligence and real thought and a little bit of thought about cost benefit, what it does to the economy, where it pushes lending and things like that. So we're anxiously waiting to see the actual detail because that's what's going to make all the difference.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And then as a follow-up, in view of this excess capital in your comments a moment ago about direct lending, you look at your current cash and marketable securities on a risk-weighted asset basis, you put it in your presentation, of course, $1.5 trillion. Average loan is $1.3 trillion. When everything -- when the dust settles, you know what your capital requirements are. Can you frame now for us, can you -- levering up the excess capital with more loans, is that an asset might be considered over the next two or three years relative to where you are on a mix basis? I know you're going to grow your loans, but I'm talking about the mix.\nJamie Dimon: Absolutely positively not. Loans are an outcome of doing good business. We want to do good business. If it grows our balance sheet, we're fine.\nJeremy Barnum: And I do think, Gerard, it depends a lot on what type of loans you're talking about, right? So I think in the end, as Jamie says, like it's capital, we're going to deploy it ideally to grow the franchise organically. And that could include loans that are almost good loans on a standalone basis, as well as loans that are part of an overall relationship where we're getting other revenue as part of that. So it's the same strategy that we've always had. But I wouldn't think of it as like excess capital to be deployed against a particular product. I would think of it as it's there for a rainy day. Let's hope the environment doesn't deteriorate a lot. But if it does, we'll be ready. And there'll be opportunities hopefully to deploy it against the client franchise or against the stock and if not, we'll return it.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. Appreciate the color and candor as always. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.\nMatt O'Connor: Good morning. So lower rates was supposed to drive a pickup in loan growth and conversion of some of these investment banking pipelines. I mean, obviously, we just had one cut and it's early, but any beginning signs of this in terms of the interest in borrowing more and again, conversion of the banking pipelines?\nJeremy Barnum: I would say, Matt, generally no, frankly, with a couple of minor exceptions. So I think it's probably fair to say that the outperformance late in the quarter in Investment Banking fees was to a meaningful degree, as I mentioned, driven by DCM as well as, to some degree, driven by the acceleration of the closing of some M&A transactions. And I do think that some of that DCM outperformance is in the types of deals that are opportunistic deals that aren't in our pipeline. And those are often driven by treasurers and CFOs sort of seeing improvement in market levels and jumping on those. So it's possible that, that's a little of a consequence of the cuts. But I think I mentioned we did see, for example, a pickup in mortgage applications, tiny bit of pickup in refi and our multi-family lending business, there might be some hints of more activity there. But these cuts were very heavily priced, right? The curve has been inverted for a long time. So to a large degree, this is expected. So I'm not -- it's not obvious to me that you should expect immediate dramatic reactions, and that's not really what we're seeing.\nJamie Dimon: I noticed in the debt markets, rates came down, spreads are quite low and markets are wide open. So it kind of makes sense to people taking advantage of that today. Those conditions may not prevail, ongoing conditions late next year.\nMatt O'Connor: And then specifically in the debit and credit card spend that you guys break out, you had nice growth year-over-year, up 6%, flat Q-Q. I know there's a lot of seasonality 2Q to 3Q. I think last year, it was up about 1%. But are you seeing any kind of changes in the consumer spend, either the mix or some signs of a slowdown later in the quarter? Thank you.\nJeremy Barnum: So I think what there is to say about consumer spend is a little bit boring in a sense, because what's happened is that it's become normal. So meaning -- I mean, I think we're getting to the point where it no longer makes sense to talk about the pandemic. But maybe one last time. One of the things that you had was that heavy rotation into T&E as people did a lot of traveling, and they booked cruises that they hadn't done before, and everyone was going out to dinner a lot, whatever. So you had the big spike in T&E, the big rotation into discretionary spending, and that's now normalized. And you would normally think that rotation out of discretionary into non-discretionary would be a sign of consumers battening down the hatches and getting ready for a much worse environment. But given the levels that it started from, what we see it as is actually like normalization. And inside that data, we're not seeing weakening, for example, in retail spending. So overall, we see the spending patterns as being sort of solid and consistent with the narrative that the consumer is on solid footing and consistent with the strong labor market and the current central case of a kind of new landing scenario economically. But obviously, as we always point out, that's one scenario, and there are many other scenarios.\nMatt O'Connor: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.\nMike Mayo: Hey. Jamie, I think I've seen you comment on government this year more than any other time in your career. And August 2, op-ed, Washington Post, Davos, you're talking about government. I think it was this week or last week on Bloomberg, you're saying bank merger should be allowed. Your bus tour in August, you were asked, which is my question now, under what circumstances would you leave for government service? And your answer then was, I love what I do. We get it. You love what you do, but on what circumstances would you consider government service? It seems like you'd be more likely to go now than in the past just based on the numerous comments that you've made. Is that right, wrong? What's your thinking?\nJamie Dimon: I think it's wrong. I've always been a American patriot. And my country is more important to me then my company, and I think that the government is very important to get this and if you look at the world today, Mike, it is so important that we get things right for the whole geopolitical world. So I'm not just talking about the American economy. So -- and we try to participate in policy at the local level, at the state level, at the federal level, at the international level to try to help -- that's our job. We try to grow economies and things like that. So nothing has changed in my view, in my opinion, or my interest. I just think it's very, very important that we try to help government do a good job.\nMike Mayo: So if you were asked by the next administration to serve the country, would you be open to considering it?\nJamie Dimon: I think the chance of that is almost nil, and I probably I\u2019m not going to do it. But I've always reserved the right, I don't make promise to people. We don't have to. But now, I mean, I love what I do. I intend to be doing what we're doing. I almost guarantee I'll be doing this for a long period of time or at least until the Board kicks me out.\nMike Mayo: Let me take the flip side of that question, for those who are worried about you leaving. The other side of the question is, we're on these calls the last couple of years, you're saying the stock is overvalued. And I think part -- I think that's what you're saying. You're saying the stock market is overvalued, and therefore, all stocks are overvalued. And on the one hand, you highlighted on this call, AI, tech, market share gains, high returns, high capital. So do you think in some way, when you think about the value, your price and your ability to do buybacks, you're thinking more about an old school model for valuing your stock as opposed to a new school model that might put you in the category more tech-oriented firms, especially as it relates to your progress with AI?\nJamie Dimon: Well, listen, you're making a very good point, which is I think we have an exceptional company, exceptional franchises and the price point when you might buy the stock, but I'm not that exuberant about thinking even tech valuations or any valuations will stay at these very inflated values. And so I'm just -- we're just quite patient in that. And I think you're going to have to judge us over time about we've done the right thing enough. And remember, we can always do it. We haven't lost the money. It didn't go away. It's sitting in store. The only time we'll wrong if the stock runs way up, you've got to buy at much higher prices. And I just -- I would be real skeptic about that happening.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Hey, good morning. I guess I just wanted to follow-up. You talked about private credit and the disruption to bank lending. Another area I would appreciate if you can address is we've been hearing a lot about the likes of Jane Street and other market makers potentially disrupting fixed income trading? Is that a real risk? And is there an opportunity for a firm like JPMorgan to actually compete on the private venue side on market making beyond traditional sort of FIC activity?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, Ebrahim, the way I would frame that is not as a risk, but as a reality like we've always emphasized in all of our businesses that we operate in an extremely competitive environment. And that applies to -- and that competitive environment isn't limited to competing against banks or traditional financial institutions. It extends in the consumer space to Fintech\u2019s. And in the market-making space, it obviously increasingly is extending to some of the types of firms that you're referring to. Now those firms are many cases, also clients. And that's the same type of dynamic that you see, for example, in the private credit space that we've discussed before. So there's no question that the ecosystem is changing. You've got new competitors. You've got changes in market structure, new dynamics. And as with any business, we are innovating and adjusting and making sure that we compete in all the traditional ways and all the new ways. Of course, there are some ways in which being a bank hinders our ability to do that. And one of the arguments that we've made going back to the capital liquidity regulations is that when you come to the impact on the kind of U.S. capital markets ecosystem, which is the end view of the world, it's worked well in its current contract for a long time where some activities were inside the regulatory perimeter. And there was robust participation from unregulated capital of various sorts. And a world where more and more of that activity gets pushed outside of bank market makers is a meaningful change to that structure that is untested, and it's unclear why you would want that. And we've cautioned that if that's the intent of the regulations, it should be intentional and well-studied. But in the meantime, we're going to adjust and compete to the best of our ability, given the constraints of the current rule set.\nJamie Dimon: Can I just add, so in the private markets, that remains to be seen how that develops. There is a little bit of that, and some people are talking about making more active things in private markets. In some ways, we're well positioned with that, too, because for that, you need liquidity, market making, valuation, buyers and sellers in both sides to create liquidity. So that hasn't developed yet. But we're not -- we may have competition, but we'll be there when the time comes. And the second one is the public markets. You have seen reports about dealer inventories, both corporate and treasuries. And I do think that's hampered a little bit. But again, we do it -- remember for clients, so we are a large market makers in both sides of the markets for clients, both credit and treasuries. And a little different than some of the other people just trading for their own account. And so they're both competition from our standpoint, but we're there. We're going to do it. We're going to deploy more capital we want. And we would even deploy more capital at lower returns if we really had to do it to service clients. So we're very conscious of it with the competition on both sides. As Jeremy said, we sat here 10-years ago, talking about the electronification of the business and can we keep up with that. And so far, we have.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. And just one quick one. And Jeremy, you mentioned QT stopping at some point. We saw the repo sort of market spike at the end of September. Just give us your perspective on the risk of market liquidity shock as we move into year-end. How -- and do you have a view on how quickly Fed should recalibrate QT or actually stop QT to prevent some [Technical Difficulty]? Thanks.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, it's a good question, Ebrahim. But I think you've kind of answered your own question in other words, like the argument out there is that the repo spike that we saw at the end of this quarter was an indication that maybe the market is approaching that lowest comfortable level of reserves that's been heavily speculated about and recognizing that, that number is probably higher and driven by the evolution of firms' liquidity requirements as opposed to some of the more traditional measures. And side point is just another reason why it's important to look at the whole frame more holistically when we think about the regulatory response in the events of two springs ago. You don't want those types of hikes, and it raises some questions about why there isn't more readiness to deploy into those types of disruptions, albeit this one was relatively minor. But in any case, when you put all that together, it would seem to add some weight to the notion that maybe QT should be wound down. And that seems to be increasingly the consensus that, that's going to get announced at some point in the fourth quarter. So final point was if you play that view through, it's a residual headwind for a system-wide deposit growth, which gets removed. And that's one of the reasons that we feel that we're probably in the trough of our deposit balances at the level.\nJamie Dimon: Yeah. So I just want to add a couple of policy things here. I'm not actually sure they can actually do that because you have inflationary factors out there, partially driven by QE. And also look at the volatility, it's not a risk to JPMorgan. It's a risk to the system. And what banks have -- I've already mentioned the constrained balance sheet a little bit. So the banks will have trillions of dollars of cash and unable to deploy to the repo markets. And is it a good policy to think that every time that happens because you can do it very safely, fully collateralize all things like that, providing what I call flexible financing in the marketplace that, that happens, the Fed has to step in every time. I think that becomes a policy issue that every time there comes some kind of fluctuation in the market, people panic and the Feds got to stump in and provide stuff. And can they always do that if you have a slightly more inflationary environment going forward? So I think you have to be very thoughtful about this. That's why we do think they should look at calibrating SLR and ECLR and CET1 and all these things, particularly for this. So my view is, it is going to happen again. I can't tell you exactly when, but I'd be -- when, but I'd be surprised if it doesn't happen again.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. Thank you, both.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBetsy Graseck: Hello, hi, good morning.\nJeremy Barnum: Hey, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: Can you hear me? Hello?\nJamie Dimon: Yes, we can hear you. Yes.\nBetsy Graseck: Can you hear me okay?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, we can hear you. Can you hear us?\nBetsy Graseck: Oh, yes. Thank you. So, one for Jeremy, one for Jamie. Jeremy and Jamie, sorry about the NII question I'm going to have, but it is more than half your revenue, so I kind of care about it. But when I'm thinking about the trough and then the buildup, QT ending deposit growth, I mean that's part of the calculation for improvement as we go into 2025, right? I should embed that outlook. Is that right? And that's embedded in how you're thinking about it. I know we don't have a number from you for NII for 2025, but it is in there, right?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. In other words, it goes back to my prior point and to the point that I had in the prepared remarks about the consumer deposit balances in particular that there's a bunch of different offsetting factors right now, right? You've got the yield curve, you've got Card revolve and you've got balances, and balances have been a headwind. We now see it as neutral and they could potentially become a tailwind later in the year. And one of the potential reasons for that is one of the potential tailwind -- one of the potential reasons for that is the potential end of QT, but emphasize the word potential to Jamie's point. You also obviously have a little bit of the fixed asset -- fixed rate asset reprice dynamics starting to flow through a little bit. While we're on NII, just to annoy Jamie a little bit more, I do want to make a point that I didn't get a chance to make previously, which is there is a reason that we emphasized the implied fourth quarter run rate for the Markets NII in the presentation, which is that if you take that and you annualize it, it gives you a launch point run rate, which is significantly higher than what's currently in the consensus and obviously what we've seen this year. And I'll give you the concise version of my usual speech. The changes in Markets NII are almost always bottom-line neutral and offset in NIR. But for the [Technical Difficulty] I'm trying to help you guys with your models, I would just encourage you to recognize what that launch point is, the number of cuts that are in the curve, the fact that, that number has historically and in the recent past been quite liability sensitive. So you can draw your own conclusions about what that should mean. Again, shouldn't change the overall revenue expectation. It's just a balance sheet and income statement geography issue, but just for the sake of helping you tidy up models, I wanted to make that point.\nBetsy Graseck: And so Daniel's comments in September were on NII in total or NII ex-Markets, could you...\nJeremy Barnum: Those were core NII or NII ex. So again, reiterating at the time, the '24 consensus was $91.5 billion, the '25 consensus was $90 billion on NII ex. And our point was that, that number, which remains an asset-sensitive number, indicated an insufficient amount of sequential decline year-on-year. The current consensus as we see it for NII ex-Markets is $87 billion. And as we've noted, that's closer, albeit maybe still a little bit toppy.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. And then one for Jamie. Jamie, we did talk already quite a bit about the capital that you have, capital in store. Just wanted to understand how you're thinking about that opportunity set that's in front of you with regard to using it for potentially portfolio acquisitions. I realize that depositories are not on the docket, but we all know there's portfolios out there that might be looking for a home. And could you give us a sense as to how interested you might be in acquiring assets at this stage?\nJamie Dimon: Yes. So I mean always say, assets acquisitions. I mean, I always want our people to be looking at those things and thinking about those things and being -- but if you listen to what I'm saying about my question about the world, I'm not -- it's hard for me to say that we're going to be in the market to buy credit assets.\nBetsy Graseck: What about...\nJamie Dimon: [Multiple Speakers] Creating credit assets to help clients, that's a whole different matter because when it comes to clients, we earn credit asset spread and we usually have other stuff. That -- if our bankers can deploy capital that way, of course, we want to do more. And our CIO could deploy capital in multiple ways, we would probably do more. And we ask all the time, can we do more in affordable housing? Can we do more in things we're actually quite comfortable? And yes, if we can find ways to deploy capital, we would be happy to do that. But put us in a [Multiple Speakers] stretch.\nBetsy Graseck: I'm just wondering about the private label credit card, for example. Is that something that would help clients?\nJamie Dimon: Almost no chance. But having -- it's very important. Why I say that, I always tell the management team second guess me. I mean, we've done private label. I know what it is. We've been there. I have a lot of issues with it. But is it possible that something is different one day and a different thing? Yeah, it's possible. So I don't want to cut it off. If Marianne Lake says to me, Jamie, you're not thinking clearly, the world's changed, we're going to change. But right now, I would say, no chance.\nBetsy Graseck: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from Saul Martinez with HSBC. Your line is open.\nSaul Martinez: Hey, good morning. I'm not going to ask about a specific NII in '25, but I did want to delve into the -- how to think about your deposit margin in volume dynamics in the CCB over the next few years? You have seen a decent amount of pressure in the deposit margin, 2.6%, down about 30 basis points as deposit balances have come down, so put some pressure on deposit NII. But deposit margins are still well above where they were when rates were at levels that are consistent with where the forward curve is now has been going. So I guess, how do we think about both volumes and margin dynamics if rates do come down, say to level that are consistent with the forward curve? I know the forward curve is likely going to be wrong, but that's the reference point we have. And conversely, volume offsets, you mentioned, Jeremy, the retail deposits becoming a tailwind. I guess how much of a tailwind could they be especially as you are expecting to gain quite a bit of market share in retail deposits? So just give us a sense of sort of the push and pulls of these dynamics that really help drive the deposit -- the value of the deposit franchise.\nJeremy Barnum: Sure. Yes. Thanks for the question, Saul. And I think you've laid out your -- the building blocks there already. Just for simplicity, I'm going to try to answer your question without referring to the disclosed CC deposit margin number just because that number is obviously the combination of the rate paid on the CCB deposits and the internal FTP into that. And that is a complicated thing that evolves as a function of the modeling of the betas and other things. So I think it's actually more helpful to look at this simply from a firm-wide perspective and look at the evolution of the rate paid in the context of the policy rates roughly and just set aside duration management and all those other factors. And I think when you do that, what you see is we've been saying for a while that the deposit margin defined for these purposes is simply the difference between the policy rate and the weighted average rate paid of the consumer deposits was unsustainably high. And that was going to have to correct one way or the other. Either deposits were going to reprice at the product level through checking and savings and/or we were going to see a ton of internal migration, i.e., growth in the CD mix and/or we would see a lower policy rate. So as we sit here right now, of course, we make pricing decisions in the context of market competition at any given moment, looking at what the environment is for deposits. But it -- we have not needed to reprice in order to retain bank relationships, which was also our core strategy. We were never going to chase sort of the hot money at the margin. We've leaned in heavily to CDs and gotten to the current level of CD mix, and that's been a good strategy. And from where we sit now, we now have the margin coming down as a result of the policy rate coming down. It seems that, that puts us in a pretty comfortable position from a pricing perspective. We think the CD mix has probably peaked. Now on the way down, it's not going to go back down to zero where it was at the beginning of the cycle. That's an important thing to realize. So all else equal, that creates a little bit of margin compression. And then through all of that, obviously, a lower yield environment should mean that there's a little bit less outflow from consumer deposits. As I mentioned, we're seeing a lot less yield-seeking behavior. So then when you overlay onto that what you mentioned, which is our long-term share growth in CCB deposits in no small part as a function of the brand strategy and the build-out and the fact that only about a quarter of our top 125 markets in CCB are at that 15% share number. So we believe there's a big opportunity to grow the rest of it and be on track at the type of like average annual share growth of the order of 30 or 40 basis points that we've seen historically, that's how you kind of assemble a tailwind from normalized deposit margin and balance growth in consumer.\nJamie Dimon: Jeremy, correct me if you think I'm wrong. The abnormal time period was in was in race were between 0% and 1% or 2%. Other than that, if you look at -- if you were going to say what are normal deposit margins in the normal banking business, forget people going after really hot money, that happens. It's 2% to 2.5%.\nJeremy Barnum: Absolutely. Agree.\nSaul Martinez: Okay. That's helpful. So it sounds like you're a little bit above that, but there's still some pressure, but you're not dramatically above those levels.\nJamie Dimon: Very good returns in business in Banking & Wealth Management. We're growing market share. And when we build branches and stuff like that, we don't necessarily assume current margins. We look at what could be normal margins over time. We're very comfortable, very nice business for you all.\nJeremy Barnum: Got it. Okay, that's helpful. Thanks a lot. That's all I got.\nJamie Dimon: Thanks, Saul.\nJeremy Barnum: Thanks, everyone. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you all for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time, and have a great rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeremy Barnum",
            "content": "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Starting on page one, the firm reported net income of $12.9 billion, EPS of $4.37 and revenue of $43.3 billion with an ROTCE of 19%. Touching on a couple of highlights. In CCB, we ranked number one in retail deposit share for the fourth straight year. In CIB, both IB fees and markets revenue were notably up year-on-year reflecting strength across the franchise. In AWM, we had record quarterly revenues and record long-term flows. Now turning to page two for the firm wide results. The firm reported revenue of $43.3 billion, up $2.6 billion or 6% year-on-year. NII ex-markets was up $274 million or 1%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securities reinvestment, higher revolving balances in card and higher wholesale deposit balances, predominantly offset by lower deposit balances in banking and wealth management and deposit margin compression. NIR ex-markets was up $1.8 billion or 17%, but excluding the prior year's net investment securities losses, it was up 10% on higher asset management and investment banking fees and markets revenue was up $535 million or 8% year-on-year. Expenses of $22.6 billion were up $808 million or 4% year-on-year, driven by compensation including revenue related compensation and growth in employees, partially offset by lower legal expense. And credit costs were $3.1 billion, reflecting net charge offs of $2.1 billion and a net reserve bill of $1 billion, which included $882 million in consumer, primarily in card and $144 million in wholesale. Net charge offs were up $590 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by card. On to balance sheet and capital on page three. We ended the quarter with the CET1 ratio of 15.3% flat versus the prior quarter as net income and OCI gains were offset by capital distributions and higher RWA. This quarter's RWA reflects higher lending activity, as well as higher client activity and market moves on the trading side. We added $6 billion of net common share repurchases this quarter, which in part reflects the deployment of the proceeds from the share from the sale of Visa shares as we have previously mentioned. Now let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on page four. CCB reported net income of $4 billion on revenue of $17.8 billion, which was down 3% year-on-year. In Banking and Wealth Management, revenue was down 11% year-on-year, reflecting deposit margin compression and lower deposits partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenue. Average deposits were down 8% year-on-year and 2% sequentially. We are seeing a slowdown in customer yield seeking activity including CD volumes and expect deposits to be relatively flat for the remainder of the year. Client investment assets were up 21% year-on-year, driven by market performance and we continue to see strong referrals of new wealth management clients from our branch network. In home lending, revenue was up 3% year-on-year driven by higher NII partially offset by lower servicing and production revenue. Turning to Card Services and Auto. Revenue was up 11% year-on-year, driven by higher card NII on higher revolving balances. Card outstandings were up 11% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve. And in Auto, originations were $10 billion, down 2%, while maintaining strong margins and high quality credit. Expenses of $9.6 billion were up 5% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher field and technology compensation, as well as growth in marketing. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.8 billion driven by card and reflected net charge offs of $1.9 billion, up $520 million year-on-year and a net reserve build of $876 million predominantly from higher revolving balances. Next the Commercial and Investment Bank on page five. The CIB reported net income of $5.7 billion on revenue of $17 billion. IB fees were up 31% year-on-year and we ranked number one with year-to-date wallet share of 9.1%. In advisory, fees were up 10% benefiting from the closing of a few large deals. Underwriting fees were up meaningfully with debt up 56% and equity up 26%, primarily driven by favorable market conditions. In light of the positive momentum throughout the year, we're optimistic about our pipeline, but the M&A regulatory environment and geopolitical situation are continued sources of uncertainty. Payments revenue was $4.4 billion, up 4% year-on-year, driven by fee growth and higher deposit balances, largely offset by margin compression. Moving to markets, total revenue was $7.2 billion, up 8% year-on-year. Fixed income was flat reflecting outperformance in currencies and emerging markets and lower revenue and rates. Equities was up 27%, reflecting strong performance across regions largely driven by a supportive trading environment in the U.S. and increased late quarter activity in Asia. Securities Services revenue was $1.3 billion, up 9% year-on-year largely driven by fee growth on higher market levels and volumes. Expenses of $8.8 billion were down 1% year-on-year with lower legal expense predominantly offset by higher revenue related compensation, and growth in-place, as well as higher technology spend. Average banking and payments loans were down 2% year-on-year and down 1% sequentially. In the middle market and large corporate client segments, we continue to see softness in both new loan demand and revolver utilization in part due to clients' access to receptive capital markets. In multifamily, while we are seeing encouraging signs in loan originations as long term rates fall, we expect overall growth to remain muted in the near-term as originations are offset by payoff activity. Average client deposits were up 7% year-on-year and 3% sequentially, primarily driven by growth from large corporates in payments and security services. Finally, credit costs were $316 million, driven by higher net lending activity, including in markets and downgrades, partially offset by improved macroeconomic variables. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page six. Asset and wealth management reported net income of $1.4 billion with pre-tax margin of 33%. For the quarter, revenue of $5.4 billion was up 9% year-on-year, driven by growth and management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows, investment valuation gains, compared to losses in the prior year, and higher brokerage activity, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $3.6 billion or up 16% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, as well as higher distribution fees and legal expense. For the quarter, long-term net inflows were $72 billion, led by fixed income inequities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $34 billion. AUM of $3.9 trillion and client assets of $5.7 trillion were both up 23%, driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows. And finally, loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter, and deposits were up 4% quarter-on-quarter. Turning to corporate on page seven. Corporate reported net income of $1.8 billion. Revenue was $3.1 billion, up $1.5 billion year-on-year. NII was $2.9 billion, up $932 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securities reinvestment, including from prior quarters. NIR was a net gain of $155 million, compared with a net loss of $425 million in the prior year, predominantly driven by lower net investment securities losses this quarter. Expenses of $589 million were down $107 million year-on-year. To finish up, let's turn to the outlook on page eight. We now expect 2024 NII ex-markets to be approximately $91.5 billion and total NII to be approximately $92.5 billion. Our outlook for adjusted expense is now about $91.5 billion. And given where we are in the year, we included on the page the implied fourth quarter guidance for NII and adjusted expense. And note that the NII numbers imply about $800 million of markets NII in the fourth quarter. On credit, we continue to expect the 2024 Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 3.4%. So to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating performance. As we look ahead to the next few quarters, we expect results will be somewhat challenged as normalization continues. But we remain upbeat and focused on executing in order to continue delivering excellent returns through the cycle. And with that, let's open the line for Q&A. Yes, sure, Jim. I'll try to answer both questions together, the best of my ability. So as we sit here today, the biggest single driver is of the sequential declines is in fact, that we're expecting, is in fact the yield curve. So that yield curve has changed a little bit since Daniel made his comments at the conference earlier in the quarter, but not that significantly. In terms of deposit balances, which is obviously another important factor here in light of the starting the cutting cycle. It feels to us like right now, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks for consumer, we're pretty much in the trough right now as we speak. When you look at yield seeking behavior, that has come down quite a bit. So that's no longer as much of a headwind all else being equal. And then if you look at checking account balances, those have been pretty stable for some time, which we see as an indication that consumers are kind of done spending another cash buffers. So that's kind of supportive for consumer deposit balances. And in that context, the other relevant point is the CD mix, where with the rate cuts coming, we expect CD balances to price down with pretty high betas and probably the CD mix actually peaking around now. And then as you move to wholesale, we've actually already been seeing a little bit of growth there. And when you combine that with the sort of increasing view that many people in the market have that it's likely that the end of Q2 will be announced sometime soon, that's also a little bit supportive for deposit balances. So maybe I'll, well I guess then you also asked me a little bit about next year. So I guess one thing to say, right, is that we did have a sequential increase in NII this quarter. And as you may recall at Investor Day, I said that there was some chance that we would see sequential increases followed by sequential declines and that people should avoid kind of drawing the conclusion that we'd hit the trough when that happened. So that's essentially exactly what we're seeing now. But from where we sit now, given the yield curve, assuming the yield curve materializes, obviously, we do see a pretty clear picture of sequential declines at NII ex-markets. But the trough may be happening sometime in the middle of next year, at which point the combination of balances, card revolve growth, and other factors can return us to sequential growth. Obviously, we're guessing it's pretty far out in the future, and we'll give you formal guidance on all this stuff next quarter, but I think that gives you, you know, a bit of a framework to work with. Thanks. Sure. So, good question and I agree with your numbers. I agree with the way you've normalized this year for the one-time type of significant items, and also where the consensus was when Daniel made his comments. And while we're at it, I would also just remind you on the NII comments at the time, the consensus for this year was $91.5 billion, and for next year it was $90 billion. So that was implying at the time a sequential decline of $1.5 billion. And it was because we thought that decline wasn't big enough that we made the comments that we made. So I'm happy to expand more on that. But anyway, to expenses, yes, so if you start for the sake of argument with a base of $90 billion, obviously inflation is normalizing and obviously we're always trying to generate efficiencies to offset inflation. But, you know, that having been said, if you assume 3% for the sake of argument on that base, that's a few billion dollars right out of the gates that we're working against, so that's one thing. The other thing is that we have continued to execute on our growth strategies this year, so there's a not insignificant amount of annualization. You can't quite see that in the fourth quarter numbers, because of the seasonality of incentive comp, but if you were to strip that out, you would see probably some sequential increases and so there's some manualization as an additional headwind. The other thing that's worth noting is that we do expect fees and volume-related businesses to grow next year. And so all else being equal, that would come with a higher expense loading. So when you assemble all those, that goes a long way to explain why sort of that consensus number that is slightly below $94 billion just seemed light. In terms of priorities and investments, really nothing has changed. Like the strategy hasn't changed. The strategy hasn't changed and the plans haven't changed and we're just kind of executing with the same long-term perspective that we've always had. I would note that relative to NII, obviously we're in the third quarter now and not the fourth quarter. In the old days, we did used to give you the guidance until investor day in late February. So we will give you formal expense guidance next quarter for both well for expenses and NII next quarter, but especially on expenses we are in the middle of the budget cycle right now so we probably have a little less visibility there than we do at the margin on the NII. Yes, sure. So on extending duration, Steve, you know this obviously, but I just think it's important to say that all SQL, extending duration doesn't change expected NII if you assume that the policy rate follows the forwards, right? So point one. Point two, I think the curve remains inverted and so even if you don't believe that the policy rate follows the forwards, extending right now is actually a headwind to short-term NII. Like, that's not, that wouldn't be a consideration for us either way, but I just think that's worth saying for the broader audience, it's quite different from the situation that you have with the numbers. Yes. Now, so when we think about the question of extending duration and really managing duration right now, a couple of things to say. So obviously a lot of different versions of duration, but one number that we disclose is the EAR. When the 10-Q comes out, you'll see that that number is a little bit lower. It'll come down from 2.8 to about 2.1 if our current estimates are correct. That's for a number of reasons, some of which are passive, but some of those are active choices to extend duration a little bit. And in the end, the choice to manage and extend duration is really about balancing the volatility of NII against protecting the company from extreme scenarios on either side. And so right now, if we wanted to expand as a result of different factors, we certainly could. We have the capacity inside the portfolio. But, you know, for now, we're comfortable with where we are. Thanks, Steve. Right, okay. You threw a curveball at the end there, Erika. I wasn't expecting that to be the end of your question. But let me answer the beginning of your question and then I'll also answer the end of your question. So we see the current 2025 consensus for NII ex-markets to be currently at 87%, which is obviously lower than it was at the conference earlier in the quarter. So we're happy to see that move a little bit more in line to us. That still looks a little toppy, but it's definitely in the ballpark. Now, that consists of, I already mentioned previously, that we sort of expect the NII trough sometime in the middle of the year. So you can kind of assemble the parts. You've got a fourth quarter run rate. You've got some sequential declines. You've got a trough in the middle of the year, and you've got a rough ballpark for the full-year. So you can imagine that the trough probably is a little lower than those numbers and then to the extent that growth revolves, resumed in the back half of the year, both deposit balances and the ongoing tailwind of card revolve over that tailwind will be a little bit less than you might have otherwise thought I mean sorry a little bit less than it was this year, but still a tailwind. You know obviously the mix of those things will play out in different ways and as you point out who knows what the yield curve will wind up doing. But on our current assumptions, on the current yield curve, and remembering that we're in the third quarter now, so we're doing this kind of early, that's what we think. Now... Good. Okay. Now, to your question about the EAR. So a few things to say in there. So as I already mentioned, we -- when that comes out, it will show a number of around $2.1 billion. A very important thing to say is, as you know, the experience of this rate cycle has been that our empirical EAR is meaningfully higher than our modeled EAR, which is what we disclosed. And the main reason for that is that retail deposit betas are -- have -- in actuality, even lower than the modeled deposit beta. So as a starting point, you have to kind of adjust that EAR number to be bigger than the reported number for those and a few other reasons actually, there's some nuances around how the dollar, non-dollar sensitivity interact. And then there's your question, which is a little bit about the front end versus the back end. So what you see is that actually the front end EAR has gotten smaller and most of the EAR is now in the back end. So it's definitely the case that, all else being equal, a steeper curve is better for us. But I think what I would also say is that this kind of empirical versus theoretical adjustment is disproportionately in the front end. So therefore, in order to answer your question, I would say, yes we want a steeper curve, but having the Fed cut more than what's currently in the yield curve is definitely at the margin from the context of next year's numbers, a headwind -- would be a headwind for us. We remain asset-sensitive to Fed cuts. But Gerard, maybe to give you a bit of color. So yes, obviously, everyone paid a lot of attention to that speech. It was an important speech. But in the end, we actually just really need to see the proposal, because the details matter a lot for this stuff. And so our focus is on hoping to see the proposal, so that we can process the detail and continue advocating as appropriate. I note that you talk about requirements coming down relative to what was originally proposed, which is obviously true, part of the speech. But I do think we need to be a little bit careful not to fall into the trap of saying that, that's like progress just because the original proposal was so dramatically higher than what anyone thought was reasonable. And I would remind you, what you obviously know that before this proposal came out, it was our position strongly felt that our then prevailing capital requirements were, if anything, already more than we needed. So we've got a long way to go here. And I think our position, which Jamie has been articulating very consistently, is that they need to get it right, the right amount of work and importantly, do it holistically. So it's not just RWA, it's RWA, it's G-SIB, it's SCB, it's CCAR. So that's really what we feel strong. And I do think, Gerard, it depends a lot on what type of loans you're talking about, right? So I think in the end, as Jamie says, like it's capital, we're going to deploy it ideally to grow the franchise organically. And that could include loans that are almost good loans on a standalone basis, as well as loans that are part of an overall relationship where we're getting other revenue as part of that. So it's the same strategy that we've always had. But I wouldn't think of it as like excess capital to be deployed against a particular product. I would think of it as it's there for a rainy day. Let's hope the environment doesn't deteriorate a lot. But if it does, we'll be ready. And there'll be opportunities hopefully to deploy it against the client franchise or against the stock and if not, we'll return it. I would say, Matt, generally no, frankly, with a couple of minor exceptions. So I think it's probably fair to say that the outperformance late in the quarter in Investment Banking fees was to a meaningful degree, as I mentioned, driven by DCM as well as, to some degree, driven by the acceleration of the closing of some M&A transactions. And I do think that some of that DCM outperformance is in the types of deals that are opportunistic deals that aren't in our pipeline. And those are often driven by treasurers and CFOs sort of seeing improvement in market levels and jumping on those. So it's possible that, that's a little of a consequence of the cuts. But I think I mentioned we did see, for example, a pickup in mortgage applications, tiny bit of pickup in refi and our multi-family lending business, there might be some hints of more activity there. But these cuts were very heavily priced, right? The curve has been inverted for a long time. So to a large degree, this is expected. So I'm not -- it's not obvious to me that you should expect immediate dramatic reactions, and that's not really what we're seeing. So I think what there is to say about consumer spend is a little bit boring in a sense, because what's happened is that it's become normal. So meaning -- I mean, I think we're getting to the point where it no longer makes sense to talk about the pandemic. But maybe one last time. One of the things that you had was that heavy rotation into T&E as people did a lot of traveling, and they booked cruises that they hadn't done before, and everyone was going out to dinner a lot, whatever. So you had the big spike in T&E, the big rotation into discretionary spending, and that's now normalized. And you would normally think that rotation out of discretionary into non-discretionary would be a sign of consumers battening down the hatches and getting ready for a much worse environment. But given the levels that it started from, what we see it as is actually like normalization. And inside that data, we're not seeing weakening, for example, in retail spending. So overall, we see the spending patterns as being sort of solid and consistent with the narrative that the consumer is on solid footing and consistent with the strong labor market and the current central case of a kind of new landing scenario economically. But obviously, as we always point out, that's one scenario, and there are many other scenarios. Yes, Ebrahim, the way I would frame that is not as a risk, but as a reality like we've always emphasized in all of our businesses that we operate in an extremely competitive environment. And that applies to -- and that competitive environment isn't limited to competing against banks or traditional financial institutions. It extends in the consumer space to Fintech's. And in the market-making space, it obviously increasingly is extending to some of the types of firms that you're referring to. Now those firms are many cases, also clients. And that's the same type of dynamic that you see, for example, in the private credit space that we've discussed before. So there's no question that the ecosystem is changing. You've got new competitors. You've got changes in market structure, new dynamics. And as with any business, we are innovating and adjusting and making sure that we compete in all the traditional ways and all the new ways. Of course, there are some ways in which being a bank hinders our ability to do that. And one of the arguments that we've made going back to the capital liquidity regulations is that when you come to the impact on the kind of U.S. capital markets ecosystem, which is the end view of the world, it's worked well in its current contract for a long time where some activities were inside the regulatory perimeter. And there was robust participation from unregulated capital of various sorts. And a world where more and more of that activity gets pushed outside of bank market makers is a meaningful change to that structure that is untested, and it's unclear why you would want that. And we've cautioned that if that's the intent of the regulations, it should be intentional and well-studied. But in the meantime, we're going to adjust and compete to the best of our ability, given the constraints of the current rule set. Yes, it's a good question, Ebrahim. But I think you've kind of answered your own question in other words, like the argument out there is that the repo spike that we saw at the end of this quarter was an indication that maybe the market is approaching that lowest comfortable level of reserves that's been heavily speculated about and recognizing that, that number is probably higher and driven by the evolution of firms' liquidity requirements as opposed to some of the more traditional measures. And side point is just another reason why it's important to look at the whole frame more holistically when we think about the regulatory response in the events of two springs ago. You don't want those types of hikes, and it raises some questions about why there isn't more readiness to deploy into those types of disruptions, albeit this one was relatively minor. But in any case, when you put all that together, it would seem to add some weight to the notion that maybe QT should be wound down. And that seems to be increasingly the consensus that, that's going to get announced at some point in the fourth quarter. So final point was if you play that view through, it's a residual headwind for a system-wide deposit growth, which gets removed. And that's one of the reasons that we feel that we're probably in the trough of our deposit balances at the level. Hey, Betsy. Yes, we can hear you. Can you hear us? Yes. In other words, it goes back to my prior point and to the point that I had in the prepared remarks about the consumer deposit balances in particular that there's a bunch of different offsetting factors right now, right? You've got the yield curve, you've got Card revolve and you've got balances, and balances have been a headwind. We now see it as neutral and they could potentially become a tailwind later in the year. And one of the potential reasons for that is one of the potential tailwind -- one of the potential reasons for that is the potential end of QT, but emphasize the word potential to Jamie's point. You also obviously have a little bit of the fixed asset -- fixed rate asset reprice dynamics starting to flow through a little bit. While we're on NII, just to annoy Jamie a little bit more, I do want to make a point that I didn't get a chance to make previously, which is there is a reason that we emphasized the implied fourth quarter run rate for the Markets NII in the presentation, which is that if you take that and you annualize it, it gives you a launch point run rate, which is significantly higher than what's currently in the consensus and obviously what we've seen this year. And I'll give you the concise version of my usual speech. The changes in Markets NII are almost always bottom-line neutral and offset in NIR. But for the [Technical Difficulty] I'm trying to help you guys with your models, I would just encourage you to recognize what that launch point is, the number of cuts that are in the curve, the fact that, that number has historically and in the recent past been quite liability sensitive. So you can draw your own conclusions about what that should mean. Again, shouldn't change the overall revenue expectation. It's just a balance sheet and income statement geography issue, but just for the sake of helping you tidy up models, I wanted to make that point. Those were core NII or NII ex. So again, reiterating at the time, the '24 consensus was $91.5 billion, the '25 consensus was $90 billion on NII ex. And our point was that, that number, which remains an asset-sensitive number, indicated an insufficient amount of sequential decline year-on-year. The current consensus as we see it for NII ex-Markets is $87 billion. And as we've noted, that's closer, albeit maybe still a little bit toppy. Sure. Yes. Thanks for the question, Saul. And I think you've laid out your -- the building blocks there already. Just for simplicity, I'm going to try to answer your question without referring to the disclosed CC deposit margin number just because that number is obviously the combination of the rate paid on the CCB deposits and the internal FTP into that. And that is a complicated thing that evolves as a function of the modeling of the betas and other things. So I think it's actually more helpful to look at this simply from a firm-wide perspective and look at the evolution of the rate paid in the context of the policy rates roughly and just set aside duration management and all those other factors. And I think when you do that, what you see is we've been saying for a while that the deposit margin defined for these purposes is simply the difference between the policy rate and the weighted average rate paid of the consumer deposits was unsustainably high. And that was going to have to correct one way or the other. Either deposits were going to reprice at the product level through checking and savings and/or we were going to see a ton of internal migration, i.e., growth in the CD mix and/or we would see a lower policy rate. So as we sit here right now, of course, we make pricing decisions in the context of market competition at any given moment, looking at what the environment is for deposits. But it -- we have not needed to reprice in order to retain bank relationships, which was also our core strategy. We were never going to chase sort of the hot money at the margin. We've leaned in heavily to CDs and gotten to the current level of CD mix, and that's been a good strategy. And from where we sit now, we now have the margin coming down as a result of the policy rate coming down. It seems that, that puts us in a pretty comfortable position from a pricing perspective. We think the CD mix has probably peaked. Now on the way down, it's not going to go back down to zero where it was at the beginning of the cycle. That's an important thing to realize. So all else equal, that creates a little bit of margin compression. And then through all of that, obviously, a lower yield environment should mean that there's a little bit less outflow from consumer deposits. As I mentioned, we're seeing a lot less yield-seeking behavior. So then when you overlay onto that what you mentioned, which is our long-term share growth in CCB deposits in no small part as a function of the brand strategy and the build-out and the fact that only about a quarter of our top 125 markets in CCB are at that 15% share number. So we believe there's a big opportunity to grow the rest of it and be on track at the type of like average annual share growth of the order of 30 or 40 basis points that we've seen historically, that's how you kind of assemble a tailwind from normalized deposit margin and balance growth in consumer. Absolutely. Agree. Got it. Okay, that's helpful. Thanks a lot. That's all I got. Thanks, everyone. Thank you."

            "name": "Jamie Dimon",
            "content": "And can you just give you a view of expense a little bit? You call expenses very often. I call investments. And if you actually go back to investor day, that you'll see that we're adding private bankers in asset wealth management. We're adding ETF in asset wealth management. We're adding private bankers in international private banking. We're growing chase wealth management. We've added some branches across the United States of America. We think there are huge opportunities in the innovation economy that takes bankers and certain technologies, stuff like that. Our goal is to gain share, and everything we do, we get really good returns on it. So I look at that, these are opportunities for us. These are not expenses that we have to actually punish ourself on. And we do get, and we show you kind of extensively, you know, the cost and productivity on various things. And also AI is going to go up a little bit. And I would put that as a category that's going to generate great stuff over time. More than 6%. So like... And the one thing I can assure you is the forward curve will not be the same forward curve in six months. Could I just say some -- next time, we should give you the number. I don't want to spend all time in these calls like going through what they're guessing what NII is going to be next year. And I just -- can I just also point out that NII, all things being equal, is a number, but all things are never equal. And the yield curve -- if you have a recession, the effect of the yield curve will be very different than you have continued growth. And there are decisions that are made non-stop by us and the thing that happened in the marketplace. And I just -- I think we spend too much time on just this relevancy. So you get a model -- a number in your model. And so it's going to be less than 87% next year, probably not a lot, we don't know and we don't know the environment. Okay. So first of all, when you say, dominant I'd be very careful on that. We've got some very tough competition. Different, different countries, different around the world, fintech companies, direct lenders and MSP, I want to give you a very specific comment on direct lending and stuff like that. So our goal is always to serve our clients. And when I talk about some of these expenses, that is a deployment of capital. And it's a deployment in a different way because you open branches, you initially experience an expense, but down the road, you need capital supports, the deposits and same for the innovation economy, same for private bankers, et cetera. If you look at it roughly, we have about a minimum $30 billion of excess capital. And for me, it's not burning a hole in my pocket. I look at it as you own the whole company and you can't properly deploy it now is perfectly reasonable to wait. And I've been quite clear that I think things -- the future could be quite turbulent and asset prices in my view and you -- in life, you've got to take a view sometimes, are inflated. I don't know if they're extremely inflated or a little bit, but I prefer to wait. We will be able to deploy it. Our shareholders will be very well-served by just waiting. And same thing with deploying capital, we can buy -- we can go buy $100 billion, 6% mortgages, increase our net income by a couple of billion tomorrow. We don't make decisions like that. The most important thing we do is serve our clients well, build the technology and do things like that. And we also know what the real excess capital is yet. So we're a little patient. We're going to be a little patient and wait, and it will be fine. And so that's where we are and that's not going to change. And if it changes, we'll let you know, right? And we do talk to a lot of shareholders and they understand buying stock back at more than two times tangible book value is not necessarily the best thing to do, because we think we'll have better opportunities to redeploy it or to buy back at cheaper prices at one point. Markets do not stay high forever. And one last thing. Cash is a very valuable asset sometimes in a turbulent world. And you see my friend Warren Buffett stockpiling cash right now. I mean, people should be a little more thoughtful about how we're trying to navigate in this world and grow for the long-term for our company. Yes. So let me take time to cover this one because obviously, it is very -- become very important. People are talking about how they're growing and partnering, and things like that. And so first and foremost -- I'm going to talk about very strategic and then very tactical. I think they're both important. First and foremost, we are here to give our clients an agnostic view of the world and what the best products and services are for them. Therefore, when a client comes in, we will offer them both direct lending on ourselves and syndicated lending or other specialized kind of lending. And they all have pluses and minuses. Direct lending could be done faster, maybe simpler covenants, unit tranche. It is more expensive and you're seeing little things go back and forth between syndicated lending and direct lending, but we're going to offer the clients basically what's in their best interest and tell them what those products are across the things. We mentioned before in the past that we allocated $10 billion of capital to make direct loans. We've actually deployed a lot of capital, some of this already been paid-off, some are done. So we are going to do it directly and we are going at $10 billion, could be $20 million or $30 billion, not limited today. I will say today we're extending -- we will do $500 million, we will do $1 billion, we will do more billion, we'll do it sole-handed or do it with partners. Very importantly, we are not going to allocate ourselves to one partner. So we have -- and I think we've announced a bunch of co-lenders, but that just creates more flexibility and more size. We're not going to use that flexibility to slow it down, have to get permission for everybody because like I said, JPMorgan could underwrite it and own it like a bridge loan and syndicate it after the fact. So you could -- and we're going to use our own risk measures and stuff like that. Again, all in the service of the client and making sure what we're offering them are the best thing. And we're going to different strategy. We're not going to tie ourselves exclusively to one capital provider. I think that would limit what we could offer our clients. Probably we could be more price-competitive. We can do some of the very specific thing and not the solution that fits the third-party capital provider. That's our strategy. We're going to be there, we're going to do it. And we're going to do it in spite of the fact there's capital arbitrage taking place. So if you look at the arbitrage today, where the bank has to hold for things, with the insurance guys, they are dramatically different. That's a disadvantage, but we've had those disadvantages in other business for a long time. We are going to do what's right for the client. Remember, when we do business with the client, we also get other revenues often. So it isn't just the loan, we look at the whole relationship. So we're quite comfortable we can compete. I just announced much bigger lending platforms and sizes and stuff like that. So I hope if any of the press is on, they heard this too. Yes. When I said we're at $30 billion excess, that is assuming Barr speech that the $20 billion goes $12 billion wherever it is more. But it will be more than that because there are other factors involved. Now I would just give you the minimum excess capital. In my view, it would be more, but it is what it is, and we'll wait to see the final numbers. We just want the numbers to be done right and justified. If they had to go up, we'll be fine with that, too. I just think they should be done with real diligence and real thought and a little bit of thought about cost benefit, what it does to the economy, where it pushes lending and things like that. So we're anxiously waiting to see the actual detail because that's what's going to make all the difference. Absolutely positively not. Loans are an outcome of doing good business. We want to do good business. If it grows our balance sheet, we're fine. I noticed in the debt markets, rates came down, spreads are quite low and markets are wide open. So it kind of makes sense to people taking advantage of that today. Those conditions may not prevail, ongoing conditions late next year. I think it's wrong. I've always been a American patriot. And my country is more important to me then my company, and I think that the government is very important to get this and if you look at the world today, Mike, it is so important that we get things right for the whole geopolitical world. So I'm not just talking about the American economy. So -- and we try to participate in policy at the local level, at the state level, at the federal level, at the international level to try to help -- that's our job. We try to grow economies and things like that. So nothing has changed in my view, in my opinion, or my interest. I just think it's very, very important that we try to help government do a good job. I think the chance of that is almost nil, and I probably I'm not going to do it. But I've always reserved the right, I don't make promise to people. We don't have to. But now, I mean, I love what I do. I intend to be doing what we're doing. I almost guarantee I'll be doing this for a long period of time or at least until the Board kicks me out. Well, listen, you're making a very good point, which is I think we have an exceptional company, exceptional franchises and the price point when you might buy the stock, but I'm not that exuberant about thinking even tech valuations or any valuations will stay at these very inflated values. And so I'm just -- we're just quite patient in that. And I think you're going to have to judge us over time about we've done the right thing enough. And remember, we can always do it. We haven't lost the money. It didn't go away. It's sitting in store. The only time we'll wrong if the stock runs way up, you've got to buy at much higher prices. And I just -- I would be real skeptic about that happening. Can I just add, so in the private markets, that remains to be seen how that develops. There is a little bit of that, and some people are talking about making more active things in private markets. In some ways, we're well positioned with that, too, because for that, you need liquidity, market making, valuation, buyers and sellers in both sides to create liquidity. So that hasn't developed yet. But we're not -- we may have competition, but we'll be there when the time comes. And the second one is the public markets. You have seen reports about dealer inventories, both corporate and treasuries. And I do think that's hampered a little bit. But again, we do it -- remember for clients, so we are a large market makers in both sides of the markets for clients, both credit and treasuries. And a little different than some of the other people just trading for their own account. And so they're both competition from our standpoint, but we're there. We're going to do it. We're going to deploy more capital we want. And we would even deploy more capital at lower returns if we really had to do it to service clients. So we're very conscious of it with the competition on both sides. As Jeremy said, we sat here 10-years ago, talking about the electronification of the business and can we keep up with that. And so far, we have. Yeah. So I just want to add a couple of policy things here. I'm not actually sure they can actually do that because you have inflationary factors out there, partially driven by QE. And also look at the volatility, it's not a risk to JPMorgan. It's a risk to the system. And what banks have -- I've already mentioned the constrained balance sheet a little bit. So the banks will have trillions of dollars of cash and unable to deploy to the repo markets. And is it a good policy to think that every time that happens because you can do it very safely, fully collateralize all things like that, providing what I call flexible financing in the marketplace that, that happens, the Fed has to step in every time. I think that becomes a policy issue that every time there comes some kind of fluctuation in the market, people panic and the Feds got to stump in and provide stuff. And can they always do that if you have a slightly more inflationary environment going forward? So I think you have to be very thoughtful about this. That's why we do think they should look at calibrating SLR and ECLR and CET1 and all these things, particularly for this. So my view is, it is going to happen again. I can't tell you exactly when, but I'd be -- when, but I'd be surprised if it doesn't happen again. Yes, we can hear you. Yes. Yes. So I mean always say, assets acquisitions. I mean, I always want our people to be looking at those things and thinking about those things and being -- but if you listen to what I'm saying about my question about the world, I'm not -- it's hard for me to say that we're going to be in the market to buy credit assets. [Multiple Speakers] Creating credit assets to help clients, that's a whole different matter because when it comes to clients, we earn credit asset spread and we usually have other stuff. That -- if our bankers can deploy capital that way, of course, we want to do more. And our CIO could deploy capital in multiple ways, we would probably do more. And we ask all the time, can we do more in affordable housing? Can we do more in things we're actually quite comfortable? And yes, if we can find ways to deploy capital, we would be happy to do that. But put us in a [Multiple Speakers] stretch. Almost no chance. But having -- it's very important. Why I say that, I always tell the management team second guess me. I mean, we've done private label. I know what it is. We've been there. I have a lot of issues with it. But is it possible that something is different one day and a different thing? Yeah, it's possible. So I don't want to cut it off. If Marianne Lake says to me, Jamie, you're not thinking clearly, the world's changed, we're going to change. But right now, I would say, no chance. Jeremy, correct me if you think I'm wrong. The abnormal time period was in was in race were between 0% and 1% or 2%. Other than that, if you look at -- if you were going to say what are normal deposit margins in the normal banking business, forget people going after really hot money, that happens. It's 2% to 2.5%. Very good returns in business in Banking & Wealth Management. We're growing market share. And when we build branches and stuff like that, we don't necessarily assume current margins. We look at what could be normal margins over time. We're very comfortable, very nice business for you all. Thanks, Saul."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. The presentation is available on JPMorgan Chase's website and please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward-looking statements. Please stand by. At this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.\nJeremy Barnum : Thank you and good morning everyone. Starting on Page one, the firm reported net income of $18.1 billion, EPS of $6.12 on revenue of $51 billion with an ROTCE of 28%. These results included the $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa shares and the $1 billion foundation contribution of the appreciated Visa stock. Also included is $546 million of net investment securities losses in corporate. Excluding these items, the firm had net income of $13.1 billion, EPS of $4.40, and an ROTCE of 20%. Touching on a couple of highlights, in the CIB, IB fees were up 50% year-on-year and 17% quarter-on-quarter, and market revenue was up 10% year-on-year. In CCB, we had a record number of first-time investors and strong customer acquisition across checking accounts and card and we've continued to see strong net inflows across AWM. Now before I get more detail on the results I just want to mention that starting this quarter we are no longer explicitly calling out the First Republic contribution in the presentation. Going forward, we'll only specifically call it out if it is a meaningful driver in the year-on-year comparison. As a reminder, we acquired First Republic in May of last year, so the prior year quarter only has two months of First Republic results compared to the full three months this quarter. Also in the prior year quarter most of the expenses were in corporate whereas now they are primarily in the relevant line-of-business. Now turning to Page 2 for the firm-wide results. The firm reported revenue of $51 billion, up $8.6 billion, or 20% year-on-year. Excluding both the Visa gain that I mentioned earlier, as well as last year's First Republic bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion, revenue of $43.1 billion was up $3.4 billion or 9%. NII ex-Markets was up $568 million or 3%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates, higher revolving balances in card, and the additional month of First Republic related NII, partially offset by deposit margin compression and lower deposit balances. NIR ex-Markets was up $7.3 billion or 56%. Excluding the items I just mentioned, it was up $2.1 billion or 21%, largely driven by higher investment banking revenue and asset management fees. Both periods included net investment securities losses. And markets revenue was up $731 million or 10% year-on-year. Expenses of $23.7 billion were up $2.9 billion or 14% year-on-year. Excluding the foundation contribution I previously mentioned, expenses were up 9% primarily driven by compensation including revenue related compensation and growth in employees. And credit costs were $3.1 billion reflecting net charge-offs of $2.2 billion and a net reserve build of $821 million. Net charge-offs were up $820 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card. The net reserve build included $609 million in consumer and $189 million in wholesale. Onto balance sheet and capital on Page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.3% up 30 basis points versus the prior quarter, primarily driven by net income, largely offset by capital distributions and higher RWA. As you know, we completed CCAR a couple of weeks ago and have already disclosed a number of the key points. Let me summarize them again here. Our preliminary SCB is 3.3%, although the final SCB could be higher. The preliminary SCB, which is up from the current requirement of 2.9%, results in a 12.3% standardized CET1 ratio requirement, which goes into effect in the fourth quarter of 2024. And finally the firm announced that the Board intends to increase the quarterly common stock dividend from $1.15 to $1.25 per share in the third quarter of 2024. Now, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 4. CCB reported net income of $4.2 billion on revenue of $17.7 billion, which was up 3% year-on-year. In banking and wealth management, revenue was down 5% year-on-year, reflecting lower deposits and deposit margin compression, partially offset by growth and wealth management revenue. Average deposits were down 7% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter. Client investment assets were up 14% year-on-year, predominantly driven by market performance. In home lending, revenue of $1.3 billion was up 31% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher NII, including one additional month of the First Republic portfolio. Turning to Card services and Auto, revenue was up 14% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher Card NII and higher revolving balances. Card outstandings were up 12% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve. And in Auto, originations were $10.8 billion, down 10% coming off strong originations from a year ago, while continuing to maintain healthy margins. Expenses of $9.4 billion were up 13% year-on-year, predominantly driven by First Republic expenses now reflected in the lines-of-business, as I mentioned earlier, as well as field compensation and continued growth in technology and marketing. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.6 billion reflecting net charge-offs of $2.1 billion up $813 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card, as newer vintages season and credit normalization continues. The net reserve build was $579 million, also driven by Card, due to loan growth and updates to certain macroeconomic variables. Next, the Commercial and Investment Bank on Page 5. Our new Commercial and Investment Bank reported net income of $5.9 billion on revenue of $17.9 billion. You'll note that we are disclosing revenue by business, as well as breaking down the banking and payments revenue by client coverage segment in order to best highlight the relevant trends in both important dimensions of the wholesale franchise. This quarter, IB fees were up 50% year-on-year, and we Ranked Number #1 with year-to-date wallet share of 9.5%. And advisory, fees were up 45%, primarily driven by the closing of a few large deals in a week prior year quarter. Underwriting fees were up meaningfully with equity up 56% and debt up 51%, benefiting from favorable market conditions. In terms of the outlook, we're pleased with both the year-on-year and sequential improvement in the quarter. We remain cautiously optimistic about the pipeline, although many of the same headwinds are still in effect. It's also worth noting that pull-forward refinancing activity was a meaningful contributor to the strong performance in the first half of the year. Payments revenue was $4.5 billion, down 4% year-on-year, as deposit margin compression and higher deposit related client credits were largely offset by fee growth. Moving to markets, total revenue was $7.8 billion, up 10% year-on-year. Fixed income was up 5% with continued strength in securitized products. And equity markets was up 21%, with equity derivatives up on improved client activity. We saw record revenue in Prime on growth and client balances amid supportive equity market levels. Security services revenue of $1.3 billion was up 3% year-on-year, driven by higher volumes and market levels, largely offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $9.2 billion were up 12% year-on-year, largely driven by higher revenue related compensation, legal expense, and volume related non-compensation expense. In banking and payments, average loans were up 2% year-on-year due to the impact of the First Republic acquisition and flat sequentially. Demand for new loans remains muted as middle market and large corporate clients remain somewhat cautious due to the economic environment, and revolver utilization continues to be below pre-pandemic levels. Also, capital markets are open and are providing an alternative to traditional bank lending for these clients. In CRE, higher rates continue to suppress both loan origination and payoff activity. Average client deposits were up 2% year-on-year and relatively flat sequentially. Finally, credit costs were $384 million. The net reserve build of $220 million was primarily driven by incorporating the First Republic portfolio in the Firm's modeled approach. Net charge-offs were $164 million, of which about half was in office. Then to complete our lines-of-business, AWM on Page 6. Asset and wealth management reported net income of $1.3 billion with pre-tax margin of 32%. Revenue of $5.3 billion was up 6% year-on-year, driven by growth in management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows, as well as higher brokerage activity, largely offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $3.5 billion were up 12% year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, primarily revenue-related compensation, and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams. For the quarter, long-term net inflows were $52 billion, led by equities and fixed income. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $16 billion. AUM of $3.7 trillion was up 15% year-on-year. And client assets of $5.4 trillion were up 18% year-on-year, driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows. And finally, loans and deposits were both flat quarter-on-quarter. Turning to corporate on Page 7. Corporate reported net income of $6.8 billion on revenue of $10.1 billion. Excluding this quarter's Visa-related gain and the First Republic bargain purchase gain in the prior year, NIR was up approximately $450 million year-on-year. NII was up $626 million year-on-year, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates. Expenses of $1.6 billion were up $427 million year-on-year, excluding foundation contribution expenses were down $573 million year-on-year, largely as a result of moving First Republic related expense out of corporate into the relevant segments. To finish up, we have the outlook on Page 8. Our 2024 guidance, including the drivers, remains unchanged from what we said at Investor Day. We continue to expect NII and NII ex-markets of approximately $91 billion, adjusted expense of about $92 billion, and on credit, Card net charge-off rate of approximately 3.4%. So to wrap up, the reported performance for the quarter was exceptional and actually represents record revenue and net income. But more importantly, after excluding the significant items, the underlying performance continues to be quite strong. And as always, we remain focused on continuing to execute with discipline. And with that, let's open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: For our first question, we'll go to the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteven Chubak: Hi. Good morning, Jeremy.\nJeremy Barnum: Good morning Steve.\nSteven Chubak: So, I wanted to start off with a question on capital. Just given some indications that the Fed is considering favorable revisions to both Basel III endgame and the GSIB surcharge calculations, which I know you've been pushing for some time. As you evaluate just different capital scenarios, are these revisions material enough where they could support a higher normalized ROTCE at the Firm versus a 17% target? And if so, just how that might impact or inform your appetite for buybacks going forward?\nJeremy Barnum: Right, okay. Thanks Steve. And actually before answering the question, I just want to remind everyone that Jamie is not able to join because he has a travel conflict overseas, so it's just going to be me today. Okay. Good question on the capital and the ROTCE. So let me start with the ROTCE point first. In short, my answer to that question would be no. It's hard to imagine a scenario coming out of the whole potential range of outcomes on capital that involves an upward revision on ROTCE. If you think about the way we've been talking about this, we've said that you know before the Basel III endgame proposal, we had a 17% through cycle target and that while you can imagine a range of different outcomes, the vast majority of them involve expansions of the denominator. And while we had ideas about changing the perimeter and repricing, all of which are still sort of in effect, most of those would be thought of as mitigants rather than things that would actually increase the ROTCE. And I don't really think that answer has particularly changed. So as of now, that's what I would say, which is a good pivot to the next point, which is yeah, we've been reading the same press coverage you've been reading and you know, it's fun and interesting to speculate about the potential outcomes here, but in reality, we don't know anything -- you don't know. We don't know how reliable the press coverage is. And so in that sense, I feel like on the overall capital return and buyback trajectory, not much has actually changed relative to what I laid out at Investor Day, the comments that I made then, the comments that Jamie made then, as well as the comments that Jamie made subsequent week at an industry conference. So maybe I'll just briefly summarize for everyone's benefit what we think that is, which is one, we do recognize that our current practice on capital return and buybacks does lead to an ever-expanding CET1 ratio. But obviously we're going to run the company over the cycle over time at a reasonable CET1 ratio with reasonable buffers relative to our requirements. So after all the uncertainty is sorted out, the question of the deployment of the Capital one way or another is a matter of when, not if. On the capital hierarchy, it's also worth noting that's another thing that remains unchanged, so I'll review it quickly. You know, growing the business organically and inorganically, sustainable dividend, and in that context it's worth noting that the Board's announced intention to increase it to a $1.25 is a 19% increase prior to last year, so that's a testament for our performance and that is a return of capital. And then finally buyback, but that hierarchy does not commit us to return 100% of the capital generation in any given quarter. And so, as we said here today, when you look at the relationship between the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital and the opportunities to deploy the capital outside the Firm, it is kind of hard to imagine an environment where that relationship argues more strongly for patients. So given all that, putting it all together I'm sorry for the long answer, we remain comfortable with the current amount of excess capital. And as Jamie has said, we really continue to think about it as earnings in store, as much as anything else.\nSteven Chubak: No need to apologize, Jeremy. That was a really helpful perspective. Maybe just for my follow-up on NII. You've been very consistent just in flagging the risk related to NII over earning, especially in light of potential deposit attrition, as well as repricing headwinds. In the second quarter, we did see at least some moderation in repricing pressures. Deposit balances were also more resilient in what's a seasonally weak quarter for deposit growth. So just given the evidence that some deposit pressures appear to be abating. Do you see the potential for NII normalizing higher? And where do you think that level could ultimately be in terms of stabilization?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. Interesting question, Steve. So let's talk about deposit balances. So yes I see your point about how balance pressures are slightly abating. When you look at the system as a whole, just to go through it, Q2 is still a bit of a headwind. Loan growth is modest and not enough to offset that. And RRP seems to have settled in roughly at its current levels, and there are reasons to believe that it might not go down that much more, although that could always change and that could supply extra reserves into the system. But on balance, net across all those various effects, we still think that there are net headwinds to deposit balances. So when we think of our balance outlook, we see it as flat to slightly down maybe, with our sort of market share and growth ambitions offsetting those system-wide headwinds. So in terms of normalizing higher, I guess it depends on relative to what. But I think it is definitely too early to be sort of calling the end of the over earning narrative or the normalization narrative. Clearly, the main difference in our current guidance relative to what we had earlier in the year, which implied a lot more sequential decline, is just the change in the Fed outlook. So two cuts versus six cuts is the main difference there. But obviously, based on the latest completion data and so on, you could usually get back to a situation with a lot more cuts in the yield curve. So we'll see how it goes. And in the end, we are kind of focused on just running the place, recognizing and trying not to be distracted by what remains some amount of over earning, whatever it is.\nSteven Chubak: Understood, Jeremy. Thanks so much for taking my questions.\nJeremy Barnum: Thanks Steve.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Saul Martinez from HSBC. Please go ahead.\nSaul Martinez: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jeremy, can you give an update on the stress capital buffer? You noted, obviously, that you think there is an error in the Fed\u2019s calculation due to OCI. Can you just give us a sense of what the dialogue with the Fed looks like? Is there a process to modify the SCB higher? And if you could give us a sense of what that process looks like.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. So I'm not going to comment about any conversations with the Fed. Not to confirm or deny that they even exist, that stuff is private. And so -- and then if you talk about like the timing here, right? So you know that the stress capital buffer that's been released 3.3%, is a preliminary number. By rule, the Fed has to release that by August 31, it may come sooner. You talked about an error in the calculation, we haven't used that word. What we know -- what we believe, rather, is that the amount of OCI gain that came through the Fed\u2019s disclosed results looked non-intuitively high to us. And if you adjust that in ways that we think are reasonable, you would get a slightly higher stress capital buffer. Whether the Fed agrees and whether they decide to make that change or not is up to them, and we'll see what happens. I think the larger point is that if you look at the industry as a whole and if you sort of put us into that with some higher pro forma SCB, whatever it might conceivably be, you actually see once again, quite a bit of volatility in the year-on-year change in the stress capital buffer for many firms. And just sort of reiterating and -- another example of what we've said a lot over the years, that it's volatile, it's untransparent, it makes it very hard to manage capital of a bank. It leads to excessively high management buffers, and we think it's really not a great way to do things. So I'll leave it at that.\nSaul Martinez: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. Just following up on capital returns on Steve's question. I think you highlighted in response as a matter of when not if. And obviously, Jamie is not there. You can't speak for Jamie. But seems to have shown limited enthusiasm for a special dividend or buybacks at current valuations. Can you just give us a sense of how you're thinking about the various options? Any updated thoughts on your special dividend? And can you do other things like for example, have a material increase in your dividend payout sort of a step function increase, where -- keep that flat and grow into that grow your earnings into that over time? Can you just maybe give us a sense of how you're thinking about what options you have available to deploy that capital.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. I mean I would direct you to read -- actually, I have Jamie's comments at the industry conference where you participated the week after Investor Day, because he wanted just a good amount of detail on this stuff addressing some of these points. And I think his comment there about the special dividend was that it's not really a preference. We hear from people that many of our investors wouldn't find that particularly appealing, and he said as much that it wouldn't be sort of our first choice. So I think the larger point is just that -- a little bit to your question, there are a number of tools in the toolkit, and they're really the same tools that are part of our capital hierarchy. So first and foremost, we're looking to deploy the capital into organic or inorganic growth. And then the dividend, I think, we are always going to want to keep it in that like sustainable, and also sustainable in a stress environment. So that continues to be the way we think about that. And then at the end of it, it is buybacks. And Jamie has been on the record for over a decade, I think over many shareholder letters, talking about how he thinks about price and buybacks and valuation, and price is a factor. So that's sort of the totality of the sort of options, I guess.\nSaul Martinez: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.\nJeremy Barnum : Thanks Saul.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nKen Usdin: Thanks a lot. Good morning Jeremy. Jeremy, great to see the progress on investment banking fees, up sequentially and 50% year-over-year. And I saw you on the tape earlier just talking about still regulatory concerns a little bit in the advisory space. And we clearly didn't see the debt pull-forward play through, because DCM was great again. I'm just wondering just where you feel the environment is relative to the potential. And just where the dialogue is across the three main bucket areas in terms of like how does this feel in terms of current environment versus a potential environment that we could still see ahead? Thanks.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. Thanks, Ken. It's progress, right? I mean we are happy to see the progress. People have been talking about [depressed] (ph) banking fee wallet for some time, and it's nice to see not only the year-on-year pop on the low base, but also a nice sequential improvement. So that's the first thing to say. In terms of dialogue and engagement, it's definitely elevated. So as the dialogue on ECM is elevated and the dialogue on M&A is quite robust as well. So all of those are good things that encourage us and make us hopeful that we could be seeing sort of a better trend in this space. But there are some important caveats. So on the DCM side, yes, we made pull-forward comments in the first quarter, but we still feel that this second quarter still reflects a bunch of pull forward, and therefore we are reasonably cautious about the second half of the year. Importantly, a lot of the activity is refinancing activity as opposed to for example, acquisition finance. So the fact that M&A remains still relatively muted in terms of actual deals has knock-on effects on DCM as well. And when a higher percentage of the wallet is refi, then the pull-forward risk becomes a little bit higher. On ECM, if you look at it kind of at [remove] (ph), you might ask the question, given the performance of the overall indices, you would think it would be a really booming environment for IPOs, for example. And while it's improving, it's not quite as good as you would otherwise expect. And that's driven by a variety of factors, including the fact that as has been widely discussed, that extent to which the performance of the large industries is driven by like a few stocks, the sort of mid-cap tech growth space and other spaces that would typically be driving IPOs have had much more muted performance. Also, a lot of the private capital that was raised a couple of years ago was raised at pretty high valuations. And so in some cases, people looking at IPOs could be looking at down rounds, that's an issue. And while secondary market performance of IPOs has improved meaningfully, in some cases, people still have concerns about that. So those are a little bit of overhang on that space. I think we can hope that, over time that fades away and the trend gets a bit more robust. And yes, on the advisory side, the regulatory overhang is there, remains there. And so we'll just have to see how that plays out.\nKen Usdin: Great. Thank you for all that Jeremy. And just one on the consumer side. Just anything you're noticing in terms of people who just have been waiting for this delinquency stabilization on the credit card side. Obviously, your loss rates are coming in as you expected, and we did see 30 days pretty flat and 90 days come down a little bit. Any -- is that seasonal? Is it just a good rate of change trend? Any thoughts there? Thanks.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. I still feel like when it comes to Card charge-offs and delinquencies, there's just not much to see there. It's still -- it's normalization, not deterioration. It's in-line with expectations. As I say, we always look quite closely inside the cohort, inside the income cohorts. And when you look in there, specifically, for example on spend patterns, you can see a little bit of evidence of behavior that's consistent with a little bit of weakness in the lower income segments, where you see a little bit of rotation of the spend out of discretionary into non-discretionary. But the effects are really quite subtle, and in my mind definitely entirely consistent with the type of economic environment that we are seeing, which, while very strong and certainly a lot stronger than anyone would have thought given the tightness of monetary conditions, say, like they've been predicting it a couple of years ago or whatever, you are seeing slightly higher unemployment, you are seeing moderating GDP growth. And so it is not entirely surprising that you're seeing a tiny bit of weakness in some pockets of spend. So it all kind of hangs together in what is sometimes actually not a very interesting story.\nKen Usdin: Thank you.\nJeremy Barnum: Thanks Ken.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thanks very much. So Jeremy, the discussions so far around private credit and you all, your recent comments have been the ability to add on balance sheet and compete when you need to compete on the private credit front. I do think that most of the discussion has been about the direct-lending component. So I'm curious if you are showing more progress and activity on that front. And then very importantly, do you see the same trend happening on the asset-backed finance side, because that's a bigger part of the world, and it is a bigger part of your business? So I'd appreciate your thoughts there. Thanks.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. Thanks, Glenn. So on private credit, so nothing really new to say there. I think -- I guess one way the environment is evolving a little bit is that as you know, a lot of money has been raised in private credit funds looking for deals. And sort of a little bit to my prior comment, in a relatively muted acquisition finance environment, at this point you've got a lot of money chasing kind of like not that many deals. So the space is a little bit quieter than it was at the margin. Another interesting thing to note is some of this discussion about kind of lender protections that were typical in the syndicated lender finance market making their way into the private market as well, is sort of people realize that even in the private market, you probably need some of those protections in some cases. Which is sort of supportive of the theme that we've been talking about, about convergence between the direct lending space and the syndicated lending space, which is kind of our core thesis here, which is that we can offer best-in-class service across the entire continuum, including secondary market trading and so on. So we feel optimistic about our offering there. I think the current environment is maybe a little bit quieter than it was. So it is maybe not a great moment to like kind of test whether we are doing a lot more or less in the space, so to speak. And then on asset-backed financing, you actually asked me that question before. And at the time, my answer was that I haven't heard much about that trend, and that continues to be the case. But clearly, there must be something I'm missing. So I can follow up on that and maybe we can have a chat about it.\nGlenn Schorr: That's great for you if you are not hearing much about it, so we can leave it at that. Maybe just one quick follow-up in terms of your just overall posturing on -- you were patient and smart when rates were low, waited to deploy, worked out great. We know that story. Now it seems like you have tons of excess liquidity and you are being patient and rates are high. And I'm curious on how you think about what kind of triggers, what kind of things you're looking for in the market to know if and when you would extend duration?\nJeremy Barnum: Right. I mean on duration, in truth we have actually added a little bit of duration over the last couple of quarters. So that's one thing to say, that was more last quarter than this quarter. But I guess I would just caution you from -- a little bit away from looking at kind of our reported cash balances and our balance sheet, and concluding that when you look at the duration concept holistically, that there is a lot to be done differently on the duration front. So clearly, it is true that empirically, we've behaved like very asset sensitively in this rate hiking cycle, and that has resulted in a lot of excess NII generation sort of on the way up in the near-term. But when we look at the fund's overall sensitivity to rates, we look at it through both like the [EAR type lens] (ph), the short-term NIR sensitivity, but also a variety of other lenses, including various types of scenario analysis, including impacts on capital from higher rates. And as I think Jamie has said a couple of times, we actually aim to be relatively balanced on that front. Also, given like the inverted yield curve, it's not as if extending duration from these levels means that you're walking in 5.5% rate. In fact, the forwards are not sort of that compelling given our views about some sort of structural upward pressures on inflation and so on. So I think when you put that all together, I don't think that kind of a big change in duration posture is a thing that's front in mind for us.\nGlenn Schorr : Super, helpful. Thanks so much for that.\nJeremy Barnum: Thanks Glenn.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMatt O'Connor: Good morning. I was just wondering if you can elaborate on essentially the math behind the ROTCE being too high at 20% and normalized at 17%. Obviously, you've pointed to over-[earning NII] (ph). And I guess the question is, is that all of it to go from 20% to 17%? And if so, is that all consumer deposit costs? Or are there a few other components that you could help frame for us?\nJeremy Barnum: Sure. Good question, Matt. I mean, I guess the way I think about it is a couple of things. Like our returns tend to be a bit seasonal, right? So if you kind of build yourself out a full year forecast and make reasonable space on your own, or analyst consensus or whatever, and you think about the fourth quarter, better look at this on a full year basis when you think about the returns than the quarterly numbers, and you obviously have to strip out kind of the onetime items. And so if you do that, like whatever you get for this year is still clearly a number that's higher than 17%. So yes, one source of headwinds is normalization of the NII, primarily as a result of the expected higher deposit costs. That's -- we've talked about that. Part of it is also the yield curve effects. Some cuts will come into the curve at some point. And in the normal course, if you kind of do a very, very, very supplemental model of the company, you would have like expenses grow -- revenue is growing at some organic GDP like rate, maybe higher, and expenses growing at a similar slightly lower rate, producing a sort of relatively stable overhead ratio. But even if the amount of NII normalization winds up being less than we might have thought at some prior point, you still have some background -- you still have some normalization of the overhead ratio that needs to happen. So as much as our discipline on expense management is, as tight as it always has been, the inflation is still non-zero. There are still investments that we're executing. There is still higher expense to come in a slightly flatter revenue environment as a result of in part, the normalization of NII. And then the final point is that whatever winds up being the answer on Basel III endgame and all the other pieces, you have to assume some amount of expansion of the denominator, at least based on what we know so far. So of course, any of those pieces could be wrong, but that's kind of how we get to our 17%. And if you look at the various scenarios that we showed on the last page of my Investor Day presentation, it illustrates those dynamics and also how much the range could actually vary as a function of the economic environment and other factors.\nMatt O'Connor: Yes. That was a really helpful chart. Just one follow-up. On the yield curve effects, I guess, what do you mean by that? Because right now, the yield curve is inverted, maybe you're still leaving any impact of that. But kind of longer-term, you'd expect a little bit of steepness of the curve, which I would think would help. But what does you mean by that? Thank you.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. I mean you and I talked about this before. I guess I sort of -- I guess I don't really agree fundamentally with the notion that the way to think about things is that sort of yield curve steepness above and beyond what's priced in by the forwards is a source of structural NII or NIM for banks, if you know what I mean. Like I mean people have different views about the so-called term premium. And obviously, in a moment of inverted curve and different types of treasury supply dynamics, people thinking on that may be changing. But I think we saw, when rates were at Zero and the 10-year note was below 2%, everyone sort of -- many people were kind of tempted to try to get extra NIM and extra NII by extending duration a lot. But when the steepness of the curve implies -- is driven by the expectation of actually aggressive Fed tightening, it's just a timing issue and you can wind up kind of pretty offside from the capital and other perspectives. So there are some interesting questions about whether fiscal dynamics might result in a structurally steeper yield curve down the road and whether that could be sort of -- earning the term premium, so to speak, could be a source of NII, but that feels a bit speculative to me at this point.\nMatt O'Connor: Got it. Okay, thank you for the details.\nJeremy Barnum : Thanks Matt.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nMike Mayo: Hi. Jeremy, you said it's too early to end the over earning narrative, and you highlighted higher deposit costs and the impact of lower rates and lower NII and DCM pull-forward and credit cost going higher. Anything I'm missing on that list? And what would cause you to end the over earning narrative?\nJeremy Barnum: No. Actually, I think that is the right list Mike. I mean, frankly, I think one thing that would end to be over earning narrative is if our annual returns were closer to 17%. I mean to the extent that, that is the through-the-cycle number that we believe and that we are currently producing more than that, that's one very simple way to look at that. But the pieces of that or the pieces that you talked about and the single most important piece is the deposit margin. Our deposit margins are well above historical norms, and that is a big part of the reason that we still are emphasizing the over earning narrative.\nMike Mayo: You're 17% through-the-cycle ROTCE kind of expectation, what is the CET1 ratio that you assumed for that?\nJeremy Barnum: I mean we would generally assume requirements plus a reasonable buffer, which depending on the shape of rules, could be a little bit smaller or a little bit bigger. And the small part as a function of the volatility of those pools, which goes back to my prior comments on SCB and CCAR. But obviously, as you well know, what actually matters is less the ratio and more of the dollars. And at this point, the dollars are very much a function of where rules land and where the RWA lands, and obviously things like GSIB recalibration and so on. So we've done a bunch of scenario analysis along the lines of what I did at Investor Day that informs those numbers, but that is obviously one big element of uncertainty behind that 17%. Which is why at Investor Day, when we talked about it, both Daniel and I were quite specific about saying that we thought 17% was still achievable, assuming a reasonable outcome on the Basel III endgame.\nMike Mayo: Let me just zoom out for one more question on the return target. I mean when I asked Jamie at the [2013] (ph) Investor Day would it make sense to have 13.5% capital, he was basically telling you take a hike, right? And now you have 15.3% capital and you're saying, well, we might want to have a lot more capital here. I mean at some point, if you're spending $17 billion a year to improve the company, if you're gaining share with digital banking, if you're automating the back office, if you're moving ahead with AI, if you're doing all these things that I think you say others aren't doing, why wouldn't those returns go higher over time? Or do you just assume you'll be competing those benefits away? Thanks.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. I mean, I think in short, Mike, and we've talked about this a lot and Jamie has talked about this a lot, it is a very, very, very competitive market. And we are very happy with our performance. We are very happy with the share we've taken. And 17% is like an amazing number actually. And like to be able to do that, given how robust the competition is from banks, from non-banks, from US banks, from foreign banks and all of the different businesses that we compete in, is something that we're really proud of. So the number has a range around it, obviously. So it's not a promise, it's not a guarantee and it can fluctuate. But we are very proud to be in the ballpark of being able to think that we can deliver it, again assuming a reasonable outcome on Basel III endgame. But it's a very, very, very competitive market across all of our products and services and regions and [line] (ph) segments.\nMike Mayo: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, Jeremy.\nJeremy Barnum: Hi, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: So I did want to ask one drill-down question on 2Q, and it is related to the dollar amount of buybacks that you did do. I think in the press release, right and the slide deck, it's $4.9 billion common stock net repurchases. So the question here is what's the governor for you on how much to do every quarter? And I mean I understand it is a function of okay, how much do we organically grow. But even with that, so you get the organic growth which you had some nice movement there. But you do the organic growth and then is it how much do we earn and we want to buy back our earnings? Or how should we be thinking about what that repurchase volume should be looking like over time? And I remember at Investor Day, the whole debate around I don't want to buy back my stock, but we are right? So I get this question from investors quite a bit of how should we be thinking about how you think about what the right amount is to be doing here?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. That's a very good and fair question, Betsy. So let me try to unpack it to the best of my abilities. So -- in no particular order. One thing that we've really tried to emphasize in a number of different settings, including in our recent 10-Qs actually, is that we don't want to get into the business of guiding on buybacks. So we're going to buy back whatever we think makes sense in the current moment sort of -- and we prefer the right to sort of change that at any time. So I recognize that not everyone loves that, but that is kind of a philosophical belief. And so I might as well say it explicitly. It was pretty clear in the [Q] (ph) also, but I'm just going to say that again. So that's point one. But having said that, let me nonetheless try to address your point on framework and governors. So generally speaking, we think it doesn't make sense to sort of exit the market entirely unless the conditions are much more unusual than they are right now, let's say. Obviously, when for whatever reason, if we ever need to build capital in a hurry, we've done it before and we are always comfortable suspending buybacks entirely. But I think some modest amount of buybacks, is a reasonable thing to do when you are generating your kind of capital. And so we were talking before about this $2 billion pace, we're kind of trying to move away from this notion of a pace, but that's where that idea comes from, let's put it that way. You talked about the $4.9 million, which I recognize may seem like a little bit of a random number. But where that actually comes from is the other statement that we made, that we have these significant item gains from Visa. And if you think about what that means, it means that we have, post the acceptance of the exchange offer, a meaningful long position and liquid large cap financial stock, i.e. Visa, which realistically is highly correlated to our own stock. And so in some sense, why carry that instead of just buying back JPMorgan stock. So we talked about, Jamie talked about as we liquidate the Visa, deploying those proceeds into JPM, and that's what we did this quarter. So that is why the 4.9% is a little higher. And it's consistent with my comments at our Investor Day around having slightly increased the amount of buybacks. And beyond that what you are left with is answer to Steve's question, which is that, to your point about buying back earnings or whatever, when we are generating these types of earnings and there is this much organic capital being generated, in the absence of opportunities to deploy it organically or inorganically and while continuing to maintain our healthy but sustainable dividend, if we don't return the capital, we are going to keep growing the CET1 ratio, the levels of which -- if you think about the long strategic outlook of the company, are not reasonable. They're just artificially high and unnecessary. So one way or the other, that will need to be addressed at some point. It's just that we don't feel now is the right time.\nBetsy Graseck: Great. Thank you Jeremy. Appreciate it.\nJeremy Barnum: Thanks Betsy.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nGerard Cassidy: Hi, Jeremy, how are you?\nJeremy Barnum: Hi, Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy: Jeremy, can you -- I know you touched on deposits earlier in the call in response to a question. I noticed on the average balances, the non-interest bearing deposits were relatively stable quarter-to-quarter versus prior quarters when they have steadily declined. And this is one of the areas, of course investors are focused on in terms of the future of the net interest margin for you and your peers. Can you elaborate, if you can, what you're seeing in that non-interest-bearing deposit account? I know this is average and not period end, the period end number may actually be lower. But what are you guys seeing here?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. Good question, Gerard. I have to be honest, I haven't focused on that particular sequential explain i.e., quarter-on-quarter change and average non-interest-bearing deposits. But I think the more important question is the big picture question, which is what do we expect? I mean how are we thinking about ongoing migration of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing in the current environment, and how that affects our NII outlook and our expectation for weighted average rate paid on deposits. And the answer to that question is that we do continue to expect that migration to happen. So if you think about it in the wholesale space, you have a bunch of clients with some balances in non-interest-bearing accounts, and over time for a variety of reasons, we do see them moving those balances into interest-bearing. So we do continue to expect that migration to happen, and therefore, that will be a source of headwinds. And that migration sometimes happens internally, i.e., out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing or into CDs. Sometimes it goes into money markets or into investments, which is what we see happening in our Wealth Management business. And some of it does leave the company. But one of the things that we are encouraged by is the extent to which we are actually capturing a large portion of that yield-seeking flow through CDs and money market offerings, et cetera, across our various franchises. So big picture. I do think that migration out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing will continue to be a thing, and that is a contributor to the modest headwinds that we expect for NII right now. But yes I'll leave it at that, I guess.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And as a follow-up, you've been very clear about the consumer credit card charge-offs and delinquency levels. And we all know about the commercial real estate office, and you always talk about over-earning on net interest income of course. One of the great credit quality stories for everyone, including yourselves, is the C&I portfolio, how strong it's been for -- in this elevated rate environment. And I know your numbers are still quite low, but in the Corporate and Investment Bank, you had about a $500 million pickup in non-accrual loans. Can you share with us what are you seeing in C&I? Are there any signs of cracks or anything? And again, I know your numbers are still good, but I'm just trying to look forward to see if there's something here over the next 12 months or so.\nJeremy Barnum: Yes, it's a good question. I think the short answer is no, we are not really seeing early signs of cracks in C&I. I mean, yes, I agree with you, like the C&I charge-off rate has been very, very low for a long time. I think we emphasized that at last year's Investor Day, if I remember correctly. I think the C&I charge-off rate we are seeing 10 years was something like literally zero. So that is clearly very low by historical standards. And while we take a lot of pride in that number, I think it reflects the discipline in our underwriting process and the strength of our credit culture across bankers and the risk team, that's not -- we don't actually run that franchise to like a zero loss expectation. So you have to assume there will be some upward pressure on that. But in any given quarter, the C&I numbers tend to be quite lumpy and quite idiosyncratic. So I don't think, that anything in the current quarter results is indicative of anything broader, and I haven't heard anyone internally talk that way, I would say.\nGerard Cassidy: Great, appreciate the insights as always. Thank you.\nJeremy Barnum: Thanks Gerard.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. Please go ahead.\nErika Najarian: Hi, good morning. I just had one cleanup question, Jeremy. The consensus provision for 2024 is $10.7 billion. Could you maybe clarify for once and for all sort of Jamie's comments at an industry conference earlier and try to sort of triangulate if that $10.7 billion provision is appropriate for the growth level that you are planning for in Card?\nJeremy Barnum: Yes. Happy to clarify that. So Jamie's comments were that the allowance to build and the Card allowance, so we are talking about Card specifically, we expected something like $2 billion for the full year. As I sit here today, our expectation for that number is actually slightly higher, but it is in the ballpark. And I think in terms of what that means for the consensus on the overall allowance change for the year, last time I checked, it still looked a little low on that front. So who knows what it will actually wind up being, but that remains our view. One question that we've gotten is how to reconcile that build to the 12% growth in OS that we've talked about because it seems like a little bit high relative to what you would have otherwise assumed if you apply some sort of a standard coverage ratio to that growth. But the reason that's the case is essentially a combination of higher revolving mix as we continue to see some normalization revolve in that 12%, as well as seasoning of earlier vintages, which comes with slightly higher allowance per unit of OS growth.\nErika Najarian: Great. Thank you.\nJeremy Barnum: Thanks Erika.\nOperator: And for our final question, we'll go to the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.\nJim Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Maybe just one last question on sort of deploying excess capital. It seems like the two primary ways to do that organically would be through the trading book or the loan book. So maybe two questions there. One, trading assets were up 20% year-over-year. Is that you leaning into it or just a function of demand? And is there further opportunities to grow that? And then secondly outside of Cards, loan demand has been quite weak. And any thoughts from you on if you're seeing any change in demand or how you're thinking about loan demand going forward? Thanks.\nJeremy Barnum: Thanks, Jim. Good question. So yes, trading assets have been up. That is basically client activity primarily secured financing related sort of matchbook repo type stuff and similar things that are -- grows up the balance sheet quite a bit, but are quite low risk and therefore quite low RWA intensity. So while our ability the supply that financing to clients is something that we're happy about and it's very much represents us leaning into the franchise to serve our clients. It's not really particularly RWA, and therefore capital intensive, and therefore it doesn't really reflect an aggressive choice on our part to deploy capital, so to speak. On the loan demand front, yes, I mean, unfortunately, I just don't have much new to say there on loan demand. Meaning, to your point, loan demand remains quite muted everywhere except Card. Our Card business is, of course, in no way capital constrained. So whatever growth makes sense there in terms of our customer franchise and our ability to acquire accounts and retain accounts, and what fits inside our credit risk appetite is growth that's going to make sense. And so we're very happy to deploy capital to that. But it's not constrained by our willingness or ability to deploy capital to that. And of course, for the rest of the loan space, the last thing that we are going to do is have the excess capital mean that we lean in to lending that is not inside our risk appetite or inside our credit box, especially in a world where spreads are quite compressed and terms are under pressure. So there is always a balance between capital deployment and assessing economic risk rationally. And frankly, that is in some sense, a microcosm of the larger challenge that we have right now. When I talked about if there was ever a moment where the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital relative to how attractive the opportunities outside the walls of the company are, now would be it in terms of being patient. That's a little bit one example of what I was referring to.\nJim Mitchell: All right. Okay, great. Thanks.\nJeremy Barnum: Thanks Jim.\nOperator: And we have no further questions.\nJeremy Barnum: Very good. Thank you, everyone. See you next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you all for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect your line and enjoy the rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeremy Barnum",
            "content": "Thank you and good morning everyone. Starting on Page one, the firm reported net income of $18.1 billion, EPS of $6.12 on revenue of $51 billion with an ROTCE of 28%. These results included the $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa shares and the $1 billion foundation contribution of the appreciated Visa stock. Also included is $546 million of net investment securities losses in corporate. Excluding these items, the firm had net income of $13.1 billion, EPS of $4.40, and an ROTCE of 20%. Touching on a couple of highlights, in the CIB, IB fees were up 50% year-on-year and 17% quarter-on-quarter, and market revenue was up 10% year-on-year. In CCB, we had a record number of first-time investors and strong customer acquisition across checking accounts and card and we've continued to see strong net inflows across AWM. Now before I get more detail on the results I just want to mention that starting this quarter we are no longer explicitly calling out the First Republic contribution in the presentation. Going forward, we'll only specifically call it out if it is a meaningful driver in the year-on-year comparison. As a reminder, we acquired First Republic in May of last year, so the prior year quarter only has two months of First Republic results compared to the full three months this quarter. Also in the prior year quarter most of the expenses were in corporate whereas now they are primarily in the relevant line-of-business. Now turning to Page 2 for the firm-wide results. The firm reported revenue of $51 billion, up $8.6 billion, or 20% year-on-year. Excluding both the Visa gain that I mentioned earlier, as well as last year's First Republic bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion, revenue of $43.1 billion was up $3.4 billion or 9%. NII ex-Markets was up $568 million or 3%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates, higher revolving balances in card, and the additional month of First Republic related NII, partially offset by deposit margin compression and lower deposit balances. NIR ex-Markets was up $7.3 billion or 56%. Excluding the items I just mentioned, it was up $2.1 billion or 21%, largely driven by higher investment banking revenue and asset management fees. Both periods included net investment securities losses. And markets revenue was up $731 million or 10% year-on-year. Expenses of $23.7 billion were up $2.9 billion or 14% year-on-year. Excluding the foundation contribution I previously mentioned, expenses were up 9% primarily driven by compensation including revenue related compensation and growth in employees. And credit costs were $3.1 billion reflecting net charge-offs of $2.2 billion and a net reserve build of $821 million. Net charge-offs were up $820 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card. The net reserve build included $609 million in consumer and $189 million in wholesale. Onto balance sheet and capital on Page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.3% up 30 basis points versus the prior quarter, primarily driven by net income, largely offset by capital distributions and higher RWA. As you know, we completed CCAR a couple of weeks ago and have already disclosed a number of the key points. Let me summarize them again here. Our preliminary SCB is 3.3%, although the final SCB could be higher. The preliminary SCB, which is up from the current requirement of 2.9%, results in a 12.3% standardized CET1 ratio requirement, which goes into effect in the fourth quarter of 2024. And finally the firm announced that the Board intends to increase the quarterly common stock dividend from $1.15 to $1.25 per share in the third quarter of 2024. Now, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 4. CCB reported net income of $4.2 billion on revenue of $17.7 billion, which was up 3% year-on-year. In banking and wealth management, revenue was down 5% year-on-year, reflecting lower deposits and deposit margin compression, partially offset by growth and wealth management revenue. Average deposits were down 7% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter. Client investment assets were up 14% year-on-year, predominantly driven by market performance. In home lending, revenue of $1.3 billion was up 31% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher NII, including one additional month of the First Republic portfolio. Turning to Card services and Auto, revenue was up 14% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher Card NII and higher revolving balances. Card outstandings were up 12% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve. And in Auto, originations were $10.8 billion, down 10% coming off strong originations from a year ago, while continuing to maintain healthy margins. Expenses of $9.4 billion were up 13% year-on-year, predominantly driven by First Republic expenses now reflected in the lines-of-business, as I mentioned earlier, as well as field compensation and continued growth in technology and marketing. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.6 billion reflecting net charge-offs of $2.1 billion up $813 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card, as newer vintages season and credit normalization continues. The net reserve build was $579 million, also driven by Card, due to loan growth and updates to certain macroeconomic variables. Next, the Commercial and Investment Bank on Page 5. Our new Commercial and Investment Bank reported net income of $5.9 billion on revenue of $17.9 billion. You'll note that we are disclosing revenue by business, as well as breaking down the banking and payments revenue by client coverage segment in order to best highlight the relevant trends in both important dimensions of the wholesale franchise. This quarter, IB fees were up 50% year-on-year, and we Ranked Number #1 with year-to-date wallet share of 9.5%. And advisory, fees were up 45%, primarily driven by the closing of a few large deals in a week prior year quarter. Underwriting fees were up meaningfully with equity up 56% and debt up 51%, benefiting from favorable market conditions. In terms of the outlook, we're pleased with both the year-on-year and sequential improvement in the quarter. We remain cautiously optimistic about the pipeline, although many of the same headwinds are still in effect. It's also worth noting that pull-forward refinancing activity was a meaningful contributor to the strong performance in the first half of the year. Payments revenue was $4.5 billion, down 4% year-on-year, as deposit margin compression and higher deposit related client credits were largely offset by fee growth. Moving to markets, total revenue was $7.8 billion, up 10% year-on-year. Fixed income was up 5% with continued strength in securitized products. And equity markets was up 21%, with equity derivatives up on improved client activity. We saw record revenue in Prime on growth and client balances amid supportive equity market levels. Security services revenue of $1.3 billion was up 3% year-on-year, driven by higher volumes and market levels, largely offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $9.2 billion were up 12% year-on-year, largely driven by higher revenue related compensation, legal expense, and volume related non-compensation expense. In banking and payments, average loans were up 2% year-on-year due to the impact of the First Republic acquisition and flat sequentially. Demand for new loans remains muted as middle market and large corporate clients remain somewhat cautious due to the economic environment, and revolver utilization continues to be below pre-pandemic levels. Also, capital markets are open and are providing an alternative to traditional bank lending for these clients. In CRE, higher rates continue to suppress both loan origination and payoff activity. Average client deposits were up 2% year-on-year and relatively flat sequentially. Finally, credit costs were $384 million. The net reserve build of $220 million was primarily driven by incorporating the First Republic portfolio in the Firm's modeled approach. Net charge-offs were $164 million, of which about half was in office. Then to complete our lines-of-business, AWM on Page 6. Asset and wealth management reported net income of $1.3 billion with pre-tax margin of 32%. Revenue of $5.3 billion was up 6% year-on-year, driven by growth in management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows, as well as higher brokerage activity, largely offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $3.5 billion were up 12% year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, primarily revenue-related compensation, and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams. For the quarter, long-term net inflows were $52 billion, led by equities and fixed income. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $16 billion. AUM of $3.7 trillion was up 15% year-on-year. And client assets of $5.4 trillion were up 18% year-on-year, driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows. And finally, loans and deposits were both flat quarter-on-quarter. Turning to corporate on Page 7. Corporate reported net income of $6.8 billion on revenue of $10.1 billion. Excluding this quarter's Visa-related gain and the First Republic bargain purchase gain in the prior year, NIR was up approximately $450 million year-on-year. NII was up $626 million year-on-year, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates. Expenses of $1.6 billion were up $427 million year-on-year, excluding foundation contribution expenses were down $573 million year-on-year, largely as a result of moving First Republic related expense out of corporate into the relevant segments. To finish up, we have the outlook on Page 8. Our 2024 guidance, including the drivers, remains unchanged from what we said at Investor Day. We continue to expect NII and NII ex-markets of approximately $91 billion, adjusted expense of about $92 billion, and on credit, Card net charge-off rate of approximately 3.4%. So to wrap up, the reported performance for the quarter was exceptional and actually represents record revenue and net income. But more importantly, after excluding the significant items, the underlying performance continues to be quite strong. And as always, we remain focused on continuing to execute with discipline. And with that, let's open the line for Q&A. Good morning Steve. Right, okay. Thanks Steve. And actually before answering the question, I just want to remind everyone that Jamie is not able to join because he has a travel conflict overseas, so it's just going to be me today. Okay. Good question on the capital and the ROTCE. So let me start with the ROTCE point first. In short, my answer to that question would be no. It's hard to imagine a scenario coming out of the whole potential range of outcomes on capital that involves an upward revision on ROTCE. If you think about the way we've been talking about this, we've said that you know before the Basel III endgame proposal, we had a 17% through cycle target and that while you can imagine a range of different outcomes, the vast majority of them involve expansions of the denominator. And while we had ideas about changing the perimeter and repricing, all of which are still sort of in effect, most of those would be thought of as mitigants rather than things that would actually increase the ROTCE. And I don't really think that answer has particularly changed. So as of now, that's what I would say, which is a good pivot to the next point, which is yeah, we've been reading the same press coverage you've been reading and you know, it's fun and interesting to speculate about the potential outcomes here, but in reality, we don't know anything -- you don't know. We don't know how reliable the press coverage is. And so in that sense, I feel like on the overall capital return and buyback trajectory, not much has actually changed relative to what I laid out at Investor Day, the comments that I made then, the comments that Jamie made then, as well as the comments that Jamie made subsequent week at an industry conference. So maybe I'll just briefly summarize for everyone's benefit what we think that is, which is one, we do recognize that our current practice on capital return and buybacks does lead to an ever-expanding CET1 ratio. But obviously we're going to run the company over the cycle over time at a reasonable CET1 ratio with reasonable buffers relative to our requirements. So after all the uncertainty is sorted out, the question of the deployment of the Capital one way or another is a matter of when, not if. On the capital hierarchy, it's also worth noting that's another thing that remains unchanged, so I'll review it quickly. You know, growing the business organically and inorganically, sustainable dividend, and in that context it's worth noting that the Board's announced intention to increase it to a $1.25 is a 19% increase prior to last year, so that's a testament for our performance and that is a return of capital. And then finally buyback, but that hierarchy does not commit us to return 100% of the capital generation in any given quarter. And so, as we said here today, when you look at the relationship between the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital and the opportunities to deploy the capital outside the Firm, it is kind of hard to imagine an environment where that relationship argues more strongly for patients. So given all that, putting it all together I'm sorry for the long answer, we remain comfortable with the current amount of excess capital. And as Jamie has said, we really continue to think about it as earnings in store, as much as anything else. Yes. Interesting question, Steve. So let's talk about deposit balances. So yes I see your point about how balance pressures are slightly abating. When you look at the system as a whole, just to go through it, Q2 is still a bit of a headwind. Loan growth is modest and not enough to offset that. And RRP seems to have settled in roughly at its current levels, and there are reasons to believe that it might not go down that much more, although that could always change and that could supply extra reserves into the system. But on balance, net across all those various effects, we still think that there are net headwinds to deposit balances. So when we think of our balance outlook, we see it as flat to slightly down maybe, with our sort of market share and growth ambitions offsetting those system-wide headwinds. So in terms of normalizing higher, I guess it depends on relative to what. But I think it is definitely too early to be sort of calling the end of the over earning narrative or the normalization narrative. Clearly, the main difference in our current guidance relative to what we had earlier in the year, which implied a lot more sequential decline, is just the change in the Fed outlook. So two cuts versus six cuts is the main difference there. But obviously, based on the latest completion data and so on, you could usually get back to a situation with a lot more cuts in the yield curve. So we'll see how it goes. And in the end, we are kind of focused on just running the place, recognizing and trying not to be distracted by what remains some amount of over earning, whatever it is. Thanks Steve. Yes. So I'm not going to comment about any conversations with the Fed. Not to confirm or deny that they even exist, that stuff is private. And so -- and then if you talk about like the timing here, right? So you know that the stress capital buffer that's been released 3.3%, is a preliminary number. By rule, the Fed has to release that by August 31, it may come sooner. You talked about an error in the calculation, we haven't used that word. What we know -- what we believe, rather, is that the amount of OCI gain that came through the Fed's disclosed results looked non-intuitively high to us. And if you adjust that in ways that we think are reasonable, you would get a slightly higher stress capital buffer. Whether the Fed agrees and whether they decide to make that change or not is up to them, and we'll see what happens. I think the larger point is that if you look at the industry as a whole and if you sort of put us into that with some higher pro forma SCB, whatever it might conceivably be, you actually see once again, quite a bit of volatility in the year-on-year change in the stress capital buffer for many firms. And just sort of reiterating and -- another example of what we've said a lot over the years, that it's volatile, it's untransparent, it makes it very hard to manage capital of a bank. It leads to excessively high management buffers, and we think it's really not a great way to do things. So I'll leave it at that. Yes. I mean I would direct you to read -- actually, I have Jamie's comments at the industry conference where you participated the week after Investor Day, because he wanted just a good amount of detail on this stuff addressing some of these points. And I think his comment there about the special dividend was that it's not really a preference. We hear from people that many of our investors wouldn't find that particularly appealing, and he said as much that it wouldn't be sort of our first choice. So I think the larger point is just that -- a little bit to your question, there are a number of tools in the toolkit, and they're really the same tools that are part of our capital hierarchy. So first and foremost, we're looking to deploy the capital into organic or inorganic growth. And then the dividend, I think, we are always going to want to keep it in that like sustainable, and also sustainable in a stress environment. So that continues to be the way we think about that. And then at the end of it, it is buybacks. And Jamie has been on the record for over a decade, I think over many shareholder letters, talking about how he thinks about price and buybacks and valuation, and price is a factor. So that's sort of the totality of the sort of options, I guess. Thanks Saul. Yes. Thanks, Ken. It's progress, right? I mean we are happy to see the progress. People have been talking about [depressed] (ph) banking fee wallet for some time, and it's nice to see not only the year-on-year pop on the low base, but also a nice sequential improvement. So that's the first thing to say. In terms of dialogue and engagement, it's definitely elevated. So as the dialogue on ECM is elevated and the dialogue on M&A is quite robust as well. So all of those are good things that encourage us and make us hopeful that we could be seeing sort of a better trend in this space. But there are some important caveats. So on the DCM side, yes, we made pull-forward comments in the first quarter, but we still feel that this second quarter still reflects a bunch of pull forward, and therefore we are reasonably cautious about the second half of the year. Importantly, a lot of the activity is refinancing activity as opposed to for example, acquisition finance. So the fact that M&A remains still relatively muted in terms of actual deals has knock-on effects on DCM as well. And when a higher percentage of the wallet is refi, then the pull-forward risk becomes a little bit higher. On ECM, if you look at it kind of at [remove] (ph), you might ask the question, given the performance of the overall indices, you would think it would be a really booming environment for IPOs, for example. And while it's improving, it's not quite as good as you would otherwise expect. And that's driven by a variety of factors, including the fact that as has been widely discussed, that extent to which the performance of the large industries is driven by like a few stocks, the sort of mid-cap tech growth space and other spaces that would typically be driving IPOs have had much more muted performance. Also, a lot of the private capital that was raised a couple of years ago was raised at pretty high valuations. And so in some cases, people looking at IPOs could be looking at down rounds, that's an issue. And while secondary market performance of IPOs has improved meaningfully, in some cases, people still have concerns about that. So those are a little bit of overhang on that space. I think we can hope that, over time that fades away and the trend gets a bit more robust. And yes, on the advisory side, the regulatory overhang is there, remains there. And so we'll just have to see how that plays out. Yes. I still feel like when it comes to Card charge-offs and delinquencies, there's just not much to see there. It's still -- it's normalization, not deterioration. It's in-line with expectations. As I say, we always look quite closely inside the cohort, inside the income cohorts. And when you look in there, specifically, for example on spend patterns, you can see a little bit of evidence of behavior that's consistent with a little bit of weakness in the lower income segments, where you see a little bit of rotation of the spend out of discretionary into non-discretionary. But the effects are really quite subtle, and in my mind definitely entirely consistent with the type of economic environment that we are seeing, which, while very strong and certainly a lot stronger than anyone would have thought given the tightness of monetary conditions, say, like they've been predicting it a couple of years ago or whatever, you are seeing slightly higher unemployment, you are seeing moderating GDP growth. And so it is not entirely surprising that you're seeing a tiny bit of weakness in some pockets of spend. So it all kind of hangs together in what is sometimes actually not a very interesting story. Thanks Ken. Yes. Thanks, Glenn. So on private credit, so nothing really new to say there. I think -- I guess one way the environment is evolving a little bit is that as you know, a lot of money has been raised in private credit funds looking for deals. And sort of a little bit to my prior comment, in a relatively muted acquisition finance environment, at this point you've got a lot of money chasing kind of like not that many deals. So the space is a little bit quieter than it was at the margin. Another interesting thing to note is some of this discussion about kind of lender protections that were typical in the syndicated lender finance market making their way into the private market as well, is sort of people realize that even in the private market, you probably need some of those protections in some cases. Which is sort of supportive of the theme that we've been talking about, about convergence between the direct lending space and the syndicated lending space, which is kind of our core thesis here, which is that we can offer best-in-class service across the entire continuum, including secondary market trading and so on. So we feel optimistic about our offering there. I think the current environment is maybe a little bit quieter than it was. So it is maybe not a great moment to like kind of test whether we are doing a lot more or less in the space, so to speak. And then on asset-backed financing, you actually asked me that question before. And at the time, my answer was that I haven't heard much about that trend, and that continues to be the case. But clearly, there must be something I'm missing. So I can follow up on that and maybe we can have a chat about it. Right. I mean on duration, in truth we have actually added a little bit of duration over the last couple of quarters. So that's one thing to say, that was more last quarter than this quarter. But I guess I would just caution you from -- a little bit away from looking at kind of our reported cash balances and our balance sheet, and concluding that when you look at the duration concept holistically, that there is a lot to be done differently on the duration front. So clearly, it is true that empirically, we've behaved like very asset sensitively in this rate hiking cycle, and that has resulted in a lot of excess NII generation sort of on the way up in the near-term. But when we look at the fund's overall sensitivity to rates, we look at it through both like the [EAR type lens] (ph), the short-term NIR sensitivity, but also a variety of other lenses, including various types of scenario analysis, including impacts on capital from higher rates. And as I think Jamie has said a couple of times, we actually aim to be relatively balanced on that front. Also, given like the inverted yield curve, it's not as if extending duration from these levels means that you're walking in 5.5% rate. In fact, the forwards are not sort of that compelling given our views about some sort of structural upward pressures on inflation and so on. So I think when you put that all together, I don't think that kind of a big change in duration posture is a thing that's front in mind for us. Thanks Glenn. Sure. Good question, Matt. I mean, I guess the way I think about it is a couple of things. Like our returns tend to be a bit seasonal, right? So if you kind of build yourself out a full year forecast and make reasonable space on your own, or analyst consensus or whatever, and you think about the fourth quarter, better look at this on a full year basis when you think about the returns than the quarterly numbers, and you obviously have to strip out kind of the onetime items. And so if you do that, like whatever you get for this year is still clearly a number that's higher than 17%. So yes, one source of headwinds is normalization of the NII, primarily as a result of the expected higher deposit costs. That's -- we've talked about that. Part of it is also the yield curve effects. Some cuts will come into the curve at some point. And in the normal course, if you kind of do a very, very, very supplemental model of the company, you would have like expenses grow -- revenue is growing at some organic GDP like rate, maybe higher, and expenses growing at a similar slightly lower rate, producing a sort of relatively stable overhead ratio. But even if the amount of NII normalization winds up being less than we might have thought at some prior point, you still have some background -- you still have some normalization of the overhead ratio that needs to happen. So as much as our discipline on expense management is, as tight as it always has been, the inflation is still non-zero. There are still investments that we're executing. There is still higher expense to come in a slightly flatter revenue environment as a result of in part, the normalization of NII. And then the final point is that whatever winds up being the answer on Basel III endgame and all the other pieces, you have to assume some amount of expansion of the denominator, at least based on what we know so far. So of course, any of those pieces could be wrong, but that's kind of how we get to our 17%. And if you look at the various scenarios that we showed on the last page of my Investor Day presentation, it illustrates those dynamics and also how much the range could actually vary as a function of the economic environment and other factors. Yes. I mean you and I talked about this before. I guess I sort of -- I guess I don't really agree fundamentally with the notion that the way to think about things is that sort of yield curve steepness above and beyond what's priced in by the forwards is a source of structural NII or NIM for banks, if you know what I mean. Like I mean people have different views about the so-called term premium. And obviously, in a moment of inverted curve and different types of treasury supply dynamics, people thinking on that may be changing. But I think we saw, when rates were at Zero and the 10-year note was below 2%, everyone sort of -- many people were kind of tempted to try to get extra NIM and extra NII by extending duration a lot. But when the steepness of the curve implies -- is driven by the expectation of actually aggressive Fed tightening, it's just a timing issue and you can wind up kind of pretty offside from the capital and other perspectives. So there are some interesting questions about whether fiscal dynamics might result in a structurally steeper yield curve down the road and whether that could be sort of -- earning the term premium, so to speak, could be a source of NII, but that feels a bit speculative to me at this point. Thanks Matt. No. Actually, I think that is the right list Mike. I mean, frankly, I think one thing that would end to be over earning narrative is if our annual returns were closer to 17%. I mean to the extent that, that is the through-the-cycle number that we believe and that we are currently producing more than that, that's one very simple way to look at that. But the pieces of that or the pieces that you talked about and the single most important piece is the deposit margin. Our deposit margins are well above historical norms, and that is a big part of the reason that we still are emphasizing the over earning narrative. I mean we would generally assume requirements plus a reasonable buffer, which depending on the shape of rules, could be a little bit smaller or a little bit bigger. And the small part as a function of the volatility of those pools, which goes back to my prior comments on SCB and CCAR. But obviously, as you well know, what actually matters is less the ratio and more of the dollars. And at this point, the dollars are very much a function of where rules land and where the RWA lands, and obviously things like GSIB recalibration and so on. So we've done a bunch of scenario analysis along the lines of what I did at Investor Day that informs those numbers, but that is obviously one big element of uncertainty behind that 17%. Which is why at Investor Day, when we talked about it, both Daniel and I were quite specific about saying that we thought 17% was still achievable, assuming a reasonable outcome on the Basel III endgame. Yes. I mean, I think in short, Mike, and we've talked about this a lot and Jamie has talked about this a lot, it is a very, very, very competitive market. And we are very happy with our performance. We are very happy with the share we've taken. And 17% is like an amazing number actually. And like to be able to do that, given how robust the competition is from banks, from non-banks, from US banks, from foreign banks and all of the different businesses that we compete in, is something that we're really proud of. So the number has a range around it, obviously. So it's not a promise, it's not a guarantee and it can fluctuate. But we are very proud to be in the ballpark of being able to think that we can deliver it, again assuming a reasonable outcome on Basel III endgame. But it's a very, very, very competitive market across all of our products and services and regions and [line] (ph) segments. Hi, Betsy. Yes. That's a very good and fair question, Betsy. So let me try to unpack it to the best of my abilities. So -- in no particular order. One thing that we've really tried to emphasize in a number of different settings, including in our recent 10-Qs actually, is that we don't want to get into the business of guiding on buybacks. So we're going to buy back whatever we think makes sense in the current moment sort of -- and we prefer the right to sort of change that at any time. So I recognize that not everyone loves that, but that is kind of a philosophical belief. And so I might as well say it explicitly. It was pretty clear in the [Q] (ph) also, but I'm just going to say that again. So that's point one. But having said that, let me nonetheless try to address your point on framework and governors. So generally speaking, we think it doesn't make sense to sort of exit the market entirely unless the conditions are much more unusual than they are right now, let's say. Obviously, when for whatever reason, if we ever need to build capital in a hurry, we've done it before and we are always comfortable suspending buybacks entirely. But I think some modest amount of buybacks, is a reasonable thing to do when you are generating your kind of capital. And so we were talking before about this $2 billion pace, we're kind of trying to move away from this notion of a pace, but that's where that idea comes from, let's put it that way. You talked about the $4.9 million, which I recognize may seem like a little bit of a random number. But where that actually comes from is the other statement that we made, that we have these significant item gains from Visa. And if you think about what that means, it means that we have, post the acceptance of the exchange offer, a meaningful long position and liquid large cap financial stock, i.e. Visa, which realistically is highly correlated to our own stock. And so in some sense, why carry that instead of just buying back JPMorgan stock. So we talked about, Jamie talked about as we liquidate the Visa, deploying those proceeds into JPM, and that's what we did this quarter. So that is why the 4.9% is a little higher. And it's consistent with my comments at our Investor Day around having slightly increased the amount of buybacks. And beyond that what you are left with is answer to Steve's question, which is that, to your point about buying back earnings or whatever, when we are generating these types of earnings and there is this much organic capital being generated, in the absence of opportunities to deploy it organically or inorganically and while continuing to maintain our healthy but sustainable dividend, if we don't return the capital, we are going to keep growing the CET1 ratio, the levels of which -- if you think about the long strategic outlook of the company, are not reasonable. They're just artificially high and unnecessary. So one way or the other, that will need to be addressed at some point. It's just that we don't feel now is the right time. Thanks Betsy. Hi, Gerard. Yes. Good question, Gerard. I have to be honest, I haven't focused on that particular sequential explain i.e., quarter-on-quarter change and average non-interest-bearing deposits. But I think the more important question is the big picture question, which is what do we expect? I mean how are we thinking about ongoing migration of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing in the current environment, and how that affects our NII outlook and our expectation for weighted average rate paid on deposits. And the answer to that question is that we do continue to expect that migration to happen. So if you think about it in the wholesale space, you have a bunch of clients with some balances in non-interest-bearing accounts, and over time for a variety of reasons, we do see them moving those balances into interest-bearing. So we do continue to expect that migration to happen, and therefore, that will be a source of headwinds. And that migration sometimes happens internally, i.e., out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing or into CDs. Sometimes it goes into money markets or into investments, which is what we see happening in our Wealth Management business. And some of it does leave the company. But one of the things that we are encouraged by is the extent to which we are actually capturing a large portion of that yield-seeking flow through CDs and money market offerings, et cetera, across our various franchises. So big picture. I do think that migration out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing will continue to be a thing, and that is a contributor to the modest headwinds that we expect for NII right now. But yes I'll leave it at that, I guess. Yes, it's a good question. I think the short answer is no, we are not really seeing early signs of cracks in C&I. I mean, yes, I agree with you, like the C&I charge-off rate has been very, very low for a long time. I think we emphasized that at last year's Investor Day, if I remember correctly. I think the C&I charge-off rate we are seeing 10 years was something like literally zero. So that is clearly very low by historical standards. And while we take a lot of pride in that number, I think it reflects the discipline in our underwriting process and the strength of our credit culture across bankers and the risk team, that's not -- we don't actually run that franchise to like a zero loss expectation. So you have to assume there will be some upward pressure on that. But in any given quarter, the C&I numbers tend to be quite lumpy and quite idiosyncratic. So I don't think, that anything in the current quarter results is indicative of anything broader, and I haven't heard anyone internally talk that way, I would say. Thanks Gerard. Yes. Happy to clarify that. So Jamie's comments were that the allowance to build and the Card allowance, so we are talking about Card specifically, we expected something like $2 billion for the full year. As I sit here today, our expectation for that number is actually slightly higher, but it is in the ballpark. And I think in terms of what that means for the consensus on the overall allowance change for the year, last time I checked, it still looked a little low on that front. So who knows what it will actually wind up being, but that remains our view. One question that we've gotten is how to reconcile that build to the 12% growth in OS that we've talked about because it seems like a little bit high relative to what you would have otherwise assumed if you apply some sort of a standard coverage ratio to that growth. But the reason that's the case is essentially a combination of higher revolving mix as we continue to see some normalization revolve in that 12%, as well as seasoning of earlier vintages, which comes with slightly higher allowance per unit of OS growth. Thanks Erika. Thanks, Jim. Good question. So yes, trading assets have been up. That is basically client activity primarily secured financing related sort of matchbook repo type stuff and similar things that are -- grows up the balance sheet quite a bit, but are quite low risk and therefore quite low RWA intensity. So while our ability the supply that financing to clients is something that we're happy about and it's very much represents us leaning into the franchise to serve our clients. It's not really particularly RWA, and therefore capital intensive, and therefore it doesn't really reflect an aggressive choice on our part to deploy capital, so to speak. On the loan demand front, yes, I mean, unfortunately, I just don't have much new to say there on loan demand. Meaning, to your point, loan demand remains quite muted everywhere except Card. Our Card business is, of course, in no way capital constrained. So whatever growth makes sense there in terms of our customer franchise and our ability to acquire accounts and retain accounts, and what fits inside our credit risk appetite is growth that's going to make sense. And so we're very happy to deploy capital to that. But it's not constrained by our willingness or ability to deploy capital to that. And of course, for the rest of the loan space, the last thing that we are going to do is have the excess capital mean that we lean in to lending that is not inside our risk appetite or inside our credit box, especially in a world where spreads are quite compressed and terms are under pressure. So there is always a balance between capital deployment and assessing economic risk rationally. And frankly, that is in some sense, a microcosm of the larger challenge that we have right now. When I talked about if there was ever a moment where the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital relative to how attractive the opportunities outside the walls of the company are, now would be it in terms of being patient. That's a little bit one example of what I was referring to. Thanks Jim. Very good. Thank you, everyone. See you next quarter."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by.  \n At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead. \nJeremy Barnum: Thank you very much, and good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back.  \n Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $13.4 billion, EPS of $4.44 on revenue of $42.5 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 21%. These results included a $725 million increase to the special assessment resulting from the FDIC's updated estimate of expected losses from the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.  \n Touching on a couple of highlights. Firm-wide IB fees were up 18% year-on-year, reflecting particular strength in underwriting fees. And we have seen strong net inflows across AWM as well as in the CCB and Wealth Management business.  \n On Page 2, we have some more detail. This is the last quarter we'll discuss results excluding First Republic, given that going forward, First Republic results will naturally be included in the prior period, making year-on-year results comparable. For this quarter, First Republic contributed $1.7 billion of revenue, $806 million of expense and $668 million of net income.  \n Now focusing on the firm-wide results excluding First Republic. Revenue of $40.9 billion was up $1.5 billion or 4% year-on-year. NII ex Markets was up $736 million or 4% driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates as well as higher revolving balances in card, largely offset by deposit margin compression and lower deposit balances in CCB. NIR ex Markets was up $1.2 billion or 12% driven by higher firm-wide asset management and Investment Banking fees as well as lower net investment securities losses. And Markets revenue was down $400 million or 5% year-on-year.  \n Expenses of $22 billion were up $1.8 billion or 9% year-on-year driven by higher compensation, including growth in employees and the increase to the FDIC special assessment. And credit costs were $1.9 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2 billion and a net reserve release of $38 million. Net charge-offs were up $116 million predominantly driven by Card.  \n On to balance sheet and capital on Page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15%, relatively flat versus the prior quarter, reflecting net income which was predominantly offset by higher RWA and capital distribution. This quarter's higher RWA is largely due to seasonal effects, including higher client activity in Markets and higher risk weights on deferred tax assets, partially offset by lower Card loans.  \n Now let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 4. Consumers remain financially healthy, supported by a resilient labor market. While cash buffers have largely normalized, balances were still above pre-pandemic levels, and wages are keeping pace with inflation. When looking at a stable cohort of customers, overall spend is in line with the prior year.  \n Turning now to the financial results excluding First Republic. CCB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $16.6 billion, which was up 1% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was down 4% year-on-year, reflecting lower NII on lower deposits with average balances down 7% as our CD mix increased. Client investment assets were up 25% year-on-year driven by market performance and strong net inflows.  \n In Home Lending, revenue was up 10% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher NII and production revenue. Originations, while still modest, were up 10%.  \n Moving to Card Services & Auto. Revenue was up 8% year-on-year driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by higher card acquisition costs from new account growth and lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 13% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve. And in auto, originations were $8.9 billion, down 3%, while we maintained healthy margins and market share. Expenses of $8.8 billion were up 9% year-on-year, largely driven by field compensation and continued growth in technology and marketing.  \n In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.9 billion, driven by net charge-offs, which were up $825 million year-on-year predominantly due to continued normalization in Card. The net reserve build was $45 million, reflecting the build in Card largely offset by a release in Home Lending.  \n Next, the Corporate & Investment Bank on Page 5. Before reporting CIB's results, I want to note that this will also be the last quarter we will be -- we will report earnings for the CIB and CB as standalone segments. Between now and Investor Day, we will furnish an 8-K with historical results, including 5 quarters and 2 full years of history consistent with the structure of the new Commercial and Investment Bank segment, in line with the reorganization that was announced in January.  \n Turning back to this quarter. CIB reported net income of $4.8 billion on revenue of $13.6 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $2 billion was up 27% year-on-year. IB fees were up 21% year-on-year, and we ranked #1 with year-to-date wallet share of 9.1%. In Advisory, fees were down 21% driven by fewer large completed deals. Underwriting fees were up significantly, benefiting from improved market conditions with debt up 58% and equity up 51%.  \n In terms of the outlook. While we are encouraged by the level of capital markets activity we saw this quarter, we need to be mindful that some meaningful portion of that is likely pulling forward from later in the year. Similarly, while it was encouraging to see some positive momentum in announced M&A in the quarter, it remains to be seen whether that will continue, and the Advisory business still faces structural headwinds from the regulatory environment. Payments revenue was $2.4 billion, down 1% year-on-year, as deposit margin normalization and deposit-related client credits were largely offset by higher fee-based revenue and deposit balances.  \n Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $8 billion, down 5% year-on-year. Fixed income was down 7% driven by lower activity in rates and commodities compared to a strong prior year quarter, partially offset by strong results in Securitized Products. Equity Markets was flat. Securities Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 3% year-on-year. Expenses of $7.2 billion were down 4% year-on-year predominantly driven by lower legal expense.  \n Moving to the Commercial Bank on Page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.6 billion. Revenue of $3.6 billion was up 3% year-on-year driven by higher noninterest revenue. Gross Investment Banking and Markets revenue of $913 million was up 4% year-on-year with increased IB fees, largely offset by lower Markets revenue compared to a strong prior year quarter. Payments revenue of $1.9 billion was down 2% year-on-year driven by lower deposit margins and balances, largely offset by fee growth, net of higher deposit-related client credits. Expenses of $1.5 billion were up 13% year-on-year predominantly driven by higher compensation, reflecting an increase in employees, including for office and technology investments, as well as higher volume-related expenses.  \n Average deposits were down 3% year-on-year, primarily driven by lower nonoperating deposits and down 1% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting seasonally lower balances. Loans were flat quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were down 1%, reflecting muted demand for new loans as clients remain cautious. And CRE loans were flat as higher rates continue to have an impact on originations and sales activity. Finally, credit costs were a net benefit of $35 million, including a net reserve release of $101 million and net charge-offs of $66 million.  \n Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1 billion with pretax margin of 28%. Revenue of $4.7 billion was down 1% year-on-year. Excluding net investment valuation gains in the prior year, revenue was up 5% driven by higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, partially offset by lower NII due to deposit margin compression.  \n Expenses of $3.4 billion were up 11% year-on-year largely driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation; continued growth in our private banking advisor teams; and the impact of the JPMorgan Asset Management China acquisition; as well as higher distribution fees.  \n For the quarter, long-term net inflows were $34 billion, led by equities and fixed income. AUM of $3.6 trillion was up 19% year-on-year. And client assets of $5.2 trillion were up 20% year-on-year driven by higher market levels and continued net inflow. And finally, loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter and deposits were flat.  \n Turning to Corporate on Page 8. Corporate reported net income of $918 million. Revenue was $2.3 billion, up $1.3 billion year-on-year. NII was $2.5 billion, up $737 million year-on-year driven by the impact of the balance sheet mix and higher rates. NIR was a net loss of $188 million. The current quarter included net investment securities losses of $366 million compared with net securities losses of $868 million in the prior year quarter. Expenses of $1 billion were up $889 million year-on-year predominantly driven by the increase to the FDIC special assessment.  \n To finish up, we have the outlook on Page 9. We now expect NII ex Markets to be approximately $89 billion based on a forward curve that contained 3 rate cuts at quarter end. Our total NII guidance remains approximately $90 billion, which implies a decrease in our Markets NII guidance from around $2 billion to around $1 billion. The primary driver of that reduction is balance sheet growth and mix shift in the Markets business. And as a reminder, changes in Markets NII are generally revenue-neutral. Our outlook for adjusted expense is now about $91 billion, reflecting the increase to the FDIC special assessment I mentioned upfront. And on credit, we continue to expect the 2024 Card net charge-off rate to be below 3.5%.  \n Finally, you may have noticed that our effective tax rate has increased this quarter, and it will likely stay around 23% this year, absent discrete items, which can vary quite a bit. The driver of this change is the firm's adoption of the proportional amortization method for certain tax equity investments.  \n Our managed rate is unchanged, and it should average about 3.5% above the effective tax rate. This is a smaller gap than we've previously observed, and we expect this approximate relationship to persist going forward, although the difference will continue to fluctuate as it has in the past. For the avoidance of doubt, these changes have no meaningful impact on expected annual net income. We're just mentioning this to help with your models.  \n So to wrap up. We're pleased with another quarter of strong operating results even as the journey towards NII normalization begins. While we remain confident in our ability to produce strong returns and manage risk across a range of scenarios, the economic, geopolitical and regulatory uncertainties that we have been talking about for some time remain prominent, and we are focused on being prepared to navigate those challenges as well as any others that may come our way.  \n And with that, let's open up the line for Q&A. \nOperator: The first question is coming from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. \nBetsy Graseck: So a couple of questions here. Just one, Jamie, could you talk through the decision to raise the dividend kind of mid-cycle, it felt like, pre-CCAR? And also help us understand how you're thinking about where that payout ratio, that dividend payout ratio range should be. Because over the past several years, it's been somewhere between 24% and 32%. And so is this suggesting we could be towards the higher end of that range or even expanding above that?  \n And then I also just wanted to understand the buyback and the keeping of the CET1 at 15% here. The minimum is 11.9%. I know it's -- we have to wait for Basel III endgame reproposal to come through and all that. But are we -- should we be expecting that, hey, we're going to hold 15% CET1 until we know all these rules? \nJames Dimon: Yes. So Betsy, before I answer the question, I want to say something on behalf of all of us at JPMorgan and me personally. I'm thrilled to have you on this call.  \n For those who don't know, Betsy has been through a terrible medical episode. And to remind all of us how lucky we are to be here, but Betsy in particular, the amount of respect we have, not just in your work, but in your character over the last 20-plus years have been exceptional. So on behalf of all of us, I just want to welcome you back. I'm thrilled to have you here.  \n And so you're asking a pertinent question. So we're earning a lot of money. Our capital cup runneth over, and that's why we increased the dividend. And if you ask me what we'd like to do is to pay out something like 1/3 of normalized earnings. Of course, it's hard to calculate always what normalized earnings are, but we don't mind being a little bit ahead of that sometimes, a little bit behind that sometimes. If I could give people kind of consistent dividend guidance, et cetera. \n I think the far more important question is the 15%. So look at the 15%, I'm going to oversimplify it. That basically will prepare us for the total Basel endgame today roughly. The specifics don't matter that much.  \n Remember, we can do a lot of things to change that in the short run or the long run. But -- and it looks like Basel III endgame may not be the worst case, it will be something less than that. So obviously, when and if that happens, it would free up a lot of capital, and I'm going to say on the order of $20 billion or something like that.  \n And yes, we're -- we've always had the capital hierarchy the same way, which is we're going to use capital to build our business first. And we pay the dividend, the steady dividend. Build the business. And if we think it's appropriate, to buy back stock. We're continuing to buy back stock at $2 billion a year. I personally do not want to buy back a lot more than that at these current prices.  \n I think you've all heard me talk about the world and things like that. So waiting in preparation for Basel. Hopefully, we'll know something later, and then we can be much more specific with you all.  \n But in the meantime, there's also -- it's very important to put in mind, there are short-term uses for capital that are good for shareholders that could reduce our CET1, too. So you may see us do things in the short run that will increase earnings, increase capital -- that are using up that capital. Jeremy mentioned on the -- on one of the things that we know, the balance sheet and how we use the balance sheet for credit and trading, we could do things now.  \n So it's a great position to be in. We're going to be very, very patient. I urge all the analysts to keep in mind, excess capital is not wasted capital, it's earnings in store. We will deploy it in a very good way for our shareholders in due course. \nJeremy Barnum: Betsy, I just wanted to add my welcome back thoughts as well. And just a very minor edit to Jamie's answer. I think he just misspoke when he said $2 billion a year in buybacks, the trajectory. It's $2 billion a quarter. \nJames Dimon: I'm sorry, $2 billion a quarter. \nJeremy Barnum: Otherwise, I have nothing to add to Jamie's very complete answer. But welcome back, Betsy. \nBetsy Graseck: Okay. Thank you so much, and I appreciate it. Looking forward to seeing you at Investor Day on May 20. \nJeremy Barnum: Excellent. Us too. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. \nJames Mitchell: Jeremy, can you speak to the trends you're seeing with respect to deposit migration in the quarter, if there's been any change? Have you seen that migration start to slow or not? \nJeremy Barnum: Yes, a good question, Jim. I think the simplest and best answer to that is not really. So as we've been saying for a while, migration from checking and savings to CDs is sort of the dominant trend that is driving the increase in weighted average rate paid in the consumer deposit franchise. That continues. We continue to capture that money in motion at a very high rate. So we're very happy about what that means about the consumer franchise and the level of engagement that we're seeing. \n I'm aware that there's a little bit of a narrative out there about are we seeing the end of what people sometimes refer to as cash-sorting? We've looked at that data. We see some evidence that maybe it's slowing a little bit. We're quite cautious on that. We really sort of don't think it makes sense to assume they're in a world where checking and savings is paying effectively 0 and the policy rate is above 5%, that you're not going to see ongoing migration. \n And frankly, we expect to see that even in a world where -- even if the current yield curve environment were to change and meaningful cuts were to get reintroduced and we would actually start to see those, we would still expect to see ongoing migration and yield-seeking behavior. So it's quite conceivable. \n And this is actually on the yield curve that we had in the fourth quarter that had 6 cuts in it, we were still nonetheless expecting an increase in weighted average rate paid as that migration continues. So I would say no meaningful change in the trends, and the expectation for ongoing migration is very much still there. \nJames Mitchell: Okay. And just a follow-up on that and just sort of bigger picture on NII. Is that sort of the biggest driver of your outlook? Is it migration? Is it the forward curve? Is it balances? It sounds like it's migration, but just be curious to hear your thoughts on the biggest drivers of upside or downside. \nJeremy Barnum: Yes. So I mean, I think the drivers of, let's say, what's embedded in the current guidance is actually not meaningfully different from what it was in the fourth quarter, meaning it's the current yield curve, which is a little bit stale now, but the snap from quarter end had roughly 3 cuts in it. \n So it's the current yield curve. It's what I just said, the expectation of ongoing internal migration. There is some meaningful offset from card revolve growth, which, while it's a little bit less than it was in prior years, is still a tailwind there. We expect deposit balances to be sort of flat to modestly down. So that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin. \n And then there's obviously the wildcard of potential product-level reprice, which we always say we're going to make those decisions situationally as a function of competitive conditions in the marketplace. \n And you know this, obviously. But in a world where we've got something like $900 billion of deposits paying effectively 0, relatively small changes in the product-level reprice can change the NII run rate by a lot. So the error bands here are pretty wide. And we're always going to stick with our mantra, which has been not losing primary bank relationships and thinking about the long-term health of the franchise when we think about deposit pricing. \nOperator: Our next question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. \nJohn McDonald: Jeremy, you had mentioned at a conference earlier this year that The Street might need to build in more reserve growth for the Card growth. You've had more reserve build. We didn't see that this quarter. Is that just kind of seasonal? And would you still expect the kind of growth math to play out in terms of Card growth and reserve build needs? \nJeremy Barnum: Yes, John. So in short, yes to both questions. So yes, the relative lack of build this quarter is a function of the normal seasonal patterns of Card. Yes, we still expect 12% card loan growth for the full year. And yes, that still means that all else equal, we think the consensus for the allowance build for the back 3 quarters is still a little too low if you map it to that expected card loan growth. \n Obviously, there's the wildcard of what happens with our probabilities and our parameters and the output of our internal process of assessing the SKU and the CECL distribution and so on. And we're not speaking to that one way or the other. So if you guys have your own opinions about that, that's fine. But we're narrowly just saying that, based on the card loan growth, that we expect and normal coverage ratios for that, we do expect build in the back half of the year. \nJohn McDonald: Okay. Got it. And then just a follow-up to make it super clear on the idea of the Markets NII, that outlook being revised down by $1 billion, but revenue-neutral. I guess the obvious thing is there, there's typically an offset in fee income, and you don't guide to that. But the idea would be, the way you're structuring trades, the way the balance sheet is evolving, there's some offset that you'd expect in Markets fees from the lower Markets NII, correct? \nJeremy Barnum: That is exactly right. And specifically, what's going on here is this shift between the on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet in the financing businesses and prime and so on within Markets. And you can actually see a little bit of a pop of the Markets balance sheet in the supplement, and these things are all related. \n So fundamentally, you can think of it as like we either hold equities on the balance sheet, non-interest bearing, high funding expense, negative for NII; or we receive that in total return form through derivatives, exactly the same economics, no impact on NII. \n So that shifts as a function of the sort of borrower relationships in the marketplace in ways that are bottom line effectively neutral. It's second order effects, but they change the geography quite a bit, and that's what happened this quarter. And that's why we've been emphasizing for some time that the NII ex Markets is the better number to focus on in terms of an indicator of how the core banking franchise is performing. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. \nEbrahim Poonawala: I guess just in terms of, Jamie, when you think about the outlook for the economy, would appreciate your thoughts on the health of the customer base, both commercial and consumer. \n And when we think about higher for longer, maybe the economy is too strong so don't get any rate cuts. Are you seeing that when you talk to your customers and the feedback you're getting from your bankers, where the momentum is picking up? \n And I appreciate all the macro risks Jamie's pointed out, but I'm just getting -- trying to get to a sense of what your view is in terms of the most likely outcome based on what you're seeing today from the customers. \nJames Dimon: So I would say consumer customers are fine. The unemployment is very low. Home price dropped, stock price dropped. The amount of income they need to service their debt is still kind of low. But the extra money of the lower-income folks is running out -- not running out, but normalizing. And you see credit normalizing a little bit. \n And of course, higher-income folks still have more money. They're still spending it. So whatever happens, the customer's in pretty good shape. And they're -- if you go into a recession, they'd be in pretty good shape. Businesses are in good shape. If you look at it today, their confidence is up, their order books drop, their profits are up. \n But what I caution people, these are all the same results of a lot of fiscal spending, a lot of QE, et cetera. And so we don't really know what's going to happen. And I also want to look at the year, look at 2 years or 3 years, all the geopolitical effects and oil and gas and how much fiscal spending will actually take place, our elections, et cetera. \n So we're in good -- we're okay right now. It does not mean we're okay down the road. And if you look at any inflection point, being okay in the current time is always true. That was true in '72, it was true in any time you've had it. So I'm just on the more cautious side that how people feel, the confidence levels and all that, that doesn't necessarily stop you from having an inflection point. And so everything is okay today, but you've got to be prepared for a range of outcomes, which we are. \n And the other thing I want to point out because all of these questions about interest rates and yield curves and NII and credit losses, one thing you projected today based on what -- not what we think in economic scenarios, but the generally accepted economic scenario, which is the generally accepted rate cuts of the Fed. But these numbers have always been wrong. You have to ask the question, what if other things happen? Like higher rates with this modest recession, et cetera, then all these numbers change. I just don't think any of us should be surprised if and when that happens. \n And I just think the chance of that happen is higher than other people. I don't know the outcome. We don't want to guess the outcome. I've never seen anyone actually positively predict a big inflection point in the economy literally in my life or in history. \nEbrahim Poonawala: That's helpful. And just tied to that, as we look at commercial real estate, both for JP and for the economy overall, is higher rates alone enough to create more vulnerabilities and issues beyond office CRE? How would you characterize the health of the CRE market? \nJames Dimon: Yes. So I'll put it into 2 buckets. First of all, we're fine. We've got good reserves against office. We think the multifamily is fine. Jeremy can give you more detail on that if you want. \n But if you think of real estate, there's 2 pieces. If rates go up, think of the yield curve, the whole yield curve, not Fed funds, but the 10-year bond rate, it goes up 2%. All assets, all assets, every asset on the planet, including real estate, is worth 20% less. Well obviously, that creates a little bit of stress and strain, and people have to roll those over and finance it more. But it's not just true for real estate, it's true for everybody. And that happens, leveraged loans, real estate will have some effect. \n The second thing is the why does that happen? If that happens because we have a strong economy, well, that's not so bad for real estate because people will be hiring and filling things out. And other financial assets. \n If that happens because we have stagflation, well, that's the worst case. All of a sudden, you are going to have more vacancies. You are going to have more companies cutting back. You are going to have less leases. It will affect -- including multifamily, that will filter through the whole economy in a way that people haven't really experienced since 2010. \n So I'd just put in the back of your mind, the why is important, the interest rates are important, the recession is important. If things stay where they are today, we have kind of the soft landing that seems to be embedded in the marketplace, everyone -- the real estate will muddle through. \n Obviously, it'd be idiosyncratic if you're in different cities and different types and B versus A buildings and all that, but people will muddle through. They won't muddle through under higher rates with the recession. That would be tougher on a lot of folks, and not just real estate, if in fact that happens. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. \nL. Erika Penala: Given that your response to Betsy's question is that 15% CET1 today prepares you for Basel III endgame as written. You earn 22% on -- without the FDIC assessment. Ahead of Investor Day, I guess, 6 weeks from now or 5 weeks from now, as we think about that 17% through-the-cycle target, if you're at the right capital level per you guys, where are you overearning today? \nJeremy Barnum: Right. So interesting framing of the question, Erika. So I think we've been pretty consistent about where we're overearning, right? So obviously, one major area is that we're overearning in deposit margins, especially in consumer. And that's sort of why we're expecting sequential declines in NII, why we've talked about compressing deposit margins and increases in weighted average rate paid. \n So I think that's probably the single biggest source of, let's call it, excess earnings currently. You also heard Jamie say that we're overearning in credit. I mean, wholesale charge-offs have been particularly low, but we have built for that. So in the current run rate, a bit less clear, the extent of what we're earning. \n And in Card, of course, while charge-offs are now close to normalized, essentially, we did go through an extended period of charge-offs being very low by historical standards, although that was coupled with NII also being low by historical standards. So from a bottom line perspective, it's not entirely clear what the net of that was. But broadly, it's really deposit margin that's the biggest single factor in the overearning narrative. \n Embedded in your question, I think, is a little bit of the what are you thinking about the 17% CET1 in light of the current level of capital and so on. And you did talk about Investor Day. I was hoping that we would have interesting things to say about that at Investor Day in light of potential updates of the Basel III endgame, given that the single most important factor for that 17% is how much denominator expansion do we see through the Basel III endgame. \n At the rate we're going, we won't actually know that much more about that by Investor Day. So we might not have that much more to say, except to reiterate what I've said in the past, which is that whatever it is, it's going to be very good, our returns in absolute terms, very good in relative terms. We will optimize. We will seek to reprice. We will adjust in various ways as to the best of our ability. \n But given the structure of the rule, as proposed at least, there -- a lot of this cannot be optimized away. And so in the base case, you have to think of it as a headwind. \nL. Erika Penala: Got it. And just as a follow-up question. You mentioned that the current curve that you set your NII outlook upon is stale. I guess, does it matter? That it seems like the market down-pricing; and obviously no June cut; no September cut; and a toss-up in December, which shouldn't matter for this year. As we think about that $90 billion, does the -- if we price rate cuts out totally, does that matter much? Given that it seems like June is the only one that... \nJeremy Barnum: Yes. Sorry, Erika. So just quick things on this. One, let's focus on NII ex, not on total NII. So I'd anchor you to the $89 billion. Number two, if you want to do math for like the changes of the average funds rate for the rest of the year and multiply that times the EAR, like be my guest. Looks like as good as an approach as any. \n But I would just once again remind you, of the $900 billion of deposits paying practically 0, that very small changes there can make a big difference. And we've got other factors, we've got the impact of QT on deposit balances, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So we want to make sure that we don't get too precise here. We're giving you our best guess based on a series of assumptions. And it's going to be what it's going to be. \nJames Dimon: Which we know are going to be wrong. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. \nKenneth Usdin: Jeremy, I was wondering if you could expand a little bit on one of your prepared comments. When you talked about -- we will have hopes and expectations for the Investment Banking pipeline to continue to move along. We obviously saw the good movement in ECM and DCM and the lag in Advisory. Can you just talk about that? \n You mentioned like potential cautiousness around the election. Just what are you hearing from both the corporate side and the sponsor side with -- when it relates to M&A on like go, no-go type of feel and conversation levels? And then what are you thinking we need to have to kick start just another good level of IPO activity in the ECM markets? \nJeremy Barnum: Sure. Yes. Let me take the IPO first. So we had been a little bit cautious there. Some cohorts and vintages of IPOs had performed somewhat disappointingly. And I think that narrative has changed to a meaningful degree this quarter. So I think we're seeing better IPO performance. Obviously, equity markets have been under a little bit of pressure the last few days. But in general, we have a lot of support there, and that always helps. \n Dialogue is quite good. A lot of interesting different types of conversations happening with global firms, multinationals, carve-out type things. So dialogue is good. Valuation environment is better, like sort of decent reasons for optimism there. \n But of course, with ECM, there's always a pipeline dynamic, and conditions were particularly good this quarter. And so we caution a little bit there about pull-forward, which is even more acute, I think, on the DCM side, given that quite a high percentage of the total amount of debt that needed to be refinanced this year has gotten done in the first quarter. So that's a factor. \n And then the question of M&A, I think, is probably the single most important question, not only because of its impact on M&A but also because of its knock-on impact on DCM through acquisition financing and so on. And there's the well-known kind of regulatory headwinds there, and that's definitely having a bit of a chilling effect. \n I don't know. I've heard some narratives that maybe there's like some pent-up deal demand. Who knows how important politics are in all this. So I don't know. We're fundamentally, as I said I think on the press call, happy to see momentum this quarter, happy to see momentum in announced M&A. Little bit cautious about the pull-forward dynamic, a little bit cautious about the regulatory headwinds. And in the end, we're just going to fight really hard for our share of the wallet here. \nKenneth Usdin: Got it. And I guess I'll just stick on the theme of capital markets. And not surprising at all to see a little bit tougher comp in FICC. I think you guys have kind of indicated that maybe a flattish fee pool is a reasonable place, and I know that's impossible to guide on. \n But just maybe just talk through some of the dynamics in terms of activity across the fixed income and equities business. And do you feel like this is the type of environment where, given that lingering uncertainty about rates, clients are either more engaged or less engaged in terms of how they're positioning portfolios? \nJeremy Barnum: Yes, a really good question. I would say, in general, that the sort of volatility and uncertainty in the rate environment overall on balance is actually supportive for the Markets revenue pool. And I think that, together with generally more balance sheet deployment as well as sort of some level of natural background growth, is one of the reasons that the overall level of Markets revenue has stabilized at meaningfully above what was normal in the pre-pandemic period. \n And while that does occasionally make us a little bit anxious like, oh, is this sustainable? Might there be downside here? For now, that does seem to be the new normal. And I do think that having rates off the lower 0 bound and a sort of more normal dynamic in global rates, that not only affects the rates business, but it affects the foreign exchange business. It generally just makes asset allocation decisions more important and more interesting. \n And so all of that creates risk management needs, and active managers need to grapple with it and so on and so forth. So I think that those are some of the themes on the Markets side at the margin. And yes, we'll see how the rest of the year goes. But it sort of seems to be behaving relatively normally, I would say. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. \nMichael Mayo: Jamie, I'm just trying to reconcile some of your concerns in your CEO letter. I'm sure the 60 pages, I can see you put a lot of effort into that and it's appreciated. But you talked about scenarios, tail risk, macro risk, geopolitical risk and all that over several years, it's not weeks or months, I get it. \n On the other hand, the firm is investing so much more outside the U.S., whether it's commercial or some digital banking, Consumer or Wholesale Payments. So I'm just trying to reconcile kind of your actions with your words. And specifically, how is global Wholesale Payments going? You mentioned you're in 60 countries. You do business a lot more. How is that business in particular doing? \nJeremy Barnum: Right, Mike. So I'm sorry to tell you that Jamie actually left us because he's at a leadership offsite. That's why he was here remote. So I think he left the call in my hands for better or for worse. So -- but let me try to address some of your points and without sort of speaking for Jamie here. \n I think that when we talk about the impact of the geopolitical uncertainty on the outlook, part of the point there is to note that the U.S. is not isolated from that, right? If we have global macroeconomic problems as a result of geopolitical situations, that's not only a problem outside the U.S. That affects the global economy and therefore the U.S. and therefore our corporate customers, et cetera, et cetera. \n So -- and in that context, keeping in mind what we always say, that we invest through the cycle, that we sort of go -- we don't go into countries and then leave countries, et cetera. Obviously, we adjust around the edges. We manage risks. We do make choices as a function of the overall geopolitical environment. \n But broadly, the notion that we would pull back meaningfully from one of the key competitive strengths that this company has always had, which is its sort of global character because of a particular moment geopolitically would just be inconsistent with how we've always operated. \n And in terms of the Wholesale Payments business, it's going great. It's -- we're taking share. There's been a lot of innovation there, a lot of investment in technology, a lot of connectivity to payment systems in different countries around the world. And yes, I'm sure we'll give you more color and other settings on that, but it's a good story. It's a nice thing to see. \nMichael Mayo: Just as a follow-up to that, then. Why is it doing great in terms of Wholesale Payments, given such the dislocations in the world from wars to supply chain changes, everything else, why is Wholesale Payments doing great? \nJeremy Barnum: Well, I think one of the things about payments businesses is that, in some sense, they're -- I mean, recession-proof is probably the wrong word. And in any case, we're not dealing with a recession, but we're talking fundamentally about moving money through pipes around the world. And that's a thing that people need to do more or less no matter what. So that's one piece. \n But I think the other piece is that our willingness to invest, which has always been a focus of yours, is one of the key things separating us in this business right now. And so we are seeing the benefits of that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. \nGlenn Schorr: Your commentary with Ken's questions were great and clear on Investment Banking for the near term and this year. I have a bigger-picture question in terms of you're so good in spelling out where you're overearning. Do you feel like you're underearning on the Investment Banking side? \n And I just use some of your own numbers from the past of like, look, the market has added like $40 trillion of equity market cap and $40 trillion of fixed income market cap last 10 years, yes the wallet is like 20% plus below the 10-year average. So is that -- is there just a bigger upside, and it's just a matter of when, not if? \nJeremy Barnum: Yes, Glenn, in short, yes. I mean, I think we're not shy about saying that we're underearning in Investment Banking now. Clearly, we're below cycle averages, as you point out. We've been talking about when do we get back to the pre-pandemic wallet. But as you know, at this point, it was like March 2020, right, it was the beginning of the pandemic. So it's like 4 years ago at this point. So there's been GDP growth, especially in nominal terms during that period, and you would expect the wallet to grow with that. \n So I do think there's meaningful upside in the Investment Banking fee wallet. As I've noted, there are some headwinds, I think, particularly in M&A. But over time, you would hope that the amount of M&A is a function of the underlying industrial logic rather than the regulatory environment. So you could see some mean reversion there. \n And yes, so that's why we're sort of leaning in. We're engaging with clients. We're making sure that we're appropriately resourced for a more robust level of the wallet and fighting for every dollar of share. \nGlenn Schorr: Maybe one other follow-up. You're always investing. You clearly get paid in growth across the franchise as you do. But relative to a lot of other banks that have been keeping the expenses a lot closer to flat, do you envision an environment -- or maybe I should rephrase that. What type of environment would have JPMorgan pull back on this tremendous investment spending wave that you've been going through? \nJeremy Barnum: Sure. So I think the first thing to say, which is somewhat obvious, but I'm going to say it anyway, is that there are some like auto-governors in this, right? Like some portion of the expense base is directly related to revenue, whether it's volume-related commissions, whether it's incentive compensation, whether it's other things. So there are some auto-correcting elements of the expense base that would happen automatically as part of the normal discipline. So that's point one. \n Point two is that, independently of the environment, we are always looking for efficiencies. And it's a little bit hard to see it. And in our world, where we're guiding to, I guess now with the special assessment added, $91 billion of expenses, it's hard to tell a story about all the efficiencies that are being generated underneath. But that is part of the DNA in the company. That does happen in BAU all the time as we grind things out, get the benefits of scale and try to extract that efficiency. \n And I think, to get to the heart of your question, which is, okay, in what type of environment would we make different strategic questions? And in the end, I think that's a little bit about what that environment is really like. So if you talk about like a normal recession with visibility on the cycle, would we change our long-term strategic investment plans, which are always built up from a financial modeling perspective, assuming resilience through the cycle? No, we wouldn't. \n Could there be some environments that, for whatever reason, change the business case for certain investments or even certain businesses that lead us to make meaningfully different strategic choices? Yes, but that would be because the through-the-cycle analysis has changed for some reason. I just don't see us fundamentally making strategically different decisions if the strategic outlook is unchanged, simply because of the business cycle in the short term. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. \nMatthew O'Connor: You mentioned one use of capital is to lean into the trading businesses with your balance sheet. And we did see the trading assets going up Q2, which is probably seasonal, but also up a lot year-over-year, but not necessarily translate into higher revenues. And I know they don't like match up necessarily each quarter. But maybe just elaborate like how you're leaning into the trading with the balance sheet and how you expect that to benefit you over time. \nJeremy Barnum: Yes, sure. So let me break this question down into a couple of different parts. So I think what Jamie was sort of suggesting is that you can think of a concept that's kind of like strategic capital versus tactical capital, for lack of a better term. \n And what he's kind of saying is that, in a moment where you're carrying a lot of excess capital sort of for strategic reasons, you have the ability, at least in theory, to deploy portions of that with kind of like -- into relatively short-duration assets or strategies or client opportunities in whatever moment for whatever reason in what might be thought of as a tactical sense. \n So he's just pointing out that, that's an option that you have. And the extent to which this quarter's increase in Markets RWA is a reflection of that, maybe a little bit, but probably not. I agree with you that it's hard in any given quarter to specifically link the change in capital and RWA to a change in revenue. There's just too many moving parts there. \n But for sure, one thing that's true is that higher run rate of the Markets businesses as a whole that we talked about a second ago is linked also to a higher deployment of balance sheet into those businesses. So as you well know, we pride ourselves on being extremely analytical and extremely disciplined in how we analyze capital liquidity, balance sheet deployment, G-SIB capacity utilization, et cetera, in the Markets business. \n And we don't just chase revenue. We go after returns fully measured. And that's part of the DNA, and we continue to do it, and we will. So we still are operating under multiple binding constraints, and obviously, the environment is complex. So the ability to sort of throw a ton of capital at opportunities is not quite that simple always. \n But big picture, we are clearly in a very, very strong capital position, which is in no small part in anticipation of all of the uncertainty. But it does also mean that, if opportunities arise between now and when the Basel III endgame is final, we are very well positioned to take advantage of those opportunities. \nMatthew O'Connor: Got it. And then just separately, within the consumer card businesses, you highlighted volumes are up 9% year-over-year. Obviously, still a very strong piece. Any trends within that, that are worth noting in terms of changes in spend category -- either overall or among certain segments? \nJeremy Barnum: Maybe a little bit. Jamie already alluded somewhat to this. So I do think spend is fine but not boomy, broadly speaking, I would say. You can look at it a lot of different ways, inflation cohorts, et cetera. But when you kind of triangulate that, you get back to this kind of flattish picture. \n There is a little bit of evidence of substituting out of discretionary into nondiscretionary. And I think the single most notable thing is just this effect where in the -- while it is true that real incomes have gone up in the lowest-income cohorts, within that, there's obviously a probability of distribution, and there's some -- or rather just a distribution of outcomes. And there are some such people whose real incomes are not up, they're down, and who are therefore struggling a little bit, unfortunately. And what you observe in the spending patterns of those people is some meaningful slowing rather than what you might have feared, which is sort of aggressive levering up. \n So I think that's maybe an economic indicator of sorts, although this portion of the population is small enough that I'm not sure the read-across is that big. But it is encouraging from a credit perspective because it just means that people are behaving kind of rationally and in a sort of normal post-pandemic type of way as they manage their own balance sheets. And that's sort of at the margin good news from a credit perspective. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. \nGerard Cassidy: Notwithstanding your guys' outlook for uncertainty, and of course, Jamie talked about it in the shareholder letter and addressed it also on this call when he was here earlier. Can you guys share -- or can you share with us the color on what's going on in the corporate lending market in terms of spreads seem to be getting tighter? It's not reflecting, I don't think, a real fear out there in the global geopolitical world. And any color just on what you guys are seeing in the leveraged loan market as well. \nJeremy Barnum: Right. So I think what's true about spreads in general, just broadly credit spreads, including secondary markets, and to some extent the leverage lending space, is that they're exceptionally tight. \n So I'm sure that's reversed a little bit in the last few days. But broadly throughout the quarter, we've really seen credit spreads tighten quite a bit. You even see that a little bit in our OCI this quarter, where losses in OCI that we would have had from higher rates have been meaningfully offset by tighter credit spreads in the portfolio. So broadly sort of in keeping with the big run-up that we saw in equity markets and the general sort of bullish tone, you saw quite a bit of credit spread tightening that -- in secondary markets. \n That, I think, has manifested itself a little bit in the leveraged lending space in the normal way that it does in that there's a lot of competition among providers for the revenue pool. And you start to see a little bit of loosening of terms, which always makes us a little bit concerned. And as we have in the past, we are going to be very well prepared to lose share in that space if we don't like the terms. We never compromise on structure there. So you are seeing a little bit of that. \n I think that away from the leveraged lending space, in the broader C&I space, there was a moment a few months ago where I think in no small part as a result of banks generally anticipating this more challenging capital environment and sort of disciplining a little bit their lending, we were seeing a little bit of widening actually in those corporate lending spreads. I don't know if that trend has like survived the last few weeks, and it's always a little bit hard to observe in any case. \n But I would say broadly the dynamics or the tension between people trying to be careful with their balance sheets and the fact that overall asset prices and conditions are quite supportive, and secondary market credit spreads have rallied a lot. \nGerard Cassidy: And I guess as a tie-in to that question and answer. We've read and seen so much about the private credit growth in this country by private credit companies. Can you give us some color on what you're seeing there as both as a competitor but also as a client of JPMorgan, how you balance the 2 out? Where you may see them bidding on business that you'd like, but at the same time, you're supporting their business. \nJeremy Barnum: Right. Yes. I mean, I think that tension between us as a provider of secured financing to some portions of the private credit, private equity community, now you're talking about different parts of the capital structure. But we do recognize that, that we compete in some areas and we are clients of each other in other areas. And that's part of the franchise, and it's all good at some level. \n But narrowly on private credit, it is interesting to observe what's going on there. So I would say for us, the strategy there is very much to be product-agnostic, actually. It's not so much like, oh, is it private credit or is it syndicated lending? What does it take to be good at this stuff? And what it takes is stuff that we have and have always had and that we're very good at in each individual silos. So you have -- you need underwriting skills, structuring skill, origination, distribution, secondary trading, risk appetite, credit analysis capabilities. And this is what we do, and we're really good at it. \n And increasingly, what you see actually is that as you see us doing a little bit, as the private credit space gets bigger, it starts to make sense to actually bring in some co-lenders so that you can sort of do big enough deals without having undue concentration risks. I mean, even if you have the capital, you just may not want the concentration risk. \n And so in a funny way, the private credit space becomes a little bit more like the syndicated lending space. At the same time, the syndicated lending space, being influenced a little bit by these private credit unitranche structures, gets pushed a little bit in the private credit direction in terms of like speed of execution, other aspects of how that business works. \n So we're watching it. The competitive dynamics are interesting. Certainly, there's some pressure in some areas. But we really do think that our overall value proposition and competitive position here is second to none. And so we're looking forward to the future here. \nOperator: Our last question comes from Charles Peabody with Portales. \nCharles Peabody: A couple of questions on the First Republic acquisition. Some of us obviously thought that would be a home run, and I'm glad to see that Jamie Dimon validated that in his annual letter. \n When you look at the first quarter, it annualizes out to $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion, above the $2 billion that Jamie published in the letter. Now I know you don't want to extrapolate that. But can you remind us what sort of cost savings you still have in that? Because this quarter did see expenses come down to $800 million, down from $900 million. \n And then secondly, is there an offset to that where the accretion becomes less and less, and that's why you don't want to extrapolate the $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion? So that's my first question. \nJeremy Barnum: Okay. Thanks, Charlie. And I'm going to do my best to answer your question while sticking to my sort of guns on not giving too much First Republic-specific guidance. But I do think that kind of framework you're articulating is broadly correct. So let me go through the pieces. \n So yes, the current quarter's results annualize to more than the $2 billion Jamie talked about. Yes, a big part of that reason is discount accretion, which was very front-loaded as a result of short-dated assets. So that's part of the reason that you see that converge. Yes, it's also true that we expect the expense run rate to decline later in the year as we continue making progress on integration. Obviously, as I think as I mentioned to you last quarter, from a full year perspective, you just have the offset of the full year calendarization effect. \n There was maybe an embedded question then there, too, about we had talked about $2.5 billion of integration expense. And the integration is real, the expenses are real, and also the time spent on that is quite real. It's a lot of work for a lot of people. It's going well, but we're not done yet, and it takes a lot of effort. But broadly, I think that our expectation for integration expense are probably coming in a bit lower than we originally assumed on the morning of the deal for a couple of reasons. \n One is that the framework around the time was understandably quite conservative and sort of assumed that we would kind of lose a meaningful portion of the franchise and would sort of need to size the expense base accordingly. And of course, it's worked out, to your point, quite a bit better than that. And therefore, the amount of expenses that is necessary to keep this bigger franchise is higher. And that means less integration expense associated with taking down those numbers. \n It's probably also true that the integration assumptions were conservative. They were based on kind of more typical type of bank M&A assumptions as opposed to the particular nature of this deal, including the FDIC and so on and so forth. \n So yes, I think that probably is a pretty complete answer to your question. Thanks, Charlie. \nCharles Peabody: As a quick follow-up, where are the next home runs going to come from? And this is more strategic beyond just JPMorgan. But there's probably going to be more regional bank failures, whether it's this year or next year, and opportunities to pick those up. \n But what you're seeing is that private equity and family offices are setting up to participate in this next round of bank failures. Mnuchin's buying of NYCB is clearly to create a platform for roll-ups of failed banks. And then there are other family offices that have filed shelf registrations for bank holding companies whose specific purpose is to buy failed banks. \n So where -- do you think that these opportunities are going to be competed away by private credit? And as part of that, do you think the regulators are going to view private credit as a different party and less attractive party versus bank takeovers of failed banks? So that's my question. \nJeremy Barnum: Right. Okay, Charlie, there's a lot in there. And to be honest, I just don't love the idea of spending a lot of time on this call speculating about bank failures. Like you obviously have a particular view about the next wave in the landscape. I'm not going to bother debating that with you. But I guess let me just try to say a couple of things, doing my best to answer your question. \n Like as we talked about earlier, we have a lot of capital. And as Jamie says, the capital is earnings in store. And right now, we don't see a lot of really compelling opportunities to deploy the capital. But if opportunities arise, despite the uncertainty about the Basel III endgame, we will be well positioned to deploy it. \n I think embedded there is also sort of a question about the FDIC and the FDIC's attitude towards different types of bidders. And obviously, there's a lot of thinking and analysis happening about the entire process and some recent forums and speeches on bank resolution and so on and so forth. \n And I think probably we can all agree that it's better, all else equal, for the system to have as much capital available and as many different types of capital available to ensure that things are stabilized if anything ever goes wrong. But the mechanics of how you do that when you're talking about banks are not trivial and not to be underestimated. So I guess that's probably as much as I have on that. \nOperator: We have no further questions at this time. \nJeremy Barnum: Thank you, everyone. \nOperator: Thank you all for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time, and have a great rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeremy Barnum",
            "content": "Thank you very much, and good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back.  \n Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $13.4 billion, EPS of $4.44 on revenue of $42.5 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 21%. These results included a $725 million increase to the special assessment resulting from the FDIC's updated estimate of expected losses from the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.  \n Touching on a couple of highlights. Firm-wide IB fees were up 18% year-on-year, reflecting particular strength in underwriting fees. And we have seen strong net inflows across AWM as well as in the CCB and Wealth Management business.  \n On Page 2, we have some more detail. This is the last quarter we'll discuss results excluding First Republic, given that going forward, First Republic results will naturally be included in the prior period, making year-on-year results comparable. For this quarter, First Republic contributed $1.7 billion of revenue, $806 million of expense and $668 million of net income.  \n Now focusing on the firm-wide results excluding First Republic. Revenue of $40.9 billion was up $1.5 billion or 4% year-on-year. NII ex Markets was up $736 million or 4% driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates as well as higher revolving balances in card, largely offset by deposit margin compression and lower deposit balances in CCB. NIR ex Markets was up $1.2 billion or 12% driven by higher firm-wide asset management and Investment Banking fees as well as lower net investment securities losses. And Markets revenue was down $400 million or 5% year-on-year.  \n Expenses of $22 billion were up $1.8 billion or 9% year-on-year driven by higher compensation, including growth in employees and the increase to the FDIC special assessment. And credit costs were $1.9 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2 billion and a net reserve release of $38 million. Net charge-offs were up $116 million predominantly driven by Card.  \n On to balance sheet and capital on Page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15%, relatively flat versus the prior quarter, reflecting net income which was predominantly offset by higher RWA and capital distribution. This quarter's higher RWA is largely due to seasonal effects, including higher client activity in Markets and higher risk weights on deferred tax assets, partially offset by lower Card loans.  \n Now let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 4. Consumers remain financially healthy, supported by a resilient labor market. While cash buffers have largely normalized, balances were still above pre-pandemic levels, and wages are keeping pace with inflation. When looking at a stable cohort of customers, overall spend is in line with the prior year.  \n Turning now to the financial results excluding First Republic. CCB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $16.6 billion, which was up 1% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was down 4% year-on-year, reflecting lower NII on lower deposits with average balances down 7% as our CD mix increased. Client investment assets were up 25% year-on-year driven by market performance and strong net inflows.  \n In Home Lending, revenue was up 10% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher NII and production revenue. Originations, while still modest, were up 10%.  \n Moving to Card Services & Auto. Revenue was up 8% year-on-year driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by higher card acquisition costs from new account growth and lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 13% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve. And in auto, originations were $8.9 billion, down 3%, while we maintained healthy margins and market share. Expenses of $8.8 billion were up 9% year-on-year, largely driven by field compensation and continued growth in technology and marketing.  \n In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.9 billion, driven by net charge-offs, which were up $825 million year-on-year predominantly due to continued normalization in Card. The net reserve build was $45 million, reflecting the build in Card largely offset by a release in Home Lending.  \n Next, the Corporate & Investment Bank on Page 5. Before reporting CIB's results, I want to note that this will also be the last quarter we will be -- we will report earnings for the CIB and CB as standalone segments. Between now and Investor Day, we will furnish an 8-K with historical results, including 5 quarters and 2 full years of history consistent with the structure of the new Commercial and Investment Bank segment, in line with the reorganization that was announced in January.  \n Turning back to this quarter. CIB reported net income of $4.8 billion on revenue of $13.6 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $2 billion was up 27% year-on-year. IB fees were up 21% year-on-year, and we ranked #1 with year-to-date wallet share of 9.1%. In Advisory, fees were down 21% driven by fewer large completed deals. Underwriting fees were up significantly, benefiting from improved market conditions with debt up 58% and equity up 51%.  \n In terms of the outlook. While we are encouraged by the level of capital markets activity we saw this quarter, we need to be mindful that some meaningful portion of that is likely pulling forward from later in the year. Similarly, while it was encouraging to see some positive momentum in announced M&A in the quarter, it remains to be seen whether that will continue, and the Advisory business still faces structural headwinds from the regulatory environment. Payments revenue was $2.4 billion, down 1% year-on-year, as deposit margin normalization and deposit-related client credits were largely offset by higher fee-based revenue and deposit balances.  \n Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $8 billion, down 5% year-on-year. Fixed income was down 7% driven by lower activity in rates and commodities compared to a strong prior year quarter, partially offset by strong results in Securitized Products. Equity Markets was flat. Securities Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 3% year-on-year. Expenses of $7.2 billion were down 4% year-on-year predominantly driven by lower legal expense.  \n Moving to the Commercial Bank on Page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.6 billion. Revenue of $3.6 billion was up 3% year-on-year driven by higher noninterest revenue. Gross Investment Banking and Markets revenue of $913 million was up 4% year-on-year with increased IB fees, largely offset by lower Markets revenue compared to a strong prior year quarter. Payments revenue of $1.9 billion was down 2% year-on-year driven by lower deposit margins and balances, largely offset by fee growth, net of higher deposit-related client credits. Expenses of $1.5 billion were up 13% year-on-year predominantly driven by higher compensation, reflecting an increase in employees, including for office and technology investments, as well as higher volume-related expenses.  \n Average deposits were down 3% year-on-year, primarily driven by lower nonoperating deposits and down 1% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting seasonally lower balances. Loans were flat quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were down 1%, reflecting muted demand for new loans as clients remain cautious. And CRE loans were flat as higher rates continue to have an impact on originations and sales activity. Finally, credit costs were a net benefit of $35 million, including a net reserve release of $101 million and net charge-offs of $66 million.  \n Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1 billion with pretax margin of 28%. Revenue of $4.7 billion was down 1% year-on-year. Excluding net investment valuation gains in the prior year, revenue was up 5% driven by higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, partially offset by lower NII due to deposit margin compression.  \n Expenses of $3.4 billion were up 11% year-on-year largely driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation; continued growth in our private banking advisor teams; and the impact of the JPMorgan Asset Management China acquisition; as well as higher distribution fees.  \n For the quarter, long-term net inflows were $34 billion, led by equities and fixed income. AUM of $3.6 trillion was up 19% year-on-year. And client assets of $5.2 trillion were up 20% year-on-year driven by higher market levels and continued net inflow. And finally, loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter and deposits were flat.  \n Turning to Corporate on Page 8. Corporate reported net income of $918 million. Revenue was $2.3 billion, up $1.3 billion year-on-year. NII was $2.5 billion, up $737 million year-on-year driven by the impact of the balance sheet mix and higher rates. NIR was a net loss of $188 million. The current quarter included net investment securities losses of $366 million compared with net securities losses of $868 million in the prior year quarter. Expenses of $1 billion were up $889 million year-on-year predominantly driven by the increase to the FDIC special assessment.  \n To finish up, we have the outlook on Page 9. We now expect NII ex Markets to be approximately $89 billion based on a forward curve that contained 3 rate cuts at quarter end. Our total NII guidance remains approximately $90 billion, which implies a decrease in our Markets NII guidance from around $2 billion to around $1 billion. The primary driver of that reduction is balance sheet growth and mix shift in the Markets business. And as a reminder, changes in Markets NII are generally revenue-neutral. Our outlook for adjusted expense is now about $91 billion, reflecting the increase to the FDIC special assessment I mentioned upfront. And on credit, we continue to expect the 2024 Card net charge-off rate to be below 3.5%.  \n Finally, you may have noticed that our effective tax rate has increased this quarter, and it will likely stay around 23% this year, absent discrete items, which can vary quite a bit. The driver of this change is the firm's adoption of the proportional amortization method for certain tax equity investments.  \n Our managed rate is unchanged, and it should average about 3.5% above the effective tax rate. This is a smaller gap than we've previously observed, and we expect this approximate relationship to persist going forward, although the difference will continue to fluctuate as it has in the past. For the avoidance of doubt, these changes have no meaningful impact on expected annual net income. We're just mentioning this to help with your models.  \n So to wrap up. We're pleased with another quarter of strong operating results even as the journey towards NII normalization begins. While we remain confident in our ability to produce strong returns and manage risk across a range of scenarios, the economic, geopolitical and regulatory uncertainties that we have been talking about for some time remain prominent, and we are focused on being prepared to navigate those challenges as well as any others that may come our way.  \n And with that, let's open up the line for Q&A. Betsy, I just wanted to add my welcome back thoughts as well. And just a very minor edit to Jamie's answer. I think he just misspoke when he said $2 billion a year in buybacks, the trajectory. It's $2 billion a quarter. Otherwise, I have nothing to add to Jamie's very complete answer. But welcome back, Betsy. Excellent. Us too. Yes, a good question, Jim. I think the simplest and best answer to that is not really. So as we've been saying for a while, migration from checking and savings to CDs is sort of the dominant trend that is driving the increase in weighted average rate paid in the consumer deposit franchise. That continues. We continue to capture that money in motion at a very high rate. So we're very happy about what that means about the consumer franchise and the level of engagement that we're seeing. \n I'm aware that there's a little bit of a narrative out there about are we seeing the end of what people sometimes refer to as cash-sorting? We've looked at that data. We see some evidence that maybe it's slowing a little bit. We're quite cautious on that. We really sort of don't think it makes sense to assume they're in a world where checking and savings is paying effectively 0 and the policy rate is above 5%, that you're not going to see ongoing migration. \n And frankly, we expect to see that even in a world where -- even if the current yield curve environment were to change and meaningful cuts were to get reintroduced and we would actually start to see those, we would still expect to see ongoing migration and yield-seeking behavior. So it's quite conceivable. \n And this is actually on the yield curve that we had in the fourth quarter that had 6 cuts in it, we were still nonetheless expecting an increase in weighted average rate paid as that migration continues. So I would say no meaningful change in the trends, and the expectation for ongoing migration is very much still there. Yes. So I mean, I think the drivers of, let's say, what's embedded in the current guidance is actually not meaningfully different from what it was in the fourth quarter, meaning it's the current yield curve, which is a little bit stale now, but the snap from quarter end had roughly 3 cuts in it. \n So it's the current yield curve. It's what I just said, the expectation of ongoing internal migration. There is some meaningful offset from card revolve growth, which, while it's a little bit less than it was in prior years, is still a tailwind there. We expect deposit balances to be sort of flat to modestly down. So that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin. \n And then there's obviously the wildcard of potential product-level reprice, which we always say we're going to make those decisions situationally as a function of competitive conditions in the marketplace. \n And you know this, obviously. But in a world where we've got something like $900 billion of deposits paying effectively 0, relatively small changes in the product-level reprice can change the NII run rate by a lot. So the error bands here are pretty wide. And we're always going to stick with our mantra, which has been not losing primary bank relationships and thinking about the long-term health of the franchise when we think about deposit pricing. Yes, John. So in short, yes to both questions. So yes, the relative lack of build this quarter is a function of the normal seasonal patterns of Card. Yes, we still expect 12% card loan growth for the full year. And yes, that still means that all else equal, we think the consensus for the allowance build for the back 3 quarters is still a little too low if you map it to that expected card loan growth. \n Obviously, there's the wildcard of what happens with our probabilities and our parameters and the output of our internal process of assessing the SKU and the CECL distribution and so on. And we're not speaking to that one way or the other. So if you guys have your own opinions about that, that's fine. But we're narrowly just saying that, based on the card loan growth, that we expect and normal coverage ratios for that, we do expect build in the back half of the year. That is exactly right. And specifically, what's going on here is this shift between the on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet in the financing businesses and prime and so on within Markets. And you can actually see a little bit of a pop of the Markets balance sheet in the supplement, and these things are all related. \n So fundamentally, you can think of it as like we either hold equities on the balance sheet, non-interest bearing, high funding expense, negative for NII; or we receive that in total return form through derivatives, exactly the same economics, no impact on NII. \n So that shifts as a function of the sort of borrower relationships in the marketplace in ways that are bottom line effectively neutral. It's second order effects, but they change the geography quite a bit, and that's what happened this quarter. And that's why we've been emphasizing for some time that the NII ex Markets is the better number to focus on in terms of an indicator of how the core banking franchise is performing. Right. So interesting framing of the question, Erika. So I think we've been pretty consistent about where we're overearning, right? So obviously, one major area is that we're overearning in deposit margins, especially in consumer. And that's sort of why we're expecting sequential declines in NII, why we've talked about compressing deposit margins and increases in weighted average rate paid. \n So I think that's probably the single biggest source of, let's call it, excess earnings currently. You also heard Jamie say that we're overearning in credit. I mean, wholesale charge-offs have been particularly low, but we have built for that. So in the current run rate, a bit less clear, the extent of what we're earning. \n And in Card, of course, while charge-offs are now close to normalized, essentially, we did go through an extended period of charge-offs being very low by historical standards, although that was coupled with NII also being low by historical standards. So from a bottom line perspective, it's not entirely clear what the net of that was. But broadly, it's really deposit margin that's the biggest single factor in the overearning narrative. \n Embedded in your question, I think, is a little bit of the what are you thinking about the 17% CET1 in light of the current level of capital and so on. And you did talk about Investor Day. I was hoping that we would have interesting things to say about that at Investor Day in light of potential updates of the Basel III endgame, given that the single most important factor for that 17% is how much denominator expansion do we see through the Basel III endgame. \n At the rate we're going, we won't actually know that much more about that by Investor Day. So we might not have that much more to say, except to reiterate what I've said in the past, which is that whatever it is, it's going to be very good, our returns in absolute terms, very good in relative terms. We will optimize. We will seek to reprice. We will adjust in various ways as to the best of our ability. \n But given the structure of the rule, as proposed at least, there -- a lot of this cannot be optimized away. And so in the base case, you have to think of it as a headwind. Yes. Sorry, Erika. So just quick things on this. One, let's focus on NII ex, not on total NII. So I'd anchor you to the $89 billion. Number two, if you want to do math for like the changes of the average funds rate for the rest of the year and multiply that times the EAR, like be my guest. Looks like as good as an approach as any. \n But I would just once again remind you, of the $900 billion of deposits paying practically 0, that very small changes there can make a big difference. And we've got other factors, we've got the impact of QT on deposit balances, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So we want to make sure that we don't get too precise here. We're giving you our best guess based on a series of assumptions. And it's going to be what it's going to be. Sure. Yes. Let me take the IPO first. So we had been a little bit cautious there. Some cohorts and vintages of IPOs had performed somewhat disappointingly. And I think that narrative has changed to a meaningful degree this quarter. So I think we're seeing better IPO performance. Obviously, equity markets have been under a little bit of pressure the last few days. But in general, we have a lot of support there, and that always helps. \n Dialogue is quite good. A lot of interesting different types of conversations happening with global firms, multinationals, carve-out type things. So dialogue is good. Valuation environment is better, like sort of decent reasons for optimism there. \n But of course, with ECM, there's always a pipeline dynamic, and conditions were particularly good this quarter. And so we caution a little bit there about pull-forward, which is even more acute, I think, on the DCM side, given that quite a high percentage of the total amount of debt that needed to be refinanced this year has gotten done in the first quarter. So that's a factor. \n And then the question of M&A, I think, is probably the single most important question, not only because of its impact on M&A but also because of its knock-on impact on DCM through acquisition financing and so on. And there's the well-known kind of regulatory headwinds there, and that's definitely having a bit of a chilling effect. \n I don't know. I've heard some narratives that maybe there's like some pent-up deal demand. Who knows how important politics are in all this. So I don't know. We're fundamentally, as I said I think on the press call, happy to see momentum this quarter, happy to see momentum in announced M&A. Little bit cautious about the pull-forward dynamic, a little bit cautious about the regulatory headwinds. And in the end, we're just going to fight really hard for our share of the wallet here. Yes, a really good question. I would say, in general, that the sort of volatility and uncertainty in the rate environment overall on balance is actually supportive for the Markets revenue pool. And I think that, together with generally more balance sheet deployment as well as sort of some level of natural background growth, is one of the reasons that the overall level of Markets revenue has stabilized at meaningfully above what was normal in the pre-pandemic period. \n And while that does occasionally make us a little bit anxious like, oh, is this sustainable? Might there be downside here? For now, that does seem to be the new normal. And I do think that having rates off the lower 0 bound and a sort of more normal dynamic in global rates, that not only affects the rates business, but it affects the foreign exchange business. It generally just makes asset allocation decisions more important and more interesting. \n And so all of that creates risk management needs, and active managers need to grapple with it and so on and so forth. So I think that those are some of the themes on the Markets side at the margin. And yes, we'll see how the rest of the year goes. But it sort of seems to be behaving relatively normally, I would say. Right, Mike. So I'm sorry to tell you that Jamie actually left us because he's at a leadership offsite. That's why he was here remote. So I think he left the call in my hands for better or for worse. So -- but let me try to address some of your points and without sort of speaking for Jamie here. \n I think that when we talk about the impact of the geopolitical uncertainty on the outlook, part of the point there is to note that the U.S. is not isolated from that, right? If we have global macroeconomic problems as a result of geopolitical situations, that's not only a problem outside the U.S. That affects the global economy and therefore the U.S. and therefore our corporate customers, et cetera, et cetera. \n So -- and in that context, keeping in mind what we always say, that we invest through the cycle, that we sort of go -- we don't go into countries and then leave countries, et cetera. Obviously, we adjust around the edges. We manage risks. We do make choices as a function of the overall geopolitical environment. \n But broadly, the notion that we would pull back meaningfully from one of the key competitive strengths that this company has always had, which is its sort of global character because of a particular moment geopolitically would just be inconsistent with how we've always operated. \n And in terms of the Wholesale Payments business, it's going great. It's -- we're taking share. There's been a lot of innovation there, a lot of investment in technology, a lot of connectivity to payment systems in different countries around the world. And yes, I'm sure we'll give you more color and other settings on that, but it's a good story. It's a nice thing to see. Well, I think one of the things about payments businesses is that, in some sense, they're -- I mean, recession-proof is probably the wrong word. And in any case, we're not dealing with a recession, but we're talking fundamentally about moving money through pipes around the world. And that's a thing that people need to do more or less no matter what. So that's one piece. \n But I think the other piece is that our willingness to invest, which has always been a focus of yours, is one of the key things separating us in this business right now. And so we are seeing the benefits of that. Yes, Glenn, in short, yes. I mean, I think we're not shy about saying that we're underearning in Investment Banking now. Clearly, we're below cycle averages, as you point out. We've been talking about when do we get back to the pre-pandemic wallet. But as you know, at this point, it was like March 2020, right, it was the beginning of the pandemic. So it's like 4 years ago at this point. So there's been GDP growth, especially in nominal terms during that period, and you would expect the wallet to grow with that. \n So I do think there's meaningful upside in the Investment Banking fee wallet. As I've noted, there are some headwinds, I think, particularly in M&A. But over time, you would hope that the amount of M&A is a function of the underlying industrial logic rather than the regulatory environment. So you could see some mean reversion there. \n And yes, so that's why we're sort of leaning in. We're engaging with clients. We're making sure that we're appropriately resourced for a more robust level of the wallet and fighting for every dollar of share. Sure. So I think the first thing to say, which is somewhat obvious, but I'm going to say it anyway, is that there are some like auto-governors in this, right? Like some portion of the expense base is directly related to revenue, whether it's volume-related commissions, whether it's incentive compensation, whether it's other things. So there are some auto-correcting elements of the expense base that would happen automatically as part of the normal discipline. So that's point one. \n Point two is that, independently of the environment, we are always looking for efficiencies. And it's a little bit hard to see it. And in our world, where we're guiding to, I guess now with the special assessment added, $91 billion of expenses, it's hard to tell a story about all the efficiencies that are being generated underneath. But that is part of the DNA in the company. That does happen in BAU all the time as we grind things out, get the benefits of scale and try to extract that efficiency. \n And I think, to get to the heart of your question, which is, okay, in what type of environment would we make different strategic questions? And in the end, I think that's a little bit about what that environment is really like. So if you talk about like a normal recession with visibility on the cycle, would we change our long-term strategic investment plans, which are always built up from a financial modeling perspective, assuming resilience through the cycle? No, we wouldn't. \n Could there be some environments that, for whatever reason, change the business case for certain investments or even certain businesses that lead us to make meaningfully different strategic choices? Yes, but that would be because the through-the-cycle analysis has changed for some reason. I just don't see us fundamentally making strategically different decisions if the strategic outlook is unchanged, simply because of the business cycle in the short term. Yes, sure. So let me break this question down into a couple of different parts. So I think what Jamie was sort of suggesting is that you can think of a concept that's kind of like strategic capital versus tactical capital, for lack of a better term. \n And what he's kind of saying is that, in a moment where you're carrying a lot of excess capital sort of for strategic reasons, you have the ability, at least in theory, to deploy portions of that with kind of like -- into relatively short-duration assets or strategies or client opportunities in whatever moment for whatever reason in what might be thought of as a tactical sense. \n So he's just pointing out that, that's an option that you have. And the extent to which this quarter's increase in Markets RWA is a reflection of that, maybe a little bit, but probably not. I agree with you that it's hard in any given quarter to specifically link the change in capital and RWA to a change in revenue. There's just too many moving parts there. \n But for sure, one thing that's true is that higher run rate of the Markets businesses as a whole that we talked about a second ago is linked also to a higher deployment of balance sheet into those businesses. So as you well know, we pride ourselves on being extremely analytical and extremely disciplined in how we analyze capital liquidity, balance sheet deployment, G-SIB capacity utilization, et cetera, in the Markets business. \n And we don't just chase revenue. We go after returns fully measured. And that's part of the DNA, and we continue to do it, and we will. So we still are operating under multiple binding constraints, and obviously, the environment is complex. So the ability to sort of throw a ton of capital at opportunities is not quite that simple always. \n But big picture, we are clearly in a very, very strong capital position, which is in no small part in anticipation of all of the uncertainty. But it does also mean that, if opportunities arise between now and when the Basel III endgame is final, we are very well positioned to take advantage of those opportunities. Maybe a little bit. Jamie already alluded somewhat to this. So I do think spend is fine but not boomy, broadly speaking, I would say. You can look at it a lot of different ways, inflation cohorts, et cetera. But when you kind of triangulate that, you get back to this kind of flattish picture. \n There is a little bit of evidence of substituting out of discretionary into nondiscretionary. And I think the single most notable thing is just this effect where in the -- while it is true that real incomes have gone up in the lowest-income cohorts, within that, there's obviously a probability of distribution, and there's some -- or rather just a distribution of outcomes. And there are some such people whose real incomes are not up, they're down, and who are therefore struggling a little bit, unfortunately. And what you observe in the spending patterns of those people is some meaningful slowing rather than what you might have feared, which is sort of aggressive levering up. \n So I think that's maybe an economic indicator of sorts, although this portion of the population is small enough that I'm not sure the read-across is that big. But it is encouraging from a credit perspective because it just means that people are behaving kind of rationally and in a sort of normal post-pandemic type of way as they manage their own balance sheets. And that's sort of at the margin good news from a credit perspective. Right. So I think what's true about spreads in general, just broadly credit spreads, including secondary markets, and to some extent the leverage lending space, is that they're exceptionally tight. \n So I'm sure that's reversed a little bit in the last few days. But broadly throughout the quarter, we've really seen credit spreads tighten quite a bit. You even see that a little bit in our OCI this quarter, where losses in OCI that we would have had from higher rates have been meaningfully offset by tighter credit spreads in the portfolio. So broadly sort of in keeping with the big run-up that we saw in equity markets and the general sort of bullish tone, you saw quite a bit of credit spread tightening that -- in secondary markets. \n That, I think, has manifested itself a little bit in the leveraged lending space in the normal way that it does in that there's a lot of competition among providers for the revenue pool. And you start to see a little bit of loosening of terms, which always makes us a little bit concerned. And as we have in the past, we are going to be very well prepared to lose share in that space if we don't like the terms. We never compromise on structure there. So you are seeing a little bit of that. \n I think that away from the leveraged lending space, in the broader C&I space, there was a moment a few months ago where I think in no small part as a result of banks generally anticipating this more challenging capital environment and sort of disciplining a little bit their lending, we were seeing a little bit of widening actually in those corporate lending spreads. I don't know if that trend has like survived the last few weeks, and it's always a little bit hard to observe in any case. \n But I would say broadly the dynamics or the tension between people trying to be careful with their balance sheets and the fact that overall asset prices and conditions are quite supportive, and secondary market credit spreads have rallied a lot. Right. Yes. I mean, I think that tension between us as a provider of secured financing to some portions of the private credit, private equity community, now you're talking about different parts of the capital structure. But we do recognize that, that we compete in some areas and we are clients of each other in other areas. And that's part of the franchise, and it's all good at some level. \n But narrowly on private credit, it is interesting to observe what's going on there. So I would say for us, the strategy there is very much to be product-agnostic, actually. It's not so much like, oh, is it private credit or is it syndicated lending? What does it take to be good at this stuff? And what it takes is stuff that we have and have always had and that we're very good at in each individual silos. So you have -- you need underwriting skills, structuring skill, origination, distribution, secondary trading, risk appetite, credit analysis capabilities. And this is what we do, and we're really good at it. \n And increasingly, what you see actually is that as you see us doing a little bit, as the private credit space gets bigger, it starts to make sense to actually bring in some co-lenders so that you can sort of do big enough deals without having undue concentration risks. I mean, even if you have the capital, you just may not want the concentration risk. \n And so in a funny way, the private credit space becomes a little bit more like the syndicated lending space. At the same time, the syndicated lending space, being influenced a little bit by these private credit unitranche structures, gets pushed a little bit in the private credit direction in terms of like speed of execution, other aspects of how that business works. \n So we're watching it. The competitive dynamics are interesting. Certainly, there's some pressure in some areas. But we really do think that our overall value proposition and competitive position here is second to none. And so we're looking forward to the future here. Okay. Thanks, Charlie. And I'm going to do my best to answer your question while sticking to my sort of guns on not giving too much First Republic-specific guidance. But I do think that kind of framework you're articulating is broadly correct. So let me go through the pieces. \n So yes, the current quarter's results annualize to more than the $2 billion Jamie talked about. Yes, a big part of that reason is discount accretion, which was very front-loaded as a result of short-dated assets. So that's part of the reason that you see that converge. Yes, it's also true that we expect the expense run rate to decline later in the year as we continue making progress on integration. Obviously, as I think as I mentioned to you last quarter, from a full year perspective, you just have the offset of the full year calendarization effect. \n There was maybe an embedded question then there, too, about we had talked about $2.5 billion of integration expense. And the integration is real, the expenses are real, and also the time spent on that is quite real. It's a lot of work for a lot of people. It's going well, but we're not done yet, and it takes a lot of effort. But broadly, I think that our expectation for integration expense are probably coming in a bit lower than we originally assumed on the morning of the deal for a couple of reasons. \n One is that the framework around the time was understandably quite conservative and sort of assumed that we would kind of lose a meaningful portion of the franchise and would sort of need to size the expense base accordingly. And of course, it's worked out, to your point, quite a bit better than that. And therefore, the amount of expenses that is necessary to keep this bigger franchise is higher. And that means less integration expense associated with taking down those numbers. \n It's probably also true that the integration assumptions were conservative. They were based on kind of more typical type of bank M&A assumptions as opposed to the particular nature of this deal, including the FDIC and so on and so forth. \n So yes, I think that probably is a pretty complete answer to your question. Thanks, Charlie. Right. Okay, Charlie, there's a lot in there. And to be honest, I just don't love the idea of spending a lot of time on this call speculating about bank failures. Like you obviously have a particular view about the next wave in the landscape. I'm not going to bother debating that with you. But I guess let me just try to say a couple of things, doing my best to answer your question. \n Like as we talked about earlier, we have a lot of capital. And as Jamie says, the capital is earnings in store. And right now, we don't see a lot of really compelling opportunities to deploy the capital. But if opportunities arise, despite the uncertainty about the Basel III endgame, we will be well positioned to deploy it. \n I think embedded there is also sort of a question about the FDIC and the FDIC's attitude towards different types of bidders. And obviously, there's a lot of thinking and analysis happening about the entire process and some recent forums and speeches on bank resolution and so on and so forth. \n And I think probably we can all agree that it's better, all else equal, for the system to have as much capital available and as many different types of capital available to ensure that things are stabilized if anything ever goes wrong. But the mechanics of how you do that when you're talking about banks are not trivial and not to be underestimated. So I guess that's probably as much as I have on that. Thank you, everyone."

            "name": "James Dimon",
            "content": "Yes. So Betsy, before I answer the question, I want to say something on behalf of all of us at JPMorgan and me personally. I'm thrilled to have you on this call.  \n For those who don't know, Betsy has been through a terrible medical episode. And to remind all of us how lucky we are to be here, but Betsy in particular, the amount of respect we have, not just in your work, but in your character over the last 20-plus years have been exceptional. So on behalf of all of us, I just want to welcome you back. I'm thrilled to have you here.  \n And so you're asking a pertinent question. So we're earning a lot of money. Our capital cup runneth over, and that's why we increased the dividend. And if you ask me what we'd like to do is to pay out something like 1/3 of normalized earnings. Of course, it's hard to calculate always what normalized earnings are, but we don't mind being a little bit ahead of that sometimes, a little bit behind that sometimes. If I could give people kind of consistent dividend guidance, et cetera. \n I think the far more important question is the 15%. So look at the 15%, I'm going to oversimplify it. That basically will prepare us for the total Basel endgame today roughly. The specifics don't matter that much.  \n Remember, we can do a lot of things to change that in the short run or the long run. But -- and it looks like Basel III endgame may not be the worst case, it will be something less than that. So obviously, when and if that happens, it would free up a lot of capital, and I'm going to say on the order of $20 billion or something like that.  \n And yes, we're -- we've always had the capital hierarchy the same way, which is we're going to use capital to build our business first. And we pay the dividend, the steady dividend. Build the business. And if we think it's appropriate, to buy back stock. We're continuing to buy back stock at $2 billion a year. I personally do not want to buy back a lot more than that at these current prices.  \n I think you've all heard me talk about the world and things like that. So waiting in preparation for Basel. Hopefully, we'll know something later, and then we can be much more specific with you all.  \n But in the meantime, there's also -- it's very important to put in mind, there are short-term uses for capital that are good for shareholders that could reduce our CET1, too. So you may see us do things in the short run that will increase earnings, increase capital -- that are using up that capital. Jeremy mentioned on the -- on one of the things that we know, the balance sheet and how we use the balance sheet for credit and trading, we could do things now.  \n So it's a great position to be in. We're going to be very, very patient. I urge all the analysts to keep in mind, excess capital is not wasted capital, it's earnings in store. We will deploy it in a very good way for our shareholders in due course. I'm sorry, $2 billion a quarter. So I would say consumer customers are fine. The unemployment is very low. Home price dropped, stock price dropped. The amount of income they need to service their debt is still kind of low. But the extra money of the lower-income folks is running out -- not running out, but normalizing. And you see credit normalizing a little bit. \n And of course, higher-income folks still have more money. They're still spending it. So whatever happens, the customer's in pretty good shape. And they're -- if you go into a recession, they'd be in pretty good shape. Businesses are in good shape. If you look at it today, their confidence is up, their order books drop, their profits are up. \n But what I caution people, these are all the same results of a lot of fiscal spending, a lot of QE, et cetera. And so we don't really know what's going to happen. And I also want to look at the year, look at 2 years or 3 years, all the geopolitical effects and oil and gas and how much fiscal spending will actually take place, our elections, et cetera. \n So we're in good -- we're okay right now. It does not mean we're okay down the road. And if you look at any inflection point, being okay in the current time is always true. That was true in '72, it was true in any time you've had it. So I'm just on the more cautious side that how people feel, the confidence levels and all that, that doesn't necessarily stop you from having an inflection point. And so everything is okay today, but you've got to be prepared for a range of outcomes, which we are. \n And the other thing I want to point out because all of these questions about interest rates and yield curves and NII and credit losses, one thing you projected today based on what -- not what we think in economic scenarios, but the generally accepted economic scenario, which is the generally accepted rate cuts of the Fed. But these numbers have always been wrong. You have to ask the question, what if other things happen? Like higher rates with this modest recession, et cetera, then all these numbers change. I just don't think any of us should be surprised if and when that happens. \n And I just think the chance of that happen is higher than other people. I don't know the outcome. We don't want to guess the outcome. I've never seen anyone actually positively predict a big inflection point in the economy literally in my life or in history. Yes. So I'll put it into 2 buckets. First of all, we're fine. We've got good reserves against office. We think the multifamily is fine. Jeremy can give you more detail on that if you want. \n But if you think of real estate, there's 2 pieces. If rates go up, think of the yield curve, the whole yield curve, not Fed funds, but the 10-year bond rate, it goes up 2%. All assets, all assets, every asset on the planet, including real estate, is worth 20% less. Well obviously, that creates a little bit of stress and strain, and people have to roll those over and finance it more. But it's not just true for real estate, it's true for everybody. And that happens, leveraged loans, real estate will have some effect. \n The second thing is the why does that happen? If that happens because we have a strong economy, well, that's not so bad for real estate because people will be hiring and filling things out. And other financial assets. \n If that happens because we have stagflation, well, that's the worst case. All of a sudden, you are going to have more vacancies. You are going to have more companies cutting back. You are going to have less leases. It will affect -- including multifamily, that will filter through the whole economy in a way that people haven't really experienced since 2010. \n So I'd just put in the back of your mind, the why is important, the interest rates are important, the recession is important. If things stay where they are today, we have kind of the soft landing that seems to be embedded in the marketplace, everyone -- the real estate will muddle through. \n Obviously, it'd be idiosyncratic if you're in different cities and different types and B versus A buildings and all that, but people will muddle through. They won't muddle through under higher rates with the recession. That would be tougher on a lot of folks, and not just real estate, if in fact that happens. Which we know are going to be wrong."
