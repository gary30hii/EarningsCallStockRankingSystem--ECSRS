And later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.  Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Leland Weaver to begin.\nLeland Weaver: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for DuPont's fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. We're making this call available to investors and media via webcast. We have prepared slides to supplement our comments during this conference call. These slides are posted on the Investor Relations section of DuPont's website and through the link to our webcast.  Joining me on the call today are Ed Breen, Chief Executive Officer, and Lori Koch, Chief Financial Officer. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the slide. During our call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Our 2019 Form 10-K, as updated by our current and periodic reports, includes detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties, which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today exclude significant items. We will also refer to other non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in our press release and posted to the Investors page of our website. I'll now turn the call over to Ed.\nEdward Breen: Thanks, Leland. And good morning, everyone. I will provide comments on the tremendous progress we made on several strategic priorities during the fourth quarter of 2020 and the start of 2021.  But first, let me give my appreciation to our employees and partners around the world who rose to the occasion day after day in the face of extraordinary circumstances. 2020 presented us with the challenges of a global health pandemic, social and political unrest, and the worst economic conditions in many years.  Despite these challenges, our teams remained focused on health and safety, delivering for our customers, strengthening the financial position of the company and continuing to drive our strategic priorities forward.  It is because of our commitment of our employees that today we're able to announce strong financial results, as well as significant progress on critical milestones to make DuPont a premier multi-industrial company equipped for growth and value creation.  Starting on slide 2, on February 1, we announced the completion of the merger of our N&B business with IFF, creating an $11 billion industry-leading company in the food and beverage, home and personal care and health and wellness markets. The new IFF will have unmatched capabilities to deliver for customers, with leading positions in markets such as nutrition, probiotics, soy proteins, flavors and fragrances.  The combination of these complimentary portfolios puts IFF at the forefront of highly valued consumer ingredients companies that work closely with customers to meet the growing demand in areas such as all natural, clean label, and sustainability.  The combined management team has planned and prepared for this integration, and they are committed to delivering for all stakeholders. They are already executing on a playbook to capture both the cost and revenue synergies, enabled by the combination.  I am now on the IFF Board, and I look forward to coming into the lead director role this spring to continue overseeing the transformation of IFF.  This transaction also unlocks significant value for DuPont and our shareholders. Earlier this month, we received about $7.3 billion in cash, which enables us to further strengthen our balance sheet by reducing our long-term debt and gives us the flexibility to continue generating shareholder value.  As you know, we separated the N&B business through a split-off transaction in which DuPont shareholders were given the option to tender their DuPont shares in exchange for shares in IFF at a ratio of 0.718 shares of IFF for every share of DuPont. The exchange offer was fully subscribed, and all shares that were tendered were retired by DuPont, resulting in a reduction of 197 million shares or approximately 27% of our outstanding shares. This was a very efficient process for DuPont to get shares out of the market with zero cash outlay.  In closing, customers are excited about the potential this strategic combination can deliver in terms of being a partner of choice, R&D capability, and innovation.  Additionally, our N&B colleagues are energized by the opportunities before them. And we wish them continued success as they embark on this exciting new journey.  Slide 3 highlights the impact of other actions we took throughout 2020 to strengthen our balance sheet and position the company to continue generating shareholder value for a disciplined financial policy.  As Lori and I came into our roles in February of last year, and with the initial indications of a global pandemic soon thereafter, we quickly implemented actions to improve working capital and tensioned capital expenditures across each business and function.  We achieved a $850 million improvement in working capital and reduced capital expenditures to $1 billion, a reduction of nearly $300 million from our initial targets for the year. Combined, these actions enabled free cash flow conversion of more than 150% for the year.  These actions, combined with proceeds from non-core divestitures, enabled us to close the year with zero commercial paper balances, a reduction of more than $1.8 billion. We expect to further reduce our debt balances by using $5 billion of the cash received from the IFF deal. We have already retired our $3 billion term loan and plan to redeem the $2 billion notes in May.  We closed the year with greater than $2.5 billion of available cash. And as I mentioned, we expect to have $2.3 billion of cash remaining from the IFF transaction.  Combined with the continued strong cash generation and further proceeds from non-core divestitures, we are heading into 2021 in a very favorable liquidity position with no debt maturities due until the fourth quarter of 2023.  As we look to uses of our available cash in 2021, our financial policy will remain disciplined and balanced, maintaining a strong balance sheet, growing the company through investments in CapEx and R&D, acting on strategic M&A targets and returning value to our shareholders. We remain committed to maintaining our strong investment grade credit rating and are pleased that we have a stable rating from all the major agencies.  We also look to continue our CapEx at about 5% of sales and R&D spending at about 4% of sales for 2021.  With regards to dividends, we intend to maintain our current quarterly per share dividend of $0.30 per share. Going forward, we will target a payout ratio between 35% and 45%. And we will work with our Board to increase our dividend annually as we grow earnings.  Finally, share repurchases remain an important component of our financial policy, and we intend to resume buybacks utilizing our existing plan, which still provides authorization up to $1 billion.  We are also actively evaluating a couple of acquisition targets, which will enable even further acceleration of growth in key end markets. As we move through the year, we will redeploy our excess capital in ways which maximize shareholder value.  Turning to slide 4, we also recently signed agreements to sell our Clean Technologies and Solamet businesses, and we expect these transactions to close by mid-2021. Combined with the sale of the Biomaterials business, we anticipate more than $900 million in pretax proceeds from non-core divestitures this year.  Our priority of active portfolio management has focused our portfolio and generated significant cash for the company. Since June 2019, we have divested or signed agreements to divest nine businesses, in addition to the separation of N&B, generating over $2 billion in gross proceeds.  Additionally, exiting these businesses removes a significant amount of cyclicality from the DuPont portfolio and eliminates much of the volatility that was often in our non-core results.  With the agreements on Clean Tech and Solamet, we have divested a substantial portion of the non-core segment. We will wind down the non-core segment reporting in the first quarter of 2021 and report our results in three reportable segments going forward as we announced last week. I'll ask Lori to provide more color on our new segments, as well as detail on our financial performance, but let me close with a few comments on the settlement agreement that DuPont and Corteva reached with Chemours.  I am pleased that we have reached an agreement that I believe is in the best interest of all three companies. For DuPont, there were a few key principles. First, it was important that any settlement agreement capped our share of any potential liabilities as it defined them out.  We also have a long-term agreement with the building of an escrow account over the term to provide stakeholders of all three entities the confidence that the parties to the agreement will be able to satisfy the respective obligations if they were to materialize in the future. The agreement we announced met these principles and was a key step in reducing the uncertainty around potential legacy PFAS liabilities.  The other aspect of what we announced a few weeks ago was the settlement of the remaining Ohio multi-district PFOA litigation. Our portion of the settlement is $27 million.  To be clear, we continue to believe any exposure for DuPont related to potential legacy PFAS liabilities is contained due to heritage DuPont's limited manufacture and use of PFOA and the fact that we never made firefighting foam. Having an agreement with Chemours and Corteva enables us to work together as we move forward.  With that, let me turn it over to Lori.\nLori Koch: Thanks, Ed. And good morning. With the completion of the N&B transaction on February 1 and the substantial progress we made on non-core divestitures, we announced our new segment reporting structure for DuPont going forward. We will be aligned around three business reporting segments, Electronics & Industrial, Water & Protection, and Mobility & Materials.  Our new segment structure combines businesses with common financial characteristics, enabling clear line of sight and more effective allocation of resources across the company. Each business has a meaningful growth profile with a management team that understands how to best execute on its priorities and deliver for shareholders.  We will move the following businesses to the newly named Electronics & Industrial segment \u2013 Kalrez, Vespel, medical silicones and Molykote, each previously reported in our T&I segment.  We will move the Teijin Films joint venture, the Microcircuit Materials business, and the Tedlar business to our T&I segment, which will be renamed Mobility & Materials. Each of these was previously reported in our non-core segment.  Safety & Construction will be renamed Water & Protection to highlight our market-leading water business that we have grown both organically and inorganically over the past few years.  As Ed mentioned, we will wrap up the non-core segment as part of our first quarter reporting. We will report the results of the Biomaterials, Clean Tech and Solamet businesses in our Corporate segment until the divestitures are complete.  I'll cover our fourth quarter results on slide 6. As Ed did earlier, I'd like to acknowledge the significant efforts of our teams in delivering a strong fourth quarter, a capstone to what was an incredibly productive year.  We set working capital and CapEx targets and challenged our teams to enable the reduction of commercial paper balances to zero at year-end to improve our leverage heading into 2021. Our teams delivered once again. Net sales of $5.3 billion was flat versus the fourth quarter of 2019 on an organic basis and ahead of expectations we had set at the start of the quarter. Demand for our technologies and smartphones and semiconductors remained robust through the quarter, with no seasonal decline in smartphones as we typically see in the fourth quarter. Also contributing to the strong fourth quarter was further recovery in the automotive market. At the start of the quarter, industry benchmarks suggested fourth quarter auto builds would be down low-single digits. However, with over 23 million automobiles produced globally, the fourth quarter was the strongest production quarter of the year, up 3% versus the fourth quarter of 2019 and up about 14% versus the third quarter of 2020.  Our teams navigated a challenging raw materials environment across the polymer space to deliver volume growth in line with auto builds on both a year-over-year and sequential basis.  The end markets within S&C were very similar to the third quarter and consistent with our expectations. Demand for our protective garments continued to be strong, with garment sales up nearly 50% versus the fourth quarter of 2019.  The aramid side of our safety business was up versus the third quarter on a sequential basis, but continues to see year-over-year declines in volume as a result of the pandemic impacting demand for aerospace, oil and gas, and other select industrial applications.  Similarly, the environment shelter solutions remained consistent with what we saw in the third quarter, with strength in do it yourself applications and continued recovery in residential construction, offset by faster commercial construction demand. Shelter sales were up slightly on an organic basis in the fourth quarter. And demand for water filtration technologies remained strong across the world. However, our fourth quarter results were impacted by the timing of some shipments at year-end, resulting primarily from orders associated with capital projects. We will capture this demand in our first quarter results and return to mid to high-single digit growth.  Likewise, results for the N&B segment were in line with our expectations, with ongoing demand strength in probiotics and home and personal care markets, offset by the continued softness in biorefinery and microbial control.  From an earnings perspective, we also delivered a strong quarter, driven by improved volumes and the delivery of approximately $130 million of non-manufacturing cost savings, which enabled expanded EBITDA margins in each of our core segments in the quarter. Excluding approximately $160 million of discrete gains in the fourth quarter of 2019, we delivered operating leverage with mid-single digit operating EBITDA growth.  From a segment perspective, T&I delivered operating EBITDA margins of 31.6% on strong volumes and cost reductions. T&I delivered 310 basis points of operating EBIT expansion on higher volumes, tight cost control, and lower raw material costs, offset by year-over-year pricing pressure.  Likewise, S&C drove operating margin expansion of 40 basis points through cost control and favorable product mix, more than offsetting the impact of lower volumes. N&B operating margins expanded 100 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2019, led by favorable product mix and non-manufacturing cost control, more than offsetting raw material price increases and costs associated with the planned slowdown production across the N&B network to properly manage working capital.  Adjusted EPS of $0.95 per share was flat with the prior year. Savings from both structural and temporary cost reductions and benefits from a lower tax rate were offset by pricing headwinds and a headwind of approximately $0.17 associated with the prior-year discrete items.  We also delivered robust free cash flow in the fourth quarter, driven by controlled CapEx and working capital improvements. We closed the year with CapEx on target at $1 billion and approximately $850 million in working capital improvement, well above our target of $500 million for the year.  Looking forward over the medium term, we continue to believe we have additional opportunity to improve our working capital turnover, primarily through better supply chain management through the use of data analytics.  Slide 7 provides our financial outlook for both the first quarter and full-year 2021. Our guidance reflects DuPont on the new basics excluding N&B as it will be reflected as discontinued operations when we report our results.  We have provided recast first quarter and full-year 2020 results excluding N&B for comparison purposes. Later this month, we will release fully recast segment results for 2018 and all quarters in 2019 and 2020, reflecting the segment realignment, the elimination of the non-core segment and reflecting N&B as discontinued operations.  Our guidance also includes a full year of results for the three non-core businesses we have signed agreements to sell, and we will reset expectations as they close.  For the full year, we expect net sales of $15.4 billion to $15.6 billion, an increase of 8% at the midpoint, and operating EBITDA of $3.83 billion to $3.93 billion, an increase of 13% at the midpoint. We expect operating EBITDA margin improvement of approximately 100 basis points, driven by the impact of improved volumes and the remaining benefits of our structural cost actions we put in place last year. These gains will be partially offset by anticipated return of some 2020 temporary cost reductions.  Adjusted EPS of $3.30 to $3.45, an increase of 68% at the midpoint versus 2020 adjusted EPS of $2.01 per share, reflect stronger segment earnings and lower interest expense, which is enabled by the paydown of our debt balances, including commercial paper. Our adjusted EPS also reflects the reduced share count resulting from the exchange offer that closed on January 29 in connection with the separation of N&B.  As a reminder, this took out about 197 million DuPont shares. This results in a weighted average share count for the year of 555 million. This excludes the benefit of any future buybacks.  With that, let me turn it over to Leland to open the Q&A.\nLeland Weaver : Thanks, Lori. Before we move to the Q&A portion of our call, I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. We will allow for one question and one follow-up question per person. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from one of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners.\nJeffrey Sprague: Congrats on getting a lot done in a crazy tough pandemic year. Question for me is really just thinking about kind of the way the company now is reconfigured post N&B. Ed, you mentioned M&A a little bit in your prepared remarks. I just wonder if you could elaborate a little bit more on kind of the balance between opportunities for organic investment in the areas that you're strategically focused and what the M&A pipeline and/or kind of magnitude of activity on the M&A front might look like?\nEdward Breen: As Lori highlighted, we were expecting 8% revenue growth in 2021. So, we feel like it's going to be a robust year for us. And key for us is our 4% spend on R&D. So, that's clearly number one. And we're very focused on the secular growth areas within the portfolio where we're spending the R&D. So, we feel like we're going to have very good results organically as we move forward in the new configuration.  The way we're looking at M&A, I'd say, look, there's two targets that we're presently working on. I don't know if we'll be able to consummate them or not. We're not going to stretch to get them. We're going to make sure the numbers work for us. And we're going to make sure that numbers work on the cost synergy side, not taking into account revenue synergies, even though the couple that we're working on do have revenue synergies. So, we'll see how that plays out. We're actively in that right now. They're right down the middle of the plate in a couple areas that we already participate in. We're not going to do anything on the M&A side that's a new segment or anything like that. But we feel like there's some good consolidation opportunities right where we have our strengths and right where we have great relationships with customers. So, that's how we're looking at it.  And as we highlighted, we are \u2013 even though we just took 27% of our shares out of the market, not using any cash, we do have still $1 billion open on our authorization. So, we're going to get back in the market and start repurchasing shares. We have a Board meeting coming up in the next month. And that will be a topic that we will have with the Board, share buyback versus mix of M&A that we're planning on doing during the year.\nJeffrey Sprague: As a follow-up, actually unrelated, different topic. This global semiconductor shortage fire drill that's going on, can you just kind of address how that impacts you? I'm sure it's going to impact auto production builds. It might hurt you on one side, but you\u2019re your kind of supply and the response on the other. Maybe you could just kind of tie that together for us.\nEdward Breen: I think it's going to affect the auto builds. I think the forecast out there is 650,000, 700,000 cars that'll be reduced by because of the shortages out there. But, Jeff, we're running full tilt on the semi side. And quite frankly, the whole electronics segment is running full tilt. As Lori had mentioned, even the smartphone demand where we \u2013 gee, that did not even soften up in the fourth quarter, and usually seasonally that even declines. So we're pumping out as much as we can. But definitely, there's some slight slowdown, but the car production is still hot and heavy even with that 650,000 unit reduction. And hopefully, that works its way \u2013 those issues work its way through during the first quarter. So, we're seeing a little bit there. But again, I think our forecast is very solid for what we're going to do in the electronics business and the semi.  We're also seeing some headwinds on raw materials in the T&I business, which also somewhat relates to the auto business. So, we lost a little bit in volume in the fourth quarter and we'll lose a little bit of volume in the first quarter because of those constraints. But again, our forecast still is very solid and we're pretty much running full tilt there also. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius.\nScott Davis: What changed that got you to keep the non-core businesses, the Microcircuit, the Tedlar and the films JV? Is it just the timing issue and they may still be for sale? Maybe I'll just leave it at that and let you explain.\nEdward Breen: Scott, they are businesses that are kind of down right now because of the end market. So, take the Tedlar business, somewhat aerospace exposed. They're good businesses. Lori and I did really a study of all the non-core businesses and decided we have some really nice upside. And the businesses we're moving into T&I \u2013 T&I, that team is really great operators, which is exactly what's needed here. So, we think there's nice upside coming in these businesses. It was not \u2013 it wouldn't have been productive to sell them. I don't think it would have been good for our shareholders. And we see some good long-term trends there. So, we made this decision strategically to hold on to them and don't expect them to be up for sale during the year. That's not what we're doing. We're putting them in there and we're going to run them. \nScott Davis: Ed, you just talked about T&I having some challenges, obviously, with obvious things that Jeff brought up. The pricing headwinds, I would imagine you're able to capture some of the some of this back in price, just takes a little bit of time. Is it as much of a mix issue as price issue when you say pricing headwinds? Or is it, in fact, just explicitly price?\nEdward Breen: No, the headwinds in T&I are really constraints, raw material constraints that we're having. [technical difficulty] we're going to have a very nice first quarter in T&I, but we could have more upside. I think we're going to \u2013 we think we're going to miss out on about $60 million to $80 million in sales in T&I because of raw material constraints in the first quarter. Now we think we'll get a lot of that back. We won't lose it because the whole industry is having a few issues there. But specifically to your question on pricing, things have firmed up very well. It's a constructive market for pricing as we've entered the first quarter. I think you'll see price increases in the industry across the board. But a lot of that won't kick in until you get it \u2013 by the time you put it in place with contracts with customers, usually 30 days, 45 days, you'll probably see more of that kick in in the second quarter. But it has turned very constructive at this point in time on the price front. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. \nStephen Tusa: Just following up on that last question from Scott on the price side. I guess for the old T&I segment, what are you assuming for price? Or if you just want to talk about the new mobility. However you want to kind of look at it. But what are you assuming for kind of price mix for the year there? \nLori Koch: For the quarter, we hit the quarter first of what we had guided to in the slide for the new M&M segment, we will see sequential improvement in nylon price. And so, we were down about 4% in Q4. We're looking at about 2% in Q1. So, there is some sequential improvement there. However, we still do expect to be down year-over-year just given that we were at still in a bit of a nylon run in the first quarter of 2020. So, as we go through the year, as Ed had mentioned, the pricing environment in nylon is constructive. We do have an awesome team that takes advantage of price. So, we do expect as we get to the full year that you could see positive price momentum as reported for the full year basis. Keep in mind, though, there are some raw material headwinds that Ed had mentioned that we're dealing with. So, some of that price most likely will be offset by escalating raws, especially as oil price is expected to pick up. There are some raw material headwinds that we will offset, but they could eat into some of the price appreciation that we would see.\nStephen Tusa: So, like, flat kind of price costs for the year for you guys?\nLori Koch: It will depend how the nylon dynamics plays out. Yeah. So, right now, I think we could hedge it, staying at about flat. But potentially with some upside, if the nylon and the end markets in auto continues to remain tight, there's I think a couple of recent force majeure in the industry that's making the price environment even more conducive.\nStephen Tusa: You mentioned that you're kind of running full out to keep up with some of the demand on the electronics side. Are you going to have to add capacity at all, to keep up with this? Or are these just bottlenecks that are more temporary?\nEdward Breen: It's a combo of both, Steve. We're cranking out more and we're freeing up capacity with a lot of moves we're making on the factory floor. But we're also adding capacity with \u2013 our biggest single CapEx project is the Kapton expansion. We're running flat out on Kaptons. We could definitely ship more if we had more manufacturing capability. And that comes online as we go into 2022. And that's a big move forward. The Kapton is what we use for the 5G and the smartphones. And also, that's a major expansion coming along that we desperately [technical difficulty]. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonas Oxgaard of Bernstein.\nJonas Oxgaard: Wondering about the capital allocation. So, you said you were going to seek board approval for more buyback? Can I ask what kind of range of buybacks will you be seeking?\nEdward Breen: Jonas, don't fully know yet. It's also partially going to be contingent on, do we do some M&A during the year. In aggregate, we're in a really nice spot here. We've got $5 billion to $6 billion of cash available to us as we close the three non-core sales that we've made, but haven't closed them yet. I think Lori mentioned there's still $900 million gross coming in during the first half of the year, in addition to the $2.3 billion excess from the IFF transaction and the $2.5 billion we have just coming into the year from non-core sales and operating cash flow. So, it's a really nice position to be in. And so, partially just in general on where we end up on the M&A front, not going to sit on cash through the [technical difficulty] big number. So, it'll either be M&A or buyback. \nJonas Oxgaard: If you don't mind, you seem to have been focused on the transaction, getting the businesses back up and running, so when you're thinking of 2021, like as the CEO, what are your big focus areas for the year?\nEdward Breen: Operational excellence if I just put it in two words. I think we have still nice runway for a lot of improvements. One of the areas that Lori and I are spending a lot of time on is really our throughput at our facilities. We think we have gross margin runway to improve. It's not \u2013 I think we're best in class when it comes to overhead cost structure if you benchmark us against the very best peers. So, that's not our opportunity, although we always look for ways to optimize that. But the key for us is the gross margin line. We want to move that up over time to 40%. We've been running kind of 35%. We're installing a lot of digital analytics at our facilities. We spent about $15 million last year on data analytics tools. This year, we budgeted $30 million. So, you kind of see how we're ramping there. A lot of it's on the supply chain and manufacturing efficiency. We're putting in some tools on smart demand forecasting, process optimization uptime, and we're seeing some real benefits from it. So, that's a huge focus area for us this year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Gordon Haskett.\nJohn Inch: How are you thinking about working capital improvements from here? I think you'd called out, correct me if I'm wrong, $1 billion long-term potential, but you just did over \u2013 around $850 million for 2020. And does working capital have to come back, let's say, in 2021 as your businesses cycle back, which I guess \u2013 it's probably a good problem to have actually. \nEdward Breen: Yeah, it is a good problem, John. I think when you're going back into an up environment here, I really look at it from what are the turns doing. And we took our turns from 4.3 turns going into last year to we exited the year at 5.2. And it's an $850 million improvement. And our plan this year is to slightly improve our turns from the 5.2. But not a lot this year, but slightly. And that would be a victory for us. \nJohn Inch: Would those areas where the turns are higher correlate, Ed, with what you just stated as the sort of five points of runway overall for gross margin? So, I was going to ask you that too, the gross margin, is it comparable by segments, that 5 points, 35% to 40%? Or how does that delineate across three segments? \nEdward Breen: No, the biggest opportunity is S&C. And it's also got our heaviest manufacturing footprint. So, between Nomex, Kevlar, and Tyvek, they are our biggest opportunities in the business. They are our biggest facilities. We definitely know we can improve our uptimes, our turnaround times. And that's the number one area we're working on. By the way, it's across the board. But the biggest opportunity is there.\nLori Koch: Same goes for working Capital. A lot of the opportunity still resides within inventory. I think our DSO is at a nice level. Indeed, our working capital, we can continue to improve and a lot of that back to the S&C or the new W&P business is where a lot of the opportunity lies.\nJohn Inch: No, it makes sense. Just as a follow-up, Ed, what's your appetite for doing something larger on the deal front in the next year or so? Maybe I was thinking, instead of just continuing to shrink DuPont, maybe even a possible asset swap with another company? \nEdward Breen: We always look at every opportunity. So, I don't think anything will get by us if there's something interesting. Let me just highlight on the M&A side, maybe just to size it a little bit for you. We could spend up to $2.5 billion on M&A. Now, things don't always work out. And as I said, we're not going to stretch to get something. So, you never know. But we're kind of looking in that kind of range, if it were to play out. So, just to kind of size it a little bit for you. But we always look at other alternatives. We get calls every week. If something makes sense, we'll study it. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne of Bank of America.\nSteve Byrne: Ed, when you were talking about the PFAS liability settlement, you also commented that it's your view that your liability will be limited to the legacy DuPont facilities, given you didn't ever manufacture firefighting foams. Is there anything you can do to solidify that view? And the reason I ask is, in the past, DuPont's supported the initiative to have the PFAS grouping regulated under CERCLA. And under the old superfund days, CERCLE allocated costs according to the ability to pay, not necessarily to the contribution to the problem. And thus, is that a potential concern for you with regard to broadening this potential cleanup liability? \nEdward Breen: Yes. So, let me clarify that we have been supportive \u2013 we've testified in front of Congress, that if you designate it as a hazardous substance, we're totally in agreement with that. We'd rather have a national standard than every state doing their own thing. But remember, under the CERCLA or the superfund designation, it's very narrow who is responsible for it. It's where you disposed of the material. And the party responsible either had to be the site owner or the past site owner when it occurred or the person that arranged to transport it to that location. That is the definition under the CERCLA which is very narrow. You have to be one of the players that did that.  DuPont \u2013 by the way, we have four sites where we used it as a manufacturing agent. And we disposed of it on our own sites with, by the way, approval to do that. One of our sites is 800 acres. One of them was 1,500 acres. And that's why we had so much ground. That's where the disposals occurred. So, we're very contained where we did it. There's already cleanup going on with government authorities approving what we're doing. And it's been ongoing for quite a few years. And we never obviously dispose the firefighting foam anywhere in a dump or anything because we didn't make it. As the facts keep coming out, it'll get narrow and narrow here. And then we'll, as I've said before, and I don't want to get into too much detail, it's a little bit proprietary, but we'll look at a way to hopefully contain the firefighting foam issue, so our investors understand the limited or no liability that sits there based on what we did as a company. We're very focused on it. As you can see, we said there was a three-pronged approach, we just did two of the pieces. So, with the announcements we made, with the agreement between the three companies and settling the rest of the Ohio MDL for really very little in the scheme of things. And so, now we'll focus on this firefighting foam piece of it.  Remember, also, we have been sued in states we don't even have anything in the state \u2013 State of Arizona, the State of New Hampshire. We don't even have a facility there. We didn't do anything there. So, the facts will keep coming out here. And then, hopefully, we'll get resolution and hopefully something by the end of 2021. \nSteve Byrne: And now that N&B has been separated and you've reshuffled the segments and you've accomplished a bunch in the last year, just curious, how long do you see yourself remaining the CEO? And is there a process underway that that could change? \nEdward Breen: Well, I just signed a three-year contract, I don't know, a month or two ago. So, at least that period of time. So, no process in place. I'm very excited for the next few years. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs. \nRobert Koort: Ed, I'm curious, this maybe was asked in other ways, but when you think about sort of what your aspirational peer set was, and there's some pretty good variants still in the valuations of your individual businesses, even though you've obviously made some great progress, you've cleaned up some of the non-core stuff of portfolio, you've maybe diminished the angst around PFAS, what do you sort of see as the strategic options to narrowing that variance from a valuation standpoint? \nEdward Breen: Well, it's one of the reasons we continue buying back shares. If you look at our multiple, whatever it is, 13 times, and I stare at ITWs and Honeywells and Eaton and we're just as good a company. I think part of it is, we've got to continue to post consistent results. I think consistency and people not having to worry, I think, means a lot in the multiple. I've been doing this for a long time. And I've been saying that for over 20 years. So, I think we just keep posting good numbers and I think we continue to close that gap. And I think we're going to benchmark very well this year. All our metrics vis-\u00e0-vis those other very good competitors, by the way, and multi-industry companies. So, there's a gap to that peer set for us of 400 to 500 basis points. And I truly don't believe that discount should be there at all. And so, we'll continue to prove that out during 2021. \nRobert Koort: You mentioned a few markets that have been quite hot. Obviously, you've got a few in the portfolio, end markets that are maybe more of a post pandemic glide path. Can you give us an update on how you see things progressing in energy or maybe aerospace or some of these other businesses that are going to take a bit longer to recover?\nEdward Breen: If I describe at high level, and maybe if Lori wants to give a little more detail, some of those, the oil and gas, aerospace, they dropped 30% to 40% on the revenue line. And our gut is we kind of glide back up, get half of that back in kind of 2021. That's kind of how \u2013 if you just put them all together, that's how we would look at it. So, we still would be down from 2019 levels in those end markets. And oil and gas, specifically, and aerospace, as you mentioned, would be two of those. So, that's kind of how I would look at it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. \nDavid Begleiter: Ed and Lori, just on the sales guidance of up 7% to 9%, by segment, which would be above or below or in that range, do you think?\nLori Koch: I'll give it to you on the current segment basis and then we'll remap it on the Q1 call when we have all of these recast on to get to the new segment basis. So, from the old segment basis, we would see T&I probably at this above that average 8%, just given all the strengths that we had mentioned earlier with the with the V shaped recovery in automotive and potentially some pricing tailwinds that could come our way. Ed had just mentioned, within S&C, is more of a delayed recovery to full 2019 levels within a lot of the aramid end markets that fell into oil and gas and aerospace, for example. So, they would probably be below that 8%. And we would say electronics right now right around that average. And so, very strong in the first half as we see it. We're watching the second half to see how the trends continue across semi, across the 5G infrastructure to see how we continue to trend there. Obviously, we posted very strong results in 2020, up about 8% in that segment. I'd say that's where you put it. So, T&I at the top, D&I right around the middle and S&C probably lagging the average for the company.\nDavid Begleiter: How was January? Was it above or in line with your expectations? And what are you expecting on seeing around Chinese Lunar New Year?\nLori Koch: You hit the nail on the head with the Lunar New Year. So, January, it's hard to gauge from how the quarter is going to play out because it was strong, just given the timing of Lunar New Year from this year to last year. So, we're still comfortable looking at January results with the Q1 guidance that we gave. And we'll see how \u2013 we had mentioned that nylon price continues to play out as well as availability of raw materials within the T&I business to satisfy that demand. We'll see how much unconstrained demand we have at the end of the quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson of Credit Suisse.\nChristopher Parkinson: Naturally, there are a few moving pieces heading into 2021 as well as 2022. But just given the current end market trends you're seeing and how they're setting up after that timeframe as it pertains to op leverage, mix, your efforts to just further improve your overhead structure and improve your cost profile, how should we just generally think about incremental margins on a segment by segment basis over that period versus how we used to think of them? Are there any major differences we should really be honing in on? Thank you.\nLori Koch: I think on a steady state basis, there shouldn't be material difference between them. In 2021, it'll vary because of the recoveries and the different shape [indiscernible] of recovery. If we talk in a total company level, based on the guidance that we provided, you would see incremental margin sort of in the low 40s for 2021 over 2020 for the total company.\nChristopher Parkinson: And just as a follow-up, in terms of your water solutions portfolio, where do you see your largest strength heading into 2021 and 2022 in terms of product offering? And can you also comment on just any additional substrates, you feel, could potentially augment via M&A to further enhance the breadth of your offerings. So, just trying to get a better sense of the longer-term strategy within that portfolio? Thank you.\nLori Koch: I think with the acquisitions that we made at the tail end of 2019, we now have probably the most complete portfolio in the industry. So, we've got technologies within ultra-filtration, reverse osmosis and ion exchange. And so, as we look forward to capture opportunities there, we're looking to provide not only materials into those individual spaces, but also a solution set and a solution play, more along the lines of a complete offering.  As we look to M&A, we'll look to continue to round out that portfolio from both the tamping [ph] existing businesses as well as also potentially looking at a geographic play. So, obviously, a lot of the opportunity within the water spaces in more of the emerging regions and there are some M&A plays that we can utilize to take advantage to solidify our footprint in some of those geographies.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn McNulty: Just a follow-up on the water treatment side or the water solutions side. So, you indicated there were some order delays just around capital projects being delayed, I guess, can you quantify that a little bit or kind of frame it for us a little bit? And also, can you speak to the visibility that you have in this business? How far out you can actually see and how you see 2021 as a whole playing out this year?\nLori Koch: If we size kind of the headwinds that we saw in Q4, so as we had mentioned, the capital delays, there were also some logistical delays in the quarter, availability to get shipping out the door. It was probably about $15 million for the fourth quarter. So, as we look at January results, they were strong, they were again up about 6%. We're looking for the quarter to return to that mid to high single-digit growth within water. And for the year, generally, that levels as well. So, we're confident in the go forward portfolio there. We just had a little bit around a capital project delay. And as I had mentioned, logistics. As far as visibility is concerned, we have back-end loaded order patterns. And so, a lot of the sales go into large capital projects that tend to be pushed to the back end of the quarter. And so, our visibility there on those larger opportunities is a little bit more limited than some of the shorter-term opportunities of selling materials into, like I had mentioned, reverse osmosis and ion exchange.\nJohn McNulty: Just a follow-up on, Ed, your comments earlier around the hope of getting the gross margins to \u2013 at some point, getting them pretty close to 40% or above, with a lot of that tied to or it sounds like a disproportion amount tied to S&C. So, I guess just back of the envelope, that kind of says S&C starts to see margins at some point in the low to mid 30s, which is obviously a notable jump from kind of where we are. I guess, is it just operational improvement that gets you there? Is it mix improvement as some of these higher margin businesses, like water, really start to accelerate? I guess, how do you get to those types of levels, if that's what you're really targeting, say, over whatever over the next two to three years? \nEdward Breen: S&C, I would target it more towards the high 20s EBITDA margin because not all of the opportunity is in that business. But it is the biggest single piece. And I would say the single biggest thing then in there is the factory optimization or up times or throughput on those assets. So, that the biggest area and that's where we're putting a fair amount of focus on digital tools going into to help us there. But I think that business should be a high 20s EBITDA type of business over the medium term here, and we can definitely run it there. But it's mostly on the factory optimization piece. \nOperator: Our next question comes from one of John Roberts of UBS.\nJohn Roberts: Ed, do you have to reset some of your sustainability targets here with the N&B business going away because, obviously, that was the greenest of the DuPont businesses? No, we don't, John. We have our targets laid out by segment. They are public, obviously. So, you can go look at all of them. No, it doesn't really change what we're doing and what we've laid out. But I guess, overall, it does for DuPont because you're taking 30% of the EBITDA out those businesses, but we have targets laid out by division and then totally for the company.  And it's a big focus area for us this year. I don't think we've said this publicly, but we've actually put sustainability in our bonus structure this year. It's a modifier of 10% in either direction in what the bonus payout would be for the company based on targets that we set with the board. So, I'm happy and I'm glad that we've put that in place also, so all our employees know the importance of it to us. They hit the goals that we've laid out. \nJohn Roberts: Can you quantify at all what the raw material inflation number might be for 2021? What percentage up should we expect year-over-year? And what are the couple things that are going to be above the average to push that high?\nLori Koch: In total, I would quantify about $100 million of a headwind in 2021, with the predominance of it being within T&I and some of the nylon feedstock.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Mike Sison of Wells Fargo. \nMichael Sison: Just one question. I guess in Transportation & Industrial, a lot of companies in polymer lands has talked about recycling, sustainability, recycled plastics and that type of offering. Just maybe give us your thoughts on where you participate in that trend. And then, is it maybe potentially an area for acquisitions to beef up that part of your portfolio?\nLori Koch: I'll answer the second part first around the M&A opportunities right now. I would say they're more biased towards the electronics space. Within automotive, they could be biased towards getting us more of a footprint within the electric vehicle space. And then, obviously, as we had mentioned earlier, in the water space, rounding out that portfolio, taking advantage of the underlying growth trends within that space.  I think as far as the recyclability within that space, I don't see that as a large challenge for our business. I think that more within the plastics space, I don't see that as a material driver of the overall new DuPont company.\nLeland Weaver: Thank you, everyone, for joining our call. For your reference, a copy of our transcript will be posted on DuPont's website. This concludes our call.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Lori Koch",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed. And good morning. With the completion of the N&B transaction on February 1 and the substantial progress we made on non-core divestitures, we announced our new segment reporting structure for DuPont going forward. We will be aligned around three business reporting segments, Electronics & Industrial, Water & Protection, and Mobility & Materials.  Our new segment structure combines businesses with common financial characteristics, enabling clear line of sight and more effective allocation of resources across the company. Each business has a meaningful growth profile with a management team that understands how to best execute on its priorities and deliver for shareholders.  We will move the following businesses to the newly named Electronics & Industrial segment \u2013 Kalrez, Vespel, medical silicones and Molykote, each previously reported in our T&I segment.  We will move the Teijin Films joint venture, the Microcircuit Materials business, and the Tedlar business to our T&I segment, which will be renamed Mobility & Materials. Each of these was previously reported in our non-core segment.  Safety & Construction will be renamed Water & Protection to highlight our market-leading water business that we have grown both organically and inorganically over the past few years.  As Ed mentioned, we will wrap up the non-core segment as part of our first quarter reporting. We will report the results of the Biomaterials, Clean Tech and Solamet businesses in our Corporate segment until the divestitures are complete.  I'll cover our fourth quarter results on slide 6. As Ed did earlier, I'd like to acknowledge the significant efforts of our teams in delivering a strong fourth quarter, a capstone to what was an incredibly productive year.  We set working capital and CapEx targets and challenged our teams to enable the reduction of commercial paper balances to zero at year-end to improve our leverage heading into 2021. Our teams delivered once again. Net sales of $5.3 billion was flat versus the fourth quarter of 2019 on an organic basis and ahead of expectations we had set at the start of the quarter. Demand for our technologies and smartphones and semiconductors remained robust through the quarter, with no seasonal decline in smartphones as we typically see in the fourth quarter. Also contributing to the strong fourth quarter was further recovery in the automotive market. At the start of the quarter, industry benchmarks suggested fourth quarter auto builds would be down low-single digits. However, with over 23 million automobiles produced globally, the fourth quarter was the strongest production quarter of the year, up 3% versus the fourth quarter of 2019 and up about 14% versus the third quarter of 2020.  Our teams navigated a challenging raw materials environment across the polymer space to deliver volume growth in line with auto builds on both a year-over-year and sequential basis.  The end markets within S&C were very similar to the third quarter and consistent with our expectations. Demand for our protective garments continued to be strong, with garment sales up nearly 50% versus the fourth quarter of 2019.  The aramid side of our safety business was up versus the third quarter on a sequential basis, but continues to see year-over-year declines in volume as a result of the pandemic impacting demand for aerospace, oil and gas, and other select industrial applications.  Similarly, the environment shelter solutions remained consistent with what we saw in the third quarter, with strength in do it yourself applications and continued recovery in residential construction, offset by faster commercial construction demand. Shelter sales were up slightly on an organic basis in the fourth quarter. And demand for water filtration technologies remained strong across the world. However, our fourth quarter results were impacted by the timing of some shipments at year-end, resulting primarily from orders associated with capital projects. We will capture this demand in our first quarter results and return to mid to high-single digit growth.  Likewise, results for the N&B segment were in line with our expectations, with ongoing demand strength in probiotics and home and personal care markets, offset by the continued softness in biorefinery and microbial control.  From an earnings perspective, we also delivered a strong quarter, driven by improved volumes and the delivery of approximately $130 million of non-manufacturing cost savings, which enabled expanded EBITDA margins in each of our core segments in the quarter. Excluding approximately $160 million of discrete gains in the fourth quarter of 2019, we delivered operating leverage with mid-single digit operating EBITDA growth.  From a segment perspective, T&I delivered operating EBITDA margins of 31.6% on strong volumes and cost reductions. T&I delivered 310 basis points of operating EBIT expansion on higher volumes, tight cost control, and lower raw material costs, offset by year-over-year pricing pressure.  Likewise, S&C drove operating margin expansion of 40 basis points through cost control and favorable product mix, more than offsetting the impact of lower volumes. N&B operating margins expanded 100 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2019, led by favorable product mix and non-manufacturing cost control, more than offsetting raw material price increases and costs associated with the planned slowdown production across the N&B network to properly manage working capital.  Adjusted EPS of $0.95 per share was flat with the prior year. Savings from both structural and temporary cost reductions and benefits from a lower tax rate were offset by pricing headwinds and a headwind of approximately $0.17 associated with the prior-year discrete items.  We also delivered robust free cash flow in the fourth quarter, driven by controlled CapEx and working capital improvements. We closed the year with CapEx on target at $1 billion and approximately $850 million in working capital improvement, well above our target of $500 million for the year.  Looking forward over the medium term, we continue to believe we have additional opportunity to improve our working capital turnover, primarily through better supply chain management through the use of data analytics.  Slide 7 provides our financial outlook for both the first quarter and full-year 2021. Our guidance reflects DuPont on the new basics excluding N&B as it will be reflected as discontinued operations when we report our results.  We have provided recast first quarter and full-year 2020 results excluding N&B for comparison purposes. Later this month, we will release fully recast segment results for 2018 and all quarters in 2019 and 2020, reflecting the segment realignment, the elimination of the non-core segment and reflecting N&B as discontinued operations.  Our guidance also includes a full year of results for the three non-core businesses we have signed agreements to sell, and we will reset expectations as they close.  For the full year, we expect net sales of $15.4 billion to $15.6 billion, an increase of 8% at the midpoint, and operating EBITDA of $3.83 billion to $3.93 billion, an increase of 13% at the midpoint. We expect operating EBITDA margin improvement of approximately 100 basis points, driven by the impact of improved volumes and the remaining benefits of our structural cost actions we put in place last year. These gains will be partially offset by anticipated return of some 2020 temporary cost reductions.  Adjusted EPS of $3.30 to $3.45, an increase of 68% at the midpoint versus 2020 adjusted EPS of $2.01 per share, reflect stronger segment earnings and lower interest expense, which is enabled by the paydown of our debt balances, including commercial paper. Our adjusted EPS also reflects the reduced share count resulting from the exchange offer that closed on January 29 in connection with the separation of N&B.  As a reminder, this took out about 197 million DuPont shares. This results in a weighted average share count for the year of 555 million. This excludes the benefit of any future buybacks.  With that, let me turn it over to Leland to open the Q&A. For the quarter, we hit the quarter first of what we had guided to in the slide for the new M&M segment, we will see sequential improvement in nylon price. And so, we were down about 4% in Q4. We're looking at about 2% in Q1. So, there is some sequential improvement there. However, we still do expect to be down year-over-year just given that we were at still in a bit of a nylon run in the first quarter of 2020. So, as we go through the year, as Ed had mentioned, the pricing environment in nylon is constructive. We do have an awesome team that takes advantage of price. So, we do expect as we get to the full year that you could see positive price momentum as reported for the full year basis. Keep in mind, though, there are some raw material headwinds that Ed had mentioned that we're dealing with. So, some of that price most likely will be offset by escalating raws, especially as oil price is expected to pick up. There are some raw material headwinds that we will offset, but they could eat into some of the price appreciation that we would see. It will depend how the nylon dynamics plays out. Yeah. So, right now, I think we could hedge it, staying at about flat. But potentially with some upside, if the nylon and the end markets in auto continues to remain tight, there's I think a couple of recent force majeure in the industry that's making the price environment even more conducive. Same goes for working Capital. A lot of the opportunity still resides within inventory. I think our DSO is at a nice level. Indeed, our working capital, we can continue to improve and a lot of that back to the S&C or the new W&P business is where a lot of the opportunity lies. I'll give it to you on the current segment basis and then we'll remap it on the Q1 call when we have all of these recast on to get to the new segment basis. So, from the old segment basis, we would see T&I probably at this above that average 8%, just given all the strengths that we had mentioned earlier with the with the V shaped recovery in automotive and potentially some pricing tailwinds that could come our way. Ed had just mentioned, within S&C, is more of a delayed recovery to full 2019 levels within a lot of the aramid end markets that fell into oil and gas and aerospace, for example. So, they would probably be below that 8%. And we would say electronics right now right around that average. And so, very strong in the first half as we see it. We're watching the second half to see how the trends continue across semi, across the 5G infrastructure to see how we continue to trend there. Obviously, we posted very strong results in 2020, up about 8% in that segment. I'd say that's where you put it. So, T&I at the top, D&I right around the middle and S&C probably lagging the average for the company. You hit the nail on the head with the Lunar New Year. So, January, it's hard to gauge from how the quarter is going to play out because it was strong, just given the timing of Lunar New Year from this year to last year. So, we're still comfortable looking at January results with the Q1 guidance that we gave. And we'll see how \u2013 we had mentioned that nylon price continues to play out as well as availability of raw materials within the T&I business to satisfy that demand. We'll see how much unconstrained demand we have at the end of the quarter. I think on a steady state basis, there shouldn't be material difference between them. In 2021, it'll vary because of the recoveries and the different shape [indiscernible] of recovery. If we talk in a total company level, based on the guidance that we provided, you would see incremental margin sort of in the low 40s for 2021 over 2020 for the total company. I think with the acquisitions that we made at the tail end of 2019, we now have probably the most complete portfolio in the industry. So, we've got technologies within ultra-filtration, reverse osmosis and ion exchange. And so, as we look forward to capture opportunities there, we're looking to provide not only materials into those individual spaces, but also a solution set and a solution play, more along the lines of a complete offering.  As we look to M&A, we'll look to continue to round out that portfolio from both the tamping [ph] existing businesses as well as also potentially looking at a geographic play. So, obviously, a lot of the opportunity within the water spaces in more of the emerging regions and there are some M&A plays that we can utilize to take advantage to solidify our footprint in some of those geographies. If we size kind of the headwinds that we saw in Q4, so as we had mentioned, the capital delays, there were also some logistical delays in the quarter, availability to get shipping out the door. It was probably about $15 million for the fourth quarter. So, as we look at January results, they were strong, they were again up about 6%. We're looking for the quarter to return to that mid to high single-digit growth within water. And for the year, generally, that levels as well. So, we're confident in the go forward portfolio there. We just had a little bit around a capital project delay. And as I had mentioned, logistics. As far as visibility is concerned, we have back-end loaded order patterns. And so, a lot of the sales go into large capital projects that tend to be pushed to the back end of the quarter. And so, our visibility there on those larger opportunities is a little bit more limited than some of the shorter-term opportunities of selling materials into, like I had mentioned, reverse osmosis and ion exchange. In total, I would quantify about $100 million of a headwind in 2021, with the predominance of it being within T&I and some of the nylon feedstock. I'll answer the second part first around the M&A opportunities right now. I would say they're more biased towards the electronics space. Within automotive, they could be biased towards getting us more of a footprint within the electric vehicle space. And then, obviously, as we had mentioned earlier, in the water space, rounding out that portfolio, taking advantage of the underlying growth trends within that space.  I think as far as the recyclability within that space, I don't see that as a large challenge for our business. I think that more within the plastics space, I don't see that as a material driver of the overall new DuPont company."

            "name": "Edward Breen",
            "content": "Thanks, Leland. And good morning, everyone. I will provide comments on the tremendous progress we made on several strategic priorities during the fourth quarter of 2020 and the start of 2021.  But first, let me give my appreciation to our employees and partners around the world who rose to the occasion day after day in the face of extraordinary circumstances. 2020 presented us with the challenges of a global health pandemic, social and political unrest, and the worst economic conditions in many years.  Despite these challenges, our teams remained focused on health and safety, delivering for our customers, strengthening the financial position of the company and continuing to drive our strategic priorities forward.  It is because of our commitment of our employees that today we're able to announce strong financial results, as well as significant progress on critical milestones to make DuPont a premier multi-industrial company equipped for growth and value creation.  Starting on slide 2, on February 1, we announced the completion of the merger of our N&B business with IFF, creating an $11 billion industry-leading company in the food and beverage, home and personal care and health and wellness markets. The new IFF will have unmatched capabilities to deliver for customers, with leading positions in markets such as nutrition, probiotics, soy proteins, flavors and fragrances.  The combination of these complimentary portfolios puts IFF at the forefront of highly valued consumer ingredients companies that work closely with customers to meet the growing demand in areas such as all natural, clean label, and sustainability.  The combined management team has planned and prepared for this integration, and they are committed to delivering for all stakeholders. They are already executing on a playbook to capture both the cost and revenue synergies, enabled by the combination.  I am now on the IFF Board, and I look forward to coming into the lead director role this spring to continue overseeing the transformation of IFF.  This transaction also unlocks significant value for DuPont and our shareholders. Earlier this month, we received about $7.3 billion in cash, which enables us to further strengthen our balance sheet by reducing our long-term debt and gives us the flexibility to continue generating shareholder value.  As you know, we separated the N&B business through a split-off transaction in which DuPont shareholders were given the option to tender their DuPont shares in exchange for shares in IFF at a ratio of 0.718 shares of IFF for every share of DuPont. The exchange offer was fully subscribed, and all shares that were tendered were retired by DuPont, resulting in a reduction of 197 million shares or approximately 27% of our outstanding shares. This was a very efficient process for DuPont to get shares out of the market with zero cash outlay.  In closing, customers are excited about the potential this strategic combination can deliver in terms of being a partner of choice, R&D capability, and innovation.  Additionally, our N&B colleagues are energized by the opportunities before them. And we wish them continued success as they embark on this exciting new journey.  Slide 3 highlights the impact of other actions we took throughout 2020 to strengthen our balance sheet and position the company to continue generating shareholder value for a disciplined financial policy.  As Lori and I came into our roles in February of last year, and with the initial indications of a global pandemic soon thereafter, we quickly implemented actions to improve working capital and tensioned capital expenditures across each business and function.  We achieved a $850 million improvement in working capital and reduced capital expenditures to $1 billion, a reduction of nearly $300 million from our initial targets for the year. Combined, these actions enabled free cash flow conversion of more than 150% for the year.  These actions, combined with proceeds from non-core divestitures, enabled us to close the year with zero commercial paper balances, a reduction of more than $1.8 billion. We expect to further reduce our debt balances by using $5 billion of the cash received from the IFF deal. We have already retired our $3 billion term loan and plan to redeem the $2 billion notes in May.  We closed the year with greater than $2.5 billion of available cash. And as I mentioned, we expect to have $2.3 billion of cash remaining from the IFF transaction.  Combined with the continued strong cash generation and further proceeds from non-core divestitures, we are heading into 2021 in a very favorable liquidity position with no debt maturities due until the fourth quarter of 2023.  As we look to uses of our available cash in 2021, our financial policy will remain disciplined and balanced, maintaining a strong balance sheet, growing the company through investments in CapEx and R&D, acting on strategic M&A targets and returning value to our shareholders. We remain committed to maintaining our strong investment grade credit rating and are pleased that we have a stable rating from all the major agencies.  We also look to continue our CapEx at about 5% of sales and R&D spending at about 4% of sales for 2021.  With regards to dividends, we intend to maintain our current quarterly per share dividend of $0.30 per share. Going forward, we will target a payout ratio between 35% and 45%. And we will work with our Board to increase our dividend annually as we grow earnings.  Finally, share repurchases remain an important component of our financial policy, and we intend to resume buybacks utilizing our existing plan, which still provides authorization up to $1 billion.  We are also actively evaluating a couple of acquisition targets, which will enable even further acceleration of growth in key end markets. As we move through the year, we will redeploy our excess capital in ways which maximize shareholder value.  Turning to slide 4, we also recently signed agreements to sell our Clean Technologies and Solamet businesses, and we expect these transactions to close by mid-2021. Combined with the sale of the Biomaterials business, we anticipate more than $900 million in pretax proceeds from non-core divestitures this year.  Our priority of active portfolio management has focused our portfolio and generated significant cash for the company. Since June 2019, we have divested or signed agreements to divest nine businesses, in addition to the separation of N&B, generating over $2 billion in gross proceeds.  Additionally, exiting these businesses removes a significant amount of cyclicality from the DuPont portfolio and eliminates much of the volatility that was often in our non-core results.  With the agreements on Clean Tech and Solamet, we have divested a substantial portion of the non-core segment. We will wind down the non-core segment reporting in the first quarter of 2021 and report our results in three reportable segments going forward as we announced last week. I'll ask Lori to provide more color on our new segments, as well as detail on our financial performance, but let me close with a few comments on the settlement agreement that DuPont and Corteva reached with Chemours.  I am pleased that we have reached an agreement that I believe is in the best interest of all three companies. For DuPont, there were a few key principles. First, it was important that any settlement agreement capped our share of any potential liabilities as it defined them out.  We also have a long-term agreement with the building of an escrow account over the term to provide stakeholders of all three entities the confidence that the parties to the agreement will be able to satisfy the respective obligations if they were to materialize in the future. The agreement we announced met these principles and was a key step in reducing the uncertainty around potential legacy PFAS liabilities.  The other aspect of what we announced a few weeks ago was the settlement of the remaining Ohio multi-district PFOA litigation. Our portion of the settlement is $27 million.  To be clear, we continue to believe any exposure for DuPont related to potential legacy PFAS liabilities is contained due to heritage DuPont's limited manufacture and use of PFOA and the fact that we never made firefighting foam. Having an agreement with Chemours and Corteva enables us to work together as we move forward.  With that, let me turn it over to Lori. As Lori highlighted, we were expecting 8% revenue growth in 2021. So, we feel like it's going to be a robust year for us. And key for us is our 4% spend on R&D. So, that's clearly number one. And we're very focused on the secular growth areas within the portfolio where we're spending the R&D. So, we feel like we're going to have very good results organically as we move forward in the new configuration.  The way we're looking at M&A, I'd say, look, there's two targets that we're presently working on. I don't know if we'll be able to consummate them or not. We're not going to stretch to get them. We're going to make sure the numbers work for us. And we're going to make sure that numbers work on the cost synergy side, not taking into account revenue synergies, even though the couple that we're working on do have revenue synergies. So, we'll see how that plays out. We're actively in that right now. They're right down the middle of the plate in a couple areas that we already participate in. We're not going to do anything on the M&A side that's a new segment or anything like that. But we feel like there's some good consolidation opportunities right where we have our strengths and right where we have great relationships with customers. So, that's how we're looking at it.  And as we highlighted, we are \u2013 even though we just took 27% of our shares out of the market, not using any cash, we do have still $1 billion open on our authorization. So, we're going to get back in the market and start repurchasing shares. We have a Board meeting coming up in the next month. And that will be a topic that we will have with the Board, share buyback versus mix of M&A that we're planning on doing during the year. I think it's going to affect the auto builds. I think the forecast out there is 650,000, 700,000 cars that'll be reduced by because of the shortages out there. But, Jeff, we're running full tilt on the semi side. And quite frankly, the whole electronics segment is running full tilt. As Lori had mentioned, even the smartphone demand where we \u2013 gee, that did not even soften up in the fourth quarter, and usually seasonally that even declines. So we're pumping out as much as we can. But definitely, there's some slight slowdown, but the car production is still hot and heavy even with that 650,000 unit reduction. And hopefully, that works its way \u2013 those issues work its way through during the first quarter. So, we're seeing a little bit there. But again, I think our forecast is very solid for what we're going to do in the electronics business and the semi.  We're also seeing some headwinds on raw materials in the T&I business, which also somewhat relates to the auto business. So, we lost a little bit in volume in the fourth quarter and we'll lose a little bit of volume in the first quarter because of those constraints. But again, our forecast still is very solid and we're pretty much running full tilt there also. Scott, they are businesses that are kind of down right now because of the end market. So, take the Tedlar business, somewhat aerospace exposed. They're good businesses. Lori and I did really a study of all the non-core businesses and decided we have some really nice upside. And the businesses we're moving into T&I \u2013 T&I, that team is really great operators, which is exactly what's needed here. So, we think there's nice upside coming in these businesses. It was not \u2013 it wouldn't have been productive to sell them. I don't think it would have been good for our shareholders. And we see some good long-term trends there. So, we made this decision strategically to hold on to them and don't expect them to be up for sale during the year. That's not what we're doing. We're putting them in there and we're going to run them. No, the headwinds in T&I are really constraints, raw material constraints that we're having. [technical difficulty] we're going to have a very nice first quarter in T&I, but we could have more upside. I think we're going to \u2013 we think we're going to miss out on about $60 million to $80 million in sales in T&I because of raw material constraints in the first quarter. Now we think we'll get a lot of that back. We won't lose it because the whole industry is having a few issues there. But specifically to your question on pricing, things have firmed up very well. It's a constructive market for pricing as we've entered the first quarter. I think you'll see price increases in the industry across the board. But a lot of that won't kick in until you get it \u2013 by the time you put it in place with contracts with customers, usually 30 days, 45 days, you'll probably see more of that kick in in the second quarter. But it has turned very constructive at this point in time on the price front. It's a combo of both, Steve. We're cranking out more and we're freeing up capacity with a lot of moves we're making on the factory floor. But we're also adding capacity with \u2013 our biggest single CapEx project is the Kapton expansion. We're running flat out on Kaptons. We could definitely ship more if we had more manufacturing capability. And that comes online as we go into 2022. And that's a big move forward. The Kapton is what we use for the 5G and the smartphones. And also, that's a major expansion coming along that we desperately [technical difficulty]. Jonas, don't fully know yet. It's also partially going to be contingent on, do we do some M&A during the year. In aggregate, we're in a really nice spot here. We've got $5 billion to $6 billion of cash available to us as we close the three non-core sales that we've made, but haven't closed them yet. I think Lori mentioned there's still $900 million gross coming in during the first half of the year, in addition to the $2.3 billion excess from the IFF transaction and the $2.5 billion we have just coming into the year from non-core sales and operating cash flow. So, it's a really nice position to be in. And so, partially just in general on where we end up on the M&A front, not going to sit on cash through the [technical difficulty] big number. So, it'll either be M&A or buyback. Operational excellence if I just put it in two words. I think we have still nice runway for a lot of improvements. One of the areas that Lori and I are spending a lot of time on is really our throughput at our facilities. We think we have gross margin runway to improve. It's not \u2013 I think we're best in class when it comes to overhead cost structure if you benchmark us against the very best peers. So, that's not our opportunity, although we always look for ways to optimize that. But the key for us is the gross margin line. We want to move that up over time to 40%. We've been running kind of 35%. We're installing a lot of digital analytics at our facilities. We spent about $15 million last year on data analytics tools. This year, we budgeted $30 million. So, you kind of see how we're ramping there. A lot of it's on the supply chain and manufacturing efficiency. We're putting in some tools on smart demand forecasting, process optimization uptime, and we're seeing some real benefits from it. So, that's a huge focus area for us this year. Yeah, it is a good problem, John. I think when you're going back into an up environment here, I really look at it from what are the turns doing. And we took our turns from 4.3 turns going into last year to we exited the year at 5.2. And it's an $850 million improvement. And our plan this year is to slightly improve our turns from the 5.2. But not a lot this year, but slightly. And that would be a victory for us. No, the biggest opportunity is S&C. And it's also got our heaviest manufacturing footprint. So, between Nomex, Kevlar, and Tyvek, they are our biggest opportunities in the business. They are our biggest facilities. We definitely know we can improve our uptimes, our turnaround times. And that's the number one area we're working on. By the way, it's across the board. But the biggest opportunity is there. We always look at every opportunity. So, I don't think anything will get by us if there's something interesting. Let me just highlight on the M&A side, maybe just to size it a little bit for you. We could spend up to $2.5 billion on M&A. Now, things don't always work out. And as I said, we're not going to stretch to get something. So, you never know. But we're kind of looking in that kind of range, if it were to play out. So, just to kind of size it a little bit for you. But we always look at other alternatives. We get calls every week. If something makes sense, we'll study it. Yes. So, let me clarify that we have been supportive \u2013 we've testified in front of Congress, that if you designate it as a hazardous substance, we're totally in agreement with that. We'd rather have a national standard than every state doing their own thing. But remember, under the CERCLA or the superfund designation, it's very narrow who is responsible for it. It's where you disposed of the material. And the party responsible either had to be the site owner or the past site owner when it occurred or the person that arranged to transport it to that location. That is the definition under the CERCLA which is very narrow. You have to be one of the players that did that.  DuPont \u2013 by the way, we have four sites where we used it as a manufacturing agent. And we disposed of it on our own sites with, by the way, approval to do that. One of our sites is 800 acres. One of them was 1,500 acres. And that's why we had so much ground. That's where the disposals occurred. So, we're very contained where we did it. There's already cleanup going on with government authorities approving what we're doing. And it's been ongoing for quite a few years. And we never obviously dispose the firefighting foam anywhere in a dump or anything because we didn't make it. As the facts keep coming out, it'll get narrow and narrow here. And then we'll, as I've said before, and I don't want to get into too much detail, it's a little bit proprietary, but we'll look at a way to hopefully contain the firefighting foam issue, so our investors understand the limited or no liability that sits there based on what we did as a company. We're very focused on it. As you can see, we said there was a three-pronged approach, we just did two of the pieces. So, with the announcements we made, with the agreement between the three companies and settling the rest of the Ohio MDL for really very little in the scheme of things. And so, now we'll focus on this firefighting foam piece of it.  Remember, also, we have been sued in states we don't even have anything in the state \u2013 State of Arizona, the State of New Hampshire. We don't even have a facility there. We didn't do anything there. So, the facts will keep coming out here. And then, hopefully, we'll get resolution and hopefully something by the end of 2021. Well, I just signed a three-year contract, I don't know, a month or two ago. So, at least that period of time. So, no process in place. I'm very excited for the next few years. Well, it's one of the reasons we continue buying back shares. If you look at our multiple, whatever it is, 13 times, and I stare at ITWs and Honeywells and Eaton and we're just as good a company. I think part of it is, we've got to continue to post consistent results. I think consistency and people not having to worry, I think, means a lot in the multiple. I've been doing this for a long time. And I've been saying that for over 20 years. So, I think we just keep posting good numbers and I think we continue to close that gap. And I think we're going to benchmark very well this year. All our metrics vis-a\u0300-vis those other very good competitors, by the way, and multi-industry companies. So, there's a gap to that peer set for us of 400 to 500 basis points. And I truly don't believe that discount should be there at all. And so, we'll continue to prove that out during 2021. If I describe at high level, and maybe if Lori wants to give a little more detail, some of those, the oil and gas, aerospace, they dropped 30% to 40% on the revenue line. And our gut is we kind of glide back up, get half of that back in kind of 2021. That's kind of how \u2013 if you just put them all together, that's how we would look at it. So, we still would be down from 2019 levels in those end markets. And oil and gas, specifically, and aerospace, as you mentioned, would be two of those. So, that's kind of how I would look at it. S&C, I would target it more towards the high 20s EBITDA margin because not all of the opportunity is in that business. But it is the biggest single piece. And I would say the single biggest thing then in there is the factory optimization or up times or throughput on those assets. So, that the biggest area and that's where we're putting a fair amount of focus on digital tools going into to help us there. But I think that business should be a high 20s EBITDA type of business over the medium term here, and we can definitely run it there. But it's mostly on the factory optimization piece."

And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Leland Weaver. Please go ahead.\nLeland Weaver: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for DuPont\u2019s third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. We\u2019re making this call available to investors and media via webcast. We have prepared slides to supplement our comments during this conference call. These slides are posted to the Investor Relations section of DuPont\u2019s website and through the link to our webcast. Joining me on the call today are Ed Breen, Chief Executive Officer; and Lori Koch, Chief Financial Officer. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the slide. During our call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Our 2019 Form 10-K, as updated by our current and periodic reports, includes detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties, which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today exclude significant items. We will also refer to other non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in our press release and posted to the investor page of our website. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Breen: Thanks, Leland, and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. I\u2019d like to begin by recognizing the tremendous efforts of our employees across the world to deliver another solid quarter in the face of this global pandemic. Lori will cover the specifics of the quarter shortly, but I\u2019d like to take a few minutes to highlight our performance in a few key areas. The timely actions that we took earlier this year to protect our employees, ensure the safe operation of our sites, strengthen our financial position and do our part to combat the pandemic enabled us to deliver strong results this quarter. My senior leadership team and I closely monitor developments globally to ensure we are taking the right precautionary measures to continue protecting our employees, their safety and well-being remains our top priority. Our intense focus on safety has enabled all 170 of our global manufacturing sites to continue operating according to plan. This in turn has given us the ability to deliver for customers during a period of continued uncertainty. Additionally, our balance sheet remains strong. In fact, so far this year, we reduced our commercial paper balanced by approximately $1.4 billion to end the quarter with less than $400 million in CP, which was enabled by strong free cash flow and proceeds from the TCS and Hemlock divestitures we announced in September. Since the end of the quarter, we have further reduced our commercial paper balances and we look to make additional progress through year end. We also remain committed to doing our part to help during these unprecedented times. We continued to enable production of approximately 30 million Tyvek protective garments per month in an effort to provide healthcare and frontline workers with the protection they need to battle this global pandemic. I\u2019ll cover more details regarding operational excellence on the next slide, but let me just say that I am encouraged by the progress we are making here. We continue to remove structural G&A cost and execute on our working capital improvements, which helps to drive our strong free cash flow and operating earnings improvements. We have moved faster and found additional pockets of G&A costs to streamline, enabling us to increase our expected cost savings from our 2020 initiatives from $180 million to $280 million. I am also pleased with the progress that we have made in advancing the N&B and IFF transaction, as well as the divestitures of non-core assets. In August IFF shareholders voted overwhelmingly in favor of the transaction and we remain on track for first quarter 2021 closed and we are targeting February 1st. With regards to non-core in September we announced the divestiture of the TCS business along with our equity interest in the Hemlock semiconductor joint venture for $725 million. Earlier this month, we also signed a deal to sell the biomaterials business for $240 million. These portfolio refinement efforts contribute to value creation by increasing cash flow, strengthening the balance sheet and focusing our portfolio in markets where we expect to see solid growth opportunity. Moving to Slide 3, I like to provide more specifics on the progress we\u2019ve made, improving our cash generation and G&A productivity. Free cash flow conversion on a year-to-date basis was 140%. Through September, we\u2019ve delivered approximately $1.9 billion of free cash flow versus $1.6 billion for all of 2019. This growth is primarily attributable to actions we have taken to reduce our capital expenditures and improve working capital. During the quarter, we significantly reduced inventory balances and the team is focused on reducing past due accounts receivable, also yielded positive results as we reduced our past due balances as a percentage of accounts receivable to 4%. We\u2019ve also lowered planned capital spending for 2022, to approximately $1.0 billion, nearly $500 million less than 2019 levels. As a reminder, we did not reduce any safety related CapEx and have developed detailed plans for restarting our growth projects to ensure we are able to capture demand when markets fully recover.  We delivered more than 185 basis point reduction in non-manufacturing costs as a percentage of sales in the quarter, mostly in G&A. Of the approximately $150 million of cost savings that we realized, $100 million was structural in nature. As I mentioned, we now expect our 2020 in period savings from current year actions to be $280 million, versus our prior estimate of $180 million. Our cost actions are targeted towards G&A expenses and are aimed at enabling a highly productive, appropriately scaled, cost structure. Growth through innovation remains a key component of our strategy. And we continue to invest in critical areas like sales, application development, and R&D so that we will be well positioned to capture growth when we fully emerge from the current market environment. Before turning it over to Lori, I just like to make a few comments on some of the sequential trends that we saw in the third quarter. We saw a 15% increase in operating EBITDA, as well as 200 basis point improvement in operating EBITDA margin versus the second quarter. This rebound was most significant within T&I, as global auto builds were up more than 60% sequentially, stronger than our expectations going into the quarter. Additionally, our third quarter decremental margins was approximately 31%, an improvement of approximately 1,400 basis points versus second quarter, led by strengthening topline and continued structural cost removal across the company. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Lori to walk through some of the details for the quarter.\nLori Koch: Thanks Ed. And good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 4 and the financial highlights for the quarter, net sales for the quarter were $5.1 billion, down 6% organically and as reported. Portfolio was neutral as acquisitions in Water Solutions, offset divestitures in E&I and non-core. Likewise, currency was neutral in the quarter. Pricing was mixed across the portfolio with gains in S&C and non-core offset by price declines primarily in T&I. Price declines in T&I were down mid-single digits were in line with expectations. We expect similar T&I pricing through the fourth quarter as nylon 66 prices had generally stabilized in the back half of the year. On a regional basis, organic sales increased 3% in Asia-Pacific versus a year ago period, with declines in the other regions. China sales in our core segments improved 14% versus the third quarter of 2019 and 10% sequentially from second quarter 2020. I\u2019ll provide additional color on our segment top line results on the next slide. We delivered operating EBITDA of $1.3 billion and adjusted EPS of $0.88 per share, well above expectations driven by better than expected top-line results in our E&I and T&I segments and more favorable product mix with continued strength in semiconductors, Tyvek protective garments and probiotics. Once again, our teams maintained strong cost control to deliver operating EBITDA decline in line with the sales decline on a percentage basis. Our decremental margin was approximately 31%, also ahead of our expectations heading into the quarter. Excluding approximately $60 million of costs associated with temporarily idling facilities, primarily in T&I and S&C as well as gains in both the current and prior year periods, our decremental margins were in the mid single-digits. A significant improvement from the second quarter, driven by the improving top line and continued structural cost takeout. As Ed mentioned, we are also delivering on our cash targets, free cash flow of approximately $1.9 billion through the first nine months of the year, led to a conversion rate of approximately 140%. In addition to the strong free cash flow, Ed mentioned the process we have made on the non-core divestitures, which enabled the reduction of commercial paper balances in the quarter. These actions have lowered our net debt position and improved our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to below three times. Slide 5 provides more detail on the year-over-year change in net sale, consistent strength across semiconductors, probiotics, home and personal care, Tyvek protective garments and water solution, coupled with improvement in automotive and residential construction markets led to an overall organic sales decline of 6%, which reflect steady growth of the second quarter growth. Several of our businesses have market-leading products, which enabled them to succeed despite global challenges presented by the pandemic. Within electronics and imaging, semiconductor technologies delivered its third consecutive quarter of organic growth. Likewise, with Nutrition & Biosciences, our probiotics and home and personal care offerings continue to capitalize on robust global demand, each with double-digit growth in the quarter. Finally, within Safety & Construction, the Tyvek protective garment business is providing critical PPE to our medical communities and front-line workers. And the water business continues to provide market-leading innovation demanded by our customers. In the third quarter, sales in the water business are up low single-digits on an organic basis and up mid-teens percent as reported due to the acquisitions we have made in the space. We also saw market improvement in other key markets in the third quarter, most notably automotive and residential construction, which contributes to the sequential improvement in the top line. We estimate that global auto builds were down about 4% in the third quarter versus the same period last year, a substantial improvement from the historical lows in the second quarter and stronger than we anticipated. And down 9% for the quarter, our T&I volume performance is consistent with the improvement in market demand and the lag we expect due to the majority of our automotive sales going into the Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers. There were also green shoots in residential construction, a market that represents approximately 40% of the shelter business within S&C. Our solutions to the residential construction market include Tyvek Building, Wrap, Styrofoam Insulation and GREAT STUFF Insulating Foam, which has also experienced strong retail demand from an increase in do-it-yourself projects. Despite tailwinds in residential construction, our shelter business was down versus last year due to ongoing softness and commercial construction, which makes up the remaining 60% of the shelter business. Also contributing to the improvement in top line was demand for our materials that enable smartphone technology. Increasing material content, which now accounts for up to $4 a phone in the top-end model, overcame an overall declining smartphone market and drove high single-digit growth in our interconnect solutions business as premium phone manufacturers prepared for model launches and holiday demands. Overall, top line performance continues to be impacted by significant weakness in oil and gas, aerospace, commercial construction, and select industrial markets. These market dynamics are most prevalent in the safety and shelter businesses within S&C to health and biosciences business within N&B and across the non-core segment. Before moving to the next slide, let me comment on our year-to-date performance. I am pleased that our teams focus on execution and operational excellence. Two areas that Ed and I have been focused on since day one. Through the first nine months, our sales have declined 6% on an organic basis. And our focus on streamlining our overhead structure has enabled us to better maintain our earnings. Over the same time period, our EBITDA margin has declined just 7% excluding costs associated with temporary idling facilities in the second and third quarters. Choosing to run these sites for cash was the right decision for the strength of the company and it is showing in the strength of our balance sheet and cash flow. Turning to the adjusted EPS bridge on Slide 6. Adjusted EPS of $0.88 is down 8% versus the same quarter last year, driven by lower volume, cost associated with idling facilities and the impacts of non-core divestitures. These headwinds are partially offset by the delivery of cost savings. As I mentioned, our cost actions from the 2019 restructuring program, coupled with the incremental action we are driving in 2020, contributed to approximately $150 million of savings in the quarter. The impact of portfolio actions is a net headwind, primarily due to the absence of the gain on sale of the DuPont Sustainable Solutions business in the third quarter of 2019. We realized three-center benefits from below the line items, primarily a lower share count due to share repurchases we executed in the second half of 2019 and early 2020, and lower interest rates enabled by reduction in commercial paper balances. These benefits were offset by a slightly higher base tax rate of 21%. In summary, I would emphasize again, what Ed said at the start of the call, our team is laser-focused on execution, and we are now consistently delivering on our earnings, cash flow and cost saving commitments. Through a period of significant uncertainty, we continue to progress our strategic priorities, which positions us well as we look ahead to 2021 to continue creating value for our shareholders. As we show on Slide 7, we will continue to strengthen our balance sheet with the anticipated closing of N&B and IFF deal in the first quarter of next year, as well as the closing of the biomaterials deal in the first half of 2021. Tyvek\u2019s strength alone will generate over $7.5 billion of cash proceeds, nearly $2.5 billion of which we will have available after planned debt repayment fees for creating shareholder value. Additionally, we expect our strong free cash flow generation to continue into 2021. As we said earlier, we have significantly improved our net debt position with the reduction of commercial paper balances and we do not have any debt repayments until the fourth quarter of 2023. Beyond those we intend to satisfy with the proceeds from the N&B and IFF deal. I\u2019m excited for what\u2019s ahead. And I commend our team for staying focused on execution to put us in a position to have the flexibility to capitalize on the opportunities for growth and shareholder value creation going forward. With that, let me turn it back to Ed for an update on the N&B and IFF transaction and some final comments on what we expect in the fourth quarter.\nEd Breen: Thanks, Lori. And now turning to Slide 8, we highlight the progress we\u2019ve made since announcing the N&B and IFF transaction. During the quarter, we completed two additional milestones. In August, IFF shareholders voted overwhelmingly in favor of the transaction with more than 99% of the votes cast in favor of the deal. Then in September, N&B issued $6.25 billion of senior unsecured notes in a private placement. The net proceeds from the offering are intended to fund part of N&B special cash payment of $7.3 billion to DuPont. The net proceeds are held in escrow until the deal closes. The offering was more than 5 times oversubscribed and resulted in a very favorable cost of borrowing for these notes. We continue to make progress regarding regulatory approval. And additionally, our integration planning remains on track as the team\u2019s work to a first quarter 2021 closing. I remain excited about this combination and confident that the new company will be well positioned for growth and to deliver sustainable value for shareholders. Let me close with our financial outlook on Slide 9, which we have prepared assuming no substantial change in the slope of the recovery due to the pandemic. Obviously, this is a fluid situation with increasing cases and we are monitoring this closely. We expect to deliver net sales for the year in the range of $20.1 billion to $20.2 billion, and adjusted EPS in the range of $3.17 to $3.21. Sequentially from the third quarter, normal seasonal declines in E&I from smartphone production cycles, and S&C from the timing of North America construction activity will be partially offset by improvement in T&I as auto demand continues to recover, although at a much more gradual pace as compared to the prior quarter. Our forecasted earnings also reflects the absence of a $30 million technology sale in E&I and the loss of earnings from Hemlock and TCS, which were divested in September. We will stay focused on driving improvements in working capital and delivering our cost savings commitments. With that, let me turn it back to Leland to open the Q&A.\nLeland Weaver: Thanks, Ed. Before we move to the Q&A portion of our call, I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. We will allow for one question and one follow-up question for person. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we will hear our first question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tusa: Hey guys, good morning.\nEd Breen: Hey, good morning, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Can you just maybe comment on the \u2013 there was a bit of a change of language in the last filing with regards to the IFF transaction around your decision on whether you\u2019re going to spin or split. Can you maybe just talk about what your thoughts are there? Looks like maybe a split is more likely, but you want to obviously maintain the flexibility and optionality with the kind of whole cleanup spend dynamic. Maybe just talk about what your latest thoughts are on that front.\nEd Breen: Yes, Steve. We will be making that decision by mid-December. And we truly have not made a decision yet. I wouldn\u2019t put a leaning one way or the other on it. We took some language change, because we wouldn\u2019t do a hybrid type approach. We\u2019ll pick one or the other, and that was the change in language. But no decision at this point in time. I wouldn\u2019t read anything into it.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. And then just the follow-up would be on the 4Q, I think the implied downside in to 4Q guide is a bit more than what you\u2019re losing from non-core and that that gain in T&I, is there anything else sequentially that\u2019s on an absolute basis kind of getting a worse, I guess you mentioned seasonality and electronics. But is T&I basically, did you overfill the channel before, or is that \u2013 are you kind of like is it a timing dynamic where at some point in the next couple quarters that will snap back to the kind of line and re-coupled?\nLori Koch: Yes. So let me go first to the sequential. So there\u2019s no real change in market dynamics as we see it right now. So there\u2019s actually continued sequential lists in T&I kind of in the mid-single digit space. The drops sequentially in revenue and EBITDA, it\u2019s more driven by seasonality and it\u2019s normal seasonality that we see in our businesses. So primarily it fits within smartphones. So as we get ready in the third quarter for the holiday demand coming up, we had a live sales in 3Q that would not be there in 4Q due to normal seasonality. Additionally, within our construction space, third quarter tends to be high just with the summer months driving a lot of the construction. So you\u2019ll see little bit of deceleration there from a seasonal perspective. So the decline that you\u2019re kind of getting at is roughly in the $100 million space sequentially 3Q to 4Q about a third of that is related to the seasonal decline that we just discussed. Another third of it is we did have a gain on a technology sale and E&I in 3Q that won\u2019t be there in 4Q and the rest of the largest primary piece is the sale of the Hemlock TCS assets that were sold in September. So within T&I, we don\u2019t really see any level of channel level \u2013 high inventory levels in the channel. So if you see where we look year-to-date, our volumes are down about 15% in T&I versus the auto bills are down about 23%. So I think we\u2019re outperforming there. There\u2019s really if you look at where we fell into as we mentioned on the call, we fell into the Tier 1 and Tier 2 players primarily. So it doesn\u2019t always exactly line up with the auto bills number. You kind of got to look at it year-to-date to understand the lag. So we\u2019re comfortable where we sit going and their material changes from a market perspective as we see it right now.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll hear our next question from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Davis: Hi, good morning, guys.\nEd Breen: Hey, Scott.\nLori Koch: Hey, Scott.\nScott Davis: Hi. Kind of curious, you\u2019ve been chipping at corporate and G&A really, since we got involved in your story. And is this kind of \u2013 is there an end game, I guess, is this kind of every quarter you look at just trying to take rebels down or you opportunistically can. Or is there a certain goalpost of where you want to get to and then you feel like that\u2019s the sustainable right level?\nEd Breen: Yes. Scott, I mean, I\u2019d put it more in the category of chipping away at it, as we streamline some of our functions and capabilities we can get do a little more streamlining on our overhead. We\u2019re putting in some digital tools and we\u2019re going to do a central finance tool and things like that really help us out. So I think we\u2019re getting the best in class on our G&A, when you look at peer companies and all, I think we\u2019re doing a heck of a job there. I would highlight one area, we\u2019re not touching or taking down at all as we said in our prepared remarks is clearly our salespeople around the world, our application engineering teams around the world and we\u2019re going to continue to spend at the level we\u2019ve been spending out on the R&D front. So we want to come out of the softness in this pandemic period, real strong with lots of new product introductions coming. So it\u2019s really going to continue to stay focused on the G&A piece of it. And then I would really say that the next big focus and we\u2019re focused on it now, but we\u2019re really doubling down is going to be on the gross margin line and our factory efficiency are up times. And again, we\u2019re doing a fair amount of digital tools, they\u2019re not overly expensive to really look into predictive analytics at our facilities with a lot of AI capability. And we really think we can do some fair amount of improvements there and hopefully help the gross margin line. So that\u2019s where you\u2019ll see some of the \u2013 kind of the effort is we\u2019re going into 2021.\nScott Davis: Okay, good. And then on the inventory side, another big drawdown this quarter. Where do inventory sit at kind of through the channel. And are you \u2013 do you feel like we\u2019ve gotten to the level where you want \u2013 your inventory is, and then obviously, as you look through the channel.\nEd Breen: Our inventories have a ways to go still now by as a sales pickup, that\u2019ll new as a little bit here on progress. But that we\u2019re expecting nice progress again in the fourth quarter. We still have over a $500 million opportunity on inventory to get to where we think we can get to. So that\u2019s kind of our bogey out there. And again, we\u2019ll make good progress in the fourth quarter. As far as inventory in the channel, obviously, Scott, I actually feel very good about it right now, as you know, the auto industry doesn\u2019t have a lot of finished goods. There\u2019s not any stuffing in the channel going on. And I really don\u2019t see it anywhere, except maybe just a little bit in the electronics space. I think there may potentially, and I\u2019ve heard some of our competitors talk about maybe a little pre-buying from some of the Chinese players, nervous about what\u2019s going on geopolitically right now. But I don\u2019t even think that was a big number. And in the scheme of all of our sales in electronics not significant, but that\u2019d be maybe the one area where there\u2019s a little bit of that.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nBob Koort: Thanks, good morning.\nEd Breen: Good morning, Bob.\nBob Koort: I was curious in the T&I business, you guys have been idling capacity and obviously that\u2019s hurting your margins, but helping your working capital. If we look to next year in a more normalized world and I guess global auto builds are going to be up mid teens and GDP up mid single digits. Can you talk about how powerful the incremental recovery might be and where those margins might get to relative to the 23% operating margin you just reported?\nLori Koch: Yes, so we see the T&I portfolio around the mid-20s from an EBITDA margin perspective in our market. So we\u2019ve got some sequential upside as we head into next year, really driven by the items that you had mentioned. So a top line recovery as well as having a lot of the idle facilities behind us.\nBob Koort: And is there any update on the discussions with Chemours and Corteva in terms of your separation indemnification agreements? Thank you.\nEd Breen: Yes. Well, first of all, the arbitration is started up with Chemours on MAC. And there probably won\u2019t be any decision on that until kind of mid next year, if you look at the timeline on it. But we continue to talk to each other about the settlement, in fact, Mark Vergnano, the CEO of Chemours and I actually just talked this Monday. A couple of open points, we continue to get closer and then we\u2019ll see if we can get it to the finish line. So that\u2019s paralleling along while the arbitration starts.\nOperator: And our next question will come from John Inch with Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead.\nJohn Inch: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. And Lori, what are the cost savings that spill over from actions taken in 2020 into 2021? And are you planning for prospectively more restructuring or would that potentially be too disruptive given all of the restructuring that\u2019s already gone on against the backdrop of what I will describe as a fledgling recovery?\nLori Koch: Yes. So I think the savings that will trickle into 2021 is around $120 million. So we\u2019re targeting now $280 million of in period savings, so on a run rate basis, that\u2019s about $400 million as we exited, so another $120 million next year. There are just some headwinds that we\u2019ll face next year as well. Obviously, there\u2019ll be some snap back into temporary savings, but we really biased our actions towards the structural. So we don\u2019t have a material headwind, but there will be some, opening up of the economy that was in itself to some T&E and some other stuff that we\u2019ve really seen clamped down this year. Right now as I had mentioned, I don\u2019t see additional structural cost takeout. Really the opportunity for us is within gross margin and driving more productivity and gross margin. And second to that, continuing to drive our productivity and working capital. So we\u2019ve made a lot of nice progress this year. We\u2019re up about from a working capital trade perspective, only about $250 million year-to-date that we\u2019ve nicely dug ourselves out of the hole that we got in earlier in the year. And we\u2019re still targeting more than $500 million of working capital savings this year, but we still have a ways to already get to best-in-class there.\nJohn Inch: Thanks, Lori. I\u2019m assuming these gross \u2013 the gross margin initiatives are probably longer term. And I wanted to ask you also kind of \u2013 for your strategic thoughts could do you possibly even further S&C expansion into water, I\u2019m thinking maybe technologies where you don\u2019t play currently such as EUV, or even say \u2013 I don\u2019t know, getting into the production of equipment as well as the filtration products that you currently provide.\nEd Breen: Yes. So John, we\u2019re very interested if we can and expanding the water business. So that would be one area. I don\u2019t want to comment on details, because you get pretty specific and there\u2019s not that many targets out there. So I won\u2019t get into that, but the water business would be one. There\u2019s some areas in the electronics business, I will mention that one, 5G type stuff, we would be interested in. And but let me just say overall, we\u2019re really looking at things I would put in the category of bolt-on acquisitions nothing on a bigger scale in 2021. But it could be several of bolt-ons during the year. They make financial sense.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Maybe just a couple of follow-ups on kind of segment level kind of dynamics. First on T&I just thinking about the price pressure there, I think is largely a function of kind of year-over-year dynamics, but I wonder if you could just give us a view on how you see pricing playing sequentially with the builds firming up. Do we move to a little more constructive price environment, perhaps not as soon as Q4, but into the early part of next year?\nLori Koch: Yes, we do. We do see a more constructive price environment. So I think the majority of the Nylon 66 headwinds that we\u2019ve seen are behind us. So we did see year-over-year headwinds in the third quarter and we\u2019ll expect year-over-year headwinds again in the fourth quarter, but those are really just a function of the price decline from the prior year, where they were still quite strong, so sequentially looking at about flat pricing. As we look into 2021, obviously, we\u2019ve done a nice job of taking advantage where we can have of constrained environments and we\u2019ll be able to keep our eye on that to be able to see any games that we could possibly pick up there. I think also within T&I just overall, once the market normalizes and stabilizes, we do expect to get back to that 1.5 times auto builds outperformance within that portfolio. You can\u2019t see it year-to-date. So as I had mentioned earlier, our T&I volumes being down about 15% year-to-date versus auto bills being down 23% year-to-date. So you can see that outperformance and the look to continue that going forward once the market fully recovered.\nJeff Sprague: And on the semi side specifically, I mean, you kind of spoke to the seasonal led up on handset with E&I, but some of yours kind of continued to surprise to the upside kind of all year here. Do you \u2013 and there\u2019s a lot of consolidation starting to happen in that industry. Do you see anything that kind of disrupts your growth trajectory there? And what\u2019s your view looking forward kind of a quarter or two there in terms of the end demand environment?\nEd Breen: Yes. Jeff, I\u2019ll just comment on kind of October, because I know that demand feels pretty good still on the semi side. So we\u2019re not really seeing any change from what we\u2019ve been seeing in the last few quarters. So at least so far going into the fourth quarter, that feels nice. And again, I just think the dynamics of work-at-home and what everyone\u2019s doing with data centers and nodes and all that, looks like potentially good momentum going into next year. But we\u2019ll see when we get closer to the end of year. I know one of our key competitors a very, very good company and CEO\u2019s a good friend of mine. He talked very bullishly about demand going into 2021 also. So that feels good. And again, the only thing at electronics and you just mentioned that it was a little bit of the seasonality on a smartphone because we had such strong shipments in the third quarter for the shipments and launches of the new phones in the fourth quarter. But we feel good about the portfolio, we have on the 5G side, as more phones are enabled 5G going into 2021. It\u2019s nice upside opportunity for us.\nOperator: And our next question will come from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn McNulty: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, I guess, the first one would just be, look, we\u2019ve had about a month of kind of the COVID research and especially kind of out of Europe and a little bit less of that in the U.S. Any changes in demand pull that you\u2019ve seen either positive for maybe some of your healthcare related products or negative as just some of the economy shutdown, anything that we should be thinking about and trying to think about extrapolating going forward?\nEd Breen: Well, no change in any of the end market demand that we\u2019ve talked about due to the rising cases \u2013 probably, I say so far. It\u2019s all the same ones. I mean, obviously auto coming back really strong, residential construction, we\u2019re now seeing those green shoots coming back, not surprising with what\u2019s going on in the resi market. And all the areas that are down kind of significantly oil and gas, aerospace commercial construction, they\u2019ve all come up a little bit, but not significantly. So they\u2019re not dropping anymore, they\u2019re picking up slightly, but they\u2019re still are negative numbers. So we haven\u2019t seen any change in October in patterns that we weren\u2019t expecting.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. Okay. No, thanks for the color. And then, look, on the other side, you\u2019ve gotten a lot of the non-core assets kind of out the pipeline. And I guess, does that \u2013 in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about going forward, does that free up time to look at kind of bigger more strategic options or is it really right now a little bit more about running the business in admittedly a pretty volatile time with a lot of kind of puts and takes going on? How should we be thinking about where management\u2019s putting their time right now?\nEd Breen: Yes. No, John it\u2019s very much running the business. I keep telling the team all hands on deck here. We want to string together a lot of consistent results. We\u2019ve been doing that. We\u2019ve got a ways to go here. Some things still to get to best-in-class performance on like working capital. So, it\u2019s more of that and it\u2019s more looking at bolt-ons next year. And I would think as we get into next year, we\u2019ll be having a serious conversation with the Board about the share repurchase, where we\u2019re trading at, there were new DuPont will be trading as N&B goes out of the portfolio. So that\u2019s the mode we\u2019re in.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nSteve Byrne: Yes. Thank you. Was there anything in particular that provoked the house environment subcommittee to ask for some nip these data from your part \u2013 from the legacy Parkersburg and the Circleville facilities? And do you have a sense of where their diligence is going these days with respect to PFAS contamination broadly?\nEd Breen: Steve, I didn\u2019t read anything into it. We\u2019re going to supply all the information and answer all the questions, all that data\u2019s obviously available and it\u2019s been supplied to many federal agencies already. So, I don\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s just information we\u2019ve given before. So, we\u2019ll answer it in a timely manner. But I \u2013 maybe, I would go to a little bit broader to your question there. This ETA puts some regulation in place. We\u2019re always asked that and that might be part of the push here. And we are actually for that, we said that in front of Congress when we testify, but not everyone in the industry is for that, but we think it would be great to have a national standard set on where those levels should be at, instead of it being a patchwork by state and maybe by municipality. who knows? And we actually think that would be very helpful that we\u2019re all targeting the same thing as we do remediation and all that. So that\u2019s where we see a lot of the push at the federal level and world for that happening.\nSteve Byrne: And just to follow up on that, Ed, is the national standard something that you think would focus their attention on \u2013 less on manufacturing sources and more on product use as a source of PFAS contamination. And is that where you see the potential benefit?\nEd Breen: No. No. I just think having a standard set out there that we\u2019re all marching to would be very helpful instead of having literally 50 different standards being set. And by the way, just to make a point, I make every one of these calls, there\u2019s many more locations that had PFAS, but remember how high percentage of this is firefighting foam. And I think you\u2019ll, DuPont will \u2013 we\u2019ll let that play out here in the South Carolina consolidation here, and potentially, we\u2019ll settle it or we\u2019ll let it go through the core system, but we never made the firefighting foam. So, our work is really remediation in some of our sites, where we did some a manufacturing, which is a handful.\nOperator: And next we\u2019ll hear from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you. Ed, first on the cost savings, what drove the increase from the 180 to 280 for the full year?\nLori Koch: Yes. So that was really a function of really clamping down on third-party spends, consultants and the like. and then we were able to accelerate a bit, some of the offers that we had planned that benefit is benefiting the inferior savings for this year.\nDavid Begleiter: Got it. And Ed, with the IFF transaction three months away from closing, what are your updated thoughts on what\u2019s next for the DuPont portfolio specifically, perhaps unlocking some value in E&I to maybe another RMT. Thank you.\nEd Breen: Yes. David, I said a few minutes ago, we\u2019re operationally going to run new DuPont the way we are. I got it. We want to clean up the non-core some more. So, we\u2019re very focused on that also from a portfolio standpoint. We\u2019ll be in an interesting position going into next year with the cash we\u2019re receiving from the IFF transaction. As Lori mentioned, we\u2019ll have at least $2.5 billion to $3 billion of excess cash available. So, as I said, we\u2019ll be talking to the board about how we\u2019re going to deploy that to create shareholder value in 2021. And I would expect a few baby bolt-on acquisitions would fit in there next year if they make financial sense for us to do.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMike Sison: Hey, good morning. Nice quarter. In terms of Nutrition & Biosciences, your EBITDA growth is up high single digit till this year, tough sales comps. So, if you think about getting that \u2013 getting better growth in that business next year, where do you think EBITDA growth should sort of be as volumes return?\nLori Koch: Yes. So, we\u2019ve always thought that the N&B portfolio to get closer to the company average from a margin perspective, they\u2019re looking at 26% or 27%. So, they\u2019ve got continued upside. A lot of that\u2019s really going to come from just a higher favourable mix. So, as they grow probiotics, as they grow their enzyme portfolio, as they grow their meatless meat market, those are all very high margin product lines that will lift the overall margin of the segment.\nMike Sison: Okay. Quick follow-up, then if you do get to close the business on February 1, how do you feel about the integration synergy potential? You\u2019ve had a year here to plan for it, is there upside and if there is, where could that be?\nEd Breen: Well, I won\u2019t talk about if there\u2019s upside, I should probably leave that to the IFF team when they do their earnings that would not be fair to believe. But I feel good about it. We\u2019ve got multiple teams as we did when we did DowDuPont, all that working on all the integration efforts. We\u2019re right on track. by the way, I must say I\u2019m surprised we\u2019re doing as well as we are considering everyone\u2019s working at home, but every one of the work streams is right on track. Lori and I review it literally weekly with the IFF team. So, we\u2019re ready to go on the synergy work that we\u2019ve outlined publicly and we\u2019ll get off to a very quick start.\nOperator: And next week, we will hear from John Roberts with UBS. Please go ahead.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you. Staying on N&B for a second here, food and beverage sales were down, probably close to the 4% decline for the overall segment. Can you give us some regional and maybe, application granularity on the decline in food beverages?\nLori Koch: Yes. So, a big piece of the decline was driven by sales into the food service fees, which makes us about 5% of total N&B. It would be bigger obviously within food and beverage segment that was down kind of in the mid-teens. And so that\u2019s really selling into sports arenas, cafeterias. So really, the industries that have been hit hard by COVID, so nothing underlying there beyond that. And a lot of that was in Europe. So, I think Europe was one of the markets that were hit hardest within the N&B portfolio and it\u2019s really back to that the food services play. Also, another impact that we saw a headwind was just as travel has clamped down, we had the large market into like the chewing gum and mint stays within our sweeteners portfolio. So, as there\u2019s less travel, less people going through airports that impacted the business.\nJohn Roberts: And then do you think you\u2019ll report your year-end before February 1 close or after and do we get N&B as discontinued off in 4Q if you report after February 1, just trying to figure out the information flow we\u2019re going to get here over the next few months.\nLori Koch: Yes. So, I would look at most likely to be after the February spin dates. So, we can report kind of on remain co basis. When we report disc ops will be a function of when we make the decision on spin versus flip. So, if we end up doing a split, you have to do disc ops earlier. If you end up doing a spin, you do disc ops as of the separation date.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from PJ Juvekar from Citi. Please go ahead.\nPJ Juvekar: Yes. Hi, good morning, Ed and Lori.\nEd Breen: Hi, PJ.\nLori Koch: Good morning.\nPJ Juvekar: There is a big green movement happening in Europe, parts of Asia, California, with both EVs and hydrogen. How is DuPont position for that trend in terms of your portfolio? And particularly, can you address the EV market?\nLori Koch: Yes, so this will obviously mostly be within T&I. There\u2019s also a play within S&C and E&I as well into the electric vehicle space. So we are very well positioned of obviously as the conversion continues for its hybrid and electric, you need a lighter car. So that advantages our T&I portfolios, we take out metal and replace it with polymer. Within S&C, we have a nice opportunity within the battery play. We have use of our Nomex paper as a separator, and then obviously within E&I as the enhanced electronics, electric vehicles really nicely positioned there. And so it\u2019s obviously full electric vehicles or a small such section of the total auto belt production today, but growing very quickly and we\u2019re \u2013 I am happy with the portfolio that we have.\nPJ Juvekar: Great. Thank you. And I just have a follow-up on E&I. Intel has had some well-publicized issues at seven nanometer nodes and companies like TSMC are gaining share. Can you talk about your position relative to your customers and what kind of wins or losses have you had at seven nanometers? Thank you.\nLori Koch: Yes, so I don\u2019t want to really speak to a customer level, but you can see by our results within the semi space that we\u2019re seeing really nice performance. So in this last quarter alone, we were up 8%, 9%. So we\u2019ve got a nice dispersion. We play with all of the big players. So as the consolidation continues, we\u2019re still continued to be well positioned in this space. Also as the layers as you had mentioned, get more and more complex that advantages our portfolio. So the more layers, the more steps, the more polishing that has to be done, the more cleaning that has to be done, the more complex, the layers get with advanced nodes that advantages our portfolio within as well. So I think we\u2019re nicely positioned to take advantage of growth there.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nChris Parkinson: Great. Thank you very much. You\u2019ve done impressive job on the cash conversion front. I think, we\u2019re all aware of the [indiscernible] versus targets over time, which you had mentioned in the past. But do you have any brief updates on this front, just given some of the portfolio changes as well as the ongoing incremental efforts on working capital? Thank you.\nLori Koch: Yes. So I think you\u2019re asking about our free cash flow conversion. You cut out a little bit, so I couldn\u2019t quite hear it. Yes, so we\u2019ve made some really nice progress there. So we\u2019re up to about 140% year-to-date. We were actually butting up against 200% in the quarter really enabled by that strong, greater than $300 million working capital productivity. So we\u2019ll look to keep that free cash flow conversion number greater than 90%. We\u2019ve been right around a 100% for the past several years. So I don\u2019t see any material headwinds there and there\u2019s no real change in that metric as the portfolio changes. So each business was generating nice free cash flow conversion. From an ROIC perspective, the goal that we\u2019ve had is to deliver a hundred basis points of improvement annually. So we\u2019ll look to get that out as well that. One important piece of that is once the separation happened mid last year, we started to put ROIC into our comp metrics in a lot of the executive pay metrics. There\u2019s a piece of ROIC. So obviously that would drive continued focus along with system management deep dive within that space.\nChris Parkinson: That\u2019s helpful. And just a quick follow-up, you\u2019ve also been doing a pretty solid job on the cost front, including the recent increase and also the percent that will be structural, which you had done a little while ago. How should we be thinking about the further cadence as we enter 2021? And are there any considerations for base cost inflation if we\u2019re just trying to kind of figure out the net benefits on a per annum basis? Thank you.\nLori Koch: Yes. So, we\u2019ll have another $120 million roughly on a run rate basis of savings into 2021. There will be offset. So as we had mentioned, so, we are right now planning for a merit increase. We didn\u2019t have one in 2020, so we\u2019ll love to get back on track with that in 2021. We also they\u2019ll plan for a full bonus payout in 2021. So that\u2019ll be a headwind for 2020 where we won\u2019t pay a full bonus. And TNE is another piece that we will control the snapback. So we\u2019ve seen TNE vomit-down to about $1 million a month. We used to be upwards of 10 or so million a month. So we\u2019ll see some snack back there, but we\u2019re looking to try to mitigate that pretty significant, really heading more so down on the internal travel versus the customer facing travel. So I think net-net with $120 million benefits that we\u2019ll see in the offset that we had just covered. We\u2019ll probably have a slight headwind from a cost perspective heading into 2021, probably nothing like some of maybe the others in the space, just driven by our dedication to getting structural costs out versus the temporary that maybe some others have been doing.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nArun Viswanathan: Thanks. Good morning.\nEd Breen: Good morning.\nArun Viswanathan: Yes. My first question is on SEC, you\u2019ve directed some more of your capacity towards garments. Could you just talk about the trade-off there? My understanding is that those are higher margin, but maybe precludes you from participating as much in residential? And then as well, maybe you can just address the commercial markets and what you\u2019re seeing there in construction? Thanks.\nLori Koch: Yes. So I think within Tyvek, overall the entire Tyvek enterprise in the quarter was up in the low-20s. And so obviously we continue to see nice strength within PPE; that was up 50% plus. Within the Tyvek building on gloat space, just given the seasonality within when the construction really takes place. We did see nice growth there. So we saw about 20% growth in residential Tyvek. Where the volume was taken from, was more in the medical packaging space and that\u2019s really just a function of the reduction in intellective procedures dampening the demand there. But overall 20% plus, we have been able to enable additional production that come out. We sequentially we were down a bit as we had to take the asset down for about two weeks or so, but year-over-year we are having more product coming off the lines.\nEd Breen: When we\u2019re actually bringing up what we call line one and older line that we had that it\u2019s not costing us too much to get that up and running. So we\u2019re bringing that up for incremental volumes so that\u2019s something else.\nArun Viswanathan: Thanks. And then as a follow-up; can you also just talk about your plans for the proceeds? I know that from the N&B separation, I know that you\u2019ve talked about buybacks for $2.3 billion of it and deleveraging to the rest. Is that still your current thinking or how are you thinking about deploying that capital? Thanks.\nEd Breen: Yes. $5 billion of that money from IFF N&B will be used to deliver and pay down debt. So we\u2019ll be in a great shape balance sheet wise when that occurs. And then I would think as I mentioned, I don\u2019t want to get into exact numbers, but I would think we\u2019re doing share repurchase with where our multiples at, as we get into next year and we still want to gauge the effect of COVID in cases picking-up and all that. But that would probably be our leaning along with some bolt on M&A.\nLori Koch: Yes. If I could just add on to the debt conversation. So we really did a nice job, I want to highlight in a quarter of reducing commercial paper. And so we were able to use the proceeds from the Hemlock and TCS transaction, as well as organic cash flow generation to take that down to just under $400 million for the quarter, we\u2019ve taken it down even since the quarter close and we\u2019ll continue to do that. So that\u2019ll be a nice tailwind heading into 2021, not only from a interest expense perspective, but just giving us flexibility to use those $2.3 billion of proceeds for either M&A or shareholder remuneration.\nEd Breen: Yes, our goal is to get the CP down to zero very quickly.\nOperator: And we will take our final question from Frank Mitch with Fermium Research. Please go ahead.\nFrank Mitch: Thank you so much, and nice quarter. I just wanted to follow-up on IFF since part of the DuPont value proposition is tied up in IFF share price, and obviously we\u2019ve seen a 20% decline over the past month. Ed, in your discussions with management there \u2013 what\u2019s your confidence level that, that can turn around, any thoughts that you can share there?\nEd Breen: Yes, Frank, I don\u2019t want to get into too much detail, but I think there is some technicals going on right now with that. I\u2019ve seen some reports, I think one of the analysts on this call wrote a nice report the other day. So I think there is some things going on short-term maybe overspend split that created some pressure. But look, these sets of businesses, the IFF sets of businesses, the N&B, they do very well when there is distress in the system because of the end markets that we\u2019re in. So these are consistent performers. There\u2019ll be pockets of weakness like we saw because, nobody\u2019s in airports buying chewing gum and all that, but generally speaking, they\u2019re going to do very well through this. And we got a lot of synergies coming up here to create additional value for shareholders. So \u2013 but my gut is all that settles down here rather quickly as we get closer and closer to getting the deal done.\nFrank Mitch: Terrific, very helpful. And just a question on the guidance for the fourth quarter, obviously yesterday we saw France and Germany implement lockdowns. How do \u2013 how should we think about the \u201cwave 2\u201d lock downs being embedded into that guidance? How much of that was factored in, any thoughts there?\nEd Breen: Well, we knew Germany was talking about lockdowns when we just gave the guidance. So it looks like France might be going now, but I think, look, if all of Europe lock down and there were lockdowns in the U.S. that\u2019s going to affect everybody out there. So no, we\u2019re not counting on that and the guidance that we gave. We see pretty far into the quarter now, but if there was massive lockdowns that would probably affect December tight numbers and we just have to see, but as we sit today and as long as there is not massive lockdowns, that\u2019s the way we gave the guidance.\nLeland Weaver: Thank you everyone for joining our call. For your reference, a copy of our transcript will be posted on DuPont\u2019s website. This concludes our call.\nOperator: And this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Lori Koch",
            "content": "Thanks Ed. And good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 4 and the financial highlights for the quarter, net sales for the quarter were $5.1 billion, down 6% organically and as reported. Portfolio was neutral as acquisitions in Water Solutions, offset divestitures in E&I and non-core. Likewise, currency was neutral in the quarter. Pricing was mixed across the portfolio with gains in S&C and non-core offset by price declines primarily in T&I. Price declines in T&I were down mid-single digits were in line with expectations. We expect similar T&I pricing through the fourth quarter as nylon 66 prices had generally stabilized in the back half of the year. On a regional basis, organic sales increased 3% in Asia-Pacific versus a year ago period, with declines in the other regions. China sales in our core segments improved 14% versus the third quarter of 2019 and 10% sequentially from second quarter 2020. I'll provide additional color on our segment top line results on the next slide. We delivered operating EBITDA of $1.3 billion and adjusted EPS of $0.88 per share, well above expectations driven by better than expected top-line results in our E&I and T&I segments and more favorable product mix with continued strength in semiconductors, Tyvek protective garments and probiotics. Once again, our teams maintained strong cost control to deliver operating EBITDA decline in line with the sales decline on a percentage basis. Our decremental margin was approximately 31%, also ahead of our expectations heading into the quarter. Excluding approximately $60 million of costs associated with temporarily idling facilities, primarily in T&I and S&C as well as gains in both the current and prior year periods, our decremental margins were in the mid single-digits. A significant improvement from the second quarter, driven by the improving top line and continued structural cost takeout. As Ed mentioned, we are also delivering on our cash targets, free cash flow of approximately $1.9 billion through the first nine months of the year, led to a conversion rate of approximately 140%. In addition to the strong free cash flow, Ed mentioned the process we have made on the non-core divestitures, which enabled the reduction of commercial paper balances in the quarter. These actions have lowered our net debt position and improved our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to below three times. Slide 5 provides more detail on the year-over-year change in net sale, consistent strength across semiconductors, probiotics, home and personal care, Tyvek protective garments and water solution, coupled with improvement in automotive and residential construction markets led to an overall organic sales decline of 6%, which reflect steady growth of the second quarter growth. Several of our businesses have market-leading products, which enabled them to succeed despite global challenges presented by the pandemic. Within electronics and imaging, semiconductor technologies delivered its third consecutive quarter of organic growth. Likewise, with Nutrition & Biosciences, our probiotics and home and personal care offerings continue to capitalize on robust global demand, each with double-digit growth in the quarter. Finally, within Safety & Construction, the Tyvek protective garment business is providing critical PPE to our medical communities and front-line workers. And the water business continues to provide market-leading innovation demanded by our customers. In the third quarter, sales in the water business are up low single-digits on an organic basis and up mid-teens percent as reported due to the acquisitions we have made in the space. We also saw market improvement in other key markets in the third quarter, most notably automotive and residential construction, which contributes to the sequential improvement in the top line. We estimate that global auto builds were down about 4% in the third quarter versus the same period last year, a substantial improvement from the historical lows in the second quarter and stronger than we anticipated. And down 9% for the quarter, our T&I volume performance is consistent with the improvement in market demand and the lag we expect due to the majority of our automotive sales going into the Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers. There were also green shoots in residential construction, a market that represents approximately 40% of the shelter business within S&C. Our solutions to the residential construction market include Tyvek Building, Wrap, Styrofoam Insulation and GREAT STUFF Insulating Foam, which has also experienced strong retail demand from an increase in do-it-yourself projects. Despite tailwinds in residential construction, our shelter business was down versus last year due to ongoing softness and commercial construction, which makes up the remaining 60% of the shelter business. Also contributing to the improvement in top line was demand for our materials that enable smartphone technology. Increasing material content, which now accounts for up to $4 a phone in the top-end model, overcame an overall declining smartphone market and drove high single-digit growth in our interconnect solutions business as premium phone manufacturers prepared for model launches and holiday demands. Overall, top line performance continues to be impacted by significant weakness in oil and gas, aerospace, commercial construction, and select industrial markets. These market dynamics are most prevalent in the safety and shelter businesses within S&C to health and biosciences business within N&B and across the non-core segment. Before moving to the next slide, let me comment on our year-to-date performance. I am pleased that our teams focus on execution and operational excellence. Two areas that Ed and I have been focused on since day one. Through the first nine months, our sales have declined 6% on an organic basis. And our focus on streamlining our overhead structure has enabled us to better maintain our earnings. Over the same time period, our EBITDA margin has declined just 7% excluding costs associated with temporary idling facilities in the second and third quarters. Choosing to run these sites for cash was the right decision for the strength of the company and it is showing in the strength of our balance sheet and cash flow. Turning to the adjusted EPS bridge on Slide 6. Adjusted EPS of $0.88 is down 8% versus the same quarter last year, driven by lower volume, cost associated with idling facilities and the impacts of non-core divestitures. These headwinds are partially offset by the delivery of cost savings. As I mentioned, our cost actions from the 2019 restructuring program, coupled with the incremental action we are driving in 2020, contributed to approximately $150 million of savings in the quarter. The impact of portfolio actions is a net headwind, primarily due to the absence of the gain on sale of the DuPont Sustainable Solutions business in the third quarter of 2019. We realized three-center benefits from below the line items, primarily a lower share count due to share repurchases we executed in the second half of 2019 and early 2020, and lower interest rates enabled by reduction in commercial paper balances. These benefits were offset by a slightly higher base tax rate of 21%. In summary, I would emphasize again, what Ed said at the start of the call, our team is laser-focused on execution, and we are now consistently delivering on our earnings, cash flow and cost saving commitments. Through a period of significant uncertainty, we continue to progress our strategic priorities, which positions us well as we look ahead to 2021 to continue creating value for our shareholders. As we show on Slide 7, we will continue to strengthen our balance sheet with the anticipated closing of N&B and IFF deal in the first quarter of next year, as well as the closing of the biomaterials deal in the first half of 2021. Tyvek's strength alone will generate over $7.5 billion of cash proceeds, nearly $2.5 billion of which we will have available after planned debt repayment fees for creating shareholder value. Additionally, we expect our strong free cash flow generation to continue into 2021. As we said earlier, we have significantly improved our net debt position with the reduction of commercial paper balances and we do not have any debt repayments until the fourth quarter of 2023. Beyond those we intend to satisfy with the proceeds from the N&B and IFF deal. I'm excited for what's ahead. And I commend our team for staying focused on execution to put us in a position to have the flexibility to capitalize on the opportunities for growth and shareholder value creation going forward. With that, let me turn it back to Ed for an update on the N&B and IFF transaction and some final comments on what we expect in the fourth quarter. Yes. So let me go first to the sequential. So there's no real change in market dynamics as we see it right now. So there's actually continued sequential lists in T&I kind of in the mid-single digit space. The drops sequentially in revenue and EBITDA, it's more driven by seasonality and it's normal seasonality that we see in our businesses. So primarily it fits within smartphones. So as we get ready in the third quarter for the holiday demand coming up, we had a live sales in 3Q that would not be there in 4Q due to normal seasonality. Additionally, within our construction space, third quarter tends to be high just with the summer months driving a lot of the construction. So you'll see little bit of deceleration there from a seasonal perspective. So the decline that you're kind of getting at is roughly in the $100 million space sequentially 3Q to 4Q about a third of that is related to the seasonal decline that we just discussed. Another third of it is we did have a gain on a technology sale and E&I in 3Q that won't be there in 4Q and the rest of the largest primary piece is the sale of the Hemlock TCS assets that were sold in September. So within T&I, we don't really see any level of channel level \u2013 high inventory levels in the channel. So if you see where we look year-to-date, our volumes are down about 15% in T&I versus the auto bills are down about 23%. So I think we're outperforming there. There's really if you look at where we fell into as we mentioned on the call, we fell into the Tier 1 and Tier 2 players primarily. So it doesn't always exactly line up with the auto bills number. You kind of got to look at it year-to-date to understand the lag. So we're comfortable where we sit going and their material changes from a market perspective as we see it right now. Hey, Scott. Yes, so we see the T&I portfolio around the mid-20s from an EBITDA margin perspective in our market. So we've got some sequential upside as we head into next year, really driven by the items that you had mentioned. So a top line recovery as well as having a lot of the idle facilities behind us. Yes. So I think the savings that will trickle into 2021 is around $120 million. So we're targeting now $280 million of in period savings, so on a run rate basis, that's about $400 million as we exited, so another $120 million next year. There are just some headwinds that we'll face next year as well. Obviously, there'll be some snap back into temporary savings, but we really biased our actions towards the structural. So we don't have a material headwind, but there will be some, opening up of the economy that was in itself to some T&E and some other stuff that we've really seen clamped down this year. Right now as I had mentioned, I don't see additional structural cost takeout. Really the opportunity for us is within gross margin and driving more productivity and gross margin. And second to that, continuing to drive our productivity and working capital. So we've made a lot of nice progress this year. We're up about from a working capital trade perspective, only about $250 million year-to-date that we've nicely dug ourselves out of the hole that we got in earlier in the year. And we're still targeting more than $500 million of working capital savings this year, but we still have a ways to already get to best-in-class there. Yes, we do. We do see a more constructive price environment. So I think the majority of the Nylon 66 headwinds that we've seen are behind us. So we did see year-over-year headwinds in the third quarter and we'll expect year-over-year headwinds again in the fourth quarter, but those are really just a function of the price decline from the prior year, where they were still quite strong, so sequentially looking at about flat pricing. As we look into 2021, obviously, we've done a nice job of taking advantage where we can have of constrained environments and we'll be able to keep our eye on that to be able to see any games that we could possibly pick up there. I think also within T&I just overall, once the market normalizes and stabilizes, we do expect to get back to that 1.5 times auto builds outperformance within that portfolio. You can't see it year-to-date. So as I had mentioned earlier, our T&I volumes being down about 15% year-to-date versus auto bills being down 23% year-to-date. So you can see that outperformance and the look to continue that going forward once the market fully recovered. Yes. So that was really a function of really clamping down on third-party spends, consultants and the like. and then we were able to accelerate a bit, some of the offers that we had planned that benefit is benefiting the inferior savings for this year. Yes. So, we've always thought that the N&B portfolio to get closer to the company average from a margin perspective, they're looking at 26% or 27%. So, they've got continued upside. A lot of that's really going to come from just a higher favourable mix. So, as they grow probiotics, as they grow their enzyme portfolio, as they grow their meatless meat market, those are all very high margin product lines that will lift the overall margin of the segment. Yes. So, a big piece of the decline was driven by sales into the food service fees, which makes us about 5% of total N&B. It would be bigger obviously within food and beverage segment that was down kind of in the mid-teens. And so that's really selling into sports arenas, cafeterias. So really, the industries that have been hit hard by COVID, so nothing underlying there beyond that. And a lot of that was in Europe. So, I think Europe was one of the markets that were hit hardest within the N&B portfolio and it's really back to that the food services play. Also, another impact that we saw a headwind was just as travel has clamped down, we had the large market into like the chewing gum and mint stays within our sweeteners portfolio. So, as there's less travel, less people going through airports that impacted the business. Yes. So, I would look at most likely to be after the February spin dates. So, we can report kind of on remain co basis. When we report disc ops will be a function of when we make the decision on spin versus flip. So, if we end up doing a split, you have to do disc ops earlier. If you end up doing a spin, you do disc ops as of the separation date. Good morning. Yes, so this will obviously mostly be within T&I. There's also a play within S&C and E&I as well into the electric vehicle space. So we are very well positioned of obviously as the conversion continues for its hybrid and electric, you need a lighter car. So that advantages our T&I portfolios, we take out metal and replace it with polymer. Within S&C, we have a nice opportunity within the battery play. We have use of our Nomex paper as a separator, and then obviously within E&I as the enhanced electronics, electric vehicles really nicely positioned there. And so it's obviously full electric vehicles or a small such section of the total auto belt production today, but growing very quickly and we're \u2013 I am happy with the portfolio that we have. Yes, so I don't want to really speak to a customer level, but you can see by our results within the semi space that we're seeing really nice performance. So in this last quarter alone, we were up 8%, 9%. So we've got a nice dispersion. We play with all of the big players. So as the consolidation continues, we're still continued to be well positioned in this space. Also as the layers as you had mentioned, get more and more complex that advantages our portfolio. So the more layers, the more steps, the more polishing that has to be done, the more cleaning that has to be done, the more complex, the layers get with advanced nodes that advantages our portfolio within as well. So I think we're nicely positioned to take advantage of growth there. Yes. So I think you're asking about our free cash flow conversion. You cut out a little bit, so I couldn't quite hear it. Yes, so we've made some really nice progress there. So we're up to about 140% year-to-date. We were actually butting up against 200% in the quarter really enabled by that strong, greater than $300 million working capital productivity. So we'll look to keep that free cash flow conversion number greater than 90%. We've been right around a 100% for the past several years. So I don't see any material headwinds there and there's no real change in that metric as the portfolio changes. So each business was generating nice free cash flow conversion. From an ROIC perspective, the goal that we've had is to deliver a hundred basis points of improvement annually. So we'll look to get that out as well that. One important piece of that is once the separation happened mid last year, we started to put ROIC into our comp metrics in a lot of the executive pay metrics. There's a piece of ROIC. So obviously that would drive continued focus along with system management deep dive within that space. Yes. So, we'll have another $120 million roughly on a run rate basis of savings into 2021. There will be offset. So as we had mentioned, so, we are right now planning for a merit increase. We didn't have one in 2020, so we'll love to get back on track with that in 2021. We also they'll plan for a full bonus payout in 2021. So that'll be a headwind for 2020 where we won't pay a full bonus. And TNE is another piece that we will control the snapback. So we've seen TNE vomit-down to about $1 million a month. We used to be upwards of 10 or so million a month. So we'll see some snack back there, but we're looking to try to mitigate that pretty significant, really heading more so down on the internal travel versus the customer facing travel. So I think net-net with $120 million benefits that we'll see in the offset that we had just covered. We'll probably have a slight headwind from a cost perspective heading into 2021, probably nothing like some of maybe the others in the space, just driven by our dedication to getting structural costs out versus the temporary that maybe some others have been doing. Yes. So I think within Tyvek, overall the entire Tyvek enterprise in the quarter was up in the low-20s. And so obviously we continue to see nice strength within PPE; that was up 50% plus. Within the Tyvek building on gloat space, just given the seasonality within when the construction really takes place. We did see nice growth there. So we saw about 20% growth in residential Tyvek. Where the volume was taken from, was more in the medical packaging space and that's really just a function of the reduction in intellective procedures dampening the demand there. But overall 20% plus, we have been able to enable additional production that come out. We sequentially we were down a bit as we had to take the asset down for about two weeks or so, but year-over-year we are having more product coming off the lines. Yes. If I could just add on to the debt conversation. So we really did a nice job, I want to highlight in a quarter of reducing commercial paper. And so we were able to use the proceeds from the Hemlock and TCS transaction, as well as organic cash flow generation to take that down to just under $400 million for the quarter, we've taken it down even since the quarter close and we'll continue to do that. So that'll be a nice tailwind heading into 2021, not only from a interest expense perspective, but just giving us flexibility to use those $2.3 billion of proceeds for either M&A or shareholder remuneration."

            "name": "Ed Breen",
            "content": "Thanks, Leland, and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. I'd like to begin by recognizing the tremendous efforts of our employees across the world to deliver another solid quarter in the face of this global pandemic. Lori will cover the specifics of the quarter shortly, but I'd like to take a few minutes to highlight our performance in a few key areas. The timely actions that we took earlier this year to protect our employees, ensure the safe operation of our sites, strengthen our financial position and do our part to combat the pandemic enabled us to deliver strong results this quarter. My senior leadership team and I closely monitor developments globally to ensure we are taking the right precautionary measures to continue protecting our employees, their safety and well-being remains our top priority. Our intense focus on safety has enabled all 170 of our global manufacturing sites to continue operating according to plan. This in turn has given us the ability to deliver for customers during a period of continued uncertainty. Additionally, our balance sheet remains strong. In fact, so far this year, we reduced our commercial paper balanced by approximately $1.4 billion to end the quarter with less than $400 million in CP, which was enabled by strong free cash flow and proceeds from the TCS and Hemlock divestitures we announced in September. Since the end of the quarter, we have further reduced our commercial paper balances and we look to make additional progress through year end. We also remain committed to doing our part to help during these unprecedented times. We continued to enable production of approximately 30 million Tyvek protective garments per month in an effort to provide healthcare and frontline workers with the protection they need to battle this global pandemic. I'll cover more details regarding operational excellence on the next slide, but let me just say that I am encouraged by the progress we are making here. We continue to remove structural G&A cost and execute on our working capital improvements, which helps to drive our strong free cash flow and operating earnings improvements. We have moved faster and found additional pockets of G&A costs to streamline, enabling us to increase our expected cost savings from our 2020 initiatives from $180 million to $280 million. I am also pleased with the progress that we have made in advancing the N&B and IFF transaction, as well as the divestitures of non-core assets. In August IFF shareholders voted overwhelmingly in favor of the transaction and we remain on track for first quarter 2021 closed and we are targeting February 1st. With regards to non-core in September we announced the divestiture of the TCS business along with our equity interest in the Hemlock semiconductor joint venture for $725 million. Earlier this month, we also signed a deal to sell the biomaterials business for $240 million. These portfolio refinement efforts contribute to value creation by increasing cash flow, strengthening the balance sheet and focusing our portfolio in markets where we expect to see solid growth opportunity. Moving to Slide 3, I like to provide more specifics on the progress we've made, improving our cash generation and G&A productivity. Free cash flow conversion on a year-to-date basis was 140%. Through September, we've delivered approximately $1.9 billion of free cash flow versus $1.6 billion for all of 2019. This growth is primarily attributable to actions we have taken to reduce our capital expenditures and improve working capital. During the quarter, we significantly reduced inventory balances and the team is focused on reducing past due accounts receivable, also yielded positive results as we reduced our past due balances as a percentage of accounts receivable to 4%. We've also lowered planned capital spending for 2022, to approximately $1.0 billion, nearly $500 million less than 2019 levels. As a reminder, we did not reduce any safety related CapEx and have developed detailed plans for restarting our growth projects to ensure we are able to capture demand when markets fully recover.  We delivered more than 185 basis point reduction in non-manufacturing costs as a percentage of sales in the quarter, mostly in G&A. Of the approximately $150 million of cost savings that we realized, $100 million was structural in nature. As I mentioned, we now expect our 2020 in period savings from current year actions to be $280 million, versus our prior estimate of $180 million. Our cost actions are targeted towards G&A expenses and are aimed at enabling a highly productive, appropriately scaled, cost structure. Growth through innovation remains a key component of our strategy. And we continue to invest in critical areas like sales, application development, and R&D so that we will be well positioned to capture growth when we fully emerge from the current market environment. Before turning it over to Lori, I just like to make a few comments on some of the sequential trends that we saw in the third quarter. We saw a 15% increase in operating EBITDA, as well as 200 basis point improvement in operating EBITDA margin versus the second quarter. This rebound was most significant within T&I, as global auto builds were up more than 60% sequentially, stronger than our expectations going into the quarter. Additionally, our third quarter decremental margins was approximately 31%, an improvement of approximately 1,400 basis points versus second quarter, led by strengthening topline and continued structural cost removal across the company. I'll now turn it over to Lori to walk through some of the details for the quarter. Thanks, Lori. And now turning to Slide 8, we highlight the progress we've made since announcing the N&B and IFF transaction. During the quarter, we completed two additional milestones. In August, IFF shareholders voted overwhelmingly in favor of the transaction with more than 99% of the votes cast in favor of the deal. Then in September, N&B issued $6.25 billion of senior unsecured notes in a private placement. The net proceeds from the offering are intended to fund part of N&B special cash payment of $7.3 billion to DuPont. The net proceeds are held in escrow until the deal closes. The offering was more than 5 times oversubscribed and resulted in a very favorable cost of borrowing for these notes. We continue to make progress regarding regulatory approval. And additionally, our integration planning remains on track as the team's work to a first quarter 2021 closing. I remain excited about this combination and confident that the new company will be well positioned for growth and to deliver sustainable value for shareholders. Let me close with our financial outlook on Slide 9, which we have prepared assuming no substantial change in the slope of the recovery due to the pandemic. Obviously, this is a fluid situation with increasing cases and we are monitoring this closely. We expect to deliver net sales for the year in the range of $20.1 billion to $20.2 billion, and adjusted EPS in the range of $3.17 to $3.21. Sequentially from the third quarter, normal seasonal declines in E&I from smartphone production cycles, and S&C from the timing of North America construction activity will be partially offset by improvement in T&I as auto demand continues to recover, although at a much more gradual pace as compared to the prior quarter. Our forecasted earnings also reflects the absence of a $30 million technology sale in E&I and the loss of earnings from Hemlock and TCS, which were divested in September. We will stay focused on driving improvements in working capital and delivering our cost savings commitments. With that, let me turn it back to Leland to open the Q&A. Hey, good morning, Steve. Yes, Steve. We will be making that decision by mid-December. And we truly have not made a decision yet. I wouldn't put a leaning one way or the other on it. We took some language change, because we wouldn't do a hybrid type approach. We'll pick one or the other, and that was the change in language. But no decision at this point in time. I wouldn't read anything into it. Hey, Scott. Yes. Scott, I mean, I'd put it more in the category of chipping away at it, as we streamline some of our functions and capabilities we can get do a little more streamlining on our overhead. We're putting in some digital tools and we're going to do a central finance tool and things like that really help us out. So I think we're getting the best in class on our G&A, when you look at peer companies and all, I think we're doing a heck of a job there. I would highlight one area, we're not touching or taking down at all as we said in our prepared remarks is clearly our salespeople around the world, our application engineering teams around the world and we're going to continue to spend at the level we've been spending out on the R&D front. So we want to come out of the softness in this pandemic period, real strong with lots of new product introductions coming. So it's really going to continue to stay focused on the G&A piece of it. And then I would really say that the next big focus and we're focused on it now, but we're really doubling down is going to be on the gross margin line and our factory efficiency are up times. And again, we're doing a fair amount of digital tools, they're not overly expensive to really look into predictive analytics at our facilities with a lot of AI capability. And we really think we can do some fair amount of improvements there and hopefully help the gross margin line. So that's where you'll see some of the \u2013 kind of the effort is we're going into 2021. Our inventories have a ways to go still now by as a sales pickup, that'll new as a little bit here on progress. But that we're expecting nice progress again in the fourth quarter. We still have over a $500 million opportunity on inventory to get to where we think we can get to. So that's kind of our bogey out there. And again, we'll make good progress in the fourth quarter. As far as inventory in the channel, obviously, Scott, I actually feel very good about it right now, as you know, the auto industry doesn't have a lot of finished goods. There's not any stuffing in the channel going on. And I really don't see it anywhere, except maybe just a little bit in the electronics space. I think there may potentially, and I've heard some of our competitors talk about maybe a little pre-buying from some of the Chinese players, nervous about what's going on geopolitically right now. But I don't even think that was a big number. And in the scheme of all of our sales in electronics not significant, but that'd be maybe the one area where there's a little bit of that. Good morning, Bob. Yes. Well, first of all, the arbitration is started up with Chemours on MAC. And there probably won't be any decision on that until kind of mid next year, if you look at the timeline on it. But we continue to talk to each other about the settlement, in fact, Mark Vergnano, the CEO of Chemours and I actually just talked this Monday. A couple of open points, we continue to get closer and then we'll see if we can get it to the finish line. So that's paralleling along while the arbitration starts. Yes. So John, we're very interested if we can and expanding the water business. So that would be one area. I don't want to comment on details, because you get pretty specific and there's not that many targets out there. So I won't get into that, but the water business would be one. There's some areas in the electronics business, I will mention that one, 5G type stuff, we would be interested in. And but let me just say overall, we're really looking at things I would put in the category of bolt-on acquisitions nothing on a bigger scale in 2021. But it could be several of bolt-ons during the year. They make financial sense. Yes. Jeff, I'll just comment on kind of October, because I know that demand feels pretty good still on the semi side. So we're not really seeing any change from what we've been seeing in the last few quarters. So at least so far going into the fourth quarter, that feels nice. And again, I just think the dynamics of work-at-home and what everyone's doing with data centers and nodes and all that, looks like potentially good momentum going into next year. But we'll see when we get closer to the end of year. I know one of our key competitors a very, very good company and CEO's a good friend of mine. He talked very bullishly about demand going into 2021 also. So that feels good. And again, the only thing at electronics and you just mentioned that it was a little bit of the seasonality on a smartphone because we had such strong shipments in the third quarter for the shipments and launches of the new phones in the fourth quarter. But we feel good about the portfolio, we have on the 5G side, as more phones are enabled 5G going into 2021. It's nice upside opportunity for us. Well, no change in any of the end market demand that we've talked about due to the rising cases \u2013 probably, I say so far. It's all the same ones. I mean, obviously auto coming back really strong, residential construction, we're now seeing those green shoots coming back, not surprising with what's going on in the resi market. And all the areas that are down kind of significantly oil and gas, aerospace commercial construction, they've all come up a little bit, but not significantly. So they're not dropping anymore, they're picking up slightly, but they're still are negative numbers. So we haven't seen any change in October in patterns that we weren't expecting. Yes. No, John it's very much running the business. I keep telling the team all hands on deck here. We want to string together a lot of consistent results. We've been doing that. We've got a ways to go here. Some things still to get to best-in-class performance on like working capital. So, it's more of that and it's more looking at bolt-ons next year. And I would think as we get into next year, we'll be having a serious conversation with the Board about the share repurchase, where we're trading at, there were new DuPont will be trading as N&B goes out of the portfolio. So that's the mode we're in. Steve, I didn't read anything into it. We're going to supply all the information and answer all the questions, all that data's obviously available and it's been supplied to many federal agencies already. So, I don't \u2013 it's just information we've given before. So, we'll answer it in a timely manner. But I \u2013 maybe, I would go to a little bit broader to your question there. This ETA puts some regulation in place. We're always asked that and that might be part of the push here. And we are actually for that, we said that in front of Congress when we testify, but not everyone in the industry is for that, but we think it would be great to have a national standard set on where those levels should be at, instead of it being a patchwork by state and maybe by municipality. who knows? And we actually think that would be very helpful that we're all targeting the same thing as we do remediation and all that. So that's where we see a lot of the push at the federal level and world for that happening. No. No. I just think having a standard set out there that we're all marching to would be very helpful instead of having literally 50 different standards being set. And by the way, just to make a point, I make every one of these calls, there's many more locations that had PFAS, but remember how high percentage of this is firefighting foam. And I think you'll, DuPont will \u2013 we'll let that play out here in the South Carolina consolidation here, and potentially, we'll settle it or we'll let it go through the core system, but we never made the firefighting foam. So, our work is really remediation in some of our sites, where we did some a manufacturing, which is a handful. Yes. David, I said a few minutes ago, we're operationally going to run new DuPont the way we are. I got it. We want to clean up the non-core some more. So, we're very focused on that also from a portfolio standpoint. We'll be in an interesting position going into next year with the cash we're receiving from the IFF transaction. As Lori mentioned, we'll have at least $2.5 billion to $3 billion of excess cash available. So, as I said, we'll be talking to the board about how we're going to deploy that to create shareholder value in 2021. And I would expect a few baby bolt-on acquisitions would fit in there next year if they make financial sense for us to do. Well, I won't talk about if there's upside, I should probably leave that to the IFF team when they do their earnings that would not be fair to believe. But I feel good about it. We've got multiple teams as we did when we did DowDuPont, all that working on all the integration efforts. We're right on track. by the way, I must say I'm surprised we're doing as well as we are considering everyone's working at home, but every one of the work streams is right on track. Lori and I review it literally weekly with the IFF team. So, we're ready to go on the synergy work that we've outlined publicly and we'll get off to a very quick start. Hi, PJ. Good morning. When we're actually bringing up what we call line one and older line that we had that it's not costing us too much to get that up and running. So we're bringing that up for incremental volumes so that's something else. Yes. $5 billion of that money from IFF N&B will be used to deliver and pay down debt. So we'll be in a great shape balance sheet wise when that occurs. And then I would think as I mentioned, I don't want to get into exact numbers, but I would think we're doing share repurchase with where our multiples at, as we get into next year and we still want to gauge the effect of COVID in cases picking-up and all that. But that would probably be our leaning along with some bolt on M&A. Yes, our goal is to get the CP down to zero very quickly. Yes, Frank, I don't want to get into too much detail, but I think there is some technicals going on right now with that. I've seen some reports, I think one of the analysts on this call wrote a nice report the other day. So I think there is some things going on short-term maybe overspend split that created some pressure. But look, these sets of businesses, the IFF sets of businesses, the N&B, they do very well when there is distress in the system because of the end markets that we're in. So these are consistent performers. There'll be pockets of weakness like we saw because, nobody's in airports buying chewing gum and all that, but generally speaking, they're going to do very well through this. And we got a lot of synergies coming up here to create additional value for shareholders. So \u2013 but my gut is all that settles down here rather quickly as we get closer and closer to getting the deal done. Well, we knew Germany was talking about lockdowns when we just gave the guidance. So it looks like France might be going now, but I think, look, if all of Europe lock down and there were lockdowns in the U.S. that's going to affect everybody out there. So no, we're not counting on that and the guidance that we gave. We see pretty far into the quarter now, but if there was massive lockdowns that would probably affect December tight numbers and we just have to see, but as we sit today and as long as there is not massive lockdowns, that's the way we gave the guidance."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the DuPont Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Leland Weaver. Please go ahead.\nLeland Weaver: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for DuPont's second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. We are making this call available to investors and media via webcast. We have prepared slides to supplement our comments during this conference call, slides are posted on the Investor Relations section of DuPont's website and through the link to our webcast. Joining me on the call today are Ed Breen, Chief Executive Officer; and Lori Koch, our Chief Financial Officer. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the slide. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Our 2019 Form 10-K as updated by our current and periodic reports includes detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties, which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today exclude significant items. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP financial measure is included in our press release. I'll now turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Breen: Thanks, Leland, and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. I hope you and your loved ones are safe and well. Last quarter, I laid out our priorities for operating in this unprecedented environment. I am pleased to say that the quick actions that we took to protect our employees ensure the safe operations of our sites, strengthen the financial position of the company and do our part to combat this pandemic are working. Additionally, I'd like to acknowledge the tremendous efforts of all of our employees to deliver solid results this quarter in the face of this global pandemic. Lori will cover the specifics of the quarter, but first I'd like to discuss our performance versus our priorities in the current environment. First and foremost, the safety and wellbeing of our employees remains paramount. We continue to restrict access to our sites, execute enhanced cleaning protocols, administer quarantines where needed and enable our employees to work from home where possible. In addition to the extra measures taken in response to the pandemic, our employees have remained laser focused on safety as we achieved our all time best safety performance in the second quarter. We remain focused on safely maintaining our operations. Through the incredible effort across our organization, 100% of our 170 manufacturing sites around the globe are currently operating according to plan. We also made nice progress on our third priority, bolstering our already strong balance sheet. As we discussed last quarter, we launched a successful 2 billion bond offering, which will be used to satisfy the long-term debt maturities that come due in November of this year and extended and upsized our liquidity facility. Looking ahead, we plan on using $5 billion of special cash payment associated with the N&B and IFF deal to pay down debt, which will leave us in a very favorable position with no long-term debt maturities until the end of 2023. Finally, we believe it is critically important for companies like ours to continue partnering with other industry leaders to deliver essential products needed to support the significant efforts to combat COVID-19. I am proud of what we've achieved thus far with the TyvekTogether campaign, which in combination with our efforts to increase our production capacity has significantly improved the supply of protective garments to healthcare workers and others on the frontline of this pandemics. We also continue to advance other critical priorities across the company. In fact, just last week, we published our inaugural sustainability report at the new DuPont. With this report, we are not only able to convey our progress towards our 2030 Sustainability Goals, but we are also able to highlight our innovations across the company, which create a positive impact in people's lives every day. This is an exciting time for our company and I look forward to the progress we will make in the coming years. Moving to Slide 3, I am also pleased with the progress we've made executing the playbook that we implemented in mid-March as the pandemic intensified. We remain committed to a best-in-class cost structure and delivered approximately $130 million in cost savings during the quarter, two thirds of which are structural. We have made great, great progress towards delivering the $180 million of structural cost savings we announced earlier this year and the majority of the actions to deliver the savings are in place. In addition to these cost savings, we're also realizing benefits from the tail of the DowDuPont synergies and the restructuring actions we put in place in 2019. As I've noted before, our cost actions are targeted towards G&A expenses and aimed at enabling a highly productive cost structure, which is appropriately scaled to the size of the organization. While we will continuously monitor our cost structure for optimization opportunities, we will also drive growth through innovation, which remains a key component of our strategy. We are continuing to invest in key areas like sales, application development and R&D, so that when we fully emerged from this softness, we will be well positioned to capture growth. We are also studying the temporary savings that we are experiencing in the areas such as T&E to better understand what changes we can make to ensure some portion of these temporary savings become more structural. Additionally longer-term we are evaluating the most effective approach to the way we work in order to generate further potential savings from consolidation of our asset footprint driven by hostelling or other office sharing initiatives, plus productivity is an instilled mindset at DuPont and we are consistently scouting for new areas to drive improvement. We also made the decision to reduce 2020 CapEx to approximately $1 billion, which is about $500 million lower than 2019. We are not reducing any safety related capital expenditures and have developed detailed plans for restarting our growth projects to ensure we are able to capture the demand when markets fully recover. Through the first half of the year, we remain on track to deliver our goal. From a working capital perspective, we made good progress reducing our past due accounts in the quarter, which is notable in the current environment. However, the majority of the benefits we generated were from lower sales and idling facilities versus systemic productivity improvements. Our teams have developed a number of detailed plans to generate working capital benefits beyond those that you would expect in a soft macro environment. And we anticipate these initiatives will favorably impact the second half and enabled a greater than $500 million improvement that we are targeting for 2020. Our focus on cash generation not only ensures we have a strong balance sheet that positions us well to act on our commitment of returning excess capital to shareholders when we and the board feel it is appropriate to do so. I believe that our playbook is working. We have solid plans in place and are keenly focused on all the levers within our control. We are confident in the strength of our businesses that are well positioned for growth when markets fully recover. Before turning it over to Lori, I'd like to make a few comments on diversity, equality and inclusion. The significant challenge that has been put before all of us as individuals and as a company to confront deep rooted issues of inequality, racism and discrimination is one that we must take head on. My leadership team and I are committed to supporting racial equity within intensified focus on the experiences of black Americans through programs specifically aimed at improving our hiring, training and talent development practices within DuPont, as well as extensive efforts to eliminate barriers to equality for people of color in our broader communities. This is the right thing to do and a necessity for any company that wants to achieve long-term sustainable leadership. I am confident that DuPont will once again be an agent of change to make meaningful and lasting progress in this vital area. Now, let me turn it over to Lori to walk through some of the details for the quarter.\nLori Koch: Thanks, Ed, and good morning everyone. Our results for the quarter gives me confidence that our business teams are staying close to our customers, understanding the near term market dynamics of their industries and responding appropriately. These actions enabled us to deliver results that exceeded the expectations we provided in the first week of May with overall market dynamics very similar at the end of the quarter as they were at the beginning. The diversity of our portfolio, including significant strength in semiconductors, water filtration, private protective garment and health and wellness enabled us to deliver top-line results that were down 10% organically in the most challenging macro environment that we have seen since the global financial crisis. Additionally, excluding the cost associated with idling facilities as well as a gain in our non-core segment. Our earnings declines were very consistent with our top-line performance on a percentage basis due to significant cost actions that we have taken to improve our cost structure. In the quarter, our Electronics and Imaging and Nutrition and Biosciences businesses delivered organic growth of 7% and 1% respectively. This was more than offset by organic declines in the other segments with the largest impact in our T&I segment, which is highly exposed to the auto industry. Regionally, organic sales declined mid to high teens in the U.S. and Canada, Europe and Latin America while Asia Pacific was up 1% versus last year. Sequentially, the year-over-year change in the U.S. and Canada, Europe and Latin America declined while Asia Pacific showed a slight improvement. These trends are all consistent with what we expected as the pandemic significantly slowed Western economies through the second quarter. Also in the second quarter, we thought parts of Asia, particularly China, begin their recovery. China sales in our core segments improved 6% versus the second quarter of 2019 and 20% sequentially. The top-line growth in E&I and N&B coupled with delivery of our cost savings translated into robust operating EBITDA margin expansion in each of these segments in the quarter, up 190 basis points and 240 basis points respectively. Unprecedented demand weakness in automotive markets, which led to decision to idle approximately 50% of our polymer capacity in T&I as well as soft industrial markets lead to margin contraction in T&I and Safety and Construction. In total, we generated operating EBITDA of $1.1 billion and adjusted EPS of $0.70 per share.  Our decremental margin was approximately 45% in the quarter at the low end of our expected range driven primarily by even greater cost savings than we had anticipated. Excluding the $64 million Non-Core gain and the $160 million of costs associated with idling facilities, our decremental margins in the quarter were approximately 30%. Free cash flow of approximately $560 million in the quarter, led to a conversion rate of approximately 140%. As Ed indicated, we have implemented a number of working capital initiatives that will enable us to continue to drive strong cash flow conversion through the balance of the year. As you saw on our release this morning, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge related to our T&I segment of $2.5 billion. As you know, the automotive markets account for about 15% of our sales. The majority of this exposure sits in our T&I segment with the advanced materials we supplied to the OEMs, Tier one and Tier two component manufacturers. This is a market we watched closely, and one that has been significantly impacted by the global pandemic. With auto builds down now more than 30% in the first half of 2020, and IHS projections for further year-over-year declines in the second half. We determined that an impairment test was appropriate. In connection with the DowDuPont merger in 2017, the carrying value of the heritage DuPont assets and liabilities were marked at fair value and a significant goodwill and intangible balance was recorded. Specific to T&I, approximately $10 billion of goodwill and intangibles were recorded in 2017 equating to more than 75% of the overall carrying value of the segment. The impairment charge was the result of the unprecedented market dynamics received today, combined with the increased carrying value of the assets resulting from the DowDuPont merger. It is important to note that there was no impairment recorded associated with the tangible assets of the T&I segment. Our confidence in the long-term characteristics of the automotive industry and our position as a market leader remain strong. In addition, we continue to expand our application development expertise and take actions to improve our cost structure, so that we can expand our margin profile when markets fully recover. Slide 5 provides more detail on the year-over-year change in net sales. Our organic sales decline of 10% reflects the net impact of significant market weakness in automotive, aerospace, oil and gas and other industrial end markets, partially offset by robust demand in semiconductors, water filtration, Tyvek protective garments and health and wellness. Within E&I, Semiconductor Technologies delivered another strong quarter with 17% growth. The semi demand was broad-based. We saw market strength in both logic and foundry driven by the ramp up of advanced technology nodes, which plays lightly to our product portfolio as well as robust demand for memory and servers and data centers. The strength in semi also provided a more favorable product mix leading to 190 basis points of margin improvement in the segment. Our Nutrition & Biosciences business also delivered another strong quarter with very resilient growth across the food and beverage and health and wellness market. Our sales in these end markets, which make up approximately 85% of N&B portfolio were up 5% organically in the quarter. New customer wins and initiatives to better position our products in the market through multiple channels combined with a renewed focus on health and wellness drove more than 30% growth in probiotics, its strongest quarter ever. Pharma Solutions recorded a strong quarter on increased demand in over-the-counter and prescription pharma applications. Growing demands in the meat-free segment and continued strengthen animal nutrition and home and personal care applications also contributed to the strong results. These areas of strength were partially offset by significant demand weakness in the energy and industrial markets, which make up about 15% of N&B\u2019s top-line. The well-known weakness in automotive and industrial end markets continued to impact all three businesses within T&I. Our volumes in the second quarter were down 28%, while global auto builds were down 45%. We thought a similar trend in the first quarter where our volumes declined with 8% when global auto builds were down 22%. Our total T&I outperformance versus auto builds as a function of a few key drivers. First is mix with about 40% of the portfolio selling into markets outside of auto such as health care and electronics. Additionally, while we expect to deliver volume growth in our normal inventory environment of about 1.5 times auto build, the main drivers are outperformance versus auto builds in the current environment is more a function of where we sell into the supply chain. Our polymer sales, which accounts for the majority of our auto exposure were sold into Tier one and Tier two component manufacturers, whereas our adhesives business sells directly to OEM. Our polymer sales outperformed auto builds, which we believe has led to some inventory build in the channel, which we expect to result in a more muted recovery in the back half versus expectations for auto build. Our adhesives business sales are more directly aligned with auto build results, and we, therefore, expect that segment of the business to recover along with the expected pace of recovery at the OEM. Within S&C, demand of both Water Solutions and Tyvek protective garments remained robust. Water delivered another quarter with double-digit organic growth. The Tyvek protective garment business has expanded to nearly 30% of the safety solutions portfolio with garment sales up 65% in the second quarter, however, weakness in aerospace, automotive, oil and gas and industrial markets continued leading to a decline in the safety business overall. Growth in Shelter Solutions remains pressured as we continue to redirect Tyvek supply to personal protection and stay-at-home orders across the globe limited demand.  Turning to the adjusted EPS bridge on Slide 6. Adjusted EPS of $0.70, was down 28% versus the same quarter last year, driven by lower volumes and costs associated with idling facilities partially offset by the delivery of cost savings and a $64 million customer settlement gain in the Non-Core segment. As I mentioned, our cost actions from the DowDuPont synergies and the 2019 restructuring program coupled with the incremental actions we are taking in 2020 contributed to approximately $130 million of savings in the quarter.  Below the lines, we saw benefits from a lower share count due to share repurchases we executed in the second half of 2019 and early 2020, and a lower tax rate relating to foreign operations. Year-to-date, our base tax rate is approximately 22.5%. And we continue to anticipate our full year base tax rate in the range of 21% to 23%.  With that, let me turn it back to Ed for an update on the N&B and IFF transactions as well as some final comments on what we expect in the third quarter.\nEd Breen: Thanks, Lori. Slide 7 highlights the progress we've made since announcing the N&B and IFF transaction in mid-December. During the quarter, we completed additional key milestones. In May, DuPont, N&B and IFF filed the respective initial registration statements and are advancing the review process with the SEC. IFF and DuPont also named executive committee of the future combined company, which will include key DuPont N&B senior leaders. In addition, the company announced two independent DuPont appointees to the Board of Directors for the future combined company. We have made meaningful progress regarding regulatory approval. We cleared the U.S. process in March and have since received the approval in China, Serbia and Colombia. The clearance processes and the remaining required jurisdictions are well underway. Earlier this week, IFF filed its definitive proxy relating to the IFF shareholder approval of the transaction. The IFF shareholder meeting is set to take place on August 27. I remain excited about this combination as the tremendous opportunity for growth and greater innovation as the businesses come together. The teams are energized and all the critical milestones remain on track for first quarter of 2021 closing. Let me wrap up with a few comments on our expectations for the third quarter, while the next several months will likely continue to be challenging due to the pandemic we believe that the second quarter will mark the bottom for us. However, our return to pre pandemic levels will be measured and will certainly vary across our end markets. In markets like automotive and residential construction, we have seen an inflection in demand heading into the third quarter, but believe recovery will be gradual. Additionally markets like oil and gas, aerospace, commercial, construction and other key industrial segments continue to see significant weakness. As a result, the approach of operating many of our sites with a focus on cash generation to better match supply with demand will remain unchanged. We expect third quarter to look very similar to the second quarter with sales slightly up sequentially driven by modest recovery in automotive and residential construction, mostly offset by seasonal patterns in N&B as well as the impact of supply constraints across our Tyvek enterprise as we perform routine maintenance on the assets. It is worth noting that within E&I, semi is holding up stronger than we initially estimated what we remain cautious about the potential of some elevated inventory in the channel. We expect operating EPS in the range of $0.71 to $0.73 of sequential increase from the second quarter driven by the improving top-line. Sequentially lower costs associated with idling facilities will be offset by a slightly weaker mix in S&C due to required downtime in Tyvek and the absence of gains associated with the customer settlement and a discrete tax item recorded in the second quarter. We estimate our year-over-year decremental margins for the third quarter to be in line with the second quarter at around 45% on an as reported basis, again impacted by costs associated with idling facilities as well as the absence of prior year gains in our E&I and Non-Core segments. However, on an underlying basis, we estimate our decremental margins will be approximately 25%, an improvement of more than 500 basis points versus our second quarter underlying decremental margins driven by sustained execution of our structural cost savings. We will continue to stay focused on execution and remain confident that we will emerge from this crisis, an even stronger company. I'll now turn it to Leland to open up for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from John Inch from Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead.\nJohn Inch: Thank you. Good morning, everybody.\nEd Breen: Good morning, John.\nJohn Inch: Good morning, guys. I would like to ask you about the Tyvek line maintenance. Is this routine, say, for the summer? Or because you have older equipment, I'm just hypothesizing and it's been running full out. Obviously, you would not want to have the one going down in a period of strong demand. So maybe just a little more color there would be helpful.\nEd Breen: Yes. John, there's multiple lines basically in two locations over in the Luxembourg and Europe and in our Spruance facility in the U.S. So it's more than one line. And we're going to add line eight actually, which we have a CapEx program against for future demand. But a couple of our lines are extremely old lines. We got those up and running at way higher rates than we had been running on that before because of the pandemic and want to make so many more garments, as Lori mentioned. You could see our garment sales were up 60% or so. So we've really been cranking it out a couple of the older lines, and we just need to be doing some maintenance on. And the maintenance is not long, but it takes the lines down for two, three weeks and we're going to rotate through quite a few of those during this quarter and then we'll be hopefully in really good shape as we move over the next year after we do that. And then line eight we delayed some of that CapEx. We had to delay it because Luxembourg, the government actually shut us down during the pandemic and towards the end of the year, will recrank up the CapEx on that program to get that line up and running, and we'll have that up in like 1.5 years from kind of when we started up. So we'll have all that capability as we move forward.\nJohn Inch: Yes, okay. So that sounds like it really is just maintenance versus a major overhaul, which completely makes sense.\nEd Breen: No, no. It's just some maintenance.\nJohn Inch: Yes. Yes. That\u2019s fine. As a follow-up, Ed, how do July trends look? And by extension, not to put you on the spot, but how conservative do you think you're being with your third quarter sales commentary of sales up slightly sequentially.\nEd Breen: Yes. So John, look, our July sales were similar to the average we kind of were running in the first quarter, but the big difference was that we saw resi orders starting to pick up as we got into the middle of July. We're starting to see auto orders pick up for us as we kind of got into the middle of the month. And so we \u2013 but we sit in the supply chain a little bit later, as Lori mentioned in her remarks. So we're expecting to see the sales impact from that hit more towards the back half of the third quarter and then certainly as we go into the fourth quarter. So are we being a little conservative? Possibly because there are two key end markets for us, but it's just hard to tell exactly how much actually makes it into the quarter. But there's no doubt we're seeing demand lift on the order front in those two segments. And then as Lori had mentioned also, the semi market is holding up. We thought we might see some softness in the third quarter because some build in the channel. We still think there is some. We're a little cautious on that. I know some of our competitors are saying things are running hot also, and we continue to run pretty hot on the semi side. So could we be a little bit conservative possibly. But again, it's hard to tell when things actually hit in the sales number during the quarter. But I think its building momentum back half of third quarter, certainly in the fourth quarter.\nJohn Inch: Understand. Thanks very much.\nLori Koch: Yes. If I could just add some things by a comment. So our July sales curve, the average of 2Q, not 1Q. And then if we are being conservative in the market recovering a little bit more quickly than expected, then we will participate in that upside. So we have \u2013 concern that we've got market share issues. Really just our call on when the recovery really starts and when we start to see that manifest in order placement.\nJohn Inch: Yes, make sense. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.\nEd Breen: Thanks, John.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, Ed and Lori. Just two for me. On the electronics and then semi in particular, could you address, a, just kind of what you're seeing from a macro standpoint kind of in the channel. But the most important is how you're positioned relative to the various manufacturers. And I'm thinking, in particular, kind of this seemingly ongoing share gain that's going on by Taiwan semi, how you're positioned there? And is there opportunity for share gain in some of these OEM players?\nEd Breen: Yes. I don't necessarily like talking about specific customers, but I think \u2013 let me just \u2013 I think we're in a very strong position. That is a large customer of ours. So let me just say it that way. And there's clearly, maybe everyone misread the momentum a little bit in this industry, but the work at home, the data center usage, I know a key competitor of ours saw pretty much the same results. So I think it's across-the-board. The industry is growing \u2013 was growing at that rate last quarter, 18%. But we're positioned very well with a couple of the very big players in the industry. So they're seeing nice momentum also as I see they reported their numbers. So if they continue like that, we're going to continue like that. But 18% growth, I just don't see that, Jeff, holding at those kind of rates. I mean, we grow 5%, 6%, 7%. I think that's pretty nice. So I do think there's going to be some, over the second half of the year, here, a little bit of a downdraft from those growth rates, I would think, but still growing nicely.\nJeff Sprague: And you mentioned improving handsets in the back half. Obviously, Q2 was a tough quarter for handset industry. Do you feel like you have decent visibility on what happens in the back half at this point? And maybe you could address what's going on with content?\nEd Breen: Yes. So there's two things going on. We've got the product \u2013 some key product launches coming up with our customers for the holiday season and their 5G-enabled phones. And we have a lot more content in the 5G phones because we do all the antenna technology. So yes, we definitely have visibility for that. Obviously, smartphone sales year-over-year have been down, but we'll start to get the lift from these new launches and then the lift from the content from \u2013 going into 5G. Lori, you might want to mention kind of the difference between a 5G and a non-5G phone, just to put it in perspective.\nLori Koch: Yes. As Ed had mentioned, as we look to the third quarter, we'll see sequential lift within the Interconnect Solutions, which primarily sells into smartphones, just driven by the seasonality as the new phones come to market in the back half of the year. So we do expect that the overall handset to be down versus prior year but we'll pretty much offset that decline with the higher content that we have in the newer smartphones. So as Ed had noted, we sell into normal premium smartphone, about $2.50 a phone. In the newer models coming out, we have an extra dollar on phone, up to $3.50. And then as you get all the way to an enabled-5G phone, we see upwards of potentially another $1 on top of the $3.50 that we expected. It's a nice play for us to be able to offset some of the decline that we expect within the overall handset.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Thanks for the color. I appreciate it.\nEd Breen: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.\nSteve Tusa: Hi, guys. Good morning. \nEd Breen: Hey, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: You mentioned in the slides that the delivery of cost reduction offsets absent a prior year gain in Electronics & Imaging. Does that mean that you will have a flat margin year-over-year? Or is that we should expect flat profits year-over-year?\nLori Koch: Yes. So I think from a margin perspective, underlying, so it takes the costs that we'll see with idling facilities in 3Q and then the prior year total gains of around $60 million between E&I and Non-Core, expect margins to be about flat, maybe up a bit underlying.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. So I guess, just in E&I, is that \u2013 you're saying kind of the same thing?\nLori Koch: Yes. E&I, the same thing. So the gains were in E&I and Non-Core, their value grows.\nSteve Tusa: Sure. Okay. So that's the message there. I still don't quite understand why T&I wouldn't be kind of better, why 2Q wouldn't be kind of the trough quarter. I mean I understand that things aren't maybe coming back as fast as you would have expected, but kind of tough to kind of understand why 2Q wouldn't be the trough. I mean are you saying that 2Q is the trough there? Or are we kind of stuck at the bottom for another quarter? I'm just trying to kind of parse out how negative you're kind of being here on this market.\nLori Koch: So we definitely see 2Q as trough year. We will see sequential improvement in T&I as we head into Q3. Just right now, as we see the order book, it's going to be more towards the back end of the quarter and that really a nice [indiscernible] assuming the reopening continues. It's really more of a function of where we sell into this than anything else. So we \u2013 usually, once you start seeing the OEMs start back again, you're about a quarter behind because of where we sell in with the customers versus direct to OEMs.  So as we had mentioned earlier, if we're being conservative on that ramp, we'll participate in that upside because we have no share concerns. But I think it's indicative, too, if you kind of look through in the first half, we pretty well outperformed the auto build number and that's a function of where we sell into the chain. Polymer player sit and pull back as much as the OEMs enabling us to have volume declines that were less than the overall auto build decline. \nSteve Tusa: Got it. Okay. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nSteve Byrne: Yes, thank you. Was curious to hear what fraction of your staffing at headquarters and in R&D during the quarter were working remotely. And do you see any impact on the R&D productivity from that challenge? And with respect to headquarter staffing, just curious about what you've learned from this. You've obviously accomplished everything that headquarters needs to do with that staffing working remotely. Where do you think that goes down the road? Is that a lot of that staffing remaining remote? Or is that kind of what you're talking about changing the locations or figuring out another way of housing all of that staffing?\nEd Breen: Yes. It\u2019s a great question. So from an R&D standpoint \u2013 and by the way, want to just to use one example. Our biggest location is the experimental station in Delaware where a couple thousand people work there, a lot of our scientists that do just great work, and they are going back into their labs. Very few of them though are using the office space that they have, but they are doing all their lab work. We have set it up where we are actually doing different shifts. So not every employee is in the labs at the same time. So we have an early shift that goes to about noon and then we have a second shift that goes in for the whole afternoon into the evening. And we even have quite a few of our scientists going in during the nighttime into the wee hours of the morning. So we can keep \u2013 limit the number of people in any given lab at one time. But we have many, many, many labs. So that \u2013 they are functioning. They need to be in those facilities to do a lot of their work, and that's occurring. One of the things that I think every CEO is seeing in this environment, though, back to your point about the corporate office and many of our other offices, we've been able to really work very well remotely. And by way, remember, DuPont is going through a massive deal with IFF and N&B and all the integration work and separation and hard financials and tax work and we're right on schedule with it despite most of the people working remotely. So we really \u2013 we've put a team together, and we're really looking at how do we handle our office footprint around the globe going forward. And by the way, I'm a big believer you should be in the office interacting with people. I do think if you do this long term, you'll lose something but I don't think it has to be where you're there every single day and our people are working extremely hard remotely. So we're kind of doing a whole study on can we do kind of sharing of offices and all that and reduce the footprint as we move forward. So we're taking a hard, hard look at that and probably make some decisions before we exit the year.\nSteve Byrne: And then, Ed, can you provide any update on the on the Ohio MDL litigation settlement? I don't know, you had a couple of law firms that you're working with. Just wondering if anything is an obstacle at this point? Or whether you're still thinking about resolution there relatively soon?\nEd Breen: Yes. I think \u2013 look, I think there'll be a resolution settlement. There's basically two plaintiffs that are handling the 100 or so outstanding cases. We've been in conversations, and let me just say, I'm highly confident there'll be a resolution in the not-too-distant future on that.\nSteve Byrne: Thank you.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Davis: Hi, good morning, Ed. Good morning, Lori.\nEd Breen: Hey, Scott.\nLori Koch: Good morning.\nScott Davis: I know it\u2019s hard to predict these things but, Ed, do you have a gut instinct to when you think your T&I plans will be back up deployed and running or when you'll need them again kind of a cadence, I guess, is what I'm looking for? \nEd Breen: Yes, yes, yes. Go ahead, Lori.\nLori Koch: Yes. So from an idle mill perspective, we took about $130 million in Q2. We do see sequentially less underlying from the costs actually associated with taking the assets down into Q3 and then even more so into Q4. So fortunately, we have the flexibility that whenever we do see the demand recover, that we can be pretty agile and take those assets back up in two to three weeks. And so if we need to accelerate our existing plans, we can do that. So Q3 will look a little bit more of uptime than Q2 and then we'll see even more uptime as you head into Q4. \nScott Davis: And then CapEx, I mean, you took it down to $1 billion for 2020. And just one of the knocks on \u2013 I know your business structure is just the capital intensity of it. But is there a sense \u2013 I mean, Ed, how do you think about how think about how you become more capital-efficient kind of longer term? I mean, obviously, productivity has to play a role. But is there a possibility that a longer-term DuPont could become less capital-intensive and perhaps closer to the $1 billion run rate than the $1.5 billion-ish levels.\nEd Breen: Yes. No, Scott, I think there definitely is, and by the way, Lori and I have been very focused on that issue. As we Lori and I have been very focused on that issue. As we look out over multiple years, I think we can reduce the CapEx. It just so happened that we hit a period between probiotics, Kapton, Tyvek where we were very constrained on capacity and it just so happens they happen to be three of our most capital intense businesses. So I would just put in we kind of are hitting a hump on the high end for a couple of years. And we \u2013 as we model out over three, four, kind of five years, we can drift that CapEx back down. We're also \u2013 I don't want to get into all the details, all the details, but we're also looking at some outsourcing of some of the earlier chain stuff in our portfolio that I don't feel we have to do and we can outsource that to somebody else, and we're studying that hard, too. There's a couple of areas we know we can do that in and that will reduce the CapEx on our that will reduce the CapEx on our end also. So it's a big focus of ours to get that number back down around D&A on a consistent basis. But it's a great question. We understand the importance of that. \nScott Davis: Well, it sounds encouraging. So good luck guys. Thank you.\nLori Koch: Thanks Scott.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Mike Sison from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMike Sison: Hey, good morning. Nice quarter.\nEd Breen: Thank you.\nLori Koch: Thank you.\nMike Sison: In Nutrition & Biosciences, you drove 240 basis points of margin improvement. What drove that improvement and beyond 2020 Ed, given you'll be on the IFF Board, what do you think the normalized growth rate for this business could be? And remind us how you think IFF combination can support that growth?\nLori Koch: Yes, so maybe I can hit the margin piece first. So we did drive really nice margin lift in N&B and a lot of it was driven just by favorable mix. And so, we had mentioned that our probiotics were up about 30%. That's definitely the highest margin piece of the portfolio. So we really had nice improvement there. And also cost actions helps with the margin lift. So N&B would have shared in a portion of that $130 million of cost reductions that we saw in the quarter.\nEd Breen: Yes. And just by the way on the combo, look a couple of key principles. We're going to have pretty massive R&D capability in the combined company. So we're not doing any cutting there, most of our synergy work as it is at DuPont is really going to be on the G&A side. So we're going to have really nice scale to be launching consistently new products into the markets. We've had great feedback from customers on our ability to do a lot of application development work with them with the extensive portfolio we're going to have. So I feel very bullish on that. And as you can see, generally as an industry, it just holds up very, very well. I think Lori mentioned this in her prepared remarks, 85% of the portfolio, which is really food and beverage centric grew organically 5% in the quarter and the piece that dragged it down to a 1% in aggregate was really industrial end markets that we play in. So we'll have to look at that as we move forward, but it's just a consistent industry. I would also point out, I think I said this on the last earnings call, the multiple that IFF trade that, and by the way, the IFF value or the N&B values basically still about where we announced the deal at, which is $26 billion of value for a DuPont shareholder and IFF multiple still sits 400 basis points to 500 basis points below the top, what I'd call the top few players in the industry. So I think we, as a combo, we prove success rolling out the new company. There's great margin expansion capability, just with the IFF share price and clearly the number one position that we're going to have. Again, we got to come out elegantly and integrate the company well, but that opportunity is there. And in this case, I truly believe we have the revenue synergies we've talked about with what we can offer to a customer. One of the areas \u2013 probably it's still a small business, but one of the areas really growing for us right now is the meatless meat market business. And I think we had a chart out when we announced the deal. IFF has four or five products that sell into that industry. DuPont has four or five products that sell into that industry. So our ability to innovate, just use that as one example, innovate in that industry as it moves forward is just way more significant than anybody else. So I think it's going to be a really awesome company, when we get it to \u2013 get going on it and hope February 1 is our date to consummate the merger next year. Again as \u2013 and as I think Lori said the vote \u2013 the shareholder vote is on August 27, so another month from now and that'll be done.\nMike Sison: All right. And a quick follow-up, TE FMC announced a new fab to put in Arizona in 2Q and not sure if that's a one off or an ongoing trend to bring capacity back to the U.S., but if that's the latter, would that be a positive for your semi business?\nEd Breen: It should be yes. And my gut is talking to our customers that you'll see more announcements like that.\nMike Sison: Great. Thank you.\nEd Breen: Yep, thanks.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nJonas Oxgaard: Hi, good morning guys.\nEd Breen: Good morning, Jonas.\nLori Koch: Good morning, Jonas.\nJonas Oxgaard: Hi. I was hoping to take a step back. I mean, we are living through the probably most influential event in our lifetimes. The world is changing a lot. And given that you're a diversified company, are you seeing any place where you're changing your strategy in the next couple of years?\nEd Breen: Not \u2013 Jonas, not significantly, but remember one of the things we've been working on and I'm really glad we got our sustainability report out. If you want to take a look at that now, it's online, is that a lot of our products in areas we're working on from an R&D standpoint really goes towards the UN sustainability goals. So I think we're secularly where we're \u2013 our scientists are working, where we're developing products for, I think, is in the sweet spot of a lot of things that are changing in the world. So from that standpoint, yes, we put a lot of effort into that over the last few years, so we're kind of redirect our thinking towards that area. And so I think secularly, I feel good about where we're investing our money. So I wouldn't say the pandemic changed anything. It's kind of been something we've been working on the last few years. And I think that's going to play out well for us. And it's why we think in normal times we can outgrow GDP because of the areas we're going to be focused on.\nJonas Oxgaard: Okay. As a follow-up with that, if you don't mind, you're seeing a lot of discussion about hydrogen in the \u2013 particularly from the European Union. And some of the hydrogen investment has to be water purification. Is that something your water business is doubling down on? Or is that an opportunity for you guys?\nEd Breen: Yes. Yes, it is. And by the way, we \u2013 that's a business and by the way that goes to our sustainability goal. That's one of the key ones is global clean water. That business, as you saw, is growing very nicely. And we would love to add to that portfolio, both R&D capability, which we're adding people, application development people we're adding in that business. And if we could do any more bolt-on acquisitions, we would be thrilled to do it in that space. And by the way it was strong across the home application, desalination and industrial wastewater, every one of those segments is doing very well.\nLori Koch: And if I can just add the acquisitions that we made at the end of the year, really have put us as a leader across all the three types of filtration technology, so reverse Osmosis, Ultrafiltration and Ion Exchange Resins. So we're well positioned to take advantage of any inflections in the market.\nJonas Oxgaard: Okay, thank you.\nEd Breen: Thanks, Jonas.\nOperator: We will now take your next question from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. Ed and Lori just on Tyvek. How are you thinking about the growth of this franchise going forward, given recent events? And are you doing any debottlenecking with the current plant maintenance?\nLori Koch: Yes, so I think the growth, we see a lot of upside in the growth and even when the pandemic is behind us we see further upside with the garments, just given that a lot of the local and national governments will look to either establish or replenish their stockpile, so that the benefit that we're seeing isn't temporary. And longer-term, obviously, we need to add capacity to continue to participate in the growth and we're doing that. So once we are able to restart the Tyvek line 8 project at the end of the year that ultimately will add an incremental capacity for us. As far as the debottlenecking is concerned, we did a lot of that in the first half to enable the improvements that we saw in Tyvek garment. So combined with a couple of initiatives of bringing some new assets online as well as debottlenecking, that\u2019s where we able to double that production of Tyvek garment. So always looking to get incremental capacity of the line just given the asset is sold out.\nDavid Begleiter: That's very helpful. Just on T&I, you mentioned an inventory build that could impact Q3 in the auto area. Would that be done by end of Q3? Or could that leak into Q4 as well?\nEd Breen: No, I would think that that would be done. It's not \u2013 I don't think it's overly significant. But, as Lori mentioned in her remarks, our sales in T&I were kind of less than half of the downturn of autos. So, we're concerned just there's a little bit, but we also, as we said, we lag in the supply chain a little bit. So I would think by the time we're going into the end of the third quarter into the fourth quarter, we're totally fine.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you very much.\nEd Breen: Thanks, David.\nLori Koch: Thanks, David.\nOperator: We will now take your next question from John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJohn McNulty: Yes, thanks for taking my question. It sounds like you've got a lot of things in the works in terms of improving cash conversion and you highlighted a greater than $500 million working capital improvement. Can you speak to kind of the types of targets that you're looking for in terms of working capital enhancement as you're looking forward? Like I said, it sounds like you've got a lot in the works, but can you help us to quantify how to think about that going forward?\nLori Koch: Sure, yes. So we've got \u2013 for this year, we've got a target of greater than $500 million and then even beyond that we've still got entitlement as far as improving our underlying productivity probably deliver another $500 million. So we said, it's not going to come out in one year, but we saw $1 billion total working capital opportunity. So once we get past that, those two large improvement opportunities, they're going to be a couple years until we're complete with those. With the free cash flow conversion targets that we've set of at least greater than 90% and we've been greater than that in the past. And so, our history is right around a 100% that sort of dictates that you maintain flat working capital to be able to deliver that metric. And so any upside that you see as far as top-line growth that may negatively impact working capital. We're going to have to offset that with ongoing productivity. And so our largest opportunity sits within inventory, which is where a lot of our efforts are targeted around improving inventory productivity through SKU rationalization, through reorder point examination, through demand \u2013 better demand planning. So that's one of the larger opportunities for us as we go forward.\nEd Breen: Yes, I'd also mention \u2013 or Lori, you might want to give a number around this, but one of the things going into the pandemic, I was personally very worried about was just past due balances and we have had massive improvement on pass through, which I kind of find interesting in this environment because I wouldn't have thought that, but Lori \u2013 the teams around the world, we put a big, big focus on that as I thought it could become a little bit more of an issue and we've actually made great progress.\nLori Koch: Yes, we did. We've reduced past due versus prior year by about 40% in the quarter. So really nice there, just as Ed had mentioned with a lot of the customers looking to delay payments or miss payments because of the pandemic, we've actually went to the other side and reduced it. So, a great performance there.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. That's hugely helpful. And maybe just as a follow-up, it looks like in terms of asset values, they've come up a lot in the market. It sounds like a lot of the bid asks that are out there in terms of M&A or maybe narrowing. Can you give us any update on the non-core businesses that you have kind of sitting there and your optimism on getting some transactions done either in the \u2013 kind of in the back half of the year?\nEd Breen: Yes, John, it's been one of my more frustrating ones. We have interested parties in every one of the assets. We're in negotiations on everyone and it's just slower in this environment doing due diligence people visiting sites, doing the environmental studies. So, hopefully, we'll make some progress here in the back half of the year on that, but we're totally focused on getting that done. I just don't want to put a date on them. I thought we'd have a couple done by this phone call and hopefully we get them across the finish line, but we definitely have parties that we've been talking to. Mostly strategic\u2026\nJohn McNulty: Got it. Thanks very much.\nEd Breen: Mostly strategic players, which is a good sign, I think.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. Thanks very much for the color.\nEd Breen: Yep, thanks.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from John Roberts from UBS. Please go ahead.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you. Any updated thoughts on how you distribute the new IFF shares? You're giving yourself a lot of flexibility between a spinoff and split off here? Are you tilting towards one versus the other?\nEd Breen: Well, I can't say yet. We'll make that decision as we get later into the fall. I mean, I've always just done a spin-off, but I don't want to put a leaning on it right now, just depends what the numbers look like when we get there. But look, I think, the good news overall, John, I mean the shareholder vote is happening in a month, the deal is definitely happening. I know earlier in the year, people were curious, is this thing going to stick and all that with everything going on. So the deal is in great shape from that standpoint. And again, we'll see where we're trading at what's going on at the time and we'll make a decision then, and you just can't make it right now because you don't know the facts.\nJohn Roberts: And then could you give us an update on the ethanol enzyme in the Biosciences businesses, which are the weaker areas within N&B recently?\nLori Koch: Yes, so that was within the 15% of the portfolio that we had noted that was weaker in N&B. So that portion of the portfolio along with microbial control was down significantly in the quarter. As we look to the back half, we would think \u2013 you would see kind of a flattish in the second half, but we'll see how the market continues to play out.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you.\nEd Breen: Thanks, John. I think we're going to take one more question.\nOperator: Perfect. We\u2019ll now take our next question PJ Juvekar from Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nPJ Juvekar: Yes. Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Ed, many companies have deferred buybacks and I know right now there is gas savings aspect of it, there's also the perception of buybacks in the middle of the pandemic. So with your strong free cash flow from the working capital release when do you think you can come back in a meaningful way in share repurchases?\nEd Breen: Yes, PJ it\u2019s a great question. I think we'll probably assess it again in the kind of early fall. Take a look at it. Remember, we're going to get over $2 billion of excess cash from the IFF deal at the beginning or kind of going into 2021. So we know we have that coming back to the prior question, hopefully we have some decent cash coming in from the non-core asset sales, so that will be excess cash and of course in our own just operations generating cash. So, I really love our position going into 2021 because we're going to have cash available from a multiple angles and no debt payments until November of 2023. So we're going to have a lot of flexibility. And so, I think, we'll be reassessing that as I said in the early fall and make a call on that. If I look at the new DuPont ex N&B and I look at where the multiple of the companies out, which is give or take eight times. I can't imagine at some point here, we're not going to be doing some share repurchase. Hopefully, we're not trading around eight times moving forward, but ex not worried about the pandemic, I'd be buying shares back right now. So I again will assess it again in the fall knowing where we're going to be sitting from a balance sheet, a very strong cash position.\nPJ Juvekar: Great. And one quick follow-up on M&A, I know it's tough to do M&A right now, but in the past you had talked about potential deals in either T&I or E&I, but with the recent charge that you took in T&I, does that set that division back a little bit and maybe whenever the M&A market opens up, would E&I be the front runners? Thank you.\nEd Breen: Yes, let me just answer that. No, I don't feel any different about T&I. By the way it\u2019s a great \u2013 auto is a great industry to be in and just. It\u2019s just \u2013 hey, the pandemic took it down, but remember, I think Lori covered this well. The charge we had to take was because we had to step up the assets so significantly in the DowDuPont merger that there just was no wiggle room there. So it's a non-cash charge. If we \u2013 any weakness we would see we were kind of on the teetering edge because of what we had to do when we did the merger and step up. So no, I don't feel any different about it. And look, we're starting to see the rebound in auto come back here and I think 2021 will be a decent year for auto, not back to $90 million auto builds, but it's going to lift up rather nicely here. So I feel good about that. And look, as I said, we're all hands on deck operationally right now. We're not looking at something big structural right now. There's too many moving pieces with \u2013 in all the industries. And it's just not on our plate at this point in time. We want to get the N&B deal done, keep it on schedule which we are, and \u2013 but we always have that flexibility in the future, if there's a great opportunity for our shareholders.\nPJ Juvekar: Great, thank you.\nEd Breen: Thanks PJ.\nLeland Weaver: Thank you everyone for joining the call. For your reference a copy of our transcript will be posted on our website. This concludes our call.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Lori Koch",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed, and good morning everyone. Our results for the quarter gives me confidence that our business teams are staying close to our customers, understanding the near term market dynamics of their industries and responding appropriately. These actions enabled us to deliver results that exceeded the expectations we provided in the first week of May with overall market dynamics very similar at the end of the quarter as they were at the beginning. The diversity of our portfolio, including significant strength in semiconductors, water filtration, private protective garment and health and wellness enabled us to deliver top-line results that were down 10% organically in the most challenging macro environment that we have seen since the global financial crisis. Additionally, excluding the cost associated with idling facilities as well as a gain in our non-core segment. Our earnings declines were very consistent with our top-line performance on a percentage basis due to significant cost actions that we have taken to improve our cost structure. In the quarter, our Electronics and Imaging and Nutrition and Biosciences businesses delivered organic growth of 7% and 1% respectively. This was more than offset by organic declines in the other segments with the largest impact in our T&I segment, which is highly exposed to the auto industry. Regionally, organic sales declined mid to high teens in the U.S. and Canada, Europe and Latin America while Asia Pacific was up 1% versus last year. Sequentially, the year-over-year change in the U.S. and Canada, Europe and Latin America declined while Asia Pacific showed a slight improvement. These trends are all consistent with what we expected as the pandemic significantly slowed Western economies through the second quarter. Also in the second quarter, we thought parts of Asia, particularly China, begin their recovery. China sales in our core segments improved 6% versus the second quarter of 2019 and 20% sequentially. The top-line growth in E&I and N&B coupled with delivery of our cost savings translated into robust operating EBITDA margin expansion in each of these segments in the quarter, up 190 basis points and 240 basis points respectively. Unprecedented demand weakness in automotive markets, which led to decision to idle approximately 50% of our polymer capacity in T&I as well as soft industrial markets lead to margin contraction in T&I and Safety and Construction. In total, we generated operating EBITDA of $1.1 billion and adjusted EPS of $0.70 per share.  Our decremental margin was approximately 45% in the quarter at the low end of our expected range driven primarily by even greater cost savings than we had anticipated. Excluding the $64 million Non-Core gain and the $160 million of costs associated with idling facilities, our decremental margins in the quarter were approximately 30%. Free cash flow of approximately $560 million in the quarter, led to a conversion rate of approximately 140%. As Ed indicated, we have implemented a number of working capital initiatives that will enable us to continue to drive strong cash flow conversion through the balance of the year. As you saw on our release this morning, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge related to our T&I segment of $2.5 billion. As you know, the automotive markets account for about 15% of our sales. The majority of this exposure sits in our T&I segment with the advanced materials we supplied to the OEMs, Tier one and Tier two component manufacturers. This is a market we watched closely, and one that has been significantly impacted by the global pandemic. With auto builds down now more than 30% in the first half of 2020, and IHS projections for further year-over-year declines in the second half. We determined that an impairment test was appropriate. In connection with the DowDuPont merger in 2017, the carrying value of the heritage DuPont assets and liabilities were marked at fair value and a significant goodwill and intangible balance was recorded. Specific to T&I, approximately $10 billion of goodwill and intangibles were recorded in 2017 equating to more than 75% of the overall carrying value of the segment. The impairment charge was the result of the unprecedented market dynamics received today, combined with the increased carrying value of the assets resulting from the DowDuPont merger. It is important to note that there was no impairment recorded associated with the tangible assets of the T&I segment. Our confidence in the long-term characteristics of the automotive industry and our position as a market leader remain strong. In addition, we continue to expand our application development expertise and take actions to improve our cost structure, so that we can expand our margin profile when markets fully recover. Slide 5 provides more detail on the year-over-year change in net sales. Our organic sales decline of 10% reflects the net impact of significant market weakness in automotive, aerospace, oil and gas and other industrial end markets, partially offset by robust demand in semiconductors, water filtration, Tyvek protective garments and health and wellness. Within E&I, Semiconductor Technologies delivered another strong quarter with 17% growth. The semi demand was broad-based. We saw market strength in both logic and foundry driven by the ramp up of advanced technology nodes, which plays lightly to our product portfolio as well as robust demand for memory and servers and data centers. The strength in semi also provided a more favorable product mix leading to 190 basis points of margin improvement in the segment. Our Nutrition & Biosciences business also delivered another strong quarter with very resilient growth across the food and beverage and health and wellness market. Our sales in these end markets, which make up approximately 85% of N&B portfolio were up 5% organically in the quarter. New customer wins and initiatives to better position our products in the market through multiple channels combined with a renewed focus on health and wellness drove more than 30% growth in probiotics, its strongest quarter ever. Pharma Solutions recorded a strong quarter on increased demand in over-the-counter and prescription pharma applications. Growing demands in the meat-free segment and continued strengthen animal nutrition and home and personal care applications also contributed to the strong results. These areas of strength were partially offset by significant demand weakness in the energy and industrial markets, which make up about 15% of N&B's top-line. The well-known weakness in automotive and industrial end markets continued to impact all three businesses within T&I. Our volumes in the second quarter were down 28%, while global auto builds were down 45%. We thought a similar trend in the first quarter where our volumes declined with 8% when global auto builds were down 22%. Our total T&I outperformance versus auto builds as a function of a few key drivers. First is mix with about 40% of the portfolio selling into markets outside of auto such as health care and electronics. Additionally, while we expect to deliver volume growth in our normal inventory environment of about 1.5 times auto build, the main drivers are outperformance versus auto builds in the current environment is more a function of where we sell into the supply chain. Our polymer sales, which accounts for the majority of our auto exposure were sold into Tier one and Tier two component manufacturers, whereas our adhesives business sells directly to OEM. Our polymer sales outperformed auto builds, which we believe has led to some inventory build in the channel, which we expect to result in a more muted recovery in the back half versus expectations for auto build. Our adhesives business sales are more directly aligned with auto build results, and we, therefore, expect that segment of the business to recover along with the expected pace of recovery at the OEM. Within S&C, demand of both Water Solutions and Tyvek protective garments remained robust. Water delivered another quarter with double-digit organic growth. The Tyvek protective garment business has expanded to nearly 30% of the safety solutions portfolio with garment sales up 65% in the second quarter, however, weakness in aerospace, automotive, oil and gas and industrial markets continued leading to a decline in the safety business overall. Growth in Shelter Solutions remains pressured as we continue to redirect Tyvek supply to personal protection and stay-at-home orders across the globe limited demand.  Turning to the adjusted EPS bridge on Slide 6. Adjusted EPS of $0.70, was down 28% versus the same quarter last year, driven by lower volumes and costs associated with idling facilities partially offset by the delivery of cost savings and a $64 million customer settlement gain in the Non-Core segment. As I mentioned, our cost actions from the DowDuPont synergies and the 2019 restructuring program coupled with the incremental actions we are taking in 2020 contributed to approximately $130 million of savings in the quarter.  Below the lines, we saw benefits from a lower share count due to share repurchases we executed in the second half of 2019 and early 2020, and a lower tax rate relating to foreign operations. Year-to-date, our base tax rate is approximately 22.5%. And we continue to anticipate our full year base tax rate in the range of 21% to 23%.  With that, let me turn it back to Ed for an update on the N&B and IFF transactions as well as some final comments on what we expect in the third quarter. Yes. If I could just add some things by a comment. So our July sales curve, the average of 2Q, not 1Q. And then if we are being conservative in the market recovering a little bit more quickly than expected, then we will participate in that upside. So we have \u2013 concern that we've got market share issues. Really just our call on when the recovery really starts and when we start to see that manifest in order placement. Yes. As Ed had mentioned, as we look to the third quarter, we'll see sequential lift within the Interconnect Solutions, which primarily sells into smartphones, just driven by the seasonality as the new phones come to market in the back half of the year. So we do expect that the overall handset to be down versus prior year but we'll pretty much offset that decline with the higher content that we have in the newer smartphones. So as Ed had noted, we sell into normal premium smartphone, about $2.50 a phone. In the newer models coming out, we have an extra dollar on phone, up to $3.50. And then as you get all the way to an enabled-5G phone, we see upwards of potentially another $1 on top of the $3.50 that we expected. It's a nice play for us to be able to offset some of the decline that we expect within the overall handset. Yes. So I think from a margin perspective, underlying, so it takes the costs that we'll see with idling facilities in 3Q and then the prior year total gains of around $60 million between E&I and Non-Core, expect margins to be about flat, maybe up a bit underlying. Yes. E&I, the same thing. So the gains were in E&I and Non-Core, their value grows. So we definitely see 2Q as trough year. We will see sequential improvement in T&I as we head into Q3. Just right now, as we see the order book, it's going to be more towards the back end of the quarter and that really a nice [indiscernible] assuming the reopening continues. It's really more of a function of where we sell into this than anything else. So we \u2013 usually, once you start seeing the OEMs start back again, you're about a quarter behind because of where we sell in with the customers versus direct to OEMs.  So as we had mentioned earlier, if we're being conservative on that ramp, we'll participate in that upside because we have no share concerns. But I think it's indicative, too, if you kind of look through in the first half, we pretty well outperformed the auto build number and that's a function of where we sell into the chain. Polymer player sit and pull back as much as the OEMs enabling us to have volume declines that were less than the overall auto build decline. Good morning. Yes. So from an idle mill perspective, we took about $130 million in Q2. We do see sequentially less underlying from the costs actually associated with taking the assets down into Q3 and then even more so into Q4. So fortunately, we have the flexibility that whenever we do see the demand recover, that we can be pretty agile and take those assets back up in two to three weeks. And so if we need to accelerate our existing plans, we can do that. So Q3 will look a little bit more of uptime than Q2 and then we'll see even more uptime as you head into Q4. Thanks Scott. Thank you. Yes, so maybe I can hit the margin piece first. So we did drive really nice margin lift in N&B and a lot of it was driven just by favorable mix. And so, we had mentioned that our probiotics were up about 30%. That's definitely the highest margin piece of the portfolio. So we really had nice improvement there. And also cost actions helps with the margin lift. So N&B would have shared in a portion of that $130 million of cost reductions that we saw in the quarter. Good morning, Jonas. And if I can just add the acquisitions that we made at the end of the year, really have put us as a leader across all the three types of filtration technology, so reverse Osmosis, Ultrafiltration and Ion Exchange Resins. So we're well positioned to take advantage of any inflections in the market. Yes, so I think the growth, we see a lot of upside in the growth and even when the pandemic is behind us we see further upside with the garments, just given that a lot of the local and national governments will look to either establish or replenish their stockpile, so that the benefit that we're seeing isn't temporary. And longer-term, obviously, we need to add capacity to continue to participate in the growth and we're doing that. So once we are able to restart the Tyvek line 8 project at the end of the year that ultimately will add an incremental capacity for us. As far as the debottlenecking is concerned, we did a lot of that in the first half to enable the improvements that we saw in Tyvek garment. So combined with a couple of initiatives of bringing some new assets online as well as debottlenecking, that's where we able to double that production of Tyvek garment. So always looking to get incremental capacity of the line just given the asset is sold out. Thanks, David. Sure, yes. So we've got \u2013 for this year, we've got a target of greater than $500 million and then even beyond that we've still got entitlement as far as improving our underlying productivity probably deliver another $500 million. So we said, it's not going to come out in one year, but we saw $1 billion total working capital opportunity. So once we get past that, those two large improvement opportunities, they're going to be a couple years until we're complete with those. With the free cash flow conversion targets that we've set of at least greater than 90% and we've been greater than that in the past. And so, our history is right around a 100% that sort of dictates that you maintain flat working capital to be able to deliver that metric. And so any upside that you see as far as top-line growth that may negatively impact working capital. We're going to have to offset that with ongoing productivity. And so our largest opportunity sits within inventory, which is where a lot of our efforts are targeted around improving inventory productivity through SKU rationalization, through reorder point examination, through demand \u2013 better demand planning. So that's one of the larger opportunities for us as we go forward. Yes, we did. We've reduced past due versus prior year by about 40% in the quarter. So really nice there, just as Ed had mentioned with a lot of the customers looking to delay payments or miss payments because of the pandemic, we've actually went to the other side and reduced it. So, a great performance there. Yes, so that was within the 15% of the portfolio that we had noted that was weaker in N&B. So that portion of the portfolio along with microbial control was down significantly in the quarter. As we look to the back half, we would think \u2013 you would see kind of a flattish in the second half, but we'll see how the market continues to play out."

            "name": "Ed Breen",
            "content": "Thanks, Leland, and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. I hope you and your loved ones are safe and well. Last quarter, I laid out our priorities for operating in this unprecedented environment. I am pleased to say that the quick actions that we took to protect our employees ensure the safe operations of our sites, strengthen the financial position of the company and do our part to combat this pandemic are working. Additionally, I'd like to acknowledge the tremendous efforts of all of our employees to deliver solid results this quarter in the face of this global pandemic. Lori will cover the specifics of the quarter, but first I'd like to discuss our performance versus our priorities in the current environment. First and foremost, the safety and wellbeing of our employees remains paramount. We continue to restrict access to our sites, execute enhanced cleaning protocols, administer quarantines where needed and enable our employees to work from home where possible. In addition to the extra measures taken in response to the pandemic, our employees have remained laser focused on safety as we achieved our all time best safety performance in the second quarter. We remain focused on safely maintaining our operations. Through the incredible effort across our organization, 100% of our 170 manufacturing sites around the globe are currently operating according to plan. We also made nice progress on our third priority, bolstering our already strong balance sheet. As we discussed last quarter, we launched a successful 2 billion bond offering, which will be used to satisfy the long-term debt maturities that come due in November of this year and extended and upsized our liquidity facility. Looking ahead, we plan on using $5 billion of special cash payment associated with the N&B and IFF deal to pay down debt, which will leave us in a very favorable position with no long-term debt maturities until the end of 2023. Finally, we believe it is critically important for companies like ours to continue partnering with other industry leaders to deliver essential products needed to support the significant efforts to combat COVID-19. I am proud of what we've achieved thus far with the TyvekTogether campaign, which in combination with our efforts to increase our production capacity has significantly improved the supply of protective garments to healthcare workers and others on the frontline of this pandemics. We also continue to advance other critical priorities across the company. In fact, just last week, we published our inaugural sustainability report at the new DuPont. With this report, we are not only able to convey our progress towards our 2030 Sustainability Goals, but we are also able to highlight our innovations across the company, which create a positive impact in people's lives every day. This is an exciting time for our company and I look forward to the progress we will make in the coming years. Moving to Slide 3, I am also pleased with the progress we've made executing the playbook that we implemented in mid-March as the pandemic intensified. We remain committed to a best-in-class cost structure and delivered approximately $130 million in cost savings during the quarter, two thirds of which are structural. We have made great, great progress towards delivering the $180 million of structural cost savings we announced earlier this year and the majority of the actions to deliver the savings are in place. In addition to these cost savings, we're also realizing benefits from the tail of the DowDuPont synergies and the restructuring actions we put in place in 2019. As I've noted before, our cost actions are targeted towards G&A expenses and aimed at enabling a highly productive cost structure, which is appropriately scaled to the size of the organization. While we will continuously monitor our cost structure for optimization opportunities, we will also drive growth through innovation, which remains a key component of our strategy. We are continuing to invest in key areas like sales, application development and R&D, so that when we fully emerged from this softness, we will be well positioned to capture growth. We are also studying the temporary savings that we are experiencing in the areas such as T&E to better understand what changes we can make to ensure some portion of these temporary savings become more structural. Additionally longer-term we are evaluating the most effective approach to the way we work in order to generate further potential savings from consolidation of our asset footprint driven by hostelling or other office sharing initiatives, plus productivity is an instilled mindset at DuPont and we are consistently scouting for new areas to drive improvement. We also made the decision to reduce 2020 CapEx to approximately $1 billion, which is about $500 million lower than 2019. We are not reducing any safety related capital expenditures and have developed detailed plans for restarting our growth projects to ensure we are able to capture the demand when markets fully recover. Through the first half of the year, we remain on track to deliver our goal. From a working capital perspective, we made good progress reducing our past due accounts in the quarter, which is notable in the current environment. However, the majority of the benefits we generated were from lower sales and idling facilities versus systemic productivity improvements. Our teams have developed a number of detailed plans to generate working capital benefits beyond those that you would expect in a soft macro environment. And we anticipate these initiatives will favorably impact the second half and enabled a greater than $500 million improvement that we are targeting for 2020. Our focus on cash generation not only ensures we have a strong balance sheet that positions us well to act on our commitment of returning excess capital to shareholders when we and the board feel it is appropriate to do so. I believe that our playbook is working. We have solid plans in place and are keenly focused on all the levers within our control. We are confident in the strength of our businesses that are well positioned for growth when markets fully recover. Before turning it over to Lori, I'd like to make a few comments on diversity, equality and inclusion. The significant challenge that has been put before all of us as individuals and as a company to confront deep rooted issues of inequality, racism and discrimination is one that we must take head on. My leadership team and I are committed to supporting racial equity within intensified focus on the experiences of black Americans through programs specifically aimed at improving our hiring, training and talent development practices within DuPont, as well as extensive efforts to eliminate barriers to equality for people of color in our broader communities. This is the right thing to do and a necessity for any company that wants to achieve long-term sustainable leadership. I am confident that DuPont will once again be an agent of change to make meaningful and lasting progress in this vital area. Now, let me turn it over to Lori to walk through some of the details for the quarter. Thanks, Lori. Slide 7 highlights the progress we've made since announcing the N&B and IFF transaction in mid-December. During the quarter, we completed additional key milestones. In May, DuPont, N&B and IFF filed the respective initial registration statements and are advancing the review process with the SEC. IFF and DuPont also named executive committee of the future combined company, which will include key DuPont N&B senior leaders. In addition, the company announced two independent DuPont appointees to the Board of Directors for the future combined company. We have made meaningful progress regarding regulatory approval. We cleared the U.S. process in March and have since received the approval in China, Serbia and Colombia. The clearance processes and the remaining required jurisdictions are well underway. Earlier this week, IFF filed its definitive proxy relating to the IFF shareholder approval of the transaction. The IFF shareholder meeting is set to take place on August 27. I remain excited about this combination as the tremendous opportunity for growth and greater innovation as the businesses come together. The teams are energized and all the critical milestones remain on track for first quarter of 2021 closing. Let me wrap up with a few comments on our expectations for the third quarter, while the next several months will likely continue to be challenging due to the pandemic we believe that the second quarter will mark the bottom for us. However, our return to pre pandemic levels will be measured and will certainly vary across our end markets. In markets like automotive and residential construction, we have seen an inflection in demand heading into the third quarter, but believe recovery will be gradual. Additionally markets like oil and gas, aerospace, commercial, construction and other key industrial segments continue to see significant weakness. As a result, the approach of operating many of our sites with a focus on cash generation to better match supply with demand will remain unchanged. We expect third quarter to look very similar to the second quarter with sales slightly up sequentially driven by modest recovery in automotive and residential construction, mostly offset by seasonal patterns in N&B as well as the impact of supply constraints across our Tyvek enterprise as we perform routine maintenance on the assets. It is worth noting that within E&I, semi is holding up stronger than we initially estimated what we remain cautious about the potential of some elevated inventory in the channel. We expect operating EPS in the range of $0.71 to $0.73 of sequential increase from the second quarter driven by the improving top-line. Sequentially lower costs associated with idling facilities will be offset by a slightly weaker mix in S&C due to required downtime in Tyvek and the absence of gains associated with the customer settlement and a discrete tax item recorded in the second quarter. We estimate our year-over-year decremental margins for the third quarter to be in line with the second quarter at around 45% on an as reported basis, again impacted by costs associated with idling facilities as well as the absence of prior year gains in our E&I and Non-Core segments. However, on an underlying basis, we estimate our decremental margins will be approximately 25%, an improvement of more than 500 basis points versus our second quarter underlying decremental margins driven by sustained execution of our structural cost savings. We will continue to stay focused on execution and remain confident that we will emerge from this crisis, an even stronger company. I'll now turn it to Leland to open up for Q&A. Good morning, John. Yes. John, there's multiple lines basically in two locations over in the Luxembourg and Europe and in our Spruance facility in the U.S. So it's more than one line. And we're going to add line eight actually, which we have a CapEx program against for future demand. But a couple of our lines are extremely old lines. We got those up and running at way higher rates than we had been running on that before because of the pandemic and want to make so many more garments, as Lori mentioned. You could see our garment sales were up 60% or so. So we've really been cranking it out a couple of the older lines, and we just need to be doing some maintenance on. And the maintenance is not long, but it takes the lines down for two, three weeks and we're going to rotate through quite a few of those during this quarter and then we'll be hopefully in really good shape as we move over the next year after we do that. And then line eight we delayed some of that CapEx. We had to delay it because Luxembourg, the government actually shut us down during the pandemic and towards the end of the year, will recrank up the CapEx on that program to get that line up and running, and we'll have that up in like 1.5 years from kind of when we started up. So we'll have all that capability as we move forward. No, no. It's just some maintenance. Yes. So John, look, our July sales were similar to the average we kind of were running in the first quarter, but the big difference was that we saw resi orders starting to pick up as we got into the middle of July. We're starting to see auto orders pick up for us as we kind of got into the middle of the month. And so we \u2013 but we sit in the supply chain a little bit later, as Lori mentioned in her remarks. So we're expecting to see the sales impact from that hit more towards the back half of the third quarter and then certainly as we go into the fourth quarter. So are we being a little conservative? Possibly because there are two key end markets for us, but it's just hard to tell exactly how much actually makes it into the quarter. But there's no doubt we're seeing demand lift on the order front in those two segments. And then as Lori had mentioned also, the semi market is holding up. We thought we might see some softness in the third quarter because some build in the channel. We still think there is some. We're a little cautious on that. I know some of our competitors are saying things are running hot also, and we continue to run pretty hot on the semi side. So could we be a little bit conservative possibly. But again, it's hard to tell when things actually hit in the sales number during the quarter. But I think its building momentum back half of third quarter, certainly in the fourth quarter. Thanks, John. Yes. I don't necessarily like talking about specific customers, but I think \u2013 let me just \u2013 I think we're in a very strong position. That is a large customer of ours. So let me just say it that way. And there's clearly, maybe everyone misread the momentum a little bit in this industry, but the work at home, the data center usage, I know a key competitor of ours saw pretty much the same results. So I think it's across-the-board. The industry is growing \u2013 was growing at that rate last quarter, 18%. But we're positioned very well with a couple of the very big players in the industry. So they're seeing nice momentum also as I see they reported their numbers. So if they continue like that, we're going to continue like that. But 18% growth, I just don't see that, Jeff, holding at those kind of rates. I mean, we grow 5%, 6%, 7%. I think that's pretty nice. So I do think there's going to be some, over the second half of the year, here, a little bit of a downdraft from those growth rates, I would think, but still growing nicely. Yes. So there's two things going on. We've got the product \u2013 some key product launches coming up with our customers for the holiday season and their 5G-enabled phones. And we have a lot more content in the 5G phones because we do all the antenna technology. So yes, we definitely have visibility for that. Obviously, smartphone sales year-over-year have been down, but we'll start to get the lift from these new launches and then the lift from the content from \u2013 going into 5G. Lori, you might want to mention kind of the difference between a 5G and a non-5G phone, just to put it in perspective. Thanks, Jeff. Hey, Steve. Yes. It's a great question. So from an R&D standpoint \u2013 and by the way, want to just to use one example. Our biggest location is the experimental station in Delaware where a couple thousand people work there, a lot of our scientists that do just great work, and they are going back into their labs. Very few of them though are using the office space that they have, but they are doing all their lab work. We have set it up where we are actually doing different shifts. So not every employee is in the labs at the same time. So we have an early shift that goes to about noon and then we have a second shift that goes in for the whole afternoon into the evening. And we even have quite a few of our scientists going in during the nighttime into the wee hours of the morning. So we can keep \u2013 limit the number of people in any given lab at one time. But we have many, many, many labs. So that \u2013 they are functioning. They need to be in those facilities to do a lot of their work, and that's occurring. One of the things that I think every CEO is seeing in this environment, though, back to your point about the corporate office and many of our other offices, we've been able to really work very well remotely. And by way, remember, DuPont is going through a massive deal with IFF and N&B and all the integration work and separation and hard financials and tax work and we're right on schedule with it despite most of the people working remotely. So we really \u2013 we've put a team together, and we're really looking at how do we handle our office footprint around the globe going forward. And by the way, I'm a big believer you should be in the office interacting with people. I do think if you do this long term, you'll lose something but I don't think it has to be where you're there every single day and our people are working extremely hard remotely. So we're kind of doing a whole study on can we do kind of sharing of offices and all that and reduce the footprint as we move forward. So we're taking a hard, hard look at that and probably make some decisions before we exit the year. Yes. I think \u2013 look, I think there'll be a resolution settlement. There's basically two plaintiffs that are handling the 100 or so outstanding cases. We've been in conversations, and let me just say, I'm highly confident there'll be a resolution in the not-too-distant future on that. Hey, Scott. Yes, yes, yes. Go ahead, Lori. Yes. No, Scott, I think there definitely is, and by the way, Lori and I have been very focused on that issue. As we Lori and I have been very focused on that issue. As we look out over multiple years, I think we can reduce the CapEx. It just so happened that we hit a period between probiotics, Kapton, Tyvek where we were very constrained on capacity and it just so happens they happen to be three of our most capital intense businesses. So I would just put in we kind of are hitting a hump on the high end for a couple of years. And we \u2013 as we model out over three, four, kind of five years, we can drift that CapEx back down. We're also \u2013 I don't want to get into all the details, all the details, but we're also looking at some outsourcing of some of the earlier chain stuff in our portfolio that I don't feel we have to do and we can outsource that to somebody else, and we're studying that hard, too. There's a couple of areas we know we can do that in and that will reduce the CapEx on our that will reduce the CapEx on our end also. So it's a big focus of ours to get that number back down around D&A on a consistent basis. But it's a great question. We understand the importance of that. Thank you. Yes. And just by the way on the combo, look a couple of key principles. We're going to have pretty massive R&D capability in the combined company. So we're not doing any cutting there, most of our synergy work as it is at DuPont is really going to be on the G&A side. So we're going to have really nice scale to be launching consistently new products into the markets. We've had great feedback from customers on our ability to do a lot of application development work with them with the extensive portfolio we're going to have. So I feel very bullish on that. And as you can see, generally as an industry, it just holds up very, very well. I think Lori mentioned this in her prepared remarks, 85% of the portfolio, which is really food and beverage centric grew organically 5% in the quarter and the piece that dragged it down to a 1% in aggregate was really industrial end markets that we play in. So we'll have to look at that as we move forward, but it's just a consistent industry. I would also point out, I think I said this on the last earnings call, the multiple that IFF trade that, and by the way, the IFF value or the N&B values basically still about where we announced the deal at, which is $26 billion of value for a DuPont shareholder and IFF multiple still sits 400 basis points to 500 basis points below the top, what I'd call the top few players in the industry. So I think we, as a combo, we prove success rolling out the new company. There's great margin expansion capability, just with the IFF share price and clearly the number one position that we're going to have. Again, we got to come out elegantly and integrate the company well, but that opportunity is there. And in this case, I truly believe we have the revenue synergies we've talked about with what we can offer to a customer. One of the areas \u2013 probably it's still a small business, but one of the areas really growing for us right now is the meatless meat market business. And I think we had a chart out when we announced the deal. IFF has four or five products that sell into that industry. DuPont has four or five products that sell into that industry. So our ability to innovate, just use that as one example, innovate in that industry as it moves forward is just way more significant than anybody else. So I think it's going to be a really awesome company, when we get it to \u2013 get going on it and hope February 1 is our date to consummate the merger next year. Again as \u2013 and as I think Lori said the vote \u2013 the shareholder vote is on August 27, so another month from now and that'll be done. It should be yes. And my gut is talking to our customers that you'll see more announcements like that. Yep, thanks. Good morning, Jonas. Not \u2013 Jonas, not significantly, but remember one of the things we've been working on and I'm really glad we got our sustainability report out. If you want to take a look at that now, it's online, is that a lot of our products in areas we're working on from an R&D standpoint really goes towards the UN sustainability goals. So I think we're secularly where we're \u2013 our scientists are working, where we're developing products for, I think, is in the sweet spot of a lot of things that are changing in the world. So from that standpoint, yes, we put a lot of effort into that over the last few years, so we're kind of redirect our thinking towards that area. And so I think secularly, I feel good about where we're investing our money. So I wouldn't say the pandemic changed anything. It's kind of been something we've been working on the last few years. And I think that's going to play out well for us. And it's why we think in normal times we can outgrow GDP because of the areas we're going to be focused on. Yes. Yes, it is. And by the way, we \u2013 that's a business and by the way that goes to our sustainability goal. That's one of the key ones is global clean water. That business, as you saw, is growing very nicely. And we would love to add to that portfolio, both R&D capability, which we're adding people, application development people we're adding in that business. And if we could do any more bolt-on acquisitions, we would be thrilled to do it in that space. And by the way it was strong across the home application, desalination and industrial wastewater, every one of those segments is doing very well. Thanks, Jonas. No, I would think that that would be done. It's not \u2013 I don't think it's overly significant. But, as Lori mentioned in her remarks, our sales in T&I were kind of less than half of the downturn of autos. So, we're concerned just there's a little bit, but we also, as we said, we lag in the supply chain a little bit. So I would think by the time we're going into the end of the third quarter into the fourth quarter, we're totally fine. Thanks, David. Yes, I'd also mention \u2013 or Lori, you might want to give a number around this, but one of the things going into the pandemic, I was personally very worried about was just past due balances and we have had massive improvement on pass through, which I kind of find interesting in this environment because I wouldn't have thought that, but Lori \u2013 the teams around the world, we put a big, big focus on that as I thought it could become a little bit more of an issue and we've actually made great progress. Yes, John, it's been one of my more frustrating ones. We have interested parties in every one of the assets. We're in negotiations on everyone and it's just slower in this environment doing due diligence people visiting sites, doing the environmental studies. So, hopefully, we'll make some progress here in the back half of the year on that, but we're totally focused on getting that done. I just don't want to put a date on them. I thought we'd have a couple done by this phone call and hopefully we get them across the finish line, but we definitely have parties that we've been talking to. Mostly strategic... Mostly strategic players, which is a good sign, I think. Yep, thanks. Well, I can't say yet. We'll make that decision as we get later into the fall. I mean, I've always just done a spin-off, but I don't want to put a leaning on it right now, just depends what the numbers look like when we get there. But look, I think, the good news overall, John, I mean the shareholder vote is happening in a month, the deal is definitely happening. I know earlier in the year, people were curious, is this thing going to stick and all that with everything going on. So the deal is in great shape from that standpoint. And again, we'll see where we're trading at what's going on at the time and we'll make a decision then, and you just can't make it right now because you don't know the facts. Thanks, John. I think we're going to take one more question. Yes, PJ it's a great question. I think we'll probably assess it again in the kind of early fall. Take a look at it. Remember, we're going to get over $2 billion of excess cash from the IFF deal at the beginning or kind of going into 2021. So we know we have that coming back to the prior question, hopefully we have some decent cash coming in from the non-core asset sales, so that will be excess cash and of course in our own just operations generating cash. So, I really love our position going into 2021 because we're going to have cash available from a multiple angles and no debt payments until November of 2023. So we're going to have a lot of flexibility. And so, I think, we'll be reassessing that as I said in the early fall and make a call on that. If I look at the new DuPont ex N&B and I look at where the multiple of the companies out, which is give or take eight times. I can't imagine at some point here, we're not going to be doing some share repurchase. Hopefully, we're not trading around eight times moving forward, but ex not worried about the pandemic, I'd be buying shares back right now. So I again will assess it again in the fall knowing where we're going to be sitting from a balance sheet, a very strong cash position. Yes, let me just answer that. No, I don't feel any different about T&I. By the way it's a great \u2013 auto is a great industry to be in and just. It's just \u2013 hey, the pandemic took it down, but remember, I think Lori covered this well. The charge we had to take was because we had to step up the assets so significantly in the DowDuPont merger that there just was no wiggle room there. So it's a non-cash charge. If we \u2013 any weakness we would see we were kind of on the teetering edge because of what we had to do when we did the merger and step up. So no, I don't feel any different about it. And look, we're starting to see the rebound in auto come back here and I think 2021 will be a decent year for auto, not back to $90 million auto builds, but it's going to lift up rather nicely here. So I feel good about that. And look, as I said, we're all hands on deck operationally right now. We're not looking at something big structural right now. There's too many moving pieces with \u2013 in all the industries. And it's just not on our plate at this point in time. We want to get the N&B deal done, keep it on schedule which we are, and \u2013 but we always have that flexibility in the future, if there's a great opportunity for our shareholders. Thanks PJ."

        "content": "Operator: Good day and welcome to the DuPont First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.  At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Leland Weaver. Please go ahead.\nLeland Weaver: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for DuPont's first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. We are making this call available to investors and media via webcast. We have prepared slides to supplement our comments during this conference call. These slides are posted on the Investor Relations section of DuPont\u2019s website and through the link to our webcast. Joining me today on the call are Ed Breen, Chief Executive Officer; and Lori Koch, our Chief Financial Officer. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the slide. During our call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Our 2019 Form 10-K as updated by our current and periodic reports includes detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today exclude significant items. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures; a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in our press release. I'll now turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Breen: Thanks, Leland, and good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. This is obviously an unprecedented time, and I hope you're all safe and well. Today we will walk through the disciplined plan we are executing as we navigate the current environment, including our overall approach to protecting the health and safety of our employees and maintaining our supply chains and operations. We will also detail a number of actions we quickly implemented to strengthen our liquidity, protect our balance sheet and generate cash. Because of these swift actions, we are on solid footings and are well prepared to handle the uncertain times ahead. We will also provide comments on the first quarter results, overall market dynamics in April, as well as our current assumptions for the next few months. Since the outset of this pandemic, our priorities have been clear; beginning with the safety and well being of our employees. We have taken aggressive steps to protect our employees, are restricting access to our sites, implementing enhanced cleaning protocols, performing contact tracing among our employees, administering quarantines where needed and implementing work-from-home protocols where possible. I want to acknowledge the tremendous efforts across our organization in overcoming the challenges created by the pandemic. The determination of our employees from across the globe to maintain business continuity has enabled us to continue to be a reliable supplier for our customers, and a vast majority of our plant sites have been deemed essential in their local jurisdictions, and have continued to operate. As a result many of our manufacturing and other necessary personnel deserve particular recognition. Their extraordinary dedication in this incredibly challenging environment has enabled us to keep our sites and supply chains operating; our second priority for managing in these difficult times.  In fact, we have been successful in maintaining our operating base during the global pandemic with only a handful of our manufacturing locations shut down by local restrictions over the past few months; and currently, operations are restricted at only two of our 170 manufacturing sites. We have begun longer term planning for an eventual return to the work for non-manufacturing employees, which will be done in accordance with all relevant government requirements, and continued emphasis on health, safety and the overall well-being of our employees, customers and communities.  Our third area of focus has been bolstering our already strong balance sheet by enhancing our liquidity position and implementing plans to generate and preserve cash. We will provide more detail on these actions in a moment. Lastly, we continue to do our part to help combat this pandemic. We have donated over 140,000 Tyvek garments, and thousands of gallons of hand sanitizer to healthcare and other frontline workers. We have also used our 3D printing capabilities to make face shield for local hospitals that were experiencing shortages and partner with Cummins to use DuPont filtration technology to help augment the supply of N95 respirator masks. We have also announced a number of initiatives to increase the supply of protective garments by more than 15 million per month since the start of the pandemic, including the increased production of Tyvek garments by more than 9 million per month primarily by shifting production away from non-healthcare markets. And launching the TyvekTogether campaign, which enable the production of 5 million to 6 million additional garments per month for the rapid development of a safe, easy to use version of Tyvek and by empowering others to join DuPont in protecting frontline responders with free access to our designs and usage instructions.  These are unprecedented times, and I am personally engaged in the day-to-day work to respond quickly to the changing environment. We take our designation as an essential business very seriously, and are committed to doing all we can to support our employees, our customers, our partners, our shareholders, and the communities in which we operate. Slide 3 details the series of actions we have been operating against since the pandemic spiked in mid-March. The senior leadership team and I are on top of these items daily to ensure we remain well positioned. We have analyzed a number of stress case scenarios and are confident we are making the right decisions to ensure we are favorably positioned to weather an unlikely steep and prolonged downturn, while also being equipped to return to growth when the market recovers. Our playbook for this environment is straightforward: Improve cash generation through working capital improvements and deferral of certain capital expenditures, strengthen our liquidity position and optimize the cost structure of the company. We will provide more color on how we are driving success in each of these areas. Our scenario planning was broad and simulated severe downturn cases to ensure we can protect the company. We're also staying keenly focused on the downside risk in automotive, aerospace, oil and gas, and other industrial markets.  With nearly 15% of our sales connected to the automotive industry, this is the largest area of exposure for us, particularly within our Transportation & Industrial segment. The numbers are unprecedented with global auto builds down 24% in the first quarter, and the latest estimate suggests the global auto builds will be down more than 40% in the second quarter. In light of this, we developed a plan in the first quarter to begin slowing and idling certain facilities in our network, primarily factories in our Transportation & Industrial segment in order to align our supply with market demand. Taking these actions will provide significant working capital improvement through inventory reductions over the course of the year that will translate into near term earnings headwinds, as fixed costs that would otherwise be absorbed in inventory will now flow directly to earnings. For T&I a very weak top-line driven by the expected decline in auto builds, as well as year-over-year price declines, coupled with the charges associated with plant shutdowns is expected to result in decremental margin in T&I of approximately 55% to 65% in the second quarter. These are not easy decisions, but the confidence to react quickly and decisively is critical, and we will continue this mindset as we move forward. Let me turn it over to Lori for additional color on the other actions we have taken, as well as a few comments on the first quarter.\nLori Koch : Thanks, Ed. Slide 4 highlights our strong liquidity position. We have always valued a strong balance sheet and that mindset led our actions as the severity of the downturn came into focus in mid-March. We saw the certainty of access of liquidity, as well as a firm plan for refinancing our November 2020 bond maturities by simply putting the wheels in motion to obtain bank financing as commercial paper and credit markets were initially constrained.  In short order we were able to secure a new $1 billion 364 day revolving credit facility, which replaced the $750 million facility that was set to expire in June. While we expect it to remain untapped, extending and enlarging this facility provides greater certainty to meet our general business needs. We also obtained a $2 billion delayed-draw term loan to ensure we had a path to pay off the November maturity, and have since replaced the bank commitment with a short dated bond, which I will discuss on the next slide. With these new credit facilities in place, and our strong cash position, we feel very comfortable with our liquidity. We also have opportunities ahead of us for further cash generation through working capital improvements and proceeds from divestitures. We have identified working capital as a key area for improvement and expect to deliver more than $500 million of working capital improvement in the year and we are off to a nice start in the first quarter by reducing our use of cash by $300 million versus the prior year. Each of our businesses have a series of targeted focus areas to deliver our working capital improvement, including inventory reductions through initiatives such as SKU rationalization and shifting from make to stock model to a make to order model in certain businesses. Within accounts receivables, our teams have increased their focus on pass-through accounts and across both accounts receivable and accounts payable we continue to optimize terms with our customers and vendors. In the quarter, we closed the sale of our Compound Semiconductor Solutions business generating over $400 million in gross proceeds. We are also taking a prudent action to pull back on certain CapEx reducing our spend by about $500 million versus the prior year. We elected in mid to late-March to price share buybacks after we had repurchased approximately 230 million in the quarter. While shareholder remuneration remains a critical component of our financial solvency, this was a tactical action at the time in order to conserve cash.  Lastly, our Board recently approved the second quarter dividend of $0.30 a share. We remain committed to our dividends and are confident that we will be able to maintain it through these challenging times.  Moving to Slide 5, as I mentioned, just last week, we launched a successful $2 billion bond offering, which has replaced the delayed-draw bank facility we previously secured. The proceeds of this three year bond offering will be used to satisfy the debt maturities that become due in November of this year. The newly issued bonds have a stated maturity 2023, but includes a provision that accelerates the maturity when we close the IFF transaction. With the receipt of a several cash payment from the N&B and IFF deal, we remain committed to paying down our debt by $5 billion. With this deleveraging payment, we will have no long-term debt maturities until the end of 2023.  Getting bonds in place to pay off the November maturities will be net neutral to our debt position as of the end of the year and significantly improves our liquidity position. We have amendable debt load and we are in a position to maintain a strong balance sheet both now and post the N&B/IFF transaction. We continue to hold strong investment grade ratings from each of the leading rating agencies and intend to maintain the balanced financial policy that has positioned us well. Turning to Slide 6, we remain committed to delivering our structural cost savings targets. In March, we indicated that we would be doubling the incremental cost actions that we plan to deliver in 2020 from approximately $90 million to $180 million. We are not impacting the long-term growth of the company through the actions we are planning. It is important to note that the bulk of the savings we have identified are targeted at reducing functional G&A costs, thus maintaining our investment in sales and R&D. We plan to maintain a competitive level of R&D spend of approximately $900 million in 2020, which will help to ensure that we are well positioned for growth once market recovers. These cost reductions will enable us to achieve our best-in-class functional cost structure.  In addition to the structural cost savings, we took a number of actions to control cost increases, including the decision to forego merit increases for 2020 and implementing a hiring freeze. We're also seeing reductions in cost especially with capital projects as we pull back on our capital and lower spending across the company. These actions were implemented quickly and we are seeing the benefits. Before turning it to Ed, I will comment on the first quarter results on Slide 7. Our teams executed well to deliver a solid quarter above our expectations in each of our core segments. We delivered net sales of $5.2 billion, down 4% in total and down 2% organically with price flat and volume down 2%. We saw strong demand across a number of key end markets including protective garments, water filtration, electronics and probiotics.  Gross margin improved more than 150 basis points on a year-over-year basis on favorable mix and the benefits from our productivity actions. Operating EBITDA was $1.3 billion down 8% from a year ago period driven primarily by the absence of $75 million of discrete gains in S&C and E&I, as well as lower volume and price in T&I. Adjusted EPS of $0.84 per share was down 9%.  Turning to Slide 8 for more detail on the segments. The solid first quarter results in our Nutrition & Bioscience business are clear in the numbers. Solid top-line growth and robust operating leverage led to an operating EBITDA margin improvement of more than 200 basis points. The operating leverage in N&B was primarily driven by the recovery of the probiotics business which delivered a margin above the segment average. Probiotics had its strongest quarter ever as key initiatives to strengthen the North America market were implemented and consumer demand for immune health strengthened globally. N&B also saw increasing demand in food and beverage, home & personal care and animal nutrition markets, a trend we continue to see in April. Likewise 8% organic top-line growth in our E&I segment was a solid result. Strength in the quarter was led by double-digit growth in Interconnect Solutions, driven by higher material content in premium, next generation smartphones, and high single-digit growth in Semiconductor Technologies, where new technology ramps within logic and foundry coupled with robust demand for memory in servers and data centers.  These areas of strength were more than offset by the absence of a $50 million prior year gain resulting in operating EBIT decline of 12%. The results of our T&I business were generally as we had anticipated with a very difficult environment for both price and volume.  As Ed mentioned, we expect further challenges looking forward as the auto industry slows dramatically as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We delivered net sales of $1.1 billion, which included a volume decline of 8% and a price decline of 4%. We anticipate a similar year-over-year pricing trend in the second quarter.  Within S&C demand for protective garments was robust leading to a 65% increase in garment sales versus last year. Our Tyvek team is working tirelessly to get our protective garments in the hands of healthcare and other frontline workers, including in many instances, donations of these garments.  We are working closely with our channel partners to increase the speed and availability of personal protective equipment and we are taking great efforts to prohibit opportunistic pricing of these vital supplies.  Despite the strength of protective garments, sales in the Safety Solutions business declined mid-single-digits, as demand weakened across industrial, aerospace and defense markets as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and challenges in the oil and gas industry. Similarly, Shelter Solutions sales declined low single-digits as construction activity was impacted by stay-at-home orders issued across the globe. Demand continued to be strong in Water Solutions which drove mid single-digit organic growth in the quarter. S&C operating EBITDA margin of 28.8% was the highest it has been in several quarters driven by the continued focus on price improvement, cost actions and productivity. Versus first quarter of 2019, operating EBIT was down due to the absence of a $26 million gain, which was recognized in the prior year.  Turning to the adjusted EPS bridge on Slide 9, you'll see that our adjusted EPS declined 9% to $0.84 per share for the first quarter. Organic top-line growth in our E&I and N&B segments as well as further execution of our cost savings and productivity actions was not able to offset the $0.06 headwind we saw from nylon pricing pressure in our T&I segment, as well as the absence of prior gains in our E&I, S&C segments, which reduced adjusted EPS by $0.08. Below the lines, we saw a 500 basis point increase to our base tax rate driven by discrete items in the first quarter. We expect our full year base tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 23%, driven by the first quarter discrete items.  With that, I'll turn it back to Ed.\nEd Breen: Thanks, Lori. Slide 10 shows the progress we have made since announcing the N&B and IFF transaction last year. I remain very excited to bring these two businesses together to create a global leader. Since the announcement of the transaction in mid-December, teams have been hard at work. As I told you in January, the executive steering team and leaders for key work streams including separation and integration, our financials, IT separation and stand up, legal entity work and talent selection are in place, and things are progressing as planned.  In fact, as of March, we have received antitrust clearance here in the U.S. and our draft EU filing was submitted on April 20th. And we are now working with the European Commission to formally notify the transaction and opinion by trust clearance. We will file our initial registration statement with the SEC in the coming days. Also, the new leadership team will be announced later this month and IFF intends to hold a shareholder vote in September.  In summary, the teams are energized and all the critical milestones remain on track for a Q1 2021 closing. Let me wrap up a few comments on what we saw in April, as well as our expectations for the second quarter. We are seeing robust demand continuing within several key end markets such as water filtration, food & beverage, probiotics, electronics and protective garments. There\u2019s some increased demand in these markets as a result of pandemic, but these businesses are market leaders in their space, and there is undoubtedly underlying growth driving these results as well. However, as we have highlighted, these areas of strength are expected to be more than offset by the well-known softness in automotive, aerospace, oil and gas, and other industrial markets. In April, our sales were down low to mid-teens percent versus last year. Earlier I mentioned the actions we\u2019re taking to run our T&I business for cash through this period of significant demand weakness. These actions will result in near-term earnings headwinds as fixed costs otherwise would have run through inventory, will flow directly to earnings. Likewise, actions to pull back up production will lead to lower utilization in several industrial businesses within S&C segment. All in, we expect our second quarter decremental margins to be in a range of 45% to 55% on lower volume, nylon pricing pressure, lower utilization, and costs associated with idling facilities. Excluding our decision idle facilities our decremental margins would be in a range of 35% to 40%.  While it is still impossible to predict timing, our markets will eventually stabilize and return to growth, and we will be well positioned for the recovery. In the interim, we will continue to prioritize the safety and health of our employees, safely maintain our operations, strengthen our balance sheet, and partner with other industry leaders to combat this pandemic. I'll now turn it over to Leland to open up for Q&A.\nLeland Weaver: Thanks, Ed. Before we move to the Q&A portion of our call, I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. We will allow for one question per person. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan.\nSteve Tusa: A lot of companies are calling out like gargantuan temporary cost savings. 3M talked about $350 million, $400 million or something in the second quarter alone. Honeywell talked about like $1 billion. I see kind of the structural cost which is positive obviously, because that kind of carries forward. Can you maybe frame anything that may be temporary that can kind of defend the margins in the near-term? \nEd Breen: Yes, Steve, thanks for the question. And obviously, we spent a lot of time on this topic. So, as you know, we upped our structural cost savings in the last month or so from $90 million to $180 million. In addition to that, remember that we have another $165 million that is a structural change to the cost of the business. That's coming out from the DowDuPont merger and putting those businesses together. So in total, we have about 330 million give or take coming out of the system permanently.  On top of that, we have about another $80 million to $100 million of what I would call opportunities that are T&E reduction, external contractor spend at our facilities. And we've eliminated the merit increases, we\u2019ve freezed hiring. So things that were in our plans, there's about another give or take $80 million to $100 million that won't get spent that was baked into the plan. So, when you kind of sit back and look at it, we have benchmarked every function in the company, every business in the company and we are getting the G&A expenditures to best-in-class benchmarking with the best companies out there. Remember that four years ago, when I arrived, we took about $1 billion of structural costs out of DuPont and during the DowDuPont merger we took another $1 billion of structural costs out of the business on top of what we're now presently doing. So, I think if you look at it, we're going to benchmark very, very well through this. And again, I wanted to really attack the structural flaws, so that they're permanent in the business.  Another point, though, that I would make, we did not touch the growth programs in the company. We left all of our sales organizations totally intact and we left all of our R&D spend, which is 4% of sales $900 million totally intact. And by the way, I think we're running our R&D machine very, very well. We\u2019ve benchmarked every single program, what's the return going to be on the program, are we spending what we said, is the timing the timing we said it would be? So we're going to come out of the downturn I think in a very strong position. We're still cranking out a lot of new products through this. So I think we\u2019ve balanced this thing very well.\nOperator: Next question will come from Scott Davis with Melius Research.\nScott Davis : I was encouraged by that [comment] [ph] on April down low-teens. And I guess my question, I was hoping you could give us some granularity on perhaps by segment on what those numbers were. Because does sound like a pretty good result versus what we're hearing from others so far, at least?\nLori Koch: Thanks, Scott. So, as we mentioned on the call, April was down kind of low to mid-teens. It was a similar result that we saw in Q1 kind of carry into April. So we saw continued strength in E&I, continued strength in N&B. The strength in E&I is primarily coming again from semiconductors as we see increased usage in the data and server space. T&I and S&C were down more than what they were down in Q1, in line with what you would expect with what's going on in automotive. Automotive right now, we expect it to be down about 45% in Q2, versus down 25% in Q1. And S&C continued strength in Tyvek within the garment space, as the garments alone, which are about a third, historically at Tyvek they've kind of come up now to almost half of Tyvek. We're up about 65% in the quarter. So really nice shrink there. And we've announced some capacity expansion to enable that to continue to grow into Q2. But the headwinds that we're seeing in aerospace and oil and gas are more than offsetting that as well as construction with all the stay-at-home orders. So net-net, April down. As we\u2019d mentioned about low to mid-teens with very similar end market results that we saw in Q1.\nOperator: Next question will come from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.\nVincent Andrews: Maybe just a follow up on the Transportation & Industrials. You said builds were down 24% 1Q, but your volume is only down 8%. Was that sort of trade loading of some sort, does that have to reverse in the second quarter such that your auto performance would actually be much worse than that 40% that you're seeing in -- decline in global auto builds?\nLori Koch: So I think, so underneath the 12% down, 8% volume that we've recorded in T&I. So there was strength that we saw in the Healthcare segment that offset some of the weakness that we saw in Mobility Solutions. So mobility would have been down more than the results that we reported for the quarter.  Having said that, we continue to expect to see our performance outpacing auto builds just driven by the content per vehicle, so we've given a number in the past of about 1.5 times that we would look to exceed auto build just driven by the material content that we have as we see branch towards light-weighting as well as electric vehicle. So that's kind of what led to our results to outpace. There is a little bit of a time lag between when you see auto builds decline and when you see back to chain where we primarily sell into with our polymers. So we did see a little bit of acceleration in Q1 as people were loading their supply chains in advance of the downturn. So I think our results in 2Q will more mirror what you're seeing from an end market perspective.\nEd Breen: And just add on to that, just to make it clear, this is a business in T&I that we are truly running for cash performance in this period of time. So, we purposely are hurting our earnings by $90 million to $100 million if we kept running the facilities as they do, for instance, in the semiconductor industry, our earnings would literally be $90 million to $100 million better. But we're going to draw down the supply chain here and generate $200 million to $250 million of cash performance in the company. So, we will be temporarily shutting down about 50% of our polymer capacity in the business and I think it's the right decision, a smart decision to do that. And we'll come out of it stronger and have a better uptick when things return a little bit more to normal.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.\nSteve Byrne: I appreciate the near-term focus on these urgent issues like coronavirus. I just wondered if that impacted any progress you made on your PFAS liabilities. Didn't hear much about that and just want to know whether or not you could give us an update on that. The arbitration with Chemours, the litigation of the Ohio MDL and any movement towards getting a little more collaborative on this front?\nEd Breen: Yes. Thanks for the question, Steve. So on the PFOA front, as you know we had two trials of the case, the small amount of case is remaining. My personal opinion is there will be a settlement there. We'll get those cases in Ohio behind us. And I'm highly confident that will occur. As you know, Chemours, the judge ruled in our favor that this will go to arbitration. Chemours did appeal that to the court. But the law is so heavily on our side on this issue that arbitration will occur here.  As I said before, I like the arbitration process just because it's a quicker process than going through the court system. So, we feel very, very good about that. But again, my opinion is, there probably will be a settlement with Chemours that will carve here at some point in time. We'll renegotiate the agreement we have between the companies. There are some very key guideposts in any agreement that we would come up with that are important to us. It will not be -- we will not do an uncapped deal. And it would be a deal that would play out over multiple, multiple years, because I don't see any liabilities on PFOA that are significant at any point in time. But there will be liabilities that will play out over multiple years as we do remediation of piece of certain sites and all that. And then one other point I would just make, remember that I think a lot of the hoopla around PFOA with us, and I certainly acknowledge this, that it's a little bit of a cloud over us, is that we are being named in fair amount of the firefighting foam cases. But it's very important than I know, Steve, you've written extensively about this. We never made firefighting foam. We had one surfactant that was used for 10 years out of a 70 year period. So I think we're a very, very minor player if at all in firefighting foam, and I think the biggest issue for DuPont is to get out of those cases and be able to wrap that up, I think is the biggest thing, because the rest of the PFOA is very limited for manufacturing sites where we used it in the process in the manufacturing. So, again, that will play out over the next year or so. But on the other two items, the Ohio one, the Chemours one, I think you'll see some action there in the coming months.\nOperator: Next question will come from John Inch with Gordon Haskett.\nJohn Inch : You have a prominent -- I'll just say a prominent reputation as a deal guy. However, I think folks often forget you kind of cut your teeth on operations at Motorola. Have you and Lori gone about coming up with more than double the cost saves versus prior management in only a few short weeks than months? And often companies that start down more of a heavy lifting restructuring path, I think financial services, lots of different sectors, actually find there's more and more that they could do without sacrificing core ops or productivity or the quality or whatever. Are you guys finding similar opportunities as you go through the processes or is it still kind of a little bit too early to make that judgment call?\nEd Breen: Thanks for the question, John, and Lori jump-in in a minute also if you would like. And thank you for saying about working on cost and operations. That's actually what I like to do the most, even though maybe reputationally it's different than that. I love running the businesses. So I mean I'm a big believer in benchmarking. I'm a big believer in keeping G&A costs really lean and mean. By the way, I've talked to many CEOs during the COVID-19 here, and I actually think we're finding additional ways to potentially structurally save costs in the company. I'm pretty impressed at how efficient we're running the company in the stay-at-home policy for most of our non-manufacturing employees. So I think there's some lessons we're going to learn there on our real estate footprint as we move forward. But we always intended to take out more costs. And remember when N&B leaves the portfolio, it's important that we reduce our G&A cost structure in the company so that we're still best in class when that revenue and EBITDA leaves the company. So what we've done is we've really benchmarked very significantly around what are we going to look like post the N&B transaction.  One of the other things we're doing on the -- which will probably translate into better costs is we're really going through the company and looking at every single SKU in the company and really looking at a rationalization there. I've done this in every other company I've run and there's always a very significant opportunity. We've already completed it in our water business. And we've taken the margins up 1,000 basis points in the water business and a big part of that was the rationalization of SKUs through the business. So that's the kind of the path that Lori and I are on right now in the company. And I think we'll continue to get opportunities from that. Lori you want to comment?\nLori Koch: Yes, I think, our next area of focus is obviously around a lot of COGS over the last few years. So we're looking and shifting the focus towards COGS. So there are definitely areas of opportunities in COGS, we will spend about $13 billion, $14 billion there. There's opportunities to increase our reliability, increase our uptime, increase our yield. So that's definitely an excellent area of focus for us that will help us to continue to expand margins.\nOperator: Next question will come from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.\nJeff Sprague: Just kind of thinking about the trajectory of this thing. Obviously, a lot of your businesses are fairly short cycle. So it's unclear how much visibility you have. But do you see April being the low watermark in terms of kind of sales declines or are we looking at kind of the possibility that auto stays week and some of the pockets of strength like electronics maybe soften up a bit? And maybe as part of that answer Ed, you made a comment about planning for kind of unlikely steep and prolonged downturn. Obviously, none of us have a crystal ball here, but would appreciate your perspective on really what you think this does look like and kind of the path back up and out of this current drawdown?\nEd Breen: Yeah, let me hit the high level scenario planning we did first Jeff and I appreciate the question. And by the way, I was the CEO through the '08, '09. And Jeff, you know this, I took over Tyco in 2002 on the brink of bankruptcy. So, I've done a lot of scenario planning in the past. And never thought I'd have to do it again. But we actually did two cases for ourselves and for our Board that we presented to the Board of Directors. And by the way, I don't plan on this happening at all. But it was truly just scenario planning. We did a scenario, where what if revenue was down 30% for at least one year, we did 20% down on volume, 10% down on price which we're -- practically the world would coming to an end, but we did it anyway, just to say, \u201cHey, here's how the P&L would look, here's how our cash position would look.\u201d And by the way, we would be fine through a period like that. We did another scenario, and I don't even want to say this one yet, but it was even worse than the 30% one. Let me just say it that way that we also presented to the Board.  And I'm just a big believer in, don't be na\u00efve here, if things are tough for a longer period, how do you run the company through and make sure the company is healthy. So I feel very, very comfortable with where we sit and where we put the liquidity of the company through this scenario. And by the way, when the N&B/IFF deal happens, we get $7.3 billion of cash. And as Lori mentioned in her prepared remarks, we're going to use $5 billion of that to pay down debt. So we'll be in a normal operating environment. Our debt profile will actually be better than it is in current DuPont. And remember, we still have $2.3 billion of excess cash left over from that $7.3 billion of that will have available to us. So we're going to be in just a phenomenal position from that standpoint. Lori, would you like to comment a little more detail?\nLori Koch: Yes. So I think, to your question on the second quarter, so we do at this point or we see the second quarter as the lowest through the year. So, as I mentioned the sales in April were down low to mid-teens. We have a hard time seeing total Q2 sales being worse than down mid-teens. So as we see it now, Q2 should be a low point. \nEd Breen: Yes. I think also, you mentioned the E&I business. I could see the semi business obviously downturn a little bit going maybe into the third quarter. It's been running very robust in the first quarter. It is running robust in the second quarter but all indicators are that, that will turn down a little bit. So I could see that happening. But as Lori just said, I think mid-teens down revenue is probably the bottom, but what we're seeing based on what we know, as of today.\nOperator: And your next question will come from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.\nDavid Begleiter: Lori, just on the CapEx reductions. What types of projects -- I assume growth projects were being cut back, so these are temporary deferrals? Are you running close to maintenance levels at these current CapEx guidance targets? Thank you.\nEd Breen: Yes. So high level, David -- thank you for the question. So last year, we spent $1.5 billion on CapEx and we planned on spending $1.3 billion this year. And remember, we're higher than our D&A, because we had three or four key growth projects, all hitting at the same time that we feel really good about. So that's the reason for the $1.5 billion last year and even higher this year, or high for us $1.3 billion this year. We have reduced that to $1 billion. So $1.5 billion last year, down to $1 billion this year. By the way everything that we've delayed is simply a delay, we're not canceling it because we want to turn these back up when appropriate. But the two of the bigger ones that we cut back on was Tyvek line 8, which is our biggest CapEx program by far, it's over $400 million. And we spent a fair amount on that last year. That will come online in a couple of years. That is a big, big project for us. And the demand on Tyvek, even at [Storm] because of medical supplies and all that, is very important to us.  So anyway, that was one. We cut back on our cap-on expansion just temporarily. That was another one and some of our maintenance CapEx we slowed down just a little bit also. So that's what gets us down to the $1 billion. One thing we did not touch at all and I certainly would never do this is any of our safety programs that we're spending CapEx on in our facilities. We've maintained at 100% of the spend level. And then another area I would say is the other big one -- besides slowing down a couple of the growth projects was some of our ERP software programs, we also slowed those down. They're nice to have from an efficiency standpoint, but we\u2019re six months later on, and it's not the end of the world. So that's kind of the big buckets on what we did. And as we see things pick up obviously, we'll go right back to spending against those growth programs.\nLori Koch: Yes, if I can just quickly comment on the Tyvek line 8 that we had to pause due to some regulations in Luxembourg where the construction is taking place. We did mention in our prepared remarks, so just to reiterate, that we were able to put in place an incremental capacity expansion to be able to meet the current Tyvek demand. So we not only added, in the first quarter alone we usually had about 15 million garments, we went up to 25 million garments and that was through a combination of incremental capacity, now in our current asset as well as pulling products for non-healthcare markets.  In the second quarter, we announced our TyvekTogether campaign, which will allow us to add another 5 million to 6 million garments. So we've got new capacity coming online even though we delayed the start up of the new line because of the regulations going on in Luxembourg.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. \nJonas Oxgaard: I was wondering about your cash use, your buybacks. At what point would you feel comfortable assuming the buybacks again? I'm not really asking for a specific week, but like how are you thinking about it?\nEd Breen: Yes, I certainly haven't thought about it in a week yet. So we did about $230 million of buyback in the first quarter of 6.1 million shares and I guess the way stocks come back we bought them back at a pretty nice price. So I obviously feel good about that. And as we said, we suspended it, we have not cancelled it. If things are picking up through the second half of the year, we'll certainly look at the share buyback again. As I\u2019ve said a few minutes ago, the balance sheet is in great shape. We're going to get the cash from the IFF/N&B transaction. So, we know that's coming at the beginning of next year. So we'll be in a strong position to reassess that with the Board. So it's really just to spend for the time being, make sure things don't get worse here. And as Lori said, I think hopefully the second quarter is the low quarter, maybe for us obviously into the third quarter, but pick up from there and then we have that money coming from the deal.  Probably I'd also just mention on the N&B and IFF front. As we said in our prepared remarks, we are in great shape on -- I talk to Andreas the CEO of IFF every single week. The teams are right on track with everything we need to do. We did get U.S. antitrust approval. We're in the process with the EU now and as you know, on this deal, there really is no antitrust issues. So all the teams are right on schedule, which is pretty amazing considering there\u2019s a lot of work-at-home policy going on right now at both of the companies. So we will definitely progress on the schedule. We're on for February 1 close. And we're going to have the shareholder vote in September. And I feel great right about that and we also have a shareholder that owns give or take 23%, 24% of the shares voting in favor of the deal. So, just in great shape.\nOperator: The next question will come from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn McNulty: So with some of the economies actually starting to open up a little bit. I guess, can you speak to whether you're seeing any incremental demand pull? And I guess two, that you spoke earlier in the call as to maybe there\u2019s a little bit of inventory to kind of work through whether it was yours or your customers in the auto side. Can you speak to kind of a broader -- the broader situation with regard to inventories and what you're seeing in the channels and how long it may take to actually work through that? \nEd Breen: I'll let Lori answer the second part of that. Let me just touch on the first part of your question, John. And give you a kind of one data point. The China economy is coming back first. And by the way, it was interesting within three weeks of being able to come back in China, all of our production facilities were up and running after the New Year. It's very impressive by the way including one in Wuhan that we have. So we're pretty much back to -- not quite full capacity. But near close to it with our 13 production facilities in China. But let me give you a data point. In the first quarter in China, our sales were down organically 1%, which actually surprised me that it was back good, considering we were shut down for a few extra weeks. But in April, our sales are up 6% to 7% in China. So we're clearly seeing the comeback there. And again, things aren't totally back to normal over there, but from a minus 1 to plus 6 or 7 is pretty impressive. Just to give you a little more granularity around that and similar to comments Lori made a little bit ago, E&I is up double-digit, N&B is up double-digit and by the way the real performance in N&B is probiotics in China, it\u2019s double-digit growth. And T&I and S&C are kind of flat. So that's kind of the breakdown of it. So, as you see economies -- everyone getting out of their homes again and the economy starting to work, that's the numbers we're seeing over in the China market. Lori, you want to comment?\nLori Koch: Yes, I think, the inventory discussion is best had within T&I and E&I as you had mentioned. The T&I, we talked a bit in the call, potentially, there was a little bit of pre-buy in Q1 into the polymer chain that caused our results to be a little bit better than where the auto builds were. One of the key initiatives that we look at in China is the vehicle alert index, it measures kind of inventory in the chain at the dealer level. And we did see some normalization as we got towards the end of 2019. And into January and then it spiked to a pretty high amount, I think in the 80s in February. And then came back down nicely in March. And so I think, right now as we see it, there's not a lot of excess inventory in the auto chain. Obviously, we're just having issues with demand with auto, with expectancy down 45% in Q2. On the E&I side, I would say there is some of the customers building their supplies to ensure that they have adequate safety stock that benefited Q1, probably benefiting a little bit of Q2, especially within the semi chain. So, those are kind of the landscape of inventories, probably about more, there were some spikes in Q1 in T&I, actually normal and probably a little bit elevated in E&I. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.\nBob Koort: I am wondering if -- just try to get -- Ed, net price mix was flat. Wondering if you could comment a little bit, I guess in T&I and S&C you did have some petrochemical backbones. What does the raw material bill look like in the first quarter? And if we're still seeing some softness in nylon and some other things, so how do you sort of see that price mix development into the middle part of the year?\nLori Koch: Yes, so the majority of our benefit from lower raws within the oil dynamic would be within T&I and S&C. So from a full year perspective, we do expect if oil price kind of stay where it is about a $200 million benefit in raws, primarily in those two segments. We're actually seeing some raw headwinds within N&B and some of it\u2019s in based ingredients. So pricing in T&I in Q1 was down 4% that's primarily nylon. It was actually a little bit better than what we would have thought just given demand was a little bit lower. And we had a better mix of nylon sales. So the last quarter when we did earnings we talked about pricing headwind being from two components: one, actual nylon price decreases; and two, unfavorable nylon mix as we sell more of the opportunistic nylon. So, in Q1 we actually didn't sell as much opportunistic volume so that benefited the price a little bit.  Within S&C we continue to do really well at deriving value and pricing. We continue to see price lift within S&C in Q1, we expect that dynamic continue into Q2. Back to T&I real quick, so sequentially we do see nylon price declining, again into Q2. We see a similar kind of down mid-single-digit price overall in T&I in Q2 sequentially. I think the most headwinds will be mainly behind us as we get through Q2 and as we go to the back half of the year we should be about flat from a nylon price perspective. \nOperator: Next question will come from John Roberts with UBS.\nJohn Roberts: Ed, the T&I segment was originally part of new Dow. And then it was moved to do DuPont after it was thought to be a better fit with DuPont. Just could you revisit the thinking on that and is there anything tax wise that would preclude you from reopening discussions with Dow?\nEd Breen: Yes. So, remember what we really -- we still did move a key part of the T&I business over to Dow which really fit more with them with exactly what they did. So, we kept the part and again it's 60% of T&I is auto, where DuPont is a big player obviously in the auto end market, not just in the T&I business. So strategically, I think the fit with us was better there. But remember the other 40% of the T&I business is other really great end markets. As Lori mentioned, one of them being medical, which has held up obviously very, very well through this period of time.  So, look, I'll just say overall, I like where DuPont portfolio is. Having said that, we always have optionality in the portfolio. I think we're aware of every possible scenario out there. And if something down the road looks like it'll create significant value for us i.e. the N&B/IFF, we certainly will look. We're not led to things being exactly the way they are. Our key is to create shareholder value over the long-term. Having said that, in the environment we're in right now, Lori and I and the team are very focused on the operations of business, generating cash. And we're really spending our time on that at this point in time. I would highlight just on the deal front. It's interesting to note, and I'm not surprised by this at all, that the value of the N&B deal is almost exactly where we announced the deal -- when we announced that the value of N&B was $26.2 billion. I didn't actually rack and stack it in the last day, but it's somewhere in the $25.5 billion range where the stock price is trading at. So and again, not surprised by that because the N&B business as you could see, in the first quarter, had a tremendous quarter. We had 3% organic growth in the business. So those types of businesses are going to hold up extremely well in any environment, economically, and I think therefore, afford a nice multiple in that sector, which I think it deserves. So when you really then look at -- and then most of you -- all of you have written about this, when you're looking at rename called DuPont and what it trades out on a multiple basis. It's pretty incredible. The disconnect that sits there. So I think therein lies a big opportunity for our shareholders over the next year. \nOperator: And our final question will come from Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse.\nChris Parkinson: Lori, as it pertains to the safety in construction segments, just given the differential current growth rates across the sub-segments, can you just offer some additional framework on how we should be thinking about the mix effects and the potential for decremental margins? And then also just any insights on just how you're still thinking about the longer term margin profile of that business? \nLori Koch: So we had posted really strong margins in Q1 as we had mentioned, so 28.8%. I mean, a piece of that was a favorable mix that we're seeing, so Tyvek at the high end of our segment margins when you compare it across the different businesses in S&C. The highlights within S&C continue to be Tyvek and our water solutions business. So really nice growth, I think 6% organically 14% as reported with the benefits of the water acquisition that we made at the end of the quarter. The headwinds are obviously within Shelter which is in the low end of the margin for the business. So it would be below segment margins, as well as where we sell into oil and gas and aerospace. So the decremental margins in S&C for the quarter would be a little worse than what we've mentioned underlying for the company really primarily as some slowing down from production sites. So we had mentioned within T&I that we're actually taking idle mills is about $90 million to $100 million that are flowing directly into COGS in the quarter versus going through inventory. In S&C we're not taking production down to the point where we need to take idle mills, but therefore we are having a lower volume run across our plants causing higher unit rate, which are what are causing the decrementals to be a little bit worse than what we said for the total company. But continue to see longer term the ability to drive those 28%, 29% segment margin for S&C.\nLeland Weaver: Thank you everyone for joining our call. For your reference the copy of the transcript will be posted on DuPont's website. This concludes our call.\nOperator: Again that does conclude our conference call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Lori Koch",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed. Slide 4 highlights our strong liquidity position. We have always valued a strong balance sheet and that mindset led our actions as the severity of the downturn came into focus in mid-March. We saw the certainty of access of liquidity, as well as a firm plan for refinancing our November 2020 bond maturities by simply putting the wheels in motion to obtain bank financing as commercial paper and credit markets were initially constrained.  In short order we were able to secure a new $1 billion 364 day revolving credit facility, which replaced the $750 million facility that was set to expire in June. While we expect it to remain untapped, extending and enlarging this facility provides greater certainty to meet our general business needs. We also obtained a $2 billion delayed-draw term loan to ensure we had a path to pay off the November maturity, and have since replaced the bank commitment with a short dated bond, which I will discuss on the next slide. With these new credit facilities in place, and our strong cash position, we feel very comfortable with our liquidity. We also have opportunities ahead of us for further cash generation through working capital improvements and proceeds from divestitures. We have identified working capital as a key area for improvement and expect to deliver more than $500 million of working capital improvement in the year and we are off to a nice start in the first quarter by reducing our use of cash by $300 million versus the prior year. Each of our businesses have a series of targeted focus areas to deliver our working capital improvement, including inventory reductions through initiatives such as SKU rationalization and shifting from make to stock model to a make to order model in certain businesses. Within accounts receivables, our teams have increased their focus on pass-through accounts and across both accounts receivable and accounts payable we continue to optimize terms with our customers and vendors. In the quarter, we closed the sale of our Compound Semiconductor Solutions business generating over $400 million in gross proceeds. We are also taking a prudent action to pull back on certain CapEx reducing our spend by about $500 million versus the prior year. We elected in mid to late-March to price share buybacks after we had repurchased approximately 230 million in the quarter. While shareholder remuneration remains a critical component of our financial solvency, this was a tactical action at the time in order to conserve cash.  Lastly, our Board recently approved the second quarter dividend of $0.30 a share. We remain committed to our dividends and are confident that we will be able to maintain it through these challenging times.  Moving to Slide 5, as I mentioned, just last week, we launched a successful $2 billion bond offering, which has replaced the delayed-draw bank facility we previously secured. The proceeds of this three year bond offering will be used to satisfy the debt maturities that become due in November of this year. The newly issued bonds have a stated maturity 2023, but includes a provision that accelerates the maturity when we close the IFF transaction. With the receipt of a several cash payment from the N&B and IFF deal, we remain committed to paying down our debt by $5 billion. With this deleveraging payment, we will have no long-term debt maturities until the end of 2023.  Getting bonds in place to pay off the November maturities will be net neutral to our debt position as of the end of the year and significantly improves our liquidity position. We have amendable debt load and we are in a position to maintain a strong balance sheet both now and post the N&B/IFF transaction. We continue to hold strong investment grade ratings from each of the leading rating agencies and intend to maintain the balanced financial policy that has positioned us well. Turning to Slide 6, we remain committed to delivering our structural cost savings targets. In March, we indicated that we would be doubling the incremental cost actions that we plan to deliver in 2020 from approximately $90 million to $180 million. We are not impacting the long-term growth of the company through the actions we are planning. It is important to note that the bulk of the savings we have identified are targeted at reducing functional G&A costs, thus maintaining our investment in sales and R&D. We plan to maintain a competitive level of R&D spend of approximately $900 million in 2020, which will help to ensure that we are well positioned for growth once market recovers. These cost reductions will enable us to achieve our best-in-class functional cost structure.  In addition to the structural cost savings, we took a number of actions to control cost increases, including the decision to forego merit increases for 2020 and implementing a hiring freeze. We're also seeing reductions in cost especially with capital projects as we pull back on our capital and lower spending across the company. These actions were implemented quickly and we are seeing the benefits. Before turning it to Ed, I will comment on the first quarter results on Slide 7. Our teams executed well to deliver a solid quarter above our expectations in each of our core segments. We delivered net sales of $5.2 billion, down 4% in total and down 2% organically with price flat and volume down 2%. We saw strong demand across a number of key end markets including protective garments, water filtration, electronics and probiotics.  Gross margin improved more than 150 basis points on a year-over-year basis on favorable mix and the benefits from our productivity actions. Operating EBITDA was $1.3 billion down 8% from a year ago period driven primarily by the absence of $75 million of discrete gains in S&C and E&I, as well as lower volume and price in T&I. Adjusted EPS of $0.84 per share was down 9%.  Turning to Slide 8 for more detail on the segments. The solid first quarter results in our Nutrition & Bioscience business are clear in the numbers. Solid top-line growth and robust operating leverage led to an operating EBITDA margin improvement of more than 200 basis points. The operating leverage in N&B was primarily driven by the recovery of the probiotics business which delivered a margin above the segment average. Probiotics had its strongest quarter ever as key initiatives to strengthen the North America market were implemented and consumer demand for immune health strengthened globally. N&B also saw increasing demand in food and beverage, home & personal care and animal nutrition markets, a trend we continue to see in April. Likewise 8% organic top-line growth in our E&I segment was a solid result. Strength in the quarter was led by double-digit growth in Interconnect Solutions, driven by higher material content in premium, next generation smartphones, and high single-digit growth in Semiconductor Technologies, where new technology ramps within logic and foundry coupled with robust demand for memory in servers and data centers.  These areas of strength were more than offset by the absence of a $50 million prior year gain resulting in operating EBIT decline of 12%. The results of our T&I business were generally as we had anticipated with a very difficult environment for both price and volume.  As Ed mentioned, we expect further challenges looking forward as the auto industry slows dramatically as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We delivered net sales of $1.1 billion, which included a volume decline of 8% and a price decline of 4%. We anticipate a similar year-over-year pricing trend in the second quarter.  Within S&C demand for protective garments was robust leading to a 65% increase in garment sales versus last year. Our Tyvek team is working tirelessly to get our protective garments in the hands of healthcare and other frontline workers, including in many instances, donations of these garments.  We are working closely with our channel partners to increase the speed and availability of personal protective equipment and we are taking great efforts to prohibit opportunistic pricing of these vital supplies.  Despite the strength of protective garments, sales in the Safety Solutions business declined mid-single-digits, as demand weakened across industrial, aerospace and defense markets as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and challenges in the oil and gas industry. Similarly, Shelter Solutions sales declined low single-digits as construction activity was impacted by stay-at-home orders issued across the globe. Demand continued to be strong in Water Solutions which drove mid single-digit organic growth in the quarter. S&C operating EBITDA margin of 28.8% was the highest it has been in several quarters driven by the continued focus on price improvement, cost actions and productivity. Versus first quarter of 2019, operating EBIT was down due to the absence of a $26 million gain, which was recognized in the prior year.  Turning to the adjusted EPS bridge on Slide 9, you'll see that our adjusted EPS declined 9% to $0.84 per share for the first quarter. Organic top-line growth in our E&I and N&B segments as well as further execution of our cost savings and productivity actions was not able to offset the $0.06 headwind we saw from nylon pricing pressure in our T&I segment, as well as the absence of prior gains in our E&I, S&C segments, which reduced adjusted EPS by $0.08. Below the lines, we saw a 500 basis point increase to our base tax rate driven by discrete items in the first quarter. We expect our full year base tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 23%, driven by the first quarter discrete items.  With that, I'll turn it back to Ed. Thanks, Scott. So, as we mentioned on the call, April was down kind of low to mid-teens. It was a similar result that we saw in Q1 kind of carry into April. So we saw continued strength in E&I, continued strength in N&B. The strength in E&I is primarily coming again from semiconductors as we see increased usage in the data and server space. T&I and S&C were down more than what they were down in Q1, in line with what you would expect with what's going on in automotive. Automotive right now, we expect it to be down about 45% in Q2, versus down 25% in Q1. And S&C continued strength in Tyvek within the garment space, as the garments alone, which are about a third, historically at Tyvek they've kind of come up now to almost half of Tyvek. We're up about 65% in the quarter. So really nice shrink there. And we've announced some capacity expansion to enable that to continue to grow into Q2. But the headwinds that we're seeing in aerospace and oil and gas are more than offsetting that as well as construction with all the stay-at-home orders. So net-net, April down. As we'd mentioned about low to mid-teens with very similar end market results that we saw in Q1. So I think, so underneath the 12% down, 8% volume that we've recorded in T&I. So there was strength that we saw in the Healthcare segment that offset some of the weakness that we saw in Mobility Solutions. So mobility would have been down more than the results that we reported for the quarter.  Having said that, we continue to expect to see our performance outpacing auto builds just driven by the content per vehicle, so we've given a number in the past of about 1.5 times that we would look to exceed auto build just driven by the material content that we have as we see branch towards light-weighting as well as electric vehicle. So that's kind of what led to our results to outpace. There is a little bit of a time lag between when you see auto builds decline and when you see back to chain where we primarily sell into with our polymers. So we did see a little bit of acceleration in Q1 as people were loading their supply chains in advance of the downturn. So I think our results in 2Q will more mirror what you're seeing from an end market perspective. Yes, I think, our next area of focus is obviously around a lot of COGS over the last few years. So we're looking and shifting the focus towards COGS. So there are definitely areas of opportunities in COGS, we will spend about $13 billion, $14 billion there. There's opportunities to increase our reliability, increase our uptime, increase our yield. So that's definitely an excellent area of focus for us that will help us to continue to expand margins. Yes. So I think, to your question on the second quarter, so we do at this point or we see the second quarter as the lowest through the year. So, as I mentioned the sales in April were down low to mid-teens. We have a hard time seeing total Q2 sales being worse than down mid-teens. So as we see it now, Q2 should be a low point. Yes, if I can just quickly comment on the Tyvek line 8 that we had to pause due to some regulations in Luxembourg where the construction is taking place. We did mention in our prepared remarks, so just to reiterate, that we were able to put in place an incremental capacity expansion to be able to meet the current Tyvek demand. So we not only added, in the first quarter alone we usually had about 15 million garments, we went up to 25 million garments and that was through a combination of incremental capacity, now in our current asset as well as pulling products for non-healthcare markets.  In the second quarter, we announced our TyvekTogether campaign, which will allow us to add another 5 million to 6 million garments. So we've got new capacity coming online even though we delayed the start up of the new line because of the regulations going on in Luxembourg. Yes, I think, the inventory discussion is best had within T&I and E&I as you had mentioned. The T&I, we talked a bit in the call, potentially, there was a little bit of pre-buy in Q1 into the polymer chain that caused our results to be a little bit better than where the auto builds were. One of the key initiatives that we look at in China is the vehicle alert index, it measures kind of inventory in the chain at the dealer level. And we did see some normalization as we got towards the end of 2019. And into January and then it spiked to a pretty high amount, I think in the 80s in February. And then came back down nicely in March. And so I think, right now as we see it, there's not a lot of excess inventory in the auto chain. Obviously, we're just having issues with demand with auto, with expectancy down 45% in Q2. On the E&I side, I would say there is some of the customers building their supplies to ensure that they have adequate safety stock that benefited Q1, probably benefiting a little bit of Q2, especially within the semi chain. So, those are kind of the landscape of inventories, probably about more, there were some spikes in Q1 in T&I, actually normal and probably a little bit elevated in E&I. Yes, so the majority of our benefit from lower raws within the oil dynamic would be within T&I and S&C. So from a full year perspective, we do expect if oil price kind of stay where it is about a $200 million benefit in raws, primarily in those two segments. We're actually seeing some raw headwinds within N&B and some of it's in based ingredients. So pricing in T&I in Q1 was down 4% that's primarily nylon. It was actually a little bit better than what we would have thought just given demand was a little bit lower. And we had a better mix of nylon sales. So the last quarter when we did earnings we talked about pricing headwind being from two components: one, actual nylon price decreases; and two, unfavorable nylon mix as we sell more of the opportunistic nylon. So, in Q1 we actually didn't sell as much opportunistic volume so that benefited the price a little bit.  Within S&C we continue to do really well at deriving value and pricing. We continue to see price lift within S&C in Q1, we expect that dynamic continue into Q2. Back to T&I real quick, so sequentially we do see nylon price declining, again into Q2. We see a similar kind of down mid-single-digit price overall in T&I in Q2 sequentially. I think the most headwinds will be mainly behind us as we get through Q2 and as we go to the back half of the year we should be about flat from a nylon price perspective. So we had posted really strong margins in Q1 as we had mentioned, so 28.8%. I mean, a piece of that was a favorable mix that we're seeing, so Tyvek at the high end of our segment margins when you compare it across the different businesses in S&C. The highlights within S&C continue to be Tyvek and our water solutions business. So really nice growth, I think 6% organically 14% as reported with the benefits of the water acquisition that we made at the end of the quarter. The headwinds are obviously within Shelter which is in the low end of the margin for the business. So it would be below segment margins, as well as where we sell into oil and gas and aerospace. So the decremental margins in S&C for the quarter would be a little worse than what we've mentioned underlying for the company really primarily as some slowing down from production sites. So we had mentioned within T&I that we're actually taking idle mills is about $90 million to $100 million that are flowing directly into COGS in the quarter versus going through inventory. In S&C we're not taking production down to the point where we need to take idle mills, but therefore we are having a lower volume run across our plants causing higher unit rate, which are what are causing the decrementals to be a little bit worse than what we said for the total company. But continue to see longer term the ability to drive those 28%, 29% segment margin for S&C."

            "name": "Ed Breen",
            "content": "Thanks, Leland, and good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. This is obviously an unprecedented time, and I hope you're all safe and well. Today we will walk through the disciplined plan we are executing as we navigate the current environment, including our overall approach to protecting the health and safety of our employees and maintaining our supply chains and operations. We will also detail a number of actions we quickly implemented to strengthen our liquidity, protect our balance sheet and generate cash. Because of these swift actions, we are on solid footings and are well prepared to handle the uncertain times ahead. We will also provide comments on the first quarter results, overall market dynamics in April, as well as our current assumptions for the next few months. Since the outset of this pandemic, our priorities have been clear; beginning with the safety and well being of our employees. We have taken aggressive steps to protect our employees, are restricting access to our sites, implementing enhanced cleaning protocols, performing contact tracing among our employees, administering quarantines where needed and implementing work-from-home protocols where possible. I want to acknowledge the tremendous efforts across our organization in overcoming the challenges created by the pandemic. The determination of our employees from across the globe to maintain business continuity has enabled us to continue to be a reliable supplier for our customers, and a vast majority of our plant sites have been deemed essential in their local jurisdictions, and have continued to operate. As a result many of our manufacturing and other necessary personnel deserve particular recognition. Their extraordinary dedication in this incredibly challenging environment has enabled us to keep our sites and supply chains operating; our second priority for managing in these difficult times.  In fact, we have been successful in maintaining our operating base during the global pandemic with only a handful of our manufacturing locations shut down by local restrictions over the past few months; and currently, operations are restricted at only two of our 170 manufacturing sites. We have begun longer term planning for an eventual return to the work for non-manufacturing employees, which will be done in accordance with all relevant government requirements, and continued emphasis on health, safety and the overall well-being of our employees, customers and communities.  Our third area of focus has been bolstering our already strong balance sheet by enhancing our liquidity position and implementing plans to generate and preserve cash. We will provide more detail on these actions in a moment. Lastly, we continue to do our part to help combat this pandemic. We have donated over 140,000 Tyvek garments, and thousands of gallons of hand sanitizer to healthcare and other frontline workers. We have also used our 3D printing capabilities to make face shield for local hospitals that were experiencing shortages and partner with Cummins to use DuPont filtration technology to help augment the supply of N95 respirator masks. We have also announced a number of initiatives to increase the supply of protective garments by more than 15 million per month since the start of the pandemic, including the increased production of Tyvek garments by more than 9 million per month primarily by shifting production away from non-healthcare markets. And launching the TyvekTogether campaign, which enable the production of 5 million to 6 million additional garments per month for the rapid development of a safe, easy to use version of Tyvek and by empowering others to join DuPont in protecting frontline responders with free access to our designs and usage instructions.  These are unprecedented times, and I am personally engaged in the day-to-day work to respond quickly to the changing environment. We take our designation as an essential business very seriously, and are committed to doing all we can to support our employees, our customers, our partners, our shareholders, and the communities in which we operate. Slide 3 details the series of actions we have been operating against since the pandemic spiked in mid-March. The senior leadership team and I are on top of these items daily to ensure we remain well positioned. We have analyzed a number of stress case scenarios and are confident we are making the right decisions to ensure we are favorably positioned to weather an unlikely steep and prolonged downturn, while also being equipped to return to growth when the market recovers. Our playbook for this environment is straightforward: Improve cash generation through working capital improvements and deferral of certain capital expenditures, strengthen our liquidity position and optimize the cost structure of the company. We will provide more color on how we are driving success in each of these areas. Our scenario planning was broad and simulated severe downturn cases to ensure we can protect the company. We're also staying keenly focused on the downside risk in automotive, aerospace, oil and gas, and other industrial markets.  With nearly 15% of our sales connected to the automotive industry, this is the largest area of exposure for us, particularly within our Transportation & Industrial segment. The numbers are unprecedented with global auto builds down 24% in the first quarter, and the latest estimate suggests the global auto builds will be down more than 40% in the second quarter. In light of this, we developed a plan in the first quarter to begin slowing and idling certain facilities in our network, primarily factories in our Transportation & Industrial segment in order to align our supply with market demand. Taking these actions will provide significant working capital improvement through inventory reductions over the course of the year that will translate into near term earnings headwinds, as fixed costs that would otherwise be absorbed in inventory will now flow directly to earnings. For T&I a very weak top-line driven by the expected decline in auto builds, as well as year-over-year price declines, coupled with the charges associated with plant shutdowns is expected to result in decremental margin in T&I of approximately 55% to 65% in the second quarter. These are not easy decisions, but the confidence to react quickly and decisively is critical, and we will continue this mindset as we move forward. Let me turn it over to Lori for additional color on the other actions we have taken, as well as a few comments on the first quarter. Thanks, Lori. Slide 10 shows the progress we have made since announcing the N&B and IFF transaction last year. I remain very excited to bring these two businesses together to create a global leader. Since the announcement of the transaction in mid-December, teams have been hard at work. As I told you in January, the executive steering team and leaders for key work streams including separation and integration, our financials, IT separation and stand up, legal entity work and talent selection are in place, and things are progressing as planned.  In fact, as of March, we have received antitrust clearance here in the U.S. and our draft EU filing was submitted on April 20th. And we are now working with the European Commission to formally notify the transaction and opinion by trust clearance. We will file our initial registration statement with the SEC in the coming days. Also, the new leadership team will be announced later this month and IFF intends to hold a shareholder vote in September.  In summary, the teams are energized and all the critical milestones remain on track for a Q1 2021 closing. Let me wrap up a few comments on what we saw in April, as well as our expectations for the second quarter. We are seeing robust demand continuing within several key end markets such as water filtration, food & beverage, probiotics, electronics and protective garments. There's some increased demand in these markets as a result of pandemic, but these businesses are market leaders in their space, and there is undoubtedly underlying growth driving these results as well. However, as we have highlighted, these areas of strength are expected to be more than offset by the well-known softness in automotive, aerospace, oil and gas, and other industrial markets. In April, our sales were down low to mid-teens percent versus last year. Earlier I mentioned the actions we're taking to run our T&I business for cash through this period of significant demand weakness. These actions will result in near-term earnings headwinds as fixed costs otherwise would have run through inventory, will flow directly to earnings. Likewise, actions to pull back up production will lead to lower utilization in several industrial businesses within S&C segment. All in, we expect our second quarter decremental margins to be in a range of 45% to 55% on lower volume, nylon pricing pressure, lower utilization, and costs associated with idling facilities. Excluding our decision idle facilities our decremental margins would be in a range of 35% to 40%.  While it is still impossible to predict timing, our markets will eventually stabilize and return to growth, and we will be well positioned for the recovery. In the interim, we will continue to prioritize the safety and health of our employees, safely maintain our operations, strengthen our balance sheet, and partner with other industry leaders to combat this pandemic. I'll now turn it over to Leland to open up for Q&A. Yes, Steve, thanks for the question. And obviously, we spent a lot of time on this topic. So, as you know, we upped our structural cost savings in the last month or so from $90 million to $180 million. In addition to that, remember that we have another $165 million that is a structural change to the cost of the business. That's coming out from the DowDuPont merger and putting those businesses together. So in total, we have about 330 million give or take coming out of the system permanently.  On top of that, we have about another $80 million to $100 million of what I would call opportunities that are T&E reduction, external contractor spend at our facilities. And we've eliminated the merit increases, we've freezed hiring. So things that were in our plans, there's about another give or take $80 million to $100 million that won't get spent that was baked into the plan. So, when you kind of sit back and look at it, we have benchmarked every function in the company, every business in the company and we are getting the G&A expenditures to best-in-class benchmarking with the best companies out there. Remember that four years ago, when I arrived, we took about $1 billion of structural costs out of DuPont and during the DowDuPont merger we took another $1 billion of structural costs out of the business on top of what we're now presently doing. So, I think if you look at it, we're going to benchmark very, very well through this. And again, I wanted to really attack the structural flaws, so that they're permanent in the business.  Another point, though, that I would make, we did not touch the growth programs in the company. We left all of our sales organizations totally intact and we left all of our R&D spend, which is 4% of sales $900 million totally intact. And by the way, I think we're running our R&D machine very, very well. We've benchmarked every single program, what's the return going to be on the program, are we spending what we said, is the timing the timing we said it would be? So we're going to come out of the downturn I think in a very strong position. We're still cranking out a lot of new products through this. So I think we've balanced this thing very well. And just add on to that, just to make it clear, this is a business in T&I that we are truly running for cash performance in this period of time. So, we purposely are hurting our earnings by $90 million to $100 million if we kept running the facilities as they do, for instance, in the semiconductor industry, our earnings would literally be $90 million to $100 million better. But we're going to draw down the supply chain here and generate $200 million to $250 million of cash performance in the company. So, we will be temporarily shutting down about 50% of our polymer capacity in the business and I think it's the right decision, a smart decision to do that. And we'll come out of it stronger and have a better uptick when things return a little bit more to normal. Yes. Thanks for the question, Steve. So on the PFOA front, as you know we had two trials of the case, the small amount of case is remaining. My personal opinion is there will be a settlement there. We'll get those cases in Ohio behind us. And I'm highly confident that will occur. As you know, Chemours, the judge ruled in our favor that this will go to arbitration. Chemours did appeal that to the court. But the law is so heavily on our side on this issue that arbitration will occur here.  As I said before, I like the arbitration process just because it's a quicker process than going through the court system. So, we feel very, very good about that. But again, my opinion is, there probably will be a settlement with Chemours that will carve here at some point in time. We'll renegotiate the agreement we have between the companies. There are some very key guideposts in any agreement that we would come up with that are important to us. It will not be -- we will not do an uncapped deal. And it would be a deal that would play out over multiple, multiple years, because I don't see any liabilities on PFOA that are significant at any point in time. But there will be liabilities that will play out over multiple years as we do remediation of piece of certain sites and all that. And then one other point I would just make, remember that I think a lot of the hoopla around PFOA with us, and I certainly acknowledge this, that it's a little bit of a cloud over us, is that we are being named in fair amount of the firefighting foam cases. But it's very important than I know, Steve, you've written extensively about this. We never made firefighting foam. We had one surfactant that was used for 10 years out of a 70 year period. So I think we're a very, very minor player if at all in firefighting foam, and I think the biggest issue for DuPont is to get out of those cases and be able to wrap that up, I think is the biggest thing, because the rest of the PFOA is very limited for manufacturing sites where we used it in the process in the manufacturing. So, again, that will play out over the next year or so. But on the other two items, the Ohio one, the Chemours one, I think you'll see some action there in the coming months. Thanks for the question, John, and Lori jump-in in a minute also if you would like. And thank you for saying about working on cost and operations. That's actually what I like to do the most, even though maybe reputationally it's different than that. I love running the businesses. So I mean I'm a big believer in benchmarking. I'm a big believer in keeping G&A costs really lean and mean. By the way, I've talked to many CEOs during the COVID-19 here, and I actually think we're finding additional ways to potentially structurally save costs in the company. I'm pretty impressed at how efficient we're running the company in the stay-at-home policy for most of our non-manufacturing employees. So I think there's some lessons we're going to learn there on our real estate footprint as we move forward. But we always intended to take out more costs. And remember when N&B leaves the portfolio, it's important that we reduce our G&A cost structure in the company so that we're still best in class when that revenue and EBITDA leaves the company. So what we've done is we've really benchmarked very significantly around what are we going to look like post the N&B transaction.  One of the other things we're doing on the -- which will probably translate into better costs is we're really going through the company and looking at every single SKU in the company and really looking at a rationalization there. I've done this in every other company I've run and there's always a very significant opportunity. We've already completed it in our water business. And we've taken the margins up 1,000 basis points in the water business and a big part of that was the rationalization of SKUs through the business. So that's the kind of the path that Lori and I are on right now in the company. And I think we'll continue to get opportunities from that. Lori you want to comment? Yeah, let me hit the high level scenario planning we did first Jeff and I appreciate the question. And by the way, I was the CEO through the '08, '09. And Jeff, you know this, I took over Tyco in 2002 on the brink of bankruptcy. So, I've done a lot of scenario planning in the past. And never thought I'd have to do it again. But we actually did two cases for ourselves and for our Board that we presented to the Board of Directors. And by the way, I don't plan on this happening at all. But it was truly just scenario planning. We did a scenario, where what if revenue was down 30% for at least one year, we did 20% down on volume, 10% down on price which we're -- practically the world would coming to an end, but we did it anyway, just to say, \u201cHey, here's how the P&L would look, here's how our cash position would look.\u201d And by the way, we would be fine through a period like that. We did another scenario, and I don't even want to say this one yet, but it was even worse than the 30% one. Let me just say it that way that we also presented to the Board.  And I'm just a big believer in, don't be nai\u0308ve here, if things are tough for a longer period, how do you run the company through and make sure the company is healthy. So I feel very, very comfortable with where we sit and where we put the liquidity of the company through this scenario. And by the way, when the N&B/IFF deal happens, we get $7.3 billion of cash. And as Lori mentioned in her prepared remarks, we're going to use $5 billion of that to pay down debt. So we'll be in a normal operating environment. Our debt profile will actually be better than it is in current DuPont. And remember, we still have $2.3 billion of excess cash left over from that $7.3 billion of that will have available to us. So we're going to be in just a phenomenal position from that standpoint. Lori, would you like to comment a little more detail? Yes. I think also, you mentioned the E&I business. I could see the semi business obviously downturn a little bit going maybe into the third quarter. It's been running very robust in the first quarter. It is running robust in the second quarter but all indicators are that, that will turn down a little bit. So I could see that happening. But as Lori just said, I think mid-teens down revenue is probably the bottom, but what we're seeing based on what we know, as of today. Yes. So high level, David -- thank you for the question. So last year, we spent $1.5 billion on CapEx and we planned on spending $1.3 billion this year. And remember, we're higher than our D&A, because we had three or four key growth projects, all hitting at the same time that we feel really good about. So that's the reason for the $1.5 billion last year and even higher this year, or high for us $1.3 billion this year. We have reduced that to $1 billion. So $1.5 billion last year, down to $1 billion this year. By the way everything that we've delayed is simply a delay, we're not canceling it because we want to turn these back up when appropriate. But the two of the bigger ones that we cut back on was Tyvek line 8, which is our biggest CapEx program by far, it's over $400 million. And we spent a fair amount on that last year. That will come online in a couple of years. That is a big, big project for us. And the demand on Tyvek, even at [Storm] because of medical supplies and all that, is very important to us.  So anyway, that was one. We cut back on our cap-on expansion just temporarily. That was another one and some of our maintenance CapEx we slowed down just a little bit also. So that's what gets us down to the $1 billion. One thing we did not touch at all and I certainly would never do this is any of our safety programs that we're spending CapEx on in our facilities. We've maintained at 100% of the spend level. And then another area I would say is the other big one -- besides slowing down a couple of the growth projects was some of our ERP software programs, we also slowed those down. They're nice to have from an efficiency standpoint, but we're six months later on, and it's not the end of the world. So that's kind of the big buckets on what we did. And as we see things pick up obviously, we'll go right back to spending against those growth programs. Yes, I certainly haven't thought about it in a week yet. So we did about $230 million of buyback in the first quarter of 6.1 million shares and I guess the way stocks come back we bought them back at a pretty nice price. So I obviously feel good about that. And as we said, we suspended it, we have not cancelled it. If things are picking up through the second half of the year, we'll certainly look at the share buyback again. As I've said a few minutes ago, the balance sheet is in great shape. We're going to get the cash from the IFF/N&B transaction. So, we know that's coming at the beginning of next year. So we'll be in a strong position to reassess that with the Board. So it's really just to spend for the time being, make sure things don't get worse here. And as Lori said, I think hopefully the second quarter is the low quarter, maybe for us obviously into the third quarter, but pick up from there and then we have that money coming from the deal.  Probably I'd also just mention on the N&B and IFF front. As we said in our prepared remarks, we are in great shape on -- I talk to Andreas the CEO of IFF every single week. The teams are right on track with everything we need to do. We did get U.S. antitrust approval. We're in the process with the EU now and as you know, on this deal, there really is no antitrust issues. So all the teams are right on schedule, which is pretty amazing considering there's a lot of work-at-home policy going on right now at both of the companies. So we will definitely progress on the schedule. We're on for February 1 close. And we're going to have the shareholder vote in September. And I feel great right about that and we also have a shareholder that owns give or take 23%, 24% of the shares voting in favor of the deal. So, just in great shape. I'll let Lori answer the second part of that. Let me just touch on the first part of your question, John. And give you a kind of one data point. The China economy is coming back first. And by the way, it was interesting within three weeks of being able to come back in China, all of our production facilities were up and running after the New Year. It's very impressive by the way including one in Wuhan that we have. So we're pretty much back to -- not quite full capacity. But near close to it with our 13 production facilities in China. But let me give you a data point. In the first quarter in China, our sales were down organically 1%, which actually surprised me that it was back good, considering we were shut down for a few extra weeks. But in April, our sales are up 6% to 7% in China. So we're clearly seeing the comeback there. And again, things aren't totally back to normal over there, but from a minus 1 to plus 6 or 7 is pretty impressive. Just to give you a little more granularity around that and similar to comments Lori made a little bit ago, E&I is up double-digit, N&B is up double-digit and by the way the real performance in N&B is probiotics in China, it's double-digit growth. And T&I and S&C are kind of flat. So that's kind of the breakdown of it. So, as you see economies -- everyone getting out of their homes again and the economy starting to work, that's the numbers we're seeing over in the China market. Lori, you want to comment? Yes. So, remember what we really -- we still did move a key part of the T&I business over to Dow which really fit more with them with exactly what they did. So, we kept the part and again it's 60% of T&I is auto, where DuPont is a big player obviously in the auto end market, not just in the T&I business. So strategically, I think the fit with us was better there. But remember the other 40% of the T&I business is other really great end markets. As Lori mentioned, one of them being medical, which has held up obviously very, very well through this period of time.  So, look, I'll just say overall, I like where DuPont portfolio is. Having said that, we always have optionality in the portfolio. I think we're aware of every possible scenario out there. And if something down the road looks like it'll create significant value for us i.e. the N&B/IFF, we certainly will look. We're not led to things being exactly the way they are. Our key is to create shareholder value over the long-term. Having said that, in the environment we're in right now, Lori and I and the team are very focused on the operations of business, generating cash. And we're really spending our time on that at this point in time. I would highlight just on the deal front. It's interesting to note, and I'm not surprised by this at all, that the value of the N&B deal is almost exactly where we announced the deal -- when we announced that the value of N&B was $26.2 billion. I didn't actually rack and stack it in the last day, but it's somewhere in the $25.5 billion range where the stock price is trading at. So and again, not surprised by that because the N&B business as you could see, in the first quarter, had a tremendous quarter. We had 3% organic growth in the business. So those types of businesses are going to hold up extremely well in any environment, economically, and I think therefore, afford a nice multiple in that sector, which I think it deserves. So when you really then look at -- and then most of you -- all of you have written about this, when you're looking at rename called DuPont and what it trades out on a multiple basis. It's pretty incredible. The disconnect that sits there. So I think therein lies a big opportunity for our shareholders over the next year."

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Pat Fitzgerald from Investor Relations.\nPat Fitzgerald: Good morning and thank you for joining us for DuPont\u2019s fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. We are making this call available to investors and media via webcast. We have prepared slides to supplement our comments during this conference call. These slides are posted on the Investor Relations section of DuPont\u2019s website and through the link to our webcast. Joining me on the call today are Ed Breen, Chief Executive Officer and Lori Koch, Chief Financial Officer. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the slides. During our call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Our 2020 Form 10-K, as updated by our current and periodic reports, includes detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties, which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today exclude significant items. We will also refer to other non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in our press release and posted to the Investor page of our website. I will now turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Breen: Thanks, Pat and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter earnings call. In addition to discussing our fourth quarter results and outlook for 2022, this morning, I will also comment on the progress of both our intended acquisition of Rogers and our process for divesting a majority of the M&M segment. Our fourth quarter results were highlighted by 6% volume gains, including a 9% increase in the E&I segment and a 12% increase in W&P. M&M delivered top line results ahead of expectations, including volumes well ahead of global auto builds in the quarter. Customer demand was broad-based across the portfolio, led by greater than 20% volume growth in semiconductor technologies and high-teens volume growth in water. Our top line performance also reflects significant pricing actions we took to offset $250 million of raw material inflation in the quarter. We are seeing increases in all businesses with about three-fourths of the impact in M&M. Our teams have done an outstanding job monitoring our input costs and quickly translating that into price increases to remain price cost neutral for the year. We are taking additional actions as we work to offset logistics costs, which during the fourth quarter, were a $50 million headwind, mostly in W&P. I want to recognize and thank our employees who show up everyday in our factories to keep our lines running and supplying the necessary products and solutions to deliver results that we reported today. Their unwavering commitment in the face of a relentless pandemic, ongoing supply chain disruptions and logistic challenges deserves our gratitude. Turning to Slide 3, I will provide an update on our portfolio transformation and we will review how our focus on those strategic actions, balanced capital allocation and innovation-led growth position us extremely well heading into 2022 to continue unlocking value for our shareholders, innovating for our customers and creating opportunity for our employees. In November, we announced our planned acquisition of Rogers Corporation as well as our intent to divest a significant portion of our M&M segment. These portfolio actions will position DuPont among the top of the multi-industrial [indiscernible] with top quartile revenue growth, EBITDA margins and low cyclicality all hallmarks of top performing companies. Going forward, our business will be centered around the secular high growth pillars of electronics, water, industrial technologies, protection and next generation automotive. Our teams see strong customer demand across these pillars driven by mega trends such as the transition to hybrid and electric vehicles, clean water sustainability and the move to 5G. The preparation for the Rogers acquisition is well underway and on track for it in the second quarter closing. Several significant milestones in the pay after closing have already been achieved. In mid-December, the waiting period under the HSR expired here in the U.S. and regulatory processes in other parts of the world are underway. Just 2 weeks ago, on January 25, Rogers\u2019 shareholders voted to approve the transaction. Excitement is building for combining this business with our portfolio of electronics offerings, which includes our recent acquisition of Laird Performance Materials. Our teams are anxious to get to the point where we could start working with the application engineers, R&D and sales teams at Rogers to map out the revenue synergy opportunities to the areas of next generation auto, 5G infrastructure, defense electronics and clean energy. Combined with Laird, these acquisitions increased the total addressable market of our E&I business by approximately 50% and we are keeping our penetration into markets such as electric vehicles, consumer electronics and industrial technologies. A lot of work has been done to plan for the cost synergies associated with Rogers acquisition, which we expect to be approximately $150 million. We also have line of sight to about $63 million of cost synergies from the Laird acquisition from last summer which is ahead of our target. We are looking across both of the acquisitions as well as our existing E&I business to maximize our synergies through G&A and footprint optimization, along with procurement savings. We also announced that we have initiated a process to divest the majority of the M&M segment. Our work here is also on track and progressing well. As I had expected, there is a significant level of interest in this market leading asset and I am pleased with how the process is progressing. Our target is to have a signed agreement by the end of the first quarter with the closing in the fourth quarter of this year. In addition to positioning the company as a top performing multi-industrial, these transactions will enable us to transform the portfolio, while maintaining a strong balance sheet and continuing with a balanced financial policy. Today, we announced that our Board has approved a 10% per share increase to our dividend which is consistent with our commitment for a dividend payout in the range of 35% to 45% and to grow the dividend annually in line with earnings. In addition, our Board has also authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program which enables us to continue returning value to our shareholders as we expect to complete the remaining $375 million under our existing authorization in the first quarter ahead of the planned expiration. After paying down the financing associated with the Rogers acquisition, we expect to deploy a significant portion of the remaining M&M proceeds to do further M&A to build on our core areas of strength as well as additional share repurchases. We will also generate strong cash flow this year in addition to the $240 million gross proceeds from the biomaterials divestiture, which is the last of our non-core divestitures. Our strong balance sheet positions us well to deliver for all stakeholders through investment in our business, dividends, share repurchases and additional M&A. Finally, we will deliver shareholder value through staying focused on innovation, which is at the core of DuPont. The 6% volume growth we delivered in the quarter and 10% volume growth for the year benchmarks well against our top peers. For the quarter, our volume gains, excluding M&M segment were up 10%. These results are proof point that the work of our R&D teams and application engineers who spent countless hours working alongside our customers, solving their most complex challenges is an advantage in the marketplace. Our focus on innovation is also at the core of our ESG strategy through both innovation and our own processes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at our factories as well as new product innovations that support and advance our customer sustainability goals in areas such as clean water, clean energy, electric vehicles and connectivity. The levers of portfolio transformation, balanced capital allocation, and innovation led growth, is a powerful combination to create long-term shareholder value at DuPont. With that, let me turn it over to Lori to discuss the details of the quarter as well as our financial outlook.\nLori Koch: Thanks, Ed and good morning, everyone. As Ed mentioned, customer demand in our key end markets remained strong in the fourth quarter. We continue to face unprecedented global supply chain challenges and rising inflation. However, the swift pricing actions that we continue to implement are benefiting top line performance and maintaining earnings on a dollars basis. These factors, along with our intense focus on execution, contributed to net sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS results above our guidance. In addition, we had solid cash flow generation and returned over $650 million in capital to shareholders during the quarter through $500 million in share repurchases and over $150 million in dividends. For the year, we returned more than $2.7 billion in capital to shareholders through $2.1 billion in share repurchases and $600 million in dividends. Turning to Slide 4, net sales of $4.3 billion were up 14% versus the fourth quarter of 2020, up 13% on an organic basis. Organic sales growth consists of 7% price gains, reflecting the continued actions we are taking to address inflationary pressure and 6% volume growth. A 2% portfolio tailwind reflects the net impact of strong top line results related to our acquisition of Laird and headwinds from non-core divestitures. Currency was a 1% headwind in the quarter. Overall, sales growth was broad-based and reflects double-digit organic growth in all four regions and high single-digit to double-digit organic growth in all three reporting segments. From an earnings perspective, we reported fourth quarter operating EBITDA of $973 million and adjusted EPS of $1.08 per share, up 5% and 54% respectively from the year ago period. Our incremental margin in the quarter was pressured by price costs and logistics. Net of these impacts, our incremental margin was about 33% in 4Q. Ed mentioned earlier, the pricing actions that we took throughout the year, resulting in us offsetting about $250 million of raw material inflation in the quarter and we also ended the year price cost neutral. The raw material inflation coupled with about $50 million of higher logistics cost in the quarter were headwinds to our margins. I will provide more detail of the margin compression we saw in the quarter in a few minutes. From a segment perspective, E&I delivered 10% operating EBITDA growth on volume gains and earnings uplift from Laird, which more than offset raw material and logistics segments as well as startup costs associated with our Kapton capacity expansion. In W&P, operating EBITDA increased 7% as pricing gains and volume growth more than offset higher raw material and logistics cost. We will remain disciplined in our pricing approach as we move into 2022 to address continued inflation. M&M operating EBITDA declined 3% as net pricing gains were more than offset by lower equity earnings due to higher natural gas costs in Europe. In the quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $621 million and CapEx was $184 million, resulting in free cash flow of $437 million. Free cash flow conversion was 100%. In addition, we received gross proceeds of about $500 million during the quarter from our Clean Technologies divestiture, which was closed at the end of December. Before we go to the next slide, I would also like to make a few comments on our full year performance. Full year net sales of $16.7 billion grew 16% and were up 14% on an organic basis. The organic growth consists of a 10% increase in volume and a 4% increase in price. Organic sales growth reflects double-digit growth in all four regions and in all three reporting segments. Further, all 9 of our business lines had organic growth in 2021 and 7 of the 9 business lines grew double-digits. The 10% increase in volume for the year consists of gains in all 3 reporting segments and within all 9 business lines, reflecting robust global customer demand in secular growth areas such as electronics and water, along with recovery in end markets negatively impacted by the pandemic in prior year, such as automotive, commercial construction and select industrial markets. Full year operating EBITDA of $4.2 billion increased 21%, reflecting 1.3x operating leverage, operating EBITDA margin expansion of about 100 basis points, an incremental margin of 32%. Operating EBITDA increased for all three reporting segments during the year. Full year adjusted EPS of $4.30 per share was up about 95% from prior year on higher segment earnings, a lower share count and lower interest expense. Slide 5 shows the impact that price cost inflation had on our operating EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter. As costs continued to rise throughout 2021, our fourth quarter results reflect the largest headwind to quarterly margins for the year. In total, pricing actions fully offset about $250 million of raw material inflation, which was higher than our expectations for input costs coming into the quarter and mainly in the M&M segment. While our pricing actions have enabled us to maintain earnings, the price cost inflation resulted in a significant headwind of about 150 basis points to operating EBITDA margins versus the year ago period. Additionally, higher logistics cost of about $50 million in the quarter resulted in a margin headwind of about 120 basis points. Offsetting the headwinds from raws and logistics was a 70 basis point improvement in operating EBITDA margin, which includes volume growth in E&I and W&P and the benefit associated with the Laird acquisition. If you exclude the price cost and logistics headwinds in the quarter on an ex-M&M segment basis, our operating EBITDA margin was above 26.5% in the fourth quarter, further illustrating our strong performance and putting an emphasis on our planned portfolio actions. Turning to Slide 6, which provides more detail on the year-over-year changes in the net sales for the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, organic sales growth of 13% during the quarter consist of 7% pricing gains and 6% volume growth. In E&I volume gains delivered 9% organic sales growth for the segment led by higher volumes in semiconductor technologies of more than 20%. Semiconductor technologies demand was driven by the ongoing transition to more advanced node technologies resulting from growth in electronics mega trends. Semi tech was up mid-teens for the full year and we expect to continue to outpace MSI growth as we head into 2022. We are seeing more investments in semiconductor capacity, which we expect to be a positive for us in the long-term. Industrial Solutions was up mid-teens during the quarter on volume growth, which was driven by ongoing strength for Caleres and Vesta [ph] within electronics and industrial end markets, along with strong demand for medical silicones and biopharma and healthcare applications. Organic growth for Industrial Solutions was up mid-teens for the full year as well. As expected, organic sales growth for Interconnect Solutions was down in the quarter, reflecting the anticipated impact of the shift in demand related to premium next-generation smartphones to the first half of 2021, along with softness in automotive end-markets related to the semi chip shortage. For the full year, organic SaaS growth for our Interconnect Solutions was up mid single-digits and we expect to return to a more traditional seasonality in 2022. In addition, we recently completed our Kapton expansion project here in the U.S., which expands our production of polyamide film and flexible circuit board materials. We will begin qualifying materials in the first half of this year for high value applications, which will start to accelerate in the second half of 2022. For W&P, 17% organic sales growth during the quarter consisted of a 12% increase in volume, including volume gains in all three businesses and 5% pricing gains. Sales gains were led by high-teens organic growth in Safety Solutions as continued recovery in industrial end markets resulted in significant volume improvement for Nomex and Kevlar air and mid fibers. Within Water Solutions, high-teens organic sales growth reflects strong global demand for water technologies, primarily in industrial and desalination markets. Shelter Solutions sales increased on mid-teens organic growth, driven by continued strength in North American residential construction and continued recovery in commercial construction led by higher demand for quarry and services. Year-over-year pricing gains of 5% during the quarter relate primarily to actions taken in safety and shelter in response to raw material inflation and also reflect sequential price improvement from all three business lines and W&P versus the third quarter. For the full year, W&P delivered 10% organic sales growth on 8% volume improvement and 2% pricing gains. Safety and Shelter Solutions were up low double digits organically, and Water Solutions was up mid-single digits for the year. The global demand for clean water technologies remained strong and expanding our capacity remains a priority for us. For M&M, 13% organic sales growth during the quarter was driven by a 16% increase in price, offset slightly by a 3% decline in volumes. M&M within the segment, within our portfolio most significantly impacted by raw material inflation. The 60% local price increase during the quarter reflects continued actions taken to offset higher raw material and logistics costs. Volume declines reflect softness in global auto production due to supply constraints, primarily the semiconductor chip shortage. For the year, M&M organic sales growth was 24% on 12% higher volume and 12% pricing gains. All three business lines within M&M delivered organic sales growth of greater than 20% for the full year. Turning to Slide 7, adjusted EPS of $1.08 per share was up 54% from $0.70 per share in the year ago period. Higher volumes and strong results from Laird more than offset higher logistics costs and other operating items such as cat time start-up costs. Below-the-line items continue to benefit our EPS results compared to the year ago period, primarily a lower share count. Lower interest expense was mainly offset by a higher tax rate. For full year 2022, we expect our base tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 23%. Let me close with a few comments on our financial outlook on Slide 8. We expect continued top line strength across the portfolio in 2022, led by ongoing strength in semiconductors as the industry continues to operate near capacity to meet demand, and consistent demand in areas such as industrial technologies, smartphone sales, housing starts and water filtration. Our plan assumes these market dynamics will lead to solid volume growth in 2022. In 2022, we are planning that raw material and logistics costs will remain at elevated levels with approximately $600 million of year-over-year headwinds versus 2021, primarily in the first half. Once again, the raw material inflation will be predominantly in our M&M segment. In response, we are implementing more price increases in all businesses, which will enable us to offset raw material and logistics costs on a full year basis, but we will lag in the first quarter. We expect our operating EBITDA margins to improve throughout 2022, driven by volume growth, productivity, acquisition synergies and full implementation of pricing actions. In the first quarter, we expect net sales between $4.2 billion and $4.3 billion and operating EBITDA between $940 million and $980 million. At the midpoint of our guidance range, we are anticipating first quarter operating EBITDA margins to be about flat sequentially with the fourth quarter 2021. We expect sequential improvement in E&I and M&M to be offset by W&P as manufacturing cost increases stemming from the Omicron variant and ongoing logistics cost headwinds lead to sequential margin decline. For the full year, net sales of $17.4 billion to $17.8 billion and operating EBITDA of approximately $4.4 billion at the midpoint reflects volume growth and acceleration of additional pricing gains throughout the year to offset the impact of both raw material and logistics cost increases. We expect operating EBITDA margin in the back half of 2022 to return to more normalized levels as impacts from the Omicron variance subsides as well as gains from volume improvement, productivity actions, acquisition synergies and full implementation of price increases. In closing, I want to note that our guidance is based on the current DuPont portfolio today, including the businesses and scope of the planned M&M divestiture. Once we sign a deal, the in-scope M&M businesses will move to discontinued operations, and we will reset the guidance for remaining DuPont. With that, let me turn the call back to Ed.\nEd Breen: Thanks, Lori. Let me close by summarizing why I am excited about 2022 at DuPont. Our results demonstrate that our businesses deliver the solutions our customers demand and a tight supply chain and challenging logistics environment, we delivered 6% volume growth well ahead of our expectations coming into the quarter. Our teams continue to work closely with our customers to understand their complex material challenges and to win business by delivering innovative and sustainable solutions. You can also see our teams are managing every lever within our control. This is evident through our delivery of pricing gains to offset every dollar of raw material inflation in 2021, and these actions continue into 2022. In addition to having our fundamentals in place, we are on track to complete a few substantial steps in the transformation of DuPont in 2022 with the planned Rogers acquisition and the M&M divestiture. These transactions as well as the potential for additional M&A in strategic areas, position DuPont as a premier multi-industrial company, focused in the areas of electronics, water, industrial technologies, protection and next-generation auto. And finally, because of our ability to complete this transformation while maintaining a strong balance sheet, we will be in a position to generate value for all stakeholders through organic and inorganic investment in our businesses and by staying committed to our dividend and share repurchases as we announced today. I look forward to providing you updates on each of these areas as we progress through 2022. With that, let me turn it to Pat to open the Q&A.\nPat Fitzgerald: Thanks, Ed. Before we move to the Q&A portion of our call, I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Ed and Lori.\nEd Breen: Good morning.\nJeff Sprague: Two questions for me. First, just on M&M. Ed, is the tenor of the discussion around valuation still in the ballpark of what you were thinking back in November, kind of given the market turmoil that we\u2019re looking at?\nEd Breen: Yes. No change to the comment I made last time, feeling very good about the process. Multiple people very interested in the asset, and we\u2019re moving along as quickly as we can here. We will have a deal to announce before the end of the first quarter.\nJeff Sprague: Great. And then just thinking about the portfolio after this, I have done a lot of the benchmarking work myself and the company does look a lot different when this is behind you. But I just wonder if you could give us a sense of what you think the organic growth profile of the company is once you get these two moves done. And should we be expecting kind of other portfolio moves? Or we\u2019re moving more into maybe, I don\u2019t know, maybe bolt-on acquisition mode with a focus on organic growth perhaps.\nEd Breen: Yes. Jeff, a couple of comments. And by the way, I think it really does transform the portfolio into a premier multi-industrial. If you look at just the fourth quarter results, if you take M&M out, the portfolio grew volume 10%. It was 6% with M&M in it. And by the way, if you look at the EBITDA margin profile, it would improve by 190 basis points with M&M out. So as we said before, with this move we\u2019re making, we\u2019re definitely going to improve our top line and the stability of it. We\u2019re going to improve our EBITDA margins, and we\u2019re clearly significantly reducing cyclicality M&M portfolio. And by the way, I think in Lori\u2019s comments or my comments, 70% of our raw material increases this year were in the M&M segment. By the way, we\u2019re getting significant price and covering it, but somewhere down the road is commodity, cost online, the pricing unwinds. And if it was in the DuPont portfolio, by the way, our organic growth rate little care for a year. even though the M&M business is a phenomenal business and a great cash generator. So it really fixes a lot of things and have been, of course, adding Laird and Rogers by the way, the consistency of those secular end markets that we\u2019re adding in are very nice. And I give you an overall comment. When you look at the pie chart on a new DuPont after these moves are made, by the way and assuming maybe another key acquisition happens that we add into one of these secular areas we talked about our five areas, you have about 45% of the portfolio that outgrows GDP and about 55% of the portfolio probably somewhere around GDP. So we are really very much tweaking that end market secular exposure we have to have a really consistent nice higher organic growth rate in the company.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Thank you.\nEd Breen: Bye, Jeff.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research.\nScott Davis: Hi, good morning, Ed, Lori and Pat.\nEd Breen: Good morning, Scott.\nLori Koch: Good morning.\nScott Davis: Good luck with M&M. Looks like we\u2019re going to get an announcement in another couple of months. But I want to switch over to W&P, because it seems to be back on track, pretty big core growth numbers even excluding price. What was it your ability to meet customer demand in the quarter that changed? Or the actual customer orders go up substantially in the quarter? And is this business just a little lumpier than perhaps we may think it is? And you\u2019re going to have some ebbs and flows.\nEd Breen: Yes. A couple of things, Scott. First of all, the order rates have continued to go up. In the last couple of weeks, we\u2019ve had really nice order input in the business. So that\u2019s continuing on a nice trend, and it\u2019s almost every one of those end markets that Lori touched on in her prepared remarks. But we also, in the quarter, did a nice job getting through some of our, call it, past due backlog. By the way, one of the areas, if you all remember this quarter, we had 19% growth in the water business, and the two quarters before that, we highlighted to you that we were having a tough time getting some shipments out the door in the water business. And we had low single-digit growth in the \u2013 if you combine the second and third quarter, and it obviously should have been higher in the second and third quarter. So we really got a lot of the logistics cleaned up, the port\u2019s cleaned up a little bit in some of the areas where we ship our water products, and we got 19%. So we flushed out a lot of that second and third quarter. Having said that, the water orders coming in still look very robust. So we\u2019re feeling good about what we\u2019re getting out the door to satisfy our customers and the order intake still coming into the company. So, on the point I made a minute ago to Jeff, you combined W&P and E&I, which will be the new portfolio, 10% volume growth in the quarter on top of us getting pricing.\nScott Davis: Right. And Ed is the strategy to price around raws or price and raws plus logistics?\nEd Breen: Yes. Scott, it\u2019s to get both. What I think happened to everybody. You see your input costs on the raws, and we\u2019ve been getting pricing, like we said, we covered it 100% in 2021. But the logistics costs, especially ocean freight, just started going bonkers around October, November, kept going up in December. And it wasn\u2019t even up and staying up. It was continuing to go up and some of the ocean freight is literally up 700%, 800%. It\u2019s crazy. So I think everyone is still chasing that, and that\u2019s really a big part of our story in the first quarter in W&P, where we\u2019re implementing more pricing \u2013 well, by the way, we\u2019re implementing more pricing actions across the portfolio, but we\u2019re really going at it on the W&P side, because they have more of our logistics costs than the other two businesses. And we\u2019re putting through more pricing there. So as we get into second quarter for W&P will start into see margin improvement keep building as we go through the year.\nScott Davis: Okay, helpful. Good luck, everybody.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.\nSteve Tusa: Hi, good morning, guys.\nLori Koch: Good morning.\nEd Breen: Hi, Steve, good morning.\nSteve Tusa: Are you still thinking kind of the same \u2013 I know the market has been a little bit volatile, but any update on your expectation for the multiple for M&M ultimately?\nEd Breen: Yes. I stick with my comments that I made last time. I think when I made the comments, our 2021 multiple was a little shy of 11%, and I said we will get more than that for this asset, but I think our multiple now is still a little shy of 11% in 2022. And I stick with my comment that I made last time.\nSteve Tusa: Great. And then just the kind of price cost dynamics first half to second half, I am sure that\u2019s part of the kind of seasonal ramp. I know it\u2019s a little bit tough to tease out what normal seasonality here is for this new portfolio, but maybe just put that in the context of the 1Q EBITDA guide, if you could? I\u2019m sure that\u2019s an aspect.\nLori Koch: Yes. So in the first quarter, we still see logistics as a headwind to earnings. They are probably in the same range that we called out for the fourth quarter of $50 million. So as the year goes on, we will expect to offset that to land neutral on a full year basis on those raw material escalation and logistics. So that\u2019s a piece of our sequential margin improvement as the year goes on kind of getting back into more normal patterns in the second half. Another benefit that we will see as the year goes on, it\u2019s really just the volume drift and so we will expect sales to increase coming out of Q1 to get to the full year guide of a midpoint of $17.6 billion. And beyond that, just the lift that we\u2019re expecting around productivity as we enact and productivity actions get more synergies out of the layer transaction. So we\u2019re doing really well there. We\u2019ve actually upped our expectations slightly from $60 million when we announced the deal. So now we\u2019re targeting closer to $63 million from the Laid synergies. So all of those things combined are what\u2019s giving us confidence in the margin ramp coming out of Q1.\nSteve Tusa: Great. Alright, thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate it.\nEd Breen: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse.\nJohn Walsh: Hi, good morning, everyone.\nEd Breen: Good morning, John.\nJohn Walsh: Maybe just circling back to the guidance, if we look at 2021, you outperformed your initial guide by about 8% on EBITDA at the midpoint in the face of a lot of inflationary pressures. As we think about 2022 and how you kind of set the initial guide, is it really just running forward some supply chain continuation of the current environment or is there anything that\u2019s DuPont specific that we should be aware about when you set that guidance?\nLori Koch: No. I wouldn\u2019t say there is anything DuPont-specific. So obviously, we still have caution in the first quarter around not being able to cover the logistics headwind as well as primarily within our W&P segment, some impacts on production because of Omicron. So we\u2019re seeing some lower production rates in January, primarily in our W&P business, which has large facilities here in the U.S. They have seen some absenteeism from the Omicron variant that\u2019s leading to lower production on assets that usually one sold-out, as well as higher labor costs as we deal with some overtime. So the margin profile that we have at the midpoint in Q1 of 22.8%, we expect to escalate as the year goes on landing more to 25% on a full year basis. But to your question, I wouldn\u2019t say there is anything different in our methodology about how we provide guidance for the full year versus any other company.\nEd Breen: Yes, I would add one other comment also. Lori and I plan that raw material inflation stays where it\u2019s at for the full year. So that\u2019s an assumption that we have in our planning. So again, we\u2019ve got to continue to get the price to cover the logistics and any other raw inflation that we see. And we are, again, enacting across all the portfolio as we enter the new year here. That continues. But we\u2019re making that assumption that it stays up here, and we got to get it covered.\nLori Koch: Yes. So I\u2019ll say we\u2019re expecting another $250 million in Q1 year-over-year, probably about the same range in Q2, and then we expect it to plateau not decline, but plateau in the second half.\nJohn Walsh: Great. Thank you for that color. And then maybe just a follow-up on how you\u2019re thinking about volumes by geography or major countries however you\u2019d like to speak on it as we think about 2022? Thank you.\nEd Breen: Yes, we expect continued robust growth again across the different regions. So in 2022, if you look at our guidance for it, 6% of the midpoint on a total company basis. But if you take out the headwind that\u2019s in non-core from the divestiture of the clean tech business, we\u2019re actually at about 8% total growth in 2022. So we see strength again in North America and Europe, Asia Pacific, all kind of up in the high single-digit range with a little tempering in Latin America. But again, Latin America is not a huge portion of our footprint.\nJohn Walsh: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nEd Breen: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. Just on W&P pricing in this cycle, how sticky do you think it will be this time around versus maybe prior cycles?\nLori Koch: Yes. I mean we are looking to get kind of in the mid-single digit price increases in this year, so we had 5% in Q4. We will look to maintain that pace through the first half. It obviously will temper a bit in the second half on a year-over-year basis as you lap the price increases that we started in Q3 and picked up in Q4. So, I would say W&P price stickiness is a little bit stickier than what we would see in the M&M business. We would expect that to the turnaround once the raw material starts to recede. So, we are hoping that we can maintain those price increases, but we will see what the raw material and the inflation environment looks like as we go forward.\nDavid Begleiter: Very good. And Ed, just on PFAS, any update on this issue? And what progress could you hope for this year in terms of removing the overhang? Thank you.\nEd Breen: Yes, David. Look, I think we are going to make very good progress this year. I will just give you a couple of things. Chemours, Corteva and DuPont are working extremely well together. I would say we are very synced up on wanting to get some outcomes here in the first half of 2022. So \u2013 and I mentioned that, David, because one of the issues we had a year ago before we signed the cooperation agreement and the structure we put in place between the three companies. We were just wasting a lot of time talking internally within the three companies and wasting, I think valuable time not being synced up because we didn\u2019t have that agreement in place. We are really, every single week now, in discussions with third-parties to resolve issues. We are literally synced up on weekly calls, and it feels really good that we can make progress. Obviously, the big focus would be getting the Water District cases settled on the PFAS side of things. We have a few states that will do some settlements with like we did in Delaware. And so we are feeling very, very good that we will make some progress. And again, a lot of conversation is going on presently and that\u2019s productive.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you.\nEd Breen: By the way, it\u2019s very high on the Ed Breen\u2019s personal list. I understand the importance of getting that stuff resolved and personally spending a lot of time on it.\nDavid Begleiter: That sounds great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Mizuho.\nChris Parkinson: Hi. Thank you very much. Just very quickly, could you speak to the current backdrop in semiconductors for \u201822, given the recent sector noise, the competitive environments? And just also how investors should be thinking about the current CapEx cycle flowing through your outlook for \u201823 and even potentially longer term? Thank you.\nEd Breen: Well, the CapEx piece, as we have said, we are going to be on the higher side for about 1.5 years here still. We have got a couple of these big expansion projects going on. We are just winding \u2013 so by the way, we are going to run about 6% on CapEx. We would like to, over the medium-term, run that more a little bit under 5%, mid-4s, high-4s, somewhere in that range. But we were just finished up the Kapton program, but we have got some water expansion stuff we are looking at. And obviously, we have the big Tyvek expansion which is our single biggest CapEx program going on over in Luxembourg right now that still goes on for about 1.5 years. So, we are going to run a little bit higher. But pretty much where our CapEx is going is where we need capacity, which is maybe a good problem to have.\nLori Koch: Yes. And I think on the semi CapEx front, obviously, the industry is running, I think, at about 98% capacity right now. So, contributing to the really strong growth that we saw overall semi in 2021 with 15%. We will look to have this strength again maybe in the high-single digits, low-double digits in 2022. So \u2013 and as they invest capacity and CapEx in the semi space obviously benefits our portfolio. So, we tend to outpace MSI for the amount of wafers produced by 200 basis points to 300 basis points. So, that number continues to show strength in the coming years from all of the demand and the capacity that\u2019s going in, we will participate in that uplift as well.\nEd Breen: Yes. Part of our growth, by the way, a nice piece of it, if you remember, from the teach-ins that John is a lot of more complex semiconductors, more layered chips and all that, and that plays to our advantage, it gives us growth. But growth is, as you all know, has been a little tempered to Lori\u2019s comment right now because we need new fabs to come on board. So, it looks like a nice business to be in over the next decade as new fabs come on, and we have seen a couple of announcements recently in the U.S. where some fabs are going. So, it looks like a nice trend for the next decade.\nChris Parkinson: And just you hit on all the follow-on topics on W&P between prepared remarks. I just want to push something out in terms of just given the strong pricing outlook, let\u2019s say, the eventually abating P&L and labor-related cost headwinds and then the growth outlook for, let\u2019s say, safety protective versus shelter. Could you just remind us and just give us your updated thoughts on normalized margins for that segment going forward, let\u2019s say \u201823 forward? Thank you.\nLori Koch: Yes. So W&P, as we had mentioned, we will see sequential margin deceleration from Q4 into Q1, really driven by the items that we had called out. But if you exclude the raw material and logistics net headwinds and the headwinds that we are seeing from a production perspective, the W&P margins in the quarter should be almost 500 basis points better than what we may post because of those headwinds. And so you are getting that more into the 26% range. I think going forward, that those margins should be in the 26%, 27% EBITDA margin profile.\nChris Parkinson: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John McNulty with BMO Capital.\nJohn McNulty: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Ed, it looks like you are going to have a mountain of cash once mobility is sold off. Can you speak to what you are seeing in terms of the M&A pipeline? It sounds like you have got some chunky targets out there with the volatility that we have seen in the market, have you seen those multiples come in at all? Are they still hanging in there? I guess how should we be thinking about that?\nEd Breen: Yes, I mean, I think generally, the multiples are hanging in there, but we will see how the year goes. We are, John, most likely won\u2019t do an acquisition until after we get the proceeds from M&M, which will be in the fourth quarter. And we are not missing out on something we want by waiting in that time window. So, we will see where things sit at that point in time. By the way, what we are looking at are things that are right in the wheelhouse of those five core secular growth areas I mentioned to you. So, we are not looking at something that\u2019s off another leg on the stool or something like that. We really feel we can beef up our opportunities in existing customers bases and expand customer bases and technology areas that we already know we sell into, and we can expand it and add to it. I think by the way, Laird and Rogers are two perfect examples of that. I am not saying it\u2019s in that area, but something like that defense will get a kind of cost synergies out of when we do it. So, that\u2019s kind of our timeline of what we are thinking that as we exit next \u2013 this year we are in now, possibility for an acquisition or two. By the way, this number could be, give or take, $1 billion, but we will probably be sitting on between cash flow, selling M&M, buying Rogers, CapEx, everything else that kind of goes into it, we will probably be sitting just for planning purposes with like $6 billion of excess cash, somewhere in that ZIP code as we consummate this year.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. No, that\u2019s helpful. And then just a question on the raw material and inflation front. I guess at this point, do you have actual constraints from a supply chain perspective where you are not \u2013 you are being kind of held back and putting out product at this point, like whether it\u2019s force majeures or logistical challenges or what have you? Are you pretty well squared away at this point? And now it\u2019s just the inflation that you have to worry about? And when will that maybe settle then?\nLori Koch: Yes. I would say, in general, the raw material constraints are pretty much behind us. There are some force majeures that we are dealing with, but they are not holding back our production. What is holding back our production is what I had mentioned earlier with some of the Omicron absenteeism at some of our sites in the U.S. that\u2019s primarily impacting the W&P segment. So, we had planned our Q1 guidance, but that doesn\u2019t materially get better versus what we saw in January. So, that\u2019s really the only place where we are seeing constraints in production.\nEd Breen: And we would think that\u2019s really a one quarter issue the way Omicron is now coming down. We had a key production facility. We missed two days of production. I think it was two weeks ago, lack of staffing. We were back up on the third day. It\u2019s things like that. We are paying everyone overtime to work more hours, and that\u2019s costing us money. And a lot of that, we obviously plan will subside here sometime in the first quarter. But from a planning purpose, we just made the assumption that January, February and March will all look the same because of Omicron and those type of issues.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. Thanks very much for the color.\nEd Breen: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.\nSteve Byrne: Yes. Thank you. Would you attribute the 9% volume growth in E&I to your customers just running harder and some capacity expansions, or is this also from share gains? And if the latter, what precludes you from not getting more price in the segment? Is that only possible with a price mix shift? And can you preclude the legacy products from declining in price?\nLori Koch: Yes. So, I would say it\u2019s a combination of just a really robust end markets within E&I as well as some share gain primarily within the semi space. And so our semi segment was up 22% in the quarter. That\u2019s mainly volume. Back to the earlier comment around the fabs running full out as well as some share gains on our point and also some benefit in the mix of chips that are being produced or those chips that have more advanced nodes favor our portfolio. And as far as price, we are getting price. It\u2019s netting out to a slight headwinds because there is a normalcy that goes on within the Electronics segment. And so we have sized that about 1% annual fees in the E&I segment that happens across the electronics industry. That\u2019s not something that\u2019s just a DuPont factor that goes on across electronics. And so if you take that out, we actually did net some price to be able to offset the raw material headwinds that we are seeing within E&I. But back to the pie chart that we provided in our slides, E&I is the smallest portion of our portfolio that has headwinds on the raw material front, only about 10% of the headwinds that we saw of the $250 million in the quarter was from E&I.\nSteve Byrne: And in your remarks, Lori, you mentioned about the water technologies focusing on industrial end markets and desalination. So, you clearly have the platform for purification. My question for you, do you have the right technology or do you need to hold on to it to expand from purification to extraction such as extracting minerals out of brine like lithium?\nEd Breen: We are \u2013 let me just answer it this way. We are \u2013 we would love to do an acquisition in the water area, and you would probably pick up some technologies in that area. There are technologies we would like to add in the portfolio. By the way, there is not a ton of water assets out there. But as you know, we did four acquisitions. I don\u2019t know what \u2013 the end of \u201819 and moved the track at time here. They were all smaller, but now we are growing really nice. So, that is a potential path for us. If there is not something a little chunkier that we really, really like. But that\u2019s a space we just feel the next couple of decades are great secular growth areas, and we have got great technology already we would like to add to, probably very similar in the Laird and Rogers coming into E&I, how that adds on to existing technologies we have. So, definitely an area of interest and could pick up some of those technologies in that extraction area.\nSteve Byrne: Thank you.\nEd Breen: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Roberts with UBS.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you. You had uneven quarterly comps in interconnects in 2021 due to the smartphone launch timings and automotive. Any insights into the quarterly comps as we go through 2022, where are the really uneven comparisons?\nLori Koch: Yes. So, we will go back to a more seasonal pattern in 2022, so that does create a headwind in Q1 because in Q1 of 2021, we were un-seasonally high. That will resolve as the year goes on and create a tailwind in the back half. But overall, the seasonality will be more normal with Q3 being the highest as we supply materials into the smartphone space in advance of the Christmas sales.\nJohn Roberts: Then on Slide 5, can you help us understand the headwinds that stay with DuPont or would continue in DuPont versus M&M.? So, how much of the logistics $50 million is continuing DuPont versus M&M? And in the part of M&M that stays with DuPont, is it performing in line with the rest of M&M, or is it outperforming overall?\nLori Koch: Yes. So, on the logistics front, of the $50 million, about $40 million stays in DuPont with the biggest piece of that being in W&P. So, only about 10 of the 50 was within M&M. And as far as the business is staying with DuPont, it\u2019s primarily adhesives and multi-based heritage Dow businesses. Fair margin profile is lower than the M&M segment today. We saw some significant headwinds on the price cost in 2021. We will look for that to improve heading into 2022, but their margin profile was slightly below where M&M is.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.\nVincent Andrews: Hi. Thank you. Good morning. Just a couple of cleanup questions here. I know you laid out sort of the shape of your raw material expectations for 2022. On logistics, as you called out, the crazy numbers that we are seeing in ocean freight, are you assuming that, that stays the same through the year, or are you allowing for that to correct a little bit in the back half?\nLori Koch: So, it corrects in the back half, primarily in the fourth quarter as we lap that $50 million headwind that we saw in 4Q 2021. So, we will look for them to remain elevated Q1 through Q3 on a year-over-year basis and then Q4 moderate. The one difference coming out of Q1 is we do expect to get price coming out of Q1 into Q2 and beyond to offset that headwind in logistics.\nVincent Andrews: Okay. And then just on the semis and maybe just going even into the tiers and the auto customers. There is chatter out there depending on who you are listening to that maybe there is some double ordering in semis or maybe the tiers have built up inventory waiting for the auto production to come back. But as you look across your businesses and your customer relationships and what you are seeing and hearing, what\u2019s your point of view on any of that stuff?\nLori Koch: Yes. We are not feeling any inventory build that would create a headwind as you head into 2020. I mean keep in mind, there is a little bit of a timing disconnect between the results within the M&M segment from a volume perspective and auto builds. And so in 2021, we significantly outpaced with volumes up 12% versus auto build up 2%. So, that could moderate a bit with respect to our performance versus auto builds in 2022. But overall, I don\u2019t feel like any inventory is building in the channel. And on the semi front, I think it would be hard to be building inventory in semi just given the market is constrained. So, we don\u2019t feel it there either.\nVincent Andrews: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions today. I will now turn the conference back over to Pat Fitzgerald for closing comments.\nPat Fitzgerald: Thank you, everyone, for joining our call. For your reference, a copy of our transcript will be posted to the DuPont website. Please join us on March 3rd for our next teach-in, which will include the Industrial Solutions line of business within our E&I segment. I hope you can join us. Thank you again. This concludes our call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Lori Koch",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed and good morning, everyone. As Ed mentioned, customer demand in our key end markets remained strong in the fourth quarter. We continue to face unprecedented global supply chain challenges and rising inflation. However, the swift pricing actions that we continue to implement are benefiting top line performance and maintaining earnings on a dollars basis. These factors, along with our intense focus on execution, contributed to net sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS results above our guidance. In addition, we had solid cash flow generation and returned over $650 million in capital to shareholders during the quarter through $500 million in share repurchases and over $150 million in dividends. For the year, we returned more than $2.7 billion in capital to shareholders through $2.1 billion in share repurchases and $600 million in dividends. Turning to Slide 4, net sales of $4.3 billion were up 14% versus the fourth quarter of 2020, up 13% on an organic basis. Organic sales growth consists of 7% price gains, reflecting the continued actions we are taking to address inflationary pressure and 6% volume growth. A 2% portfolio tailwind reflects the net impact of strong top line results related to our acquisition of Laird and headwinds from non-core divestitures. Currency was a 1% headwind in the quarter. Overall, sales growth was broad-based and reflects double-digit organic growth in all four regions and high single-digit to double-digit organic growth in all three reporting segments. From an earnings perspective, we reported fourth quarter operating EBITDA of $973 million and adjusted EPS of $1.08 per share, up 5% and 54% respectively from the year ago period. Our incremental margin in the quarter was pressured by price costs and logistics. Net of these impacts, our incremental margin was about 33% in 4Q. Ed mentioned earlier, the pricing actions that we took throughout the year, resulting in us offsetting about $250 million of raw material inflation in the quarter and we also ended the year price cost neutral. The raw material inflation coupled with about $50 million of higher logistics cost in the quarter were headwinds to our margins. I will provide more detail of the margin compression we saw in the quarter in a few minutes. From a segment perspective, E&I delivered 10% operating EBITDA growth on volume gains and earnings uplift from Laird, which more than offset raw material and logistics segments as well as startup costs associated with our Kapton capacity expansion. In W&P, operating EBITDA increased 7% as pricing gains and volume growth more than offset higher raw material and logistics cost. We will remain disciplined in our pricing approach as we move into 2022 to address continued inflation. M&M operating EBITDA declined 3% as net pricing gains were more than offset by lower equity earnings due to higher natural gas costs in Europe. In the quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $621 million and CapEx was $184 million, resulting in free cash flow of $437 million. Free cash flow conversion was 100%. In addition, we received gross proceeds of about $500 million during the quarter from our Clean Technologies divestiture, which was closed at the end of December. Before we go to the next slide, I would also like to make a few comments on our full year performance. Full year net sales of $16.7 billion grew 16% and were up 14% on an organic basis. The organic growth consists of a 10% increase in volume and a 4% increase in price. Organic sales growth reflects double-digit growth in all four regions and in all three reporting segments. Further, all 9 of our business lines had organic growth in 2021 and 7 of the 9 business lines grew double-digits. The 10% increase in volume for the year consists of gains in all 3 reporting segments and within all 9 business lines, reflecting robust global customer demand in secular growth areas such as electronics and water, along with recovery in end markets negatively impacted by the pandemic in prior year, such as automotive, commercial construction and select industrial markets. Full year operating EBITDA of $4.2 billion increased 21%, reflecting 1.3x operating leverage, operating EBITDA margin expansion of about 100 basis points, an incremental margin of 32%. Operating EBITDA increased for all three reporting segments during the year. Full year adjusted EPS of $4.30 per share was up about 95% from prior year on higher segment earnings, a lower share count and lower interest expense. Slide 5 shows the impact that price cost inflation had on our operating EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter. As costs continued to rise throughout 2021, our fourth quarter results reflect the largest headwind to quarterly margins for the year. In total, pricing actions fully offset about $250 million of raw material inflation, which was higher than our expectations for input costs coming into the quarter and mainly in the M&M segment. While our pricing actions have enabled us to maintain earnings, the price cost inflation resulted in a significant headwind of about 150 basis points to operating EBITDA margins versus the year ago period. Additionally, higher logistics cost of about $50 million in the quarter resulted in a margin headwind of about 120 basis points. Offsetting the headwinds from raws and logistics was a 70 basis point improvement in operating EBITDA margin, which includes volume growth in E&I and W&P and the benefit associated with the Laird acquisition. If you exclude the price cost and logistics headwinds in the quarter on an ex-M&M segment basis, our operating EBITDA margin was above 26.5% in the fourth quarter, further illustrating our strong performance and putting an emphasis on our planned portfolio actions. Turning to Slide 6, which provides more detail on the year-over-year changes in the net sales for the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, organic sales growth of 13% during the quarter consist of 7% pricing gains and 6% volume growth. In E&I volume gains delivered 9% organic sales growth for the segment led by higher volumes in semiconductor technologies of more than 20%. Semiconductor technologies demand was driven by the ongoing transition to more advanced node technologies resulting from growth in electronics mega trends. Semi tech was up mid-teens for the full year and we expect to continue to outpace MSI growth as we head into 2022. We are seeing more investments in semiconductor capacity, which we expect to be a positive for us in the long-term. Industrial Solutions was up mid-teens during the quarter on volume growth, which was driven by ongoing strength for Caleres and Vesta [ph] within electronics and industrial end markets, along with strong demand for medical silicones and biopharma and healthcare applications. Organic growth for Industrial Solutions was up mid-teens for the full year as well. As expected, organic sales growth for Interconnect Solutions was down in the quarter, reflecting the anticipated impact of the shift in demand related to premium next-generation smartphones to the first half of 2021, along with softness in automotive end-markets related to the semi chip shortage. For the full year, organic SaaS growth for our Interconnect Solutions was up mid single-digits and we expect to return to a more traditional seasonality in 2022. In addition, we recently completed our Kapton expansion project here in the U.S., which expands our production of polyamide film and flexible circuit board materials. We will begin qualifying materials in the first half of this year for high value applications, which will start to accelerate in the second half of 2022. For W&P, 17% organic sales growth during the quarter consisted of a 12% increase in volume, including volume gains in all three businesses and 5% pricing gains. Sales gains were led by high-teens organic growth in Safety Solutions as continued recovery in industrial end markets resulted in significant volume improvement for Nomex and Kevlar air and mid fibers. Within Water Solutions, high-teens organic sales growth reflects strong global demand for water technologies, primarily in industrial and desalination markets. Shelter Solutions sales increased on mid-teens organic growth, driven by continued strength in North American residential construction and continued recovery in commercial construction led by higher demand for quarry and services. Year-over-year pricing gains of 5% during the quarter relate primarily to actions taken in safety and shelter in response to raw material inflation and also reflect sequential price improvement from all three business lines and W&P versus the third quarter. For the full year, W&P delivered 10% organic sales growth on 8% volume improvement and 2% pricing gains. Safety and Shelter Solutions were up low double digits organically, and Water Solutions was up mid-single digits for the year. The global demand for clean water technologies remained strong and expanding our capacity remains a priority for us. For M&M, 13% organic sales growth during the quarter was driven by a 16% increase in price, offset slightly by a 3% decline in volumes. M&M within the segment, within our portfolio most significantly impacted by raw material inflation. The 60% local price increase during the quarter reflects continued actions taken to offset higher raw material and logistics costs. Volume declines reflect softness in global auto production due to supply constraints, primarily the semiconductor chip shortage. For the year, M&M organic sales growth was 24% on 12% higher volume and 12% pricing gains. All three business lines within M&M delivered organic sales growth of greater than 20% for the full year. Turning to Slide 7, adjusted EPS of $1.08 per share was up 54% from $0.70 per share in the year ago period. Higher volumes and strong results from Laird more than offset higher logistics costs and other operating items such as cat time start-up costs. Below-the-line items continue to benefit our EPS results compared to the year ago period, primarily a lower share count. Lower interest expense was mainly offset by a higher tax rate. For full year 2022, we expect our base tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 23%. Let me close with a few comments on our financial outlook on Slide 8. We expect continued top line strength across the portfolio in 2022, led by ongoing strength in semiconductors as the industry continues to operate near capacity to meet demand, and consistent demand in areas such as industrial technologies, smartphone sales, housing starts and water filtration. Our plan assumes these market dynamics will lead to solid volume growth in 2022. In 2022, we are planning that raw material and logistics costs will remain at elevated levels with approximately $600 million of year-over-year headwinds versus 2021, primarily in the first half. Once again, the raw material inflation will be predominantly in our M&M segment. In response, we are implementing more price increases in all businesses, which will enable us to offset raw material and logistics costs on a full year basis, but we will lag in the first quarter. We expect our operating EBITDA margins to improve throughout 2022, driven by volume growth, productivity, acquisition synergies and full implementation of pricing actions. In the first quarter, we expect net sales between $4.2 billion and $4.3 billion and operating EBITDA between $940 million and $980 million. At the midpoint of our guidance range, we are anticipating first quarter operating EBITDA margins to be about flat sequentially with the fourth quarter 2021. We expect sequential improvement in E&I and M&M to be offset by W&P as manufacturing cost increases stemming from the Omicron variant and ongoing logistics cost headwinds lead to sequential margin decline. For the full year, net sales of $17.4 billion to $17.8 billion and operating EBITDA of approximately $4.4 billion at the midpoint reflects volume growth and acceleration of additional pricing gains throughout the year to offset the impact of both raw material and logistics cost increases. We expect operating EBITDA margin in the back half of 2022 to return to more normalized levels as impacts from the Omicron variance subsides as well as gains from volume improvement, productivity actions, acquisition synergies and full implementation of price increases. In closing, I want to note that our guidance is based on the current DuPont portfolio today, including the businesses and scope of the planned M&M divestiture. Once we sign a deal, the in-scope M&M businesses will move to discontinued operations, and we will reset the guidance for remaining DuPont. With that, let me turn the call back to Ed. Good morning. Good morning. Yes. So in the first quarter, we still see logistics as a headwind to earnings. They are probably in the same range that we called out for the fourth quarter of $50 million. So as the year goes on, we will expect to offset that to land neutral on a full year basis on those raw material escalation and logistics. So that's a piece of our sequential margin improvement as the year goes on kind of getting back into more normal patterns in the second half. Another benefit that we will see as the year goes on, it's really just the volume drift and so we will expect sales to increase coming out of Q1 to get to the full year guide of a midpoint of $17.6 billion. And beyond that, just the lift that we're expecting around productivity as we enact and productivity actions get more synergies out of the layer transaction. So we're doing really well there. We've actually upped our expectations slightly from $60 million when we announced the deal. So now we're targeting closer to $63 million from the Laid synergies. So all of those things combined are what's giving us confidence in the margin ramp coming out of Q1. No. I wouldn't say there is anything DuPont-specific. So obviously, we still have caution in the first quarter around not being able to cover the logistics headwind as well as primarily within our W&P segment, some impacts on production because of Omicron. So we're seeing some lower production rates in January, primarily in our W&P business, which has large facilities here in the U.S. They have seen some absenteeism from the Omicron variant that's leading to lower production on assets that usually one sold-out, as well as higher labor costs as we deal with some overtime. So the margin profile that we have at the midpoint in Q1 of 22.8%, we expect to escalate as the year goes on landing more to 25% on a full year basis. But to your question, I wouldn't say there is anything different in our methodology about how we provide guidance for the full year versus any other company. Yes. So I'll say we're expecting another $250 million in Q1 year-over-year, probably about the same range in Q2, and then we expect it to plateau not decline, but plateau in the second half. Yes. I mean we are looking to get kind of in the mid-single digit price increases in this year, so we had 5% in Q4. We will look to maintain that pace through the first half. It obviously will temper a bit in the second half on a year-over-year basis as you lap the price increases that we started in Q3 and picked up in Q4. So, I would say W&P price stickiness is a little bit stickier than what we would see in the M&M business. We would expect that to the turnaround once the raw material starts to recede. So, we are hoping that we can maintain those price increases, but we will see what the raw material and the inflation environment looks like as we go forward. Yes. And I think on the semi CapEx front, obviously, the industry is running, I think, at about 98% capacity right now. So, contributing to the really strong growth that we saw overall semi in 2021 with 15%. We will look to have this strength again maybe in the high-single digits, low-double digits in 2022. So \u2013 and as they invest capacity and CapEx in the semi space obviously benefits our portfolio. So, we tend to outpace MSI for the amount of wafers produced by 200 basis points to 300 basis points. So, that number continues to show strength in the coming years from all of the demand and the capacity that's going in, we will participate in that uplift as well. Yes. So W&P, as we had mentioned, we will see sequential margin deceleration from Q4 into Q1, really driven by the items that we had called out. But if you exclude the raw material and logistics net headwinds and the headwinds that we are seeing from a production perspective, the W&P margins in the quarter should be almost 500 basis points better than what we may post because of those headwinds. And so you are getting that more into the 26% range. I think going forward, that those margins should be in the 26%, 27% EBITDA margin profile. Yes. I would say, in general, the raw material constraints are pretty much behind us. There are some force majeures that we are dealing with, but they are not holding back our production. What is holding back our production is what I had mentioned earlier with some of the Omicron absenteeism at some of our sites in the U.S. that's primarily impacting the W&P segment. So, we had planned our Q1 guidance, but that doesn't materially get better versus what we saw in January. So, that's really the only place where we are seeing constraints in production. Yes. So, I would say it's a combination of just a really robust end markets within E&I as well as some share gain primarily within the semi space. And so our semi segment was up 22% in the quarter. That's mainly volume. Back to the earlier comment around the fabs running full out as well as some share gains on our point and also some benefit in the mix of chips that are being produced or those chips that have more advanced nodes favor our portfolio. And as far as price, we are getting price. It's netting out to a slight headwinds because there is a normalcy that goes on within the Electronics segment. And so we have sized that about 1% annual fees in the E&I segment that happens across the electronics industry. That's not something that's just a DuPont factor that goes on across electronics. And so if you take that out, we actually did net some price to be able to offset the raw material headwinds that we are seeing within E&I. But back to the pie chart that we provided in our slides, E&I is the smallest portion of our portfolio that has headwinds on the raw material front, only about 10% of the headwinds that we saw of the $250 million in the quarter was from E&I. Yes. So, we will go back to a more seasonal pattern in 2022, so that does create a headwind in Q1 because in Q1 of 2021, we were un-seasonally high. That will resolve as the year goes on and create a tailwind in the back half. But overall, the seasonality will be more normal with Q3 being the highest as we supply materials into the smartphone space in advance of the Christmas sales. Yes. So, on the logistics front, of the $50 million, about $40 million stays in DuPont with the biggest piece of that being in W&P. So, only about 10 of the 50 was within M&M. And as far as the business is staying with DuPont, it's primarily adhesives and multi-based heritage Dow businesses. Fair margin profile is lower than the M&M segment today. We saw some significant headwinds on the price cost in 2021. We will look for that to improve heading into 2022, but their margin profile was slightly below where M&M is. So, it corrects in the back half, primarily in the fourth quarter as we lap that $50 million headwind that we saw in 4Q 2021. So, we will look for them to remain elevated Q1 through Q3 on a year-over-year basis and then Q4 moderate. The one difference coming out of Q1 is we do expect to get price coming out of Q1 into Q2 and beyond to offset that headwind in logistics. Yes. We are not feeling any inventory build that would create a headwind as you head into 2020. I mean keep in mind, there is a little bit of a timing disconnect between the results within the M&M segment from a volume perspective and auto builds. And so in 2021, we significantly outpaced with volumes up 12% versus auto build up 2%. So, that could moderate a bit with respect to our performance versus auto builds in 2022. But overall, I don't feel like any inventory is building in the channel. And on the semi front, I think it would be hard to be building inventory in semi just given the market is constrained. So, we don't feel it there either."

            "name": "Ed Breen",
            "content": "Thanks, Pat and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter earnings call. In addition to discussing our fourth quarter results and outlook for 2022, this morning, I will also comment on the progress of both our intended acquisition of Rogers and our process for divesting a majority of the M&M segment. Our fourth quarter results were highlighted by 6% volume gains, including a 9% increase in the E&I segment and a 12% increase in W&P. M&M delivered top line results ahead of expectations, including volumes well ahead of global auto builds in the quarter. Customer demand was broad-based across the portfolio, led by greater than 20% volume growth in semiconductor technologies and high-teens volume growth in water. Our top line performance also reflects significant pricing actions we took to offset $250 million of raw material inflation in the quarter. We are seeing increases in all businesses with about three-fourths of the impact in M&M. Our teams have done an outstanding job monitoring our input costs and quickly translating that into price increases to remain price cost neutral for the year. We are taking additional actions as we work to offset logistics costs, which during the fourth quarter, were a $50 million headwind, mostly in W&P. I want to recognize and thank our employees who show up everyday in our factories to keep our lines running and supplying the necessary products and solutions to deliver results that we reported today. Their unwavering commitment in the face of a relentless pandemic, ongoing supply chain disruptions and logistic challenges deserves our gratitude. Turning to Slide 3, I will provide an update on our portfolio transformation and we will review how our focus on those strategic actions, balanced capital allocation and innovation-led growth position us extremely well heading into 2022 to continue unlocking value for our shareholders, innovating for our customers and creating opportunity for our employees. In November, we announced our planned acquisition of Rogers Corporation as well as our intent to divest a significant portion of our M&M segment. These portfolio actions will position DuPont among the top of the multi-industrial [indiscernible] with top quartile revenue growth, EBITDA margins and low cyclicality all hallmarks of top performing companies. Going forward, our business will be centered around the secular high growth pillars of electronics, water, industrial technologies, protection and next generation automotive. Our teams see strong customer demand across these pillars driven by mega trends such as the transition to hybrid and electric vehicles, clean water sustainability and the move to 5G. The preparation for the Rogers acquisition is well underway and on track for it in the second quarter closing. Several significant milestones in the pay after closing have already been achieved. In mid-December, the waiting period under the HSR expired here in the U.S. and regulatory processes in other parts of the world are underway. Just 2 weeks ago, on January 25, Rogers' shareholders voted to approve the transaction. Excitement is building for combining this business with our portfolio of electronics offerings, which includes our recent acquisition of Laird Performance Materials. Our teams are anxious to get to the point where we could start working with the application engineers, R&D and sales teams at Rogers to map out the revenue synergy opportunities to the areas of next generation auto, 5G infrastructure, defense electronics and clean energy. Combined with Laird, these acquisitions increased the total addressable market of our E&I business by approximately 50% and we are keeping our penetration into markets such as electric vehicles, consumer electronics and industrial technologies. A lot of work has been done to plan for the cost synergies associated with Rogers acquisition, which we expect to be approximately $150 million. We also have line of sight to about $63 million of cost synergies from the Laird acquisition from last summer which is ahead of our target. We are looking across both of the acquisitions as well as our existing E&I business to maximize our synergies through G&A and footprint optimization, along with procurement savings. We also announced that we have initiated a process to divest the majority of the M&M segment. Our work here is also on track and progressing well. As I had expected, there is a significant level of interest in this market leading asset and I am pleased with how the process is progressing. Our target is to have a signed agreement by the end of the first quarter with the closing in the fourth quarter of this year. In addition to positioning the company as a top performing multi-industrial, these transactions will enable us to transform the portfolio, while maintaining a strong balance sheet and continuing with a balanced financial policy. Today, we announced that our Board has approved a 10% per share increase to our dividend which is consistent with our commitment for a dividend payout in the range of 35% to 45% and to grow the dividend annually in line with earnings. In addition, our Board has also authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program which enables us to continue returning value to our shareholders as we expect to complete the remaining $375 million under our existing authorization in the first quarter ahead of the planned expiration. After paying down the financing associated with the Rogers acquisition, we expect to deploy a significant portion of the remaining M&M proceeds to do further M&A to build on our core areas of strength as well as additional share repurchases. We will also generate strong cash flow this year in addition to the $240 million gross proceeds from the biomaterials divestiture, which is the last of our non-core divestitures. Our strong balance sheet positions us well to deliver for all stakeholders through investment in our business, dividends, share repurchases and additional M&A. Finally, we will deliver shareholder value through staying focused on innovation, which is at the core of DuPont. The 6% volume growth we delivered in the quarter and 10% volume growth for the year benchmarks well against our top peers. For the quarter, our volume gains, excluding M&M segment were up 10%. These results are proof point that the work of our R&D teams and application engineers who spent countless hours working alongside our customers, solving their most complex challenges is an advantage in the marketplace. Our focus on innovation is also at the core of our ESG strategy through both innovation and our own processes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at our factories as well as new product innovations that support and advance our customer sustainability goals in areas such as clean water, clean energy, electric vehicles and connectivity. The levers of portfolio transformation, balanced capital allocation, and innovation led growth, is a powerful combination to create long-term shareholder value at DuPont. With that, let me turn it over to Lori to discuss the details of the quarter as well as our financial outlook. Thanks, Lori. Let me close by summarizing why I am excited about 2022 at DuPont. Our results demonstrate that our businesses deliver the solutions our customers demand and a tight supply chain and challenging logistics environment, we delivered 6% volume growth well ahead of our expectations coming into the quarter. Our teams continue to work closely with our customers to understand their complex material challenges and to win business by delivering innovative and sustainable solutions. You can also see our teams are managing every lever within our control. This is evident through our delivery of pricing gains to offset every dollar of raw material inflation in 2021, and these actions continue into 2022. In addition to having our fundamentals in place, we are on track to complete a few substantial steps in the transformation of DuPont in 2022 with the planned Rogers acquisition and the M&M divestiture. These transactions as well as the potential for additional M&A in strategic areas, position DuPont as a premier multi-industrial company, focused in the areas of electronics, water, industrial technologies, protection and next-generation auto. And finally, because of our ability to complete this transformation while maintaining a strong balance sheet, we will be in a position to generate value for all stakeholders through organic and inorganic investment in our businesses and by staying committed to our dividend and share repurchases as we announced today. I look forward to providing you updates on each of these areas as we progress through 2022. With that, let me turn it to Pat to open the Q&A. Good morning. Yes. No change to the comment I made last time, feeling very good about the process. Multiple people very interested in the asset, and we're moving along as quickly as we can here. We will have a deal to announce before the end of the first quarter. Yes. Jeff, a couple of comments. And by the way, I think it really does transform the portfolio into a premier multi-industrial. If you look at just the fourth quarter results, if you take M&M out, the portfolio grew volume 10%. It was 6% with M&M in it. And by the way, if you look at the EBITDA margin profile, it would improve by 190 basis points with M&M out. So as we said before, with this move we're making, we're definitely going to improve our top line and the stability of it. We're going to improve our EBITDA margins, and we're clearly significantly reducing cyclicality M&M portfolio. And by the way, I think in Lori's comments or my comments, 70% of our raw material increases this year were in the M&M segment. By the way, we're getting significant price and covering it, but somewhere down the road is commodity, cost online, the pricing unwinds. And if it was in the DuPont portfolio, by the way, our organic growth rate little care for a year. even though the M&M business is a phenomenal business and a great cash generator. So it really fixes a lot of things and have been, of course, adding Laird and Rogers by the way, the consistency of those secular end markets that we're adding in are very nice. And I give you an overall comment. When you look at the pie chart on a new DuPont after these moves are made, by the way and assuming maybe another key acquisition happens that we add into one of these secular areas we talked about our five areas, you have about 45% of the portfolio that outgrows GDP and about 55% of the portfolio probably somewhere around GDP. So we are really very much tweaking that end market secular exposure we have to have a really consistent nice higher organic growth rate in the company. Bye, Jeff. Good morning, Scott. Yes. A couple of things, Scott. First of all, the order rates have continued to go up. In the last couple of weeks, we've had really nice order input in the business. So that's continuing on a nice trend, and it's almost every one of those end markets that Lori touched on in her prepared remarks. But we also, in the quarter, did a nice job getting through some of our, call it, past due backlog. By the way, one of the areas, if you all remember this quarter, we had 19% growth in the water business, and the two quarters before that, we highlighted to you that we were having a tough time getting some shipments out the door in the water business. And we had low single-digit growth in the \u2013 if you combine the second and third quarter, and it obviously should have been higher in the second and third quarter. So we really got a lot of the logistics cleaned up, the port's cleaned up a little bit in some of the areas where we ship our water products, and we got 19%. So we flushed out a lot of that second and third quarter. Having said that, the water orders coming in still look very robust. So we're feeling good about what we're getting out the door to satisfy our customers and the order intake still coming into the company. So, on the point I made a minute ago to Jeff, you combined W&P and E&I, which will be the new portfolio, 10% volume growth in the quarter on top of us getting pricing. Yes. Scott, it's to get both. What I think happened to everybody. You see your input costs on the raws, and we've been getting pricing, like we said, we covered it 100% in 2021. But the logistics costs, especially ocean freight, just started going bonkers around October, November, kept going up in December. And it wasn't even up and staying up. It was continuing to go up and some of the ocean freight is literally up 700%, 800%. It's crazy. So I think everyone is still chasing that, and that's really a big part of our story in the first quarter in W&P, where we're implementing more pricing \u2013 well, by the way, we're implementing more pricing actions across the portfolio, but we're really going at it on the W&P side, because they have more of our logistics costs than the other two businesses. And we're putting through more pricing there. So as we get into second quarter for W&P will start into see margin improvement keep building as we go through the year. Hi, Steve, good morning. Yes. I stick with my comments that I made last time. I think when I made the comments, our 2021 multiple was a little shy of 11%, and I said we will get more than that for this asset, but I think our multiple now is still a little shy of 11% in 2022. And I stick with my comment that I made last time. Thanks, Steve. Good morning, John. Yes, I would add one other comment also. Lori and I plan that raw material inflation stays where it's at for the full year. So that's an assumption that we have in our planning. So again, we've got to continue to get the price to cover the logistics and any other raw inflation that we see. And we are, again, enacting across all the portfolio as we enter the new year here. That continues. But we're making that assumption that it stays up here, and we got to get it covered. Yes, we expect continued robust growth again across the different regions. So in 2022, if you look at our guidance for it, 6% of the midpoint on a total company basis. But if you take out the headwind that's in non-core from the divestiture of the clean tech business, we're actually at about 8% total growth in 2022. So we see strength again in North America and Europe, Asia Pacific, all kind of up in the high single-digit range with a little tempering in Latin America. But again, Latin America is not a huge portion of our footprint. Thanks, John. Yes, David. Look, I think we are going to make very good progress this year. I will just give you a couple of things. Chemours, Corteva and DuPont are working extremely well together. I would say we are very synced up on wanting to get some outcomes here in the first half of 2022. So \u2013 and I mentioned that, David, because one of the issues we had a year ago before we signed the cooperation agreement and the structure we put in place between the three companies. We were just wasting a lot of time talking internally within the three companies and wasting, I think valuable time not being synced up because we didn't have that agreement in place. We are really, every single week now, in discussions with third-parties to resolve issues. We are literally synced up on weekly calls, and it feels really good that we can make progress. Obviously, the big focus would be getting the Water District cases settled on the PFAS side of things. We have a few states that will do some settlements with like we did in Delaware. And so we are feeling very, very good that we will make some progress. And again, a lot of conversation is going on presently and that's productive. By the way, it's very high on the Ed Breen's personal list. I understand the importance of getting that stuff resolved and personally spending a lot of time on it. Well, the CapEx piece, as we have said, we are going to be on the higher side for about 1.5 years here still. We have got a couple of these big expansion projects going on. We are just winding \u2013 so by the way, we are going to run about 6% on CapEx. We would like to, over the medium-term, run that more a little bit under 5%, mid-4s, high-4s, somewhere in that range. But we were just finished up the Kapton program, but we have got some water expansion stuff we are looking at. And obviously, we have the big Tyvek expansion which is our single biggest CapEx program going on over in Luxembourg right now that still goes on for about 1.5 years. So, we are going to run a little bit higher. But pretty much where our CapEx is going is where we need capacity, which is maybe a good problem to have. Yes. Part of our growth, by the way, a nice piece of it, if you remember, from the teach-ins that John is a lot of more complex semiconductors, more layered chips and all that, and that plays to our advantage, it gives us growth. But growth is, as you all know, has been a little tempered to Lori's comment right now because we need new fabs to come on board. So, it looks like a nice business to be in over the next decade as new fabs come on, and we have seen a couple of announcements recently in the U.S. where some fabs are going. So, it looks like a nice trend for the next decade. Yes, I mean, I think generally, the multiples are hanging in there, but we will see how the year goes. We are, John, most likely won't do an acquisition until after we get the proceeds from M&M, which will be in the fourth quarter. And we are not missing out on something we want by waiting in that time window. So, we will see where things sit at that point in time. By the way, what we are looking at are things that are right in the wheelhouse of those five core secular growth areas I mentioned to you. So, we are not looking at something that's off another leg on the stool or something like that. We really feel we can beef up our opportunities in existing customers bases and expand customer bases and technology areas that we already know we sell into, and we can expand it and add to it. I think by the way, Laird and Rogers are two perfect examples of that. I am not saying it's in that area, but something like that defense will get a kind of cost synergies out of when we do it. So, that's kind of our timeline of what we are thinking that as we exit next \u2013 this year we are in now, possibility for an acquisition or two. By the way, this number could be, give or take, $1 billion, but we will probably be sitting on between cash flow, selling M&M, buying Rogers, CapEx, everything else that kind of goes into it, we will probably be sitting just for planning purposes with like $6 billion of excess cash, somewhere in that ZIP code as we consummate this year. And we would think that's really a one quarter issue the way Omicron is now coming down. We had a key production facility. We missed two days of production. I think it was two weeks ago, lack of staffing. We were back up on the third day. It's things like that. We are paying everyone overtime to work more hours, and that's costing us money. And a lot of that, we obviously plan will subside here sometime in the first quarter. But from a planning purpose, we just made the assumption that January, February and March will all look the same because of Omicron and those type of issues. Yes. Thank you. We are \u2013 let me just answer it this way. We are \u2013 we would love to do an acquisition in the water area, and you would probably pick up some technologies in that area. There are technologies we would like to add in the portfolio. By the way, there is not a ton of water assets out there. But as you know, we did four acquisitions. I don't know what \u2013 the end of \u201819 and moved the track at time here. They were all smaller, but now we are growing really nice. So, that is a potential path for us. If there is not something a little chunkier that we really, really like. But that's a space we just feel the next couple of decades are great secular growth areas, and we have got great technology already we would like to add to, probably very similar in the Laird and Rogers coming into E&I, how that adds on to existing technologies we have. So, definitely an area of interest and could pick up some of those technologies in that extraction area. Thanks, Steve."

I'll now turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Breen: Thanks, Pat. And good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. In addition to our excellent quarterly results, I am pleased on the opportunity today to talk about two significant strategic moves we are making to further strengthen our portfolio and deliver long-term value for our shareholders. I will provide a brief overview of these announcements before Lori walks you through earnings. And then I'll be back to go into more depth on our announcements today. Our team has delivered outstanding results in the third quarter above the high end of our guidance ranges for sales, operating EBITDA, and adjusted EPS, highlighted by the actions we took to implement price increases to stay ahead of raw material inflation.  In the quarter, we delivered a neutral price cost impact for the Company, which is a proof point and effectively managing the levers within our control to deliver strong results. Market demand in nearly every one of our end markets were strong and our supply chain organization executed well in a challenging environment to deliver for our customers. Organic growth was up high single to double-digits in every segment in the quarter. I am pleased by the quick actions our teams took to position us to continue managing the supply chain challenges and raw material cost pressures effectively as we head into the fourth quarter.  As Lori will cover in a few minutes, we expect to fully offset raw material price headwinds again in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned, we also announced 2 strategic transactions this morning. The acquisition of Rogers Corporation and our attempt to divest a substantial portion of our Mobility and Materials segment will significantly strengthen DuPont 's position in our core high growth, high margin markets with a focus on electronics, water, and technologies, and next-generation automotive. In addition to focusing the portfolio, these strategic actions will accelerate our top-line growth, operating EBITDA margins, and significantly improve our earnings stability.  The combined transaction will allow us to benchmark extremely well against best-in-class multi-industrial peers, thereby resulting in long-term value creation. I will cover the details of the Rogers and M&M transactions in a moment. But first, let me turn it over to Lori to discuss the quarter, as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year.\nLori Koch: Thanks, Ed. And good morning, everyone. As Ed mentioned, customer demand across almost all of our end markets remained strong in the third quarter. We saw continued improvement in many of the industrial end market adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as global economies continue their recovery. Organic growth in the quarter was up 16% versus 2020. We delivered net sales, operating EBITDA, and adjusted EPS above the high end of our third quarter guidance. In addition, we had strong cash flow generation and returned $657 million of capital to shareholders during the quarter, grew $500 million in share repurchases, and $157 million in dividends.  We now have $875 million in share repurchases remaining under our existing authorization, which expires next June. And we expect to complete a full-year 2021 with about $2 billion in share repurchases, which is at the high-end of the range that we provided earlier this year. Net sales of $4.3 billion were up 18% versus the third quarter of 2020, up 16% on an organic basis. Organic sales growth consists of 10% volume improvement and 6% pricing gains, reflecting the continued actions we are taking to offset inflationary pressure. Excluding the impact of metals, price was up about 5% during the quarter.  A 1% portfolio tailwinds reflects the net impact of strong top-line results related to our acquisition of Laird Performance Materials and headwinds from the non-core divestiture. Currency provided a 1% tailwind in the quarter. Overall sales growth was broad-based and reflects high single to low double-digit volume growth in all 3 of our reporting segments. Double-digit organic growth within Asia Pacific, Europe, and North America reflects continued strong demand in our key end market. From an earnings perspective, we delivered operating EBITDA of $1.09 billion and adjusted EPS of a $1.15 per share, up 20% and about 90%, respectively, versus the year-ago period.  The earnings improvement was driven by strong volumes across all 3 reporting segments and earnings uplift from the Laird Performance Materials acquisition. The swift pricing actions that we implemented earlier this year, in the face of raw material inflation, continue to benefit our operating result. For the total Company, our selling price increases during the quarter, again, offset raw material inflation. Gross margin was up about a 160 basis points versus last year, reflecting increases in both M&M and E&I.  Operating EBITDA margin of 25.5% was in line with our third quarter guidance expectations and reflects 50 basis points of margin expansion versus the prior year. Incremental margins were about 28% during the third quarter versus last year. However, if you exclude the impact of price and costs, our operating EBITDA margin for the quarter would have been nearly 27% and incremental margin would have been over 40%, reflecting very strong underlying operating performance. I have also mentioned previously that we track our operating performance for our core results on an underlying basis versus 2019, given the unique nature of 2020 and certain discrete items that impacted our operating results in the prior year.  In comparing our third quarter results to pre -pandemic levels, sales for our core businesses were up 15% versus 2019 with operating EBITDA leverage at 1.4 times on an underlying basis despite the global challenges around supply chain pressures and raw material inflation. From a segment earnings perspective, E&I delivered 13% operating EBITDA improvement on strong volume and better-than-expected results from Laird as we continue to integrate this business with our current electronics offerings. The year-over-year comparison includes the headwind resulting from a technology sale in the prior year.  Adjusting for this item, operating EBITDA was up about 20% with margins essentially flat between both periods. In W&P, operating EBITDA increased 12% versus the year-ago period on volume growth, primarily reflecting recovery in industrial end markets for Aramid fibers in the absence of charges related to temporarily idled facilities in the prior year. We were proactive in implementing pricing actions during the quarter in W&P. However, these actions were more than offset by raw material inflation and logistics costs, which resulted in headwinds to margins and operating leverage.  We expect sequential price improvement as we continue to implement increases in response to raw material inflation. M&M delivered 75% improvement in operating EBITDA or about 2.5 times operating leverage compared to the year-ago period. The improvement reflects higher volumes across all end markets, net pricing gains, and response to raw material inflation, and the absence and charges related to temporarily idled facilities in the prior year. For the quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $842 million and capital expenditures of $208 million resulted in free cash flow of $634 million.  Free cash flow conversion of a 112% was up significantly compared to the second quarter. Turning to slide 4, which provides more detail on the year-over-year changes in net sales for the quarter. Strong customer demand across almost all our end markets, including the continued recovery in many industrial end markets, and the efforts of our supply chain organization drove organic sales growth of 16% during the third quarter. In E&I volume gains delivered 9% organic sales growth for the segment, led by double-digit volume gains in both Industrial Solutions and Semiconductor Technology. The sales growth in Industrial Solutions reflects strong demand across all product lines but most notably in OLED displays for a new phone and television launches. Medical silicones in healthcare Kalrez seals within electronics, along with a continued recovery in aerospace.  Semiconductor technologies, continues to benefit from robust demand driven by the ongoing transition to more advanced node technology and growth in electronics mega trends, and we expect these strong demand trends to continue in the fourth quarter.  Within Interconnect Solutions, organic sales declined in the mid-single-digit reflects the anticipated impact of the shift in demand related to premium next-generation smartphones for the first half of this year, along with softness in automotive end markets due to the semi-chip shortage. We expect these headwinds to continue in the fourth quarter. However, we do expect organic growth of ICS to be up mid-single-digits on a full-year basis.  For W&P, 11% organic sales growth during the quarter consisted of 9% volume improvement and 2% pricing gains. Continued recovery in industrial end markets resulted in significant volume improvement for Nomex and Kevlar Aramid fibers within Safety Solutions, which was up double-digits on an organic basis.  Our Shelter Solutions continue recovery in commercial construction led by demand for Corian surfaces, contribute to high single-digit organic growth. In addition, we saw continued strength in North American residential construction markets for products including Styrofoam and Tyvek house wrap, and the retail channel for Do-It-Yourself applications.  Organic sales for Water Solutions were up low-single-digits during the quarter as global demand for clean water technology remains strong. However, logistics challenges do remain and have impacted our ability to meet demand. Pricing gains for W&P during the quarter reflect actions taken to mitigate raw material inflation, mainly within shelter and safety. M&M top-line results reflect another strong quarter with organic sales growth of 28% on a 16% price increase and 12% volume improvement. And includes double-digit organic growth in each of Engineering Polymers, [indiscernible] in advanced solutions. Throughout the year, our M&M segment has been the most significantly impacted by raw material inflation.  As such, a 16% price increase reflects the continued actions we have been taking to offset these high raw material costs. And also reflects higher metals pricing in our advanced solutions business. Excluding the metals impacts, price was up about 12% during the quarter. Looking ahead, while our global supply constraints of key raw materials have improved in M&M compared to earlier in the year, and auto demand remains strong among consumers, we do expect softness in the fourth quarter as the global chip shortage continue. Turning to Slide 5, adjusted EPS of a $1.15 was off about 90% from $0.61 per share in the year-ago period.  Higher segment earnings results in a net benefit to EPS of about $0.20 per share, driven by higher volumes and strong results from Laird. As I mentioned, we were price costs neutral during the quarter, given the pricing actions we have been taking to offset raw material inflation. Our lower share count continues to provide a benefit to adjusted EPS, specifically a $0.33 benefit to the third quarter. Benefits from lower interest expense in this current quarter from de -levering actions earlier in the year, was mostly offset by a higher base tax rate compared to the last year. For full-year 2021, we expect our base tax rate to be about 21%. Turning to Slide 6, I'll discuss our outlook and guidance for the full-year 2021.  We expect strong underlying demand trends to continue in the fourth quarter in almost all of our end markets and have seen signs of these trends in the month of October. However, we are starting to see the ongoing semiconductor chip shortage impact our downstream customers\u2019 ability to produce, which is creating some deceleration in order patterns. Primarily in automotive end markets were [Indiscernible] estimates for the second half have been cut by 17%. Due primarily to the softness attributable to the semiconductor chip shortage, we are lowering the midpoint and narrowing the range of our full year guidance for net sales, operating EBITDA, and adjusted EPS compared to our previous estimates. At the midpoint of the ranges provided, we now expect net sales for the year to be about $16.37 billion down from the midpoint of our previous estimate of $16.5 billion.  Similarly, we now expect operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS to be about $4.15 billion and $4.20 per share, respectively. This is not a demand or market share issue or our inability to continue to pass on prices or effectively manage our global supply chain. As our third quarter results demonstrate, we have successfully executed on each of these. This is purely a result of the global semiconductor shortage, which is impacting our customers' ability to produce and thereby pushing up demand. With that, let me turn it back over to Ed.\nEd Breen: Thanks, Lori. I'm excited to share with you more detail on the 2 significant strategic moves we announced this morning, which will further strengthen our portfolio and deliver long-term value for our shareholders. The announcements of an agreement to acquire Rogers Corporation, and our intent to divest a significant portion of our M&M segment, are substantial moves, advancing our strategy to shift the portfolio towards higher-growth and higher-margin businesses, while significantly enhancing the earnings stability of the Company. The acquisition of Rogers will build on the Laird Performance Materials acquisition that we closed July 1st adding another high-quality business that expands our leading market position across highly attractive end markets.  Rogers is a market leader in each of their primary product categories and brings a world-class organization with differentiated technology, innovation capabilities, technical expertise, and deep customer relationships. The same value proposition that differentiates our DuPont businesses. Rogers operates in end markets where we have already established leading positions, such as consumer and mobile electronics and others that are adjacent to our businesses such as 5G infrastructure and electric vehicles, enabling us to offer an even more attractive total value proposition to a broader base of customers, and creating the opportunity to compound growth over time given complementary products and markets.  While M&M has been the market leader in high-performance thermoplastic serving automotive, electronics, industrial, and consumer markets, we believe DuPont is no longer the best owner for this asset. By separating M&M from the rest of the portfolio, we are better positioning the business to expand on its leadership position in these markets and continue to tackle some of the industry's most critical challenges, such as vehicle safety and fuel efficiency. We will leverage existing tax attributes to complete a highly efficient cash sale of the M&M business, providing ample funding to finance the Rogers acquisition, as well as further M&A and share repurchases while maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating.  We have a few key targets, which like Laird and Rogers, we have been studying for a few years, that would be excellent additions to our portfolio. Following the completion of the intended Rogers acquisition and the planned divestiture of M&M, DuPont will focus on key emerging technologies and have enhanced top-line growth. Our participation in the auto markets going forward is much more connected the high-margin advanced technologies, enabling long-term secular trends like hybrid and electric vehicles, as well as advanced driver systems. A large portion of our order exposure will be aligned to EVs and ADAS, both of which are growing at a significant pace.  This improved balance in our end markets will drive further consistency in our results and allow us to deliver best-in-class results among our multi-industrial peers. Strengthening our position in clean energy and electric vehicles, combined with our existing positions in water, safety, and production technologies, will continue to advance our customer sustainability priorities. Slide 8 shows the modeling we have done for the Company, assuming the completion of both the M&M divestiture and the Rogers acquisition, including full achievement of a planned cost synergies. As you can see, pro forma DuPont will benchmark well above our top multi-industrial peers on both organic growth and EBITDA margin, and in line with this high-performing [indiscernible] on cyclical, which we measure as peak-to-trough earnings volatility. Our historical sales growth for the new portfolio will improve by 40 basis points to 3.8%, which is nearly 2 times the growth rate of the top peers.  This growth is driven by our exposure to high-growth end markets. For example, the semiconductor materials market is expected to grow at 46% per year, which is evidenced by the significant investments in new fabs we are seeing in all regions of the world. Our $2 billion semiconductor technology business, which holds leading positions in materials for both wafer production and packaging, is positioned to outgrow the market by 200 basis points to 300 basis points. Likewise, our $1.4 billion water business operates in markets that are expected to grow high single-digits, driven by the global response to concerns such as water scarcity and circularity.  The acquisition we're making also increases our exposures in high-growth markets such as EV, which is a market growing at 30% per year. Rogers ' high-performance elastomers, specialty bus bars, and thermal substrates, complement our existing materials, such as gap fillers, adhesives, and Nomex papers. In the new portfolio, the strength in these businesses will accelerate the performance. In 2020, our top line for the core business declined about 5%, which is a solid result compared to our top multi-industrial peers, which were down about 8%. Our new portfolio would have declined less than 3% during the worst of the recession in recent years, a substantial differential versus the peer set.  We have taken several actions to drive top quartile EBITDA margins at DuPont. The M&M and Rogers transactions will deliver an additional 140 basis points of margin improvement on a 2021 basis, floating us well above our top multi-industrial peers. The new portfolios, a collection of specialty businesses underpinned by innovation, customer relationships, and manufacturing excellence. The combination that supports robust, sustainable margins. I'm also excited about the consistency these transactions will bring to our results. Strong ties, the secular growth drivers will limit the earnings volatility in the Company throughout the cycle.  You can see the earnings volatility of the DuPont portfolio was significant from 2019 to 2020, primarily associated with the M&M segment. The same is true as we look back further where the cyclicality in the portfolio was driven by M&M. Looking forward, our portfolio will have minimal exposure to commodity feedstocks. And as a result, our cyclicality will significantly improve by 700 basis points to be in line with the top peers. In addition to comparing to our top multi-industrial peer set, we also looked at how the new portfolio will benchmark against the entire set of 24 multi-industrial companies. The results are the same.  We will benchmark well above the median of the entire multi-industrial group on both growth and margin, and in line on cyclicality. With a more clearly defined portfolio and by improving the topline growth EBITDA margins and cyclicality of the Company to be well above our peer set, I am confident the quality of our businesses will be recognized, which will translate into evaluation comparable to top peers. Getting DuPont to this point has been a multi-year journey with decisive news aligned with our value-creation levers of active portfolio management, a best-in-class operating model, and disciplined capital allocation.  Slide 9 shows the actions we have taken to transform the DuPont portfolio to a combination of world-class businesses centered in long-term secular high-growth areas. Our strategy uses intentional and included strategic decisions to shift the Company to higher-growth, higher-margin businesses with less cyclicality, while also pursuing acquisitions to strengthen our leadership position and innovation capabilities in the secular growth areas of electronics, water protection, industrial technologies, and next-generation automotive. Our portfolio transformation started with the identification of non-core businesses, where our innovation, technical expertise, and close customer relationships no longer drove a competitive advantage within the DuPont portfolio.  We have been successful at identifying great owners for majority of these businesses and our work continues. We expect to close the sale of the Clean Tech business before the end of the year for around $510 million. Earlier this year, we finalize the separation of the N&B business and an RMT transaction with IFF, creating a powerhouse in the food, beverage, health, and Biosciences markets. Separation of N&B provided a lift to the top line growth and operating EBITDA margins at the DuPont portfolio, as N&B was at the low end of the portfolio on both measures.  This was an unmatched opportunity to advance the DuPont strategy, including the receipt of $7.3 billion in tax-free proceeds, which we redeployed to create shareholder value, and position N&B and IFF for future success. Today's announcement of our intent to divest a significant portion of the M&M segment is the next step to advance our transformational strategy by increasing the resiliency and earnings stability of our portfolio. Throughout, we have carefully assessed acquisition targets, which can strengthen our leadership positions in the secular areas of Electronics, Water, Protection, Industrial Technologies, and next-generation automotive.  As I have said before, we are strategic in our approach and only pursue targets that can be justified financially and that operate in our existing markets to minimize integration and execution risks. We prefer acquisitions that provide a significant synergy opportunity similar to what we saw with the water acquisitions we completed in late 2019, the Laird acquisition earlier this year, and the intended acquisition of Rogers. We also only pursued targets were innovation and our technical capabilities set us apart, which is the case for both Laird and Rogers. Our transformation strategy has also been underpinned by operational improvements.  We have made fundamental changes in the way DuPont is run. We have put full P&L accountability into the businesses by moving oversight of manufacturing, operations, and R&D under our business precedents. We spend approximately 4% of sales on R&D and we no longer operate a central R&D function. Instead, we have empowered our businesses to allocate R&D dollars to the projects that are most critical to their growth, and then hold them accountable for delivering results. The same is true for capital spending, the majority of which has been focused on capacity constrained areas.  Throughout our transformation to strengthen our Balance Sheet has been and remains a priority. Following the N&B separation, we delivered our Balance Sheet to maintain a debt to EBITDA ratio and credit rating that provides us flexibility. We also continue to control our costs at both our manufacturing facilities, as well as at our corporate functions. We have been prudent at taking costs out of our G&A line. And today, have a best-in-class cost structure. The work at our manufacturing facilities is ongoing through continuous productivity and asset reliability improvements using new digital tools, which is an integral part of our operating plants today.  The combination of focusing the portfolio and operational improvements have been part of our strategy to unlock shareholder value and strengthen the Company. The M&M and Rogers announcements are significant strategic steps in our transformation. I'll move to Slide 10 to provide more details on the Rogers agreement. Our modeling of Rogers is based on our 2022 estimated EBITDA of $270 million, which we are highly confident the business will achieve based on a thorough diligence process, including a detailed review of their projections and assumptions. The purchase price of about $5.2 billion represents a 19x EBITDA multiple based on 2022 estimates before synergies.  The multiple is expected to be below 14x after cost synergies. We are highly confident in a synergy number, approximately $115 million and our ability to achieve most of the forecasted synergies by the end of 2023, within 18 months of closing. We expect Rogers to be accretive to top-line growth, operating EBITDA, free cash flow, and adjusted EPS upon closing. We expect sizable revenue synergies from the combination of E&I, Laird and Rogers are consistent with how we justify all deals. We have not assumed any revenue synergies in our modeling. And we expect closing to take approximately six months, putting us in the second quarter of 2022.  Because the Rogers transaction will close before we expect the M&M divestiture closed and funding the acquisition, we expect to prioritize pre -payable debt, which can be retired upon receipt of the M&M proceeds to return our leverage to more normal levels. Slide 11 provides more detail on the synergy opportunities. DuPont is in a unique position to extract value from this combination due to the synergy opportunity that comes not only from having one of the largest sub-electronic material businesses in the industry, but also from the acquisition of Laird that we completed a few months ago. We looked across all three organizations to determine where there were synergy opportunities.  As is the case in many of our transaction, where we combine businesses, we have complementary product offers in similar segments. We expect significant synergies in procurement spend, as well as G&A cost. Because Rogers as a public Company, we will also realize savings associated [indiscernible] them into our structure. Our anticipated Rogers cost synergies of $115 million combined with the cost synergies and we anticipate from the layered acquisition total approximately 6% of the combined revenue of our Interconnect Solutions business, Laird, and Rogers, which is a very achievable synergy target.  As I mentioned, we expect to achieve most of these synergies within 18 months of closing. Turning to slide 12, I'll provide more detail on the business. Rogers Corporation is a $950 million business with broad end market exposure. We expect Rogers top line to grow in the high single-digits, accelerated by leading positions in the rapidly growing categories of electric vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems. The benefits of the planned synergies will deliver uplift to the EBITDA margins across all three businesses. Rogers has two operating segments with leading positions in each.  The first segment is advanced Electronics Solutions, which includes the high frequency circuit board laminates business, and the power electronics business. Rogers second segment is the Elastomeric Material Solutions. The high frequency circuit board laminates business complements our existing printed circuit board business within Interconnect Solutions. This is approximately a $300-million business that manufacturers comp or clad laminates for high-frequency circuits using ADAS radars, 4G, 5G base stations and military communications. Also included in the Advanced Electronics Solutions segment is the power electronics business, which includes both ceramic substrates and specialty busbars for high power conversion used in applications such as electric motors for trains, ships, automobiles, and wind turbines.  Specialty busbars are used instead of cable harness systems and high-power conversion applications, when highly stable and reliable power conversion is critical. This is about a $250 million business today, but poised for significant growth with exposure to next-generation technologies including powering applications for hybrid and electric vehicles. The second segment is Elastomeric Material Solutions segment, approximately a $400-million business, which manufactures precision phones and silicon materials with high reliability and high purity for cushioning, ceiling, impact protection, and vibration management across the number of growing end markets.  This segment also has high exposure to electric vehicles for battery applications. On side 13, you can see the significant offerings in combined entities through the examples of the electric vehicle, 5G infrastructure, consumer electronics, and clean energy. The increased opportunity in electric and autonomous vehicles from the combination of Laird and Rogers adds to DuPont's existing material [indiscernible] into the electric vehicle. In a segment that is growing 30% per year, this is a tremendous opportunity to increase our share of wallet with offerings such as gap fillers, adhesives, and Nomex papers from DuPont, high-performance elastomers, specialty busbars, and thermal substrates from Rogers, and electromagnetic shielding and thermal management solutions from Laird.  Likewise, Laird and Rogers expand our offering in consumer electronics, where DuPont is already a leading materials supplier through all 3 businesses within the E&I segment, Semiconductor technologies, Interconnect Solutions, and Industrial Solutions. E&I shielding, thermal interface materials, and multi-functional solutions from Laird, as well as high performance elastomers from Rogers, will make us an even more complete material supplier to leading OEMs. The combined application engineering and design expertise will be unmatched in the industry.  We're very excited about the technical skills that will transfer to DuPont through both of these acquisitions, which will enable the businesses to continue working with customers, solve their most critical challenges using our combined portfolio, advanced technologies. A hallmark of all three companies. Customers in these industries demand this level of sophisticated innovation and part nership. You can see how the acquisition of Laird and Rogers supports our strategy to expand our presence in high-growth secular end markets, and creates opportunity for compounding growth across related products and markets.  Slide 14 shows the combination of the Laird acquisition and then the Rogers acquisition, is highly complementary and can expand our addressable markets within key electronics segments by 50%. The addition of Laird and Rogers provides an entry way into markets such as clean energy, wireless infrastructure, and defense electronics, where we previously had little exposure, but will now have distinct competitive advantages. We see further opportunities for growth by leveraging the DuPont technologies across these additional electronics markets. The timing could not be better to enter these markets.  The world is making significant investments in 5G infrastructure, clean energy, and hybrid and electric vehicles, to name a few. These investments are leading to rapid growth in these areas. Rogers has been making significant investments in these areas and has a rich pipeline of offerings that will support the next-generation technologies. The acquisition creates an exciting opportunity to capture this growth, which we think will be compounded by leverage of the combined E&I, Laird and Rogers platforms. Moving to the intended M&M divestiture on Slide 15. At DuPont, we have a proven history in adapting a best owner mindset for each of our businesses.  We constantly scrutinize our portfolio to ensure fit with our business objectives and to create as much long-term value as possible for our shareholders, customers, and employees. By announcing that we have initiated process divest a majority of our M&M segment, we're committing to do just that, finding the right owner for a tremendous asset. The business to be sold predominantly includes the Engineering Polymers and performance resins lines of business. Approximately $700 million of current year revenue, M&M segment is not included in the scope of the divestiture, and includes the automotive adhesives and multi-base businesses, which aligned nicely with our offering for [indiscernible]and industrial technologies.  The portfolio to be divested is expected to generate revenue this year of about $4.2 billion and about $1 billion of EBITDA. M&M is an industry leading combination of high-quality businesses with best-in-class technology and application development, deep customer relationships, brands, and manufacturing excellence. The business is well-positioned to capitalize on the continued transition to hybrid and electric vehicles and other emerging megatrends. The business is also poised to outperform peers through the cycle with a lean G&A structure, efficient manufacturing processes, and a reliable supply chain and key raw materials. We expected the divestiture process will move quickly.  In fact, we will launch a marketing process in the coming days. We have considered multiple deal structures as part of the strategic review. We believe a transaction that maximizes the net cash proceeds to DuPont will enable us to build on our core areas of strength, like the Laird and Rogers transaction, and create significant value for our shareholders. I look forward to updating you as our process advances. I'll wrap up with a few comments on why I'm excited about their future DuPont on Slide 16. With the completion of the Rogers acquisition and the M&M divestiture, DuPont will be building around our 4 foundational pillars, including electronics, water protection, industrial technologies, and next-generation automotive. Each of these areas is experiencing rapid growth as a result of significant secular tailwinds with long term growth drivers.  From high-frequency connectivity in the most advanced technologies, to water scarcity in some of the most remote parts of the world, the technical demands of our customers are high. And we have a unique advanced technologies to partner with them to solve these global challenges. The actions we have already taken along with those we announced today, enabled us to strengthen our leadership position in each of the markets we serve. I am confident this will lead to significant opportunities for employees and unmatched solutions for our customers. We're also creating an opportunity for significant value creation for our shareholders. As I mentioned previously, the combined transaction enhanced our financial profile through higher growth, higher margins, and significantly more stability.  We will be positioned to outperform throughout the cycle. These are indicators of a strong, healthy, and vibrant Company, and I'm confident we will benchmark with the best of our multi-industrial peers. Our capital allocation will remain balanced, returning value to our shareholders through a consistent dividend that we expect to grow with earnings and share repurchases, as well as a strong balance sheet, have been and will continue to be priorities for DuPont. We will also continue to invest in our business to grow organically and support their growth through select and targeted M&A. With that, let me turn it to Pat to open the Q&A.\nPatrick Fitzgerald: Thanks Ed. Before we move to the Q&A portion of our call, I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. We will allow for one question and one follow-up question per person. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Melius Research. Your line is now open.\nScott Davis: Good morning.\nEd Breen: Good morning.\nScott Davis: Good morning, Lori and Jon.\nLori Koch: Good morning.\nScott Davis: Sounds like you guys have been busy. Kind of asking you a technical question here. I mean, the process that you're going to run on mobility, if it doesn't come out as you like, would you consider spinning the business? Is that one of the options that's in play here?\nEd Breen: Yeah. We're highly confident of there\u2019ll be a sale here. We already know people are interested in this asset. We've had many calls at even in recent times about the assets. So it's going to sell. We're starting -- literally starting the process in the next few days. And one of the great things about the sale of this, it's really extremely tax-efficient for us, which makes it very attractive. The tax leakage on this deal will be mid-single digits to high-single digits, so it's pretty incredible that we're able to accomplish that. So I'm highly confident it's going to sell. I would say just targeting for your thinking that we close a deal like that around October of next year.  By the way, I also am highly confident, which is kind of surprising. It's in everyone's sum of the parts of DuPont, M&M is by far the lowest multiple in the Company. And yet we will sell it for more than the multiple that DuPont trades at today. I would also say if you just benchmark DSMs coming to market, I think a lot of you guys and analysts have it going for at least 11 times. Our asset is a way better asset. It's better on growth. It's better on margins. It's much more global, bigger. And so I don't -- I'm confident it will sell for even more than the Company literally currently trades at now.\nScott Davis: Good. And then Ed, as a follow-on, can you talk through the synergies with Rogers? Is this standard kind of G&A stuff or is there something kind of more there that you can talk us through?\nEd Breen: Yes, it's pretty similar to our other deals. And by the way, it's a very achievable number for us. As we said in our prepared remarks, we took ICS, which is one of our division this will be in the E& I segment. We used ICS. We use Laird and the Rogers deal. And adding in the Laird synergies, by the way, it's 6% of revenue. So we're highly confident. We've been scoping this out for a long time. One of the nice things here, I guess I'd say nice is it's a public company. So all those costs go away, which are pretty significant obviously. And that just happens. Then a big chunk of it is G&A and functional costs, streamlining it into our structure.  We get some procurement savings also. And then we've got some facility consolidations. We've got sales offices all overlapping each other globally as an example. So we've scoped it out and a lot of detail. Obviously, we'll get more detail once we can sit down even more with the team. And I would also add, we had just closed on the Laird deal July 1, and we had announced $60 million of synergies with Laird. And the team is now at $63 million. And that's literally line-by-line, who's doing it? When are we getting it? What's the payback? So we have line of sight. And hopefully we're being conservative here on the combo at a $115 million of synergies for Rogers.\nOperator: Okay. Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nSteve Tusa : Hey, guys. Good morning.\nEd Breen: Good morning.\nSteve Tusa : So just quickly on the results. It sounds like kind of the majority of the 4Q cut is really kind of auto production-related. Then, I have a follow-up on the strategic stuff.\nEd Breen: Yes. Look, Steve, it's all auto. That's all centered on the semiconductor. We did not see it in the third quarter as you could tell by Laurie's prepared remarks, we had a very robust third quarter still going along, we're seeing a little bit order pattern on the auto end go down, we're just expecting it has to through the rest of the quarter because auto builds are down 17% in the second half of the year.  So that's pretty much how we modeled it out and said, we'll probably see it here in the fourth quarter. And look, you all know it's -- consumer demands their -- auto builds are supposed to be up 11% next year, so we should be in good shape in 2022. But I think we'll probably take a little bit of a hit here in the fourth quarter, and that's what we guided to. There's no softness anywhere else in the portfolio. As you can tell, every one of our sub-segments is up nicely except for one.  So out of nine segments, 8 of them were up nicely, and the only 1 that wasn't was related to the smartphone market and we knew that. We already had highlighted that to everybody because the demand came earlier in the year of the tee up for the production of the phones, and we knew the second half of the year would be softer and it will be fine again next year. So demand's perfect everywhere else. By the way, our supply issues with force majeures have cleaned up substantially, so we're not dealing with that. We're really dealing with just the semi thing, and of course, everyone's dealing with logistics and shipping and all that.\nSteve Tusa : Right. And then just lastly, I'm looking over the cash you're bringing in or you expect to bring in from these sales. And I mean, it's a pretty big number, well in excess of the $5 billion that you're spending. You still have a couple of billion of cash-generation, some divestitures that are bringing in some cash here in the fourth quarter. I'm getting to pro forma year-end 2022 cash number, that's like -- I don't know $6 billion, $7 billion, something in that range. Is that like -- is that math off? Maybe it's 5, I don't know, but it seems like you guys have like a ridiculous amount of excess cash after the dust settles on all this stuff. Am I off on my math somewhere there?\nLori Koch: I think the only thing you're off is on the timing of the receipt of the cash from the divestiture. So we ended the third quarter with about $1.7 billion in cash. We generated $600 million and change in free cash flow in the third quarter, and we'll expect a similar posting in the fourth quarter. And we'll also continue to be active in the market with our share repurchases, probably about 500 million incremental in the fourth quarter. That will put you about maybe a just shy of $2 billion at the end of the year. And then, you'll get next year the increment from the launch -- the M&M proceeds from the divestiture and then paying for the Cardinal acquisition.  I've already -- we already have the funding in place for that. The one item outside of free cash flow that we will get in the fourth quarter, as Ed had mentioned, is the proceeds from the Clean Tech divestiture. So that should be about $470 million after tax. It will be incremental to the roughly $2 billion that I had previously mentioned for ending the year.\nEd Breen: So Steve, at the end of the day if you go to the end of 2022, your numbers are clearly in the zip code there. And as we highlighted in our remarks, there are a couple of M&A targets we love. We've been looking at for literally two to three years, and we also are going to stay very balanced with share repurchase,. But we don't need to make any of those decisions now. We won't get the cash for the M&M business until about October first of next year. And we'll see where things are at that point in time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Walsh from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nJohn Walsh: Good morning, everyone.\nEd Breen: Good morning, John.\nJohn Walsh: Wanted to know if we can keep that train of thought going. You talked about wanting to maintain a healthy balance sheet. A lot of stuff going on, moving parts, several companies also reporting today. Can you just help us? What's the zip code you think you'll have your net leverage at when you pro forma for all the divestitures and also for the acquisitions? Where do you have it shaken out?\nLori Koch: Yes. The reasonable target could be around that 2.75 times by the close of the completion of both the divestiture of the M&M business, payment for the acquisition of Rogers, and then ideally another acquisitions post the receiving the proceeds from the M&M transaction, which would have us back to that 2.75 times around mid to end of 2023.\nJohn Walsh: Got you. Thank you. And then maybe just another question around capacity, just the organizational capacity to continue to do M&A. You talked about a couple of deals, some assets you were excited about. Do you have the bandwidth to kind of do all this at the same time? Or should we think that any kind of larger addition is as you talked about, post the M&M divestiture?\nEd Breen: Yeah. If there is anything of this size, like a Rogers or something, just to give you a feel, it would be at least around the time or after the proceeds for M&M. So we're going to put this pre -payable debt in place here just in the interim period. We can pay that off when we get the proceeds, as Lori said. And then we will have, as Q - Steve Tusa   was alluding to there, some billions of dollars available at that point in time.\nEd Breen: So we'll really be looking hard. Is it share repurchase? Is there an M&A opportunity in one of the sweet spots for us? And we'll make that decision then. But I wouldn't expect that you would see us do anything before we are close to or around the time getting those proceeds in the fall. By the way, the team is very capable. It's a separate team that's doing a lot of the work on the separation of M&M. we can get a transaction place for M&M in the next 3-to-5-month time frame. They have us a closed deal, but then we can't spend it until we do all the separation work, which is why I say October of 2022 to get all that done where the cars are done, the separations are all done, the tax works all done, where we can separate it.\nEd Breen: So that team did extremely good at doing it. You've watched us do the RMT and all that. And Jon's team is very far and very quickly into the integration of Laird. And this will just overlay on to that. So I don't see any issues from a bandwidth standpoint of the Company.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nStephen Byrne : Yes, thank you. When I look at the Rogers ' products, they're generally derived from either fluorinated polymers or polyurethanes or silicones, and just had a couple of questions on those. On that first bucket, these laminates that are fluorinated polymers, do they source any material that is aqueous and thus could have a PFAS wastewater issue? And then maybe, overall, do you see raw material cost pressures in this basket of products that is consistent with your Interconnect Solutions business or would you say it could be a little more like M&M?\nJon Kemp: Hey, Steve, this is Jon. Thanks for the question. Rogers, high market-leading, high-frequency laminate. As you alluded to, they do use some floral products, some floral-polymers in order to help achieve some of that performance. It's a world-class supplier. They've got a diversified supply base of blue-chip companies, globally-recognized suppliers of that, who are actively involved in all of the regulatory and other industry activity. They're leading the way on that in terms of how we address some of the floral materials. Our teams have done a detailed diligence on the EH&S, the environmental, the product stewardship components of that.  And we're comfortable with what that product line is doing, how it's performing right now, and the supplier base for those materials, as it relates to the inflationary pressures to the raw material, slash pressures. It's very consistent with our electronics business, our E&I business today, in the sense that you don't see a lot of the run-ups that we experience in some of the big commodity moves. These are value-based material and you get some exposure to obviously copper used in laminates and silicone. But not any different than what we have in the rest of the portfolio and it's been -- the team's fairly comfortable with our ability to manage that proactively.\nEd Breen: Steve [Indiscernible] just that overall for DuPont to your line of question. We've highlighted you that we've had over $400 million of raw material inflation this year. $300 million of the 400 is in the M&M division for the feedstocks there. And that by the way, again, it's a great business, but that's what jerks the results around. Most of our pricing, by the way, was in the M&M division because we needed it to cover the raw material inflation. So if you take the whole rest of the DuPont portfolio, we only had a $100 million raw material inflation. That's a pretty nice place to get to from that angle also.\nStephen Byrne : Okay. Very good. And, Ed, on the divestiture of the M&M businesses, do you have a level of confidence you can share about getting that 10x multiple, and if you can get it, is it a keeper?\nEd Breen: No. First of all, I would be very disappointed if we sold M&M for a 10x multiple. By [Indiscernible] is comparing to what I'm using as an 11 multiple. By the way, there has been assets out there, not as good as this one that has sold for 12 and a little above 12 times in the marketplace. We're going to get a good number for this one. I will stress again; I have personally had phone calls from people that have interest in this asset. I think the private equity world is going to be extremely interested in this asset.  By the way, I think there is a very interesting opportunity out there because it's publicly noted, DSM is going to market with an assets that would fit beautifully with this [indiscernible] an unbelievable Company. So I think you're going to see a lot of interest around this. And it's going to garner a nice multiple, which by the way back to my point, it's the lowest multiple in some of the parts in our Company. and we'll get more for it than DuPont trades at.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nDavid Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Ed why not spins out E&I and keep M&M and avoid any possible PFAS overhang on the high multiple E&I business?\nEd Breen: Yes, David. Well, first of all, look, I'm not worried about PFAS. Look, you know I want to get it resolved. I know there's a little bit of a cloud still lingering out there. We will get it resolved. The last announcement we did was a settlement that cost us $12.5 million in the State of Delaware. We're actively working and comfortable we're going to get there and we'll clean that issue up for the Company. That's number 1. Number 2, spinning E&I out, you really got to go through the analysis of what that trades for, and I agree it would trade higher. But what will new DuPont trade at on a bigger EBITDA base with what we put together here. And we're taking up our top-line growth rate.  We're taking up our EBITDA margins. We're taking out the cyclicality in the portfolio. There's no way that doesn't benchmark well against some of these premier companies that we've used. So if you get some multiple uplift in DuPont, it negates the multiple uplift from the E&I, which is a smaller EBITDA base. I'd also say I get asked a lot about because I've done a fair amount of RMT stuff. I always getting asked back. There is no partner for E&I. It's the business. There's nothing that matches up in size, even pre the Laird deal, by the way, that makes sense.  And it would be pieces of E&I, which could leave just a partial business in DuPont and take the rest of it out. And then by the way, the beauty here, again, remember the tax leakage is literally mid-single digits to high-single digits depending on what price we get for it. That's a rare situation to be in. So it makes a lot of sense for us to do M&M.\nDavid Begleiter : Got it, makes sense as well. And lastly, what's the -- talking about the growth synergies and the organic growth of the new enhanced E&I business?\nEd Breen: I'll let Jon cover that. We're excited about it, but let me highlight, we did not put it in our -- in our analysis of the deal. But the combo of the 3: of E&I, Laird, and Rogers has us really excited. I think we had a pretty neat chart in the deck if you want to go back and look at it, but Jon, why don't you talk about it a little bit?\nJon Kemp: Yeah. David, maybe I'll give you two quick examples here. When you look at it, Rogers really adds complementary materials and components that really build on DuPont's position in the industry today. If you use just an -- if you pull out kind of two specific application areas around 5G in applications, in smartphones, wireless infrastructure, military and defense electronics, and automotive radar system, DuPont 's the leader in flexible laminates and Laird has E&I shielding and the thermal management solutions. Rogers is the market leader in rigid PCB substrates.  And so with that enhanced offering, not only can you cross-sell customers and expand your share of wallet with a global customer base, but one of the things we're really excited about and we're already starting to see this with the layered integration process, by the way, is engaging with customers to co-design, and it help address some of their most challenging needs. To give you 1 specific example there, everybody is trying to make electronic devices smaller. And one of the ways you get smaller is you use hybrid rigid flex construction on the circuit board, and now we've got a market-leading flex circuit business, a market-leading rigid business and those complex hybrid rigid flex substrates become a lot easier to work with our customers. and they are already asking for it.  If you switch over to the electric vehicle space, we've got quite a bit of content in automotive electronics today. But we really didn't have a lot of exposure prior to Laird or Rogers into things like the automotive -- ADAS systems or the battery. And Laird brought with the EMI shielding with some of the absorbers. A great position in ADAS systems. Rogers built on that with their high-frequency laminates. And then what we're really excited about is the opportunity that they have with the specialty busbars in the specialty foams, performance foams to really address some of the critical needs in the battery packs and power assembly, power electronics part s of the electric vehicles. So you put all that together with our adhesive business, with the rest of our automotive electronics, and we'll really be a preferred partner with both the tier one auto OEMs, as well as the OEMs themselves to design the hybrid and electric vehicles of the future.\nLori Koch: Yes. And David, I think the chart that Ed was referring to in the backup is the pie chart on our end market exposure. And if you look at that, over half of our portfolio between electronics, next-gen auto, which we define as battery in ADAS applications and water. That portfolio is mid-single-digits and then some from a growth perspective. It's a really nice round out from a pro forma DuPont perspective.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nVincent Andrews : Thank you. And good morning, everyone.\nEd Breen: Good morning, Vincent.\nVincent Andrews : Ed, could you talk a little bit more about the tax strategy on M&M, and I guess what I'm asking is, sort of, what are the mechanisms that limit the tax leakage? And is this an opportunity for tax savings that you can only really harvest these of the sale of the asset or are these tax opportunities that would accrue to the overall DuPont enterprise in the absence of an M&M sale, but might have taken more time to realize over any number of years?\nEd Breen: Yeah, Vincent, I will let Lori comment. Lori why don't you hop in on it?\nLori Koch: Yes. Vincent, it really comes from going back to the Dow-DuPont transaction. And we were able to step up the basis of the Heritage DuPont assets of which are all going as part of the M&M transaction. So all those businesses, they're in perimeter for M&M or from Heritage DuPont. And therefore, have the benefit of the stepped-up basis from Dow-DuPont transaction.\nVincent Andrews : Okay. And just as a follow-up, when you think about M&M -- obviously, the fourth quarter is going to see some issue with the chip issue in auto builds. How confident are you that that trues up in 4Q versus potentially lingers into 1Q or the first half of next year? And maybe you could give us an assessment of what you think auto builds are going to look like into 2022. And that'll be helpful. Thank you.\nLori Koch: Yes. The current estimates as you head into 2022, it's really just shifting out. And so the IHS is estimating 11% growth in auto builds next year. And that still doesn't get you back to where we were pre -trade war, pre -pandemic at an $88 million or $89 million auto build number. So we're confident that growth is just getting pushed out. The demand is definitely there. You couldn't get a car now if you tried and so I think there's definitely still a lot of pent-up demand for us to serve. So we have confidence, it's really just a timing issue. It's not a share issue. It's not an underlying issue from a consumer perspective. It's really just when they're able to -- auto makers are able to get the chips to complete the production of the cars.\nEd Breen: Yeah, and by the way, just on the M&M front going into next year, we've continued during the fourth quarter and implement some price increase actions to make sure we keep covering the raw materials. So I think 2022 will be -- it has to be a solid year for the business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nJohn Mc Nulty: So on the acquisition, can you speak to the competitive landscape in terms of the businesses and how the growth rate for the business has been over the last, say, three to five years versus the broader market? Has it outpaced it? Are you gaining share in that area? Can you give us a little bit of color on that?\nJon Kemp: Yes. Sure, John. When you look at it, it's really different based on the individual product lines and the different divisions of the business. When you look at the high-frequency laminates business, the primary competitors there are companies like Asahi Glass, AGC, who did a couple of acquisitions in the last couple of years to build up their portfolio in that space. You've got some -- Panasonic is there. So primarily Japan-based competitors. And then you've got some local folks in China who are doing some of that as well, largely because of some of the geopolitical situation. All of that is outside and we're that's in the rear-view mirror now. And the Company is really well-positioned in continuing to grow that.  On the ceramic busbars and ceramic substrates and specialty busbars, that's a pretty fragmented business. You've got companies out there like Denka, Serotec, Heraeus, and multiple others. It's a fairly fragmented landscape. What differentiates this technology is really the quality of the ceramic thermal substrates and the synergy that's created with silicon carbide power module, especially for electric vehicles. And so when you combine that with the -- similarly with the specialty busbars, that's going to replace things like the wire harness that's in a power system, as Ed alluded to in his prepared remarks; the quality there is really what allows the step up in the growth acceleration really driven by electric vehicles.  On the elastomer side, it's Company like Saint - Goban, who are really \u2013 Woodbridge [indiscernible] Danco, are kind of a few names there across the board, each of these three businesses, Rogers, it has a leading market share. They're among the leaders. They're winning in the market. They've got a great pipeline of opportunities, especially on the automotive, the advanced mobility side with EV and ADAS. They're working with all the power electronic OEMs. And a lot of those are, by the way, are E&I customers as well. So we'll have great relationships across the industry to be able to deliver some of those growth synergies in the upside on a historical growth rate.  They've been growing mid-single-digits. And with the step-up from automotive opportunities and electric vehicles, which are markets that are growing anywhere for mid-teens in ADAS systems to 30% on the EV side, they'll see a nice growth acceleration as those start to scale over the next few years.\nEd Breen: John, they have very nice wins. We did a lot as we've been hearing it in the marketplace, and obviously, studying them for a few years, but we've done a lot of due diligence around the pipeline and the wins, and they're very well positioned as Jon said on ADAS, EV with wins and a lot of design opportunities that they are working on. So we feel very good about a high-single-digit growth rate going forward for the business.\nJohn Mc Nulty: Got it. Hugely, hugely helpful. And then just as a follow-up on the mobility asset sale or divestiture, however, end up going, can you speak to how we should think about any stranded costs, how quickly you may be able to exit those, if there's much in the way of anything that would be left anyway?\nLori Koch: We're very good at getting at stranded costs quickly. So if there is any to be had, we'll get at it. We'll look at the transaction holistically. So you'll have the M&M portfolio going out, Rogers coming in and then another transaction coming in sometime later fall once we have line of sight for the proceeds from the M&M divestitures. So we benchmark best-in-class from a G&A perspective. We'll continue to benchmark best-in-class, post the transaction.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson from Mizuho. Your line is now open.\nChris Parkinson: Great. Thank you very much. Just regarding Slide 11, you do have a history of exceeding expectations on cost synergies. And clearly, you're already embracing the potential for revenue synergies as well. So just taking that 14 times post-synergy multiple and integrating how you're assessing the long-term aggregate synergy potential based on your various buckets, can you just discuss the potential to further reduce the price paid and what the investment community should be monitoring during the first, let\u2019s say, 18 months, just given your progress, which you've just highlighted on Laird? Thank you.\nEd Breen: Look, when we talked about rep cost synergies, hopefully we're being conservative, and we can beat those numbers as we are already are on layered by the way. So we'll keep updating you as the year goes on. By the way, the multiple is actually, I hate to get right too adjustable, but it's 13.6 times, and if we find additional synergies, we reduced it from there, and we'll just keep updating. And now that we can sit down and actually with the teams in more detail, that's usually when we can really sharpen the pencil and really look at what else we can do. And we'll be doing that over the next few months. So highly confident, we'll get that amount, and we'll -- yes, we've always been in the past, let me just say that.\nChris Parkinson: Understood. And just as a quick follow-up, just shifting to the macro, your team has done a fairly good job just driving pricing, controlling the raw materials as you highlighted, at least $100 million x M&M, but also [indiscernible] logistics headwinds. Based on what you're seeing right here, right now, as we're already in the fourth quarter, just what should we think about the pricing algorithm versus rows, as well as transportation logistics heading into '22, '23. Is there any expectation if we do in fact received release, you will get a structural margin uplift in certain businesses? Thank you.\nEd Breen: Well, most of that would being in the M&M business. So you try to hold price as long as you can, when [indiscernible] come down. So you might get some benefit there. But I would say over a more intermediate time, they attract each other. You wouldn't have a margin problem. If [indiscernible] did comes down significant, you could give up some price. But you hold it as long as you could. By the way, the logistics issues, I don't think are getting any better out there. All the [Indiscernible] did get better as we said. So the raw material supplies into M&M has substantially improved, which is great.  And we're able to catch up a little bit last quarter with our customers and orders we couldn't ship in the first and second quarter, but we're looking right now at additional surcharges on freight, because that has continued to go up, especially ocean freight and all that. So I don't think -- we're probably will [Indiscernible] do some here. We're actually have a meeting in the next couple of days where we are going to do a surcharge instead of a price increase on the actual product itself. So people know, look, we're just testing us [Indiscernible] all because of the freight increases. So we want to be positioned well going into 2022.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts from UBS. Your line is now open.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you. I have two questions. Your 2022 Rogers EBITDA estimate is 10% above consensus. Is there any significant new product or development that you uncovered in your due diligence?\nLori Koch: Yes. So we estimated 270 for next year, so the largest incremental growth really is just coming from the top line. So you've got the benefit from -- they had made a small acquisition of silicone engineering that they just announced recently. So you have the benefit of that, as well as about mid-teens growth from an organic perspective, really coming from the strength in the pipeline that Jon had highlighted earlier. So about 30% of their revenue is in advanced mobility, which is ADAS, which is growing kind of in the mid-teens, and then battery which gets upwards of 20% plus. And then, finally, they did have a fire at one of their facilities in Asia, so we're expecting a recovery there, incremental 2022 over 2021. Those are really the key drivers of the top line that are dropping to the bottom line and giving us that confidence that we'll get to 270 next year.\nJohn Roberts: And then don't take this the wrong way, Ed. But this seems to set up an endgame for DuPont and you step back once from the CEO role, do these transactions focused DuPont enough that you might consider stepping back again?\nEd Breen: No.\nJohn Roberts: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of PJ Juvekar from Citi. Your line is now open.\nPj Juvekar: Yes. Hi, good morning, Ed and Lori.\nEd Breen: Good morning.\nLori Koch: Good morning.\nPj Juvekar: Yeah, wondering if you can talk about your volume growth in China and wondering if you've seen any weakness related to housing and construction activities as we've been reading some headlines here, can you just talk about the big picture there?\nLori Koch: Yeah. So really the only pull back that we potentially will see in China in the fourth quarter. So in the third quarter, our organic growth in China was about 11%. That put us in the low 20% year-to-date. And in the fourth quarter right now, we're expecting high single-digit growth in China organically. So the sequential deceleration is really just a reflection of the semiconductor shortage that we had highlighted earlier impacting primarily our auto sales less so our electronics sales. And then that timing shifts that we've been highlighting around the timing of the smartphone deliveries that favors the first half.  So I would say no overall structural change. Our expectations of being up organically 7% in the fourth quarter is ahead of where GDP is expected to be right now for China as well. So we'll continue to outpace.\nEd Breen: Yes and our exposure in the housing commercial sector in China is minimal. That's a bigger business for us on the residential side in North America. So really no impact there.\nPj Juvekar: Okay. Thank you. And then clearly Rogers sees a high-growth Company in areas such as EVs and wireless infrastructure. And I know you're frustrated with your own multiple, I can hear that in your voice. But maybe you can talk about your thoughts on how did you triangulate on the multiple of 19 times 2022 EBITDA for Rogers. And just your overall thoughts there. Thank you.\nEd Breen: Yes. Sure. So look, the 19 times I would never do a standalone in 19 times. I can tell you that. But we comfortably have it down to 13.6 times with the synergies. We know we can get it, as I said a minute ago, hopefully, we can get some upside to that. So I feel very comfortable buying. This is a very high-quality Company. And one of the things, Jon and I, and Lori, we love about it, is really it's high in technology expertise. They're scientists. The products they developed are on the cutting edge. It's exactly what DuPont does.  So the barriers around that we like and it's always -- it's to our existing end customers and it also expand some markets where we think we can leverage our products, as Jon said, into these other markets. So it's a very high-quality asset. Again, we've watched it for years and seriously for 3 years. And the beauty about the 13.6 times, we feel like they -- with the funnel they have there on the cost of some real secular growth areas that we're getting in on a burly with them. By the way, we feel like we did that with Laird, and we're already seeing it in the performance of Laird there.  Nicely outperforming what we said we would do. So we have literally bought Laird now. If you just use the numbers they're running at this year, we bought Laird 10 times. I think when we announced it, we said it was 11 times. and the performance we're going to end the year out on layered is already brought that down to 10 times. Again, on very high-quality asset, we got at a great price. We think we're right at that point with Rogers, with the secular growth there. ADAS is growing 15%, EV's are growing 30%, just to name the auto industry and Rogers is very well-positioned there and these things are just beginning to really ramp.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Yefremov from KeyBanc. Your line is now open.\nAlex Yefremov: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Ed and Lori, I would agree that end markets are very attractive for Rogers and the products look strong, but margins are lower than DuPont's legacy electronics business. In your due diligence, how did you think about that in terms of maybe technological differentiation, barriers to entry, or opportunities for improvement?\nJon Kemp: Yeah, Alex. So I'll go ahead and take that one. You got kind of -- the way to think about it is you got 2/3 of the portfolio with established products that have very attractive margin profiles that closely match the types of things that we have in the rest of the portfolio. And then you've got kind of 1/3 that is in that power electronics space. That is really just starting to scale up based on the EV s. it's great technology with a differentiated position, it has a slightly smaller margin profile today as the volumes are starting to scale up for those applications. As we add the volume in, the margins drift up nicely and then you layer synergies on top of that and you'll have a really solid, very attractive margin profile for the overall business.\nAlex Yefremov: Thank you, and a quick follow-up on supply constraints and the ability to supply for raw materials, if 100% that's completely normal supply and maybe 0% that's the worst point of the shortage, where do you think you would be in fourth quarter and first half of '22?\nLori Koch: The raw material constraints have really basically alleviated. So compared to where we were in the first half with a freeze in Texas we're light years beyond that. So everything is generally back to normal with respect to raw material supply. What we're facing right now is really just the semiconductor shortage impacting the OEMs that are pushing lower demand back to us. And so once we can resolve the semiconductor shortage challenge probably in some time into mid next year, and you'll get back to more normal environment. So it's really not raw. It's really just the semi shortage.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sesan from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nMike Sesan: Hey, good morning. Nice transaction -- a couple of transactions, I guess. It might be a little bit early, but when I think about 23 EBITDA, you take what you're going to do this year in 21 minus the billing for M&M, plus Rogers, plus Synergy, and I assume we get pretty good growth right? Over the next couple of years. Is kind of the base-case for '23 to look like '21, if not a lot higher -- well, maybe not a lot higher, but certainly there's a possibility of '23 EBITDA could be higher than '21?\nEd Breen: Yeah, I don't want to answer something out of '23. But look, I think we've teed up a portfolio. As we said, it's going to be higher growth and then very little volatility in itself. [Indiscernible] dependent, if we do another acquisition or we do more share repurchase. It depends on that also because I think it's back to Q - Steve Tusa 's comments. There are some billions of dollars sitting here at the end of 2022. So depends how we redeploy that to create shareholder value also.  So there's still some big moving pieces, but again, we expect nice growth in '22 in the core new portfolio. And we expect nice growth in 2023. As Lori has mentioned, 40% of the portfolio was clearly nicely growing way nicer than GDP because they are in the secular growth areas, take our water business, you take pretty much the whole E&I sector into account there. Just the name [indiscernible] and with the Laird now in there and the Rogers in there you get a nice part of our portfolio growing at a nice clip.\nMike Sesan: And as a quick follow-up. I understand the potential to be compared to the multi-industrial folks Portfolio is going be a little more simplistic to major businesses. But DuPont tends to be put into chemical indexes for the major funds. So with these transactions item move from SIC code or something like that to an industrial code where I think you could get a little bit more attention for the comps that you want to be compared to?\nEd Breen: Well, first of all, the comps, by the way, they really are good comps because if you take the broad bucket of multi - industrials, the end markets we're in are all the key end markets, a lot of the other multi-industrial. And so we're not drifting off from something else here that's different. In fact, I would say the one thing that was different actually from the compared group was more M&M. That was probably most people would lean more towards the chemical industry and not the multi-industrial. But the portfolio now lines up end market very, very well. Look, we'll work that issue on the multi-industrial over time.  We are putting an action plan together on it. We need our investors to focus on that. We need to talk to the right people at the right funds within the big companies that invest in us and we'll work that issue. But I think over time, we will get compared, I mean, we benchmark really nice against that group.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nArun Viswanathan: Great, thanks for taking my question. I guess two questions. So first off, on the Q2, '22 expected close, is that a little bit later than you expects? Are there any regulatory issues that you expect to this process and similarly, for October '22 for the divestiture, that also seems like a ways away. Are you just building in some extra cushion there?\nEd Breen: No, the 2020 -- The closing the Rogers deal, I don't see any issues. We've obviously studied the antitrust extremely deeply. So I don't see any issues there. Could that close a little bit sooner? It could. But we're just targeting the second quarter to be safe; could be a little faster. I don't think M&M will be faster than October 1, because the long pole in the tent is more the work we have to do internally at DuPont to separate it. So we'll announce a sale to somebody way sooner than October 1, but we won't be able to actually separate it out of the Company until that point in time.\nArun Viswanathan: Okay, thanks. And as a follow up, you've clearly been on a path to move towards higher growth, higher margin businesses in the hopes of getting some multiple uplift. What can you do to accelerate that if that's not shown in the market? Will you continue to march down this path of separation and streamlining? Is there -- looks like there's more announcements coming, maybe potentially in water. Is that the next area of growth that we should think about?\nEd Breen: Well, by the way, we're down to the [indiscernible] five platforms that we mentioned. So if it could come really in any of those [indiscernible we would love to have [Indiscernible] in the water space. We love it. It's high [Indiscernible] growth rate. I think it's a sector [Indiscernible] go on for many, many years. And it's a global issue, which we can help solve for people. So we do like that space. Look, let's see how this year goes, I'm highly confident people will recognize what's in this portfolio, I will also add, I think, which would be very helpful for everybody. We started doing the teachings.  Jon did one on Semiconductor a month or so ago. We have one coming up here shortly and we're going to walk you through every key piece of the portfolio and I think going really highlight the value of our -- internally, I'll use two companies we have, Vespel and Kalrez, and I don't think anyone has a clue what those businesses are like and how awesome they are, and how good in the growth trends in those businesses is. So just the name too that we didn't talk about today. So I think the teach-ins will be very, very powerful and people will see what we have, and the value in the technology that we have in the Company. And I think that's going to be helpful also.\nPatrick Fitzgerald: Thanks, Ed. Thanks everyone for joining our call. For your reference, the copy of our transcript will be posted on DuPont's website. This concludes our call.",

            "name": "Lori Koch",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed. And good morning, everyone. As Ed mentioned, customer demand across almost all of our end markets remained strong in the third quarter. We saw continued improvement in many of the industrial end market adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as global economies continue their recovery. Organic growth in the quarter was up 16% versus 2020. We delivered net sales, operating EBITDA, and adjusted EPS above the high end of our third quarter guidance. In addition, we had strong cash flow generation and returned $657 million of capital to shareholders during the quarter, grew $500 million in share repurchases, and $157 million in dividends.  We now have $875 million in share repurchases remaining under our existing authorization, which expires next June. And we expect to complete a full-year 2021 with about $2 billion in share repurchases, which is at the high-end of the range that we provided earlier this year. Net sales of $4.3 billion were up 18% versus the third quarter of 2020, up 16% on an organic basis. Organic sales growth consists of 10% volume improvement and 6% pricing gains, reflecting the continued actions we are taking to offset inflationary pressure. Excluding the impact of metals, price was up about 5% during the quarter.  A 1% portfolio tailwinds reflects the net impact of strong top-line results related to our acquisition of Laird Performance Materials and headwinds from the non-core divestiture. Currency provided a 1% tailwind in the quarter. Overall sales growth was broad-based and reflects high single to low double-digit volume growth in all 3 of our reporting segments. Double-digit organic growth within Asia Pacific, Europe, and North America reflects continued strong demand in our key end market. From an earnings perspective, we delivered operating EBITDA of $1.09 billion and adjusted EPS of a $1.15 per share, up 20% and about 90%, respectively, versus the year-ago period.  The earnings improvement was driven by strong volumes across all 3 reporting segments and earnings uplift from the Laird Performance Materials acquisition. The swift pricing actions that we implemented earlier this year, in the face of raw material inflation, continue to benefit our operating result. For the total Company, our selling price increases during the quarter, again, offset raw material inflation. Gross margin was up about a 160 basis points versus last year, reflecting increases in both M&M and E&I.  Operating EBITDA margin of 25.5% was in line with our third quarter guidance expectations and reflects 50 basis points of margin expansion versus the prior year. Incremental margins were about 28% during the third quarter versus last year. However, if you exclude the impact of price and costs, our operating EBITDA margin for the quarter would have been nearly 27% and incremental margin would have been over 40%, reflecting very strong underlying operating performance. I have also mentioned previously that we track our operating performance for our core results on an underlying basis versus 2019, given the unique nature of 2020 and certain discrete items that impacted our operating results in the prior year.  In comparing our third quarter results to pre -pandemic levels, sales for our core businesses were up 15% versus 2019 with operating EBITDA leverage at 1.4 times on an underlying basis despite the global challenges around supply chain pressures and raw material inflation. From a segment earnings perspective, E&I delivered 13% operating EBITDA improvement on strong volume and better-than-expected results from Laird as we continue to integrate this business with our current electronics offerings. The year-over-year comparison includes the headwind resulting from a technology sale in the prior year.  Adjusting for this item, operating EBITDA was up about 20% with margins essentially flat between both periods. In W&P, operating EBITDA increased 12% versus the year-ago period on volume growth, primarily reflecting recovery in industrial end markets for Aramid fibers in the absence of charges related to temporarily idled facilities in the prior year. We were proactive in implementing pricing actions during the quarter in W&P. However, these actions were more than offset by raw material inflation and logistics costs, which resulted in headwinds to margins and operating leverage.  We expect sequential price improvement as we continue to implement increases in response to raw material inflation. M&M delivered 75% improvement in operating EBITDA or about 2.5 times operating leverage compared to the year-ago period. The improvement reflects higher volumes across all end markets, net pricing gains, and response to raw material inflation, and the absence and charges related to temporarily idled facilities in the prior year. For the quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $842 million and capital expenditures of $208 million resulted in free cash flow of $634 million.  Free cash flow conversion of a 112% was up significantly compared to the second quarter. Turning to slide 4, which provides more detail on the year-over-year changes in net sales for the quarter. Strong customer demand across almost all our end markets, including the continued recovery in many industrial end markets, and the efforts of our supply chain organization drove organic sales growth of 16% during the third quarter. In E&I volume gains delivered 9% organic sales growth for the segment, led by double-digit volume gains in both Industrial Solutions and Semiconductor Technology. The sales growth in Industrial Solutions reflects strong demand across all product lines but most notably in OLED displays for a new phone and television launches. Medical silicones in healthcare Kalrez seals within electronics, along with a continued recovery in aerospace.  Semiconductor technologies, continues to benefit from robust demand driven by the ongoing transition to more advanced node technology and growth in electronics mega trends, and we expect these strong demand trends to continue in the fourth quarter.  Within Interconnect Solutions, organic sales declined in the mid-single-digit reflects the anticipated impact of the shift in demand related to premium next-generation smartphones for the first half of this year, along with softness in automotive end markets due to the semi-chip shortage. We expect these headwinds to continue in the fourth quarter. However, we do expect organic growth of ICS to be up mid-single-digits on a full-year basis.  For W&P, 11% organic sales growth during the quarter consisted of 9% volume improvement and 2% pricing gains. Continued recovery in industrial end markets resulted in significant volume improvement for Nomex and Kevlar Aramid fibers within Safety Solutions, which was up double-digits on an organic basis.  Our Shelter Solutions continue recovery in commercial construction led by demand for Corian surfaces, contribute to high single-digit organic growth. In addition, we saw continued strength in North American residential construction markets for products including Styrofoam and Tyvek house wrap, and the retail channel for Do-It-Yourself applications.  Organic sales for Water Solutions were up low-single-digits during the quarter as global demand for clean water technology remains strong. However, logistics challenges do remain and have impacted our ability to meet demand. Pricing gains for W&P during the quarter reflect actions taken to mitigate raw material inflation, mainly within shelter and safety. M&M top-line results reflect another strong quarter with organic sales growth of 28% on a 16% price increase and 12% volume improvement. And includes double-digit organic growth in each of Engineering Polymers, [indiscernible] in advanced solutions. Throughout the year, our M&M segment has been the most significantly impacted by raw material inflation.  As such, a 16% price increase reflects the continued actions we have been taking to offset these high raw material costs. And also reflects higher metals pricing in our advanced solutions business. Excluding the metals impacts, price was up about 12% during the quarter. Looking ahead, while our global supply constraints of key raw materials have improved in M&M compared to earlier in the year, and auto demand remains strong among consumers, we do expect softness in the fourth quarter as the global chip shortage continue. Turning to Slide 5, adjusted EPS of a $1.15 was off about 90% from $0.61 per share in the year-ago period.  Higher segment earnings results in a net benefit to EPS of about $0.20 per share, driven by higher volumes and strong results from Laird. As I mentioned, we were price costs neutral during the quarter, given the pricing actions we have been taking to offset raw material inflation. Our lower share count continues to provide a benefit to adjusted EPS, specifically a $0.33 benefit to the third quarter. Benefits from lower interest expense in this current quarter from de -levering actions earlier in the year, was mostly offset by a higher base tax rate compared to the last year. For full-year 2021, we expect our base tax rate to be about 21%. Turning to Slide 6, I'll discuss our outlook and guidance for the full-year 2021.  We expect strong underlying demand trends to continue in the fourth quarter in almost all of our end markets and have seen signs of these trends in the month of October. However, we are starting to see the ongoing semiconductor chip shortage impact our downstream customers' ability to produce, which is creating some deceleration in order patterns. Primarily in automotive end markets were [Indiscernible] estimates for the second half have been cut by 17%. Due primarily to the softness attributable to the semiconductor chip shortage, we are lowering the midpoint and narrowing the range of our full year guidance for net sales, operating EBITDA, and adjusted EPS compared to our previous estimates. At the midpoint of the ranges provided, we now expect net sales for the year to be about $16.37 billion down from the midpoint of our previous estimate of $16.5 billion.  Similarly, we now expect operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS to be about $4.15 billion and $4.20 per share, respectively. This is not a demand or market share issue or our inability to continue to pass on prices or effectively manage our global supply chain. As our third quarter results demonstrate, we have successfully executed on each of these. This is purely a result of the global semiconductor shortage, which is impacting our customers' ability to produce and thereby pushing up demand. With that, let me turn it back over to Ed. Good morning. I think the only thing you're off is on the timing of the receipt of the cash from the divestiture. So we ended the third quarter with about $1.7 billion in cash. We generated $600 million and change in free cash flow in the third quarter, and we'll expect a similar posting in the fourth quarter. And we'll also continue to be active in the market with our share repurchases, probably about 500 million incremental in the fourth quarter. That will put you about maybe a just shy of $2 billion at the end of the year. And then, you'll get next year the increment from the launch -- the M&M proceeds from the divestiture and then paying for the Cardinal acquisition.  I've already -- we already have the funding in place for that. The one item outside of free cash flow that we will get in the fourth quarter, as Ed had mentioned, is the proceeds from the Clean Tech divestiture. So that should be about $470 million after tax. It will be incremental to the roughly $2 billion that I had previously mentioned for ending the year. Yes. The reasonable target could be around that 2.75 times by the close of the completion of both the divestiture of the M&M business, payment for the acquisition of Rogers, and then ideally another acquisitions post the receiving the proceeds from the M&M transaction, which would have us back to that 2.75 times around mid to end of 2023. Yes. And David, I think the chart that Ed was referring to in the backup is the pie chart on our end market exposure. And if you look at that, over half of our portfolio between electronics, next-gen auto, which we define as battery in ADAS applications and water. That portfolio is mid-single-digits and then some from a growth perspective. It's a really nice round out from a pro forma DuPont perspective. Yes. Vincent, it really comes from going back to the Dow-DuPont transaction. And we were able to step up the basis of the Heritage DuPont assets of which are all going as part of the M&M transaction. So all those businesses, they're in perimeter for M&M or from Heritage DuPont. And therefore, have the benefit of the stepped-up basis from Dow-DuPont transaction. Yes. The current estimates as you head into 2022, it's really just shifting out. And so the IHS is estimating 11% growth in auto builds next year. And that still doesn't get you back to where we were pre -trade war, pre -pandemic at an $88 million or $89 million auto build number. So we're confident that growth is just getting pushed out. The demand is definitely there. You couldn't get a car now if you tried and so I think there's definitely still a lot of pent-up demand for us to serve. So we have confidence, it's really just a timing issue. It's not a share issue. It's not an underlying issue from a consumer perspective. It's really just when they're able to -- auto makers are able to get the chips to complete the production of the cars. We're very good at getting at stranded costs quickly. So if there is any to be had, we'll get at it. We'll look at the transaction holistically. So you'll have the M&M portfolio going out, Rogers coming in and then another transaction coming in sometime later fall once we have line of sight for the proceeds from the M&M divestitures. So we benchmark best-in-class from a G&A perspective. We'll continue to benchmark best-in-class, post the transaction. Yes. So we estimated 270 for next year, so the largest incremental growth really is just coming from the top line. So you've got the benefit from -- they had made a small acquisition of silicone engineering that they just announced recently. So you have the benefit of that, as well as about mid-teens growth from an organic perspective, really coming from the strength in the pipeline that Jon had highlighted earlier. So about 30% of their revenue is in advanced mobility, which is ADAS, which is growing kind of in the mid-teens, and then battery which gets upwards of 20% plus. And then, finally, they did have a fire at one of their facilities in Asia, so we're expecting a recovery there, incremental 2022 over 2021. Those are really the key drivers of the top line that are dropping to the bottom line and giving us that confidence that we'll get to 270 next year. Good morning. Yeah. So really the only pull back that we potentially will see in China in the fourth quarter. So in the third quarter, our organic growth in China was about 11%. That put us in the low 20% year-to-date. And in the fourth quarter right now, we're expecting high single-digit growth in China organically. So the sequential deceleration is really just a reflection of the semiconductor shortage that we had highlighted earlier impacting primarily our auto sales less so our electronics sales. And then that timing shifts that we've been highlighting around the timing of the smartphone deliveries that favors the first half.  So I would say no overall structural change. Our expectations of being up organically 7% in the fourth quarter is ahead of where GDP is expected to be right now for China as well. So we'll continue to outpace. The raw material constraints have really basically alleviated. So compared to where we were in the first half with a freeze in Texas we're light years beyond that. So everything is generally back to normal with respect to raw material supply. What we're facing right now is really just the semiconductor shortage impacting the OEMs that are pushing lower demand back to us. And so once we can resolve the semiconductor shortage challenge probably in some time into mid next year, and you'll get back to more normal environment. So it's really not raw. It's really just the semi shortage."

            "name": "Ed Breen",
            "content": "Thanks, Pat. And good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. In addition to our excellent quarterly results, I am pleased on the opportunity today to talk about two significant strategic moves we are making to further strengthen our portfolio and deliver long-term value for our shareholders. I will provide a brief overview of these announcements before Lori walks you through earnings. And then I'll be back to go into more depth on our announcements today. Our team has delivered outstanding results in the third quarter above the high end of our guidance ranges for sales, operating EBITDA, and adjusted EPS, highlighted by the actions we took to implement price increases to stay ahead of raw material inflation.  In the quarter, we delivered a neutral price cost impact for the Company, which is a proof point and effectively managing the levers within our control to deliver strong results. Market demand in nearly every one of our end markets were strong and our supply chain organization executed well in a challenging environment to deliver for our customers. Organic growth was up high single to double-digits in every segment in the quarter. I am pleased by the quick actions our teams took to position us to continue managing the supply chain challenges and raw material cost pressures effectively as we head into the fourth quarter.  As Lori will cover in a few minutes, we expect to fully offset raw material price headwinds again in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned, we also announced 2 strategic transactions this morning. The acquisition of Rogers Corporation and our attempt to divest a substantial portion of our Mobility and Materials segment will significantly strengthen DuPont 's position in our core high growth, high margin markets with a focus on electronics, water, and technologies, and next-generation automotive. In addition to focusing the portfolio, these strategic actions will accelerate our top-line growth, operating EBITDA margins, and significantly improve our earnings stability.  The combined transaction will allow us to benchmark extremely well against best-in-class multi-industrial peers, thereby resulting in long-term value creation. I will cover the details of the Rogers and M&M transactions in a moment. But first, let me turn it over to Lori to discuss the quarter, as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year. Thanks, Lori. I'm excited to share with you more detail on the 2 significant strategic moves we announced this morning, which will further strengthen our portfolio and deliver long-term value for our shareholders. The announcements of an agreement to acquire Rogers Corporation, and our intent to divest a significant portion of our M&M segment, are substantial moves, advancing our strategy to shift the portfolio towards higher-growth and higher-margin businesses, while significantly enhancing the earnings stability of the Company. The acquisition of Rogers will build on the Laird Performance Materials acquisition that we closed July 1st adding another high-quality business that expands our leading market position across highly attractive end markets.  Rogers is a market leader in each of their primary product categories and brings a world-class organization with differentiated technology, innovation capabilities, technical expertise, and deep customer relationships. The same value proposition that differentiates our DuPont businesses. Rogers operates in end markets where we have already established leading positions, such as consumer and mobile electronics and others that are adjacent to our businesses such as 5G infrastructure and electric vehicles, enabling us to offer an even more attractive total value proposition to a broader base of customers, and creating the opportunity to compound growth over time given complementary products and markets.  While M&M has been the market leader in high-performance thermoplastic serving automotive, electronics, industrial, and consumer markets, we believe DuPont is no longer the best owner for this asset. By separating M&M from the rest of the portfolio, we are better positioning the business to expand on its leadership position in these markets and continue to tackle some of the industry's most critical challenges, such as vehicle safety and fuel efficiency. We will leverage existing tax attributes to complete a highly efficient cash sale of the M&M business, providing ample funding to finance the Rogers acquisition, as well as further M&A and share repurchases while maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating.  We have a few key targets, which like Laird and Rogers, we have been studying for a few years, that would be excellent additions to our portfolio. Following the completion of the intended Rogers acquisition and the planned divestiture of M&M, DuPont will focus on key emerging technologies and have enhanced top-line growth. Our participation in the auto markets going forward is much more connected the high-margin advanced technologies, enabling long-term secular trends like hybrid and electric vehicles, as well as advanced driver systems. A large portion of our order exposure will be aligned to EVs and ADAS, both of which are growing at a significant pace.  This improved balance in our end markets will drive further consistency in our results and allow us to deliver best-in-class results among our multi-industrial peers. Strengthening our position in clean energy and electric vehicles, combined with our existing positions in water, safety, and production technologies, will continue to advance our customer sustainability priorities. Slide 8 shows the modeling we have done for the Company, assuming the completion of both the M&M divestiture and the Rogers acquisition, including full achievement of a planned cost synergies. As you can see, pro forma DuPont will benchmark well above our top multi-industrial peers on both organic growth and EBITDA margin, and in line with this high-performing [indiscernible] on cyclical, which we measure as peak-to-trough earnings volatility. Our historical sales growth for the new portfolio will improve by 40 basis points to 3.8%, which is nearly 2 times the growth rate of the top peers.  This growth is driven by our exposure to high-growth end markets. For example, the semiconductor materials market is expected to grow at 46% per year, which is evidenced by the significant investments in new fabs we are seeing in all regions of the world. Our $2 billion semiconductor technology business, which holds leading positions in materials for both wafer production and packaging, is positioned to outgrow the market by 200 basis points to 300 basis points. Likewise, our $1.4 billion water business operates in markets that are expected to grow high single-digits, driven by the global response to concerns such as water scarcity and circularity.  The acquisition we're making also increases our exposures in high-growth markets such as EV, which is a market growing at 30% per year. Rogers ' high-performance elastomers, specialty bus bars, and thermal substrates, complement our existing materials, such as gap fillers, adhesives, and Nomex papers. In the new portfolio, the strength in these businesses will accelerate the performance. In 2020, our top line for the core business declined about 5%, which is a solid result compared to our top multi-industrial peers, which were down about 8%. Our new portfolio would have declined less than 3% during the worst of the recession in recent years, a substantial differential versus the peer set.  We have taken several actions to drive top quartile EBITDA margins at DuPont. The M&M and Rogers transactions will deliver an additional 140 basis points of margin improvement on a 2021 basis, floating us well above our top multi-industrial peers. The new portfolios, a collection of specialty businesses underpinned by innovation, customer relationships, and manufacturing excellence. The combination that supports robust, sustainable margins. I'm also excited about the consistency these transactions will bring to our results. Strong ties, the secular growth drivers will limit the earnings volatility in the Company throughout the cycle.  You can see the earnings volatility of the DuPont portfolio was significant from 2019 to 2020, primarily associated with the M&M segment. The same is true as we look back further where the cyclicality in the portfolio was driven by M&M. Looking forward, our portfolio will have minimal exposure to commodity feedstocks. And as a result, our cyclicality will significantly improve by 700 basis points to be in line with the top peers. In addition to comparing to our top multi-industrial peer set, we also looked at how the new portfolio will benchmark against the entire set of 24 multi-industrial companies. The results are the same.  We will benchmark well above the median of the entire multi-industrial group on both growth and margin, and in line on cyclicality. With a more clearly defined portfolio and by improving the topline growth EBITDA margins and cyclicality of the Company to be well above our peer set, I am confident the quality of our businesses will be recognized, which will translate into evaluation comparable to top peers. Getting DuPont to this point has been a multi-year journey with decisive news aligned with our value-creation levers of active portfolio management, a best-in-class operating model, and disciplined capital allocation.  Slide 9 shows the actions we have taken to transform the DuPont portfolio to a combination of world-class businesses centered in long-term secular high-growth areas. Our strategy uses intentional and included strategic decisions to shift the Company to higher-growth, higher-margin businesses with less cyclicality, while also pursuing acquisitions to strengthen our leadership position and innovation capabilities in the secular growth areas of electronics, water protection, industrial technologies, and next-generation automotive. Our portfolio transformation started with the identification of non-core businesses, where our innovation, technical expertise, and close customer relationships no longer drove a competitive advantage within the DuPont portfolio.  We have been successful at identifying great owners for majority of these businesses and our work continues. We expect to close the sale of the Clean Tech business before the end of the year for around $510 million. Earlier this year, we finalize the separation of the N&B business and an RMT transaction with IFF, creating a powerhouse in the food, beverage, health, and Biosciences markets. Separation of N&B provided a lift to the top line growth and operating EBITDA margins at the DuPont portfolio, as N&B was at the low end of the portfolio on both measures.  This was an unmatched opportunity to advance the DuPont strategy, including the receipt of $7.3 billion in tax-free proceeds, which we redeployed to create shareholder value, and position N&B and IFF for future success. Today's announcement of our intent to divest a significant portion of the M&M segment is the next step to advance our transformational strategy by increasing the resiliency and earnings stability of our portfolio. Throughout, we have carefully assessed acquisition targets, which can strengthen our leadership positions in the secular areas of Electronics, Water, Protection, Industrial Technologies, and next-generation automotive.  As I have said before, we are strategic in our approach and only pursue targets that can be justified financially and that operate in our existing markets to minimize integration and execution risks. We prefer acquisitions that provide a significant synergy opportunity similar to what we saw with the water acquisitions we completed in late 2019, the Laird acquisition earlier this year, and the intended acquisition of Rogers. We also only pursued targets were innovation and our technical capabilities set us apart, which is the case for both Laird and Rogers. Our transformation strategy has also been underpinned by operational improvements.  We have made fundamental changes in the way DuPont is run. We have put full P&L accountability into the businesses by moving oversight of manufacturing, operations, and R&D under our business precedents. We spend approximately 4% of sales on R&D and we no longer operate a central R&D function. Instead, we have empowered our businesses to allocate R&D dollars to the projects that are most critical to their growth, and then hold them accountable for delivering results. The same is true for capital spending, the majority of which has been focused on capacity constrained areas.  Throughout our transformation to strengthen our Balance Sheet has been and remains a priority. Following the N&B separation, we delivered our Balance Sheet to maintain a debt to EBITDA ratio and credit rating that provides us flexibility. We also continue to control our costs at both our manufacturing facilities, as well as at our corporate functions. We have been prudent at taking costs out of our G&A line. And today, have a best-in-class cost structure. The work at our manufacturing facilities is ongoing through continuous productivity and asset reliability improvements using new digital tools, which is an integral part of our operating plants today.  The combination of focusing the portfolio and operational improvements have been part of our strategy to unlock shareholder value and strengthen the Company. The M&M and Rogers announcements are significant strategic steps in our transformation. I'll move to Slide 10 to provide more details on the Rogers agreement. Our modeling of Rogers is based on our 2022 estimated EBITDA of $270 million, which we are highly confident the business will achieve based on a thorough diligence process, including a detailed review of their projections and assumptions. The purchase price of about $5.2 billion represents a 19x EBITDA multiple based on 2022 estimates before synergies.  The multiple is expected to be below 14x after cost synergies. We are highly confident in a synergy number, approximately $115 million and our ability to achieve most of the forecasted synergies by the end of 2023, within 18 months of closing. We expect Rogers to be accretive to top-line growth, operating EBITDA, free cash flow, and adjusted EPS upon closing. We expect sizable revenue synergies from the combination of E&I, Laird and Rogers are consistent with how we justify all deals. We have not assumed any revenue synergies in our modeling. And we expect closing to take approximately six months, putting us in the second quarter of 2022.  Because the Rogers transaction will close before we expect the M&M divestiture closed and funding the acquisition, we expect to prioritize pre -payable debt, which can be retired upon receipt of the M&M proceeds to return our leverage to more normal levels. Slide 11 provides more detail on the synergy opportunities. DuPont is in a unique position to extract value from this combination due to the synergy opportunity that comes not only from having one of the largest sub-electronic material businesses in the industry, but also from the acquisition of Laird that we completed a few months ago. We looked across all three organizations to determine where there were synergy opportunities.  As is the case in many of our transaction, where we combine businesses, we have complementary product offers in similar segments. We expect significant synergies in procurement spend, as well as G&A cost. Because Rogers as a public Company, we will also realize savings associated [indiscernible] them into our structure. Our anticipated Rogers cost synergies of $115 million combined with the cost synergies and we anticipate from the layered acquisition total approximately 6% of the combined revenue of our Interconnect Solutions business, Laird, and Rogers, which is a very achievable synergy target.  As I mentioned, we expect to achieve most of these synergies within 18 months of closing. Turning to slide 12, I'll provide more detail on the business. Rogers Corporation is a $950 million business with broad end market exposure. We expect Rogers top line to grow in the high single-digits, accelerated by leading positions in the rapidly growing categories of electric vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems. The benefits of the planned synergies will deliver uplift to the EBITDA margins across all three businesses. Rogers has two operating segments with leading positions in each.  The first segment is advanced Electronics Solutions, which includes the high frequency circuit board laminates business, and the power electronics business. Rogers second segment is the Elastomeric Material Solutions. The high frequency circuit board laminates business complements our existing printed circuit board business within Interconnect Solutions. This is approximately a $300-million business that manufacturers comp or clad laminates for high-frequency circuits using ADAS radars, 4G, 5G base stations and military communications. Also included in the Advanced Electronics Solutions segment is the power electronics business, which includes both ceramic substrates and specialty busbars for high power conversion used in applications such as electric motors for trains, ships, automobiles, and wind turbines.  Specialty busbars are used instead of cable harness systems and high-power conversion applications, when highly stable and reliable power conversion is critical. This is about a $250 million business today, but poised for significant growth with exposure to next-generation technologies including powering applications for hybrid and electric vehicles. The second segment is Elastomeric Material Solutions segment, approximately a $400-million business, which manufactures precision phones and silicon materials with high reliability and high purity for cushioning, ceiling, impact protection, and vibration management across the number of growing end markets.  This segment also has high exposure to electric vehicles for battery applications. On side 13, you can see the significant offerings in combined entities through the examples of the electric vehicle, 5G infrastructure, consumer electronics, and clean energy. The increased opportunity in electric and autonomous vehicles from the combination of Laird and Rogers adds to DuPont's existing material [indiscernible] into the electric vehicle. In a segment that is growing 30% per year, this is a tremendous opportunity to increase our share of wallet with offerings such as gap fillers, adhesives, and Nomex papers from DuPont, high-performance elastomers, specialty busbars, and thermal substrates from Rogers, and electromagnetic shielding and thermal management solutions from Laird.  Likewise, Laird and Rogers expand our offering in consumer electronics, where DuPont is already a leading materials supplier through all 3 businesses within the E&I segment, Semiconductor technologies, Interconnect Solutions, and Industrial Solutions. E&I shielding, thermal interface materials, and multi-functional solutions from Laird, as well as high performance elastomers from Rogers, will make us an even more complete material supplier to leading OEMs. The combined application engineering and design expertise will be unmatched in the industry.  We're very excited about the technical skills that will transfer to DuPont through both of these acquisitions, which will enable the businesses to continue working with customers, solve their most critical challenges using our combined portfolio, advanced technologies. A hallmark of all three companies. Customers in these industries demand this level of sophisticated innovation and part nership. You can see how the acquisition of Laird and Rogers supports our strategy to expand our presence in high-growth secular end markets, and creates opportunity for compounding growth across related products and markets.  Slide 14 shows the combination of the Laird acquisition and then the Rogers acquisition, is highly complementary and can expand our addressable markets within key electronics segments by 50%. The addition of Laird and Rogers provides an entry way into markets such as clean energy, wireless infrastructure, and defense electronics, where we previously had little exposure, but will now have distinct competitive advantages. We see further opportunities for growth by leveraging the DuPont technologies across these additional electronics markets. The timing could not be better to enter these markets.  The world is making significant investments in 5G infrastructure, clean energy, and hybrid and electric vehicles, to name a few. These investments are leading to rapid growth in these areas. Rogers has been making significant investments in these areas and has a rich pipeline of offerings that will support the next-generation technologies. The acquisition creates an exciting opportunity to capture this growth, which we think will be compounded by leverage of the combined E&I, Laird and Rogers platforms. Moving to the intended M&M divestiture on Slide 15. At DuPont, we have a proven history in adapting a best owner mindset for each of our businesses.  We constantly scrutinize our portfolio to ensure fit with our business objectives and to create as much long-term value as possible for our shareholders, customers, and employees. By announcing that we have initiated process divest a majority of our M&M segment, we're committing to do just that, finding the right owner for a tremendous asset. The business to be sold predominantly includes the Engineering Polymers and performance resins lines of business. Approximately $700 million of current year revenue, M&M segment is not included in the scope of the divestiture, and includes the automotive adhesives and multi-base businesses, which aligned nicely with our offering for [indiscernible]and industrial technologies.  The portfolio to be divested is expected to generate revenue this year of about $4.2 billion and about $1 billion of EBITDA. M&M is an industry leading combination of high-quality businesses with best-in-class technology and application development, deep customer relationships, brands, and manufacturing excellence. The business is well-positioned to capitalize on the continued transition to hybrid and electric vehicles and other emerging megatrends. The business is also poised to outperform peers through the cycle with a lean G&A structure, efficient manufacturing processes, and a reliable supply chain and key raw materials. We expected the divestiture process will move quickly.  In fact, we will launch a marketing process in the coming days. We have considered multiple deal structures as part of the strategic review. We believe a transaction that maximizes the net cash proceeds to DuPont will enable us to build on our core areas of strength, like the Laird and Rogers transaction, and create significant value for our shareholders. I look forward to updating you as our process advances. I'll wrap up with a few comments on why I'm excited about their future DuPont on Slide 16. With the completion of the Rogers acquisition and the M&M divestiture, DuPont will be building around our 4 foundational pillars, including electronics, water protection, industrial technologies, and next-generation automotive. Each of these areas is experiencing rapid growth as a result of significant secular tailwinds with long term growth drivers.  From high-frequency connectivity in the most advanced technologies, to water scarcity in some of the most remote parts of the world, the technical demands of our customers are high. And we have a unique advanced technologies to partner with them to solve these global challenges. The actions we have already taken along with those we announced today, enabled us to strengthen our leadership position in each of the markets we serve. I am confident this will lead to significant opportunities for employees and unmatched solutions for our customers. We're also creating an opportunity for significant value creation for our shareholders. As I mentioned previously, the combined transaction enhanced our financial profile through higher growth, higher margins, and significantly more stability.  We will be positioned to outperform throughout the cycle. These are indicators of a strong, healthy, and vibrant Company, and I'm confident we will benchmark with the best of our multi-industrial peers. Our capital allocation will remain balanced, returning value to our shareholders through a consistent dividend that we expect to grow with earnings and share repurchases, as well as a strong balance sheet, have been and will continue to be priorities for DuPont. We will also continue to invest in our business to grow organically and support their growth through select and targeted M&A. With that, let me turn it to Pat to open the Q&A. Good morning. Yeah. We're highly confident of there'll be a sale here. We already know people are interested in this asset. We've had many calls at even in recent times about the assets. So it's going to sell. We're starting -- literally starting the process in the next few days. And one of the great things about the sale of this, it's really extremely tax-efficient for us, which makes it very attractive. The tax leakage on this deal will be mid-single digits to high-single digits, so it's pretty incredible that we're able to accomplish that. So I'm highly confident it's going to sell. I would say just targeting for your thinking that we close a deal like that around October of next year.  By the way, I also am highly confident, which is kind of surprising. It's in everyone's sum of the parts of DuPont, M&M is by far the lowest multiple in the Company. And yet we will sell it for more than the multiple that DuPont trades at today. I would also say if you just benchmark DSMs coming to market, I think a lot of you guys and analysts have it going for at least 11 times. Our asset is a way better asset. It's better on growth. It's better on margins. It's much more global, bigger. And so I don't -- I'm confident it will sell for even more than the Company literally currently trades at now. Yes, it's pretty similar to our other deals. And by the way, it's a very achievable number for us. As we said in our prepared remarks, we took ICS, which is one of our division this will be in the E& I segment. We used ICS. We use Laird and the Rogers deal. And adding in the Laird synergies, by the way, it's 6% of revenue. So we're highly confident. We've been scoping this out for a long time. One of the nice things here, I guess I'd say nice is it's a public company. So all those costs go away, which are pretty significant obviously. And that just happens. Then a big chunk of it is G&A and functional costs, streamlining it into our structure.  We get some procurement savings also. And then we've got some facility consolidations. We've got sales offices all overlapping each other globally as an example. So we've scoped it out and a lot of detail. Obviously, we'll get more detail once we can sit down even more with the team. And I would also add, we had just closed on the Laird deal July 1, and we had announced $60 million of synergies with Laird. And the team is now at $63 million. And that's literally line-by-line, who's doing it? When are we getting it? What's the payback? So we have line of sight. And hopefully we're being conservative here on the combo at a $115 million of synergies for Rogers. Good morning. Yes. Look, Steve, it's all auto. That's all centered on the semiconductor. We did not see it in the third quarter as you could tell by Laurie's prepared remarks, we had a very robust third quarter still going along, we're seeing a little bit order pattern on the auto end go down, we're just expecting it has to through the rest of the quarter because auto builds are down 17% in the second half of the year.  So that's pretty much how we modeled it out and said, we'll probably see it here in the fourth quarter. And look, you all know it's -- consumer demands their -- auto builds are supposed to be up 11% next year, so we should be in good shape in 2022. But I think we'll probably take a little bit of a hit here in the fourth quarter, and that's what we guided to. There's no softness anywhere else in the portfolio. As you can tell, every one of our sub-segments is up nicely except for one.  So out of nine segments, 8 of them were up nicely, and the only 1 that wasn't was related to the smartphone market and we knew that. We already had highlighted that to everybody because the demand came earlier in the year of the tee up for the production of the phones, and we knew the second half of the year would be softer and it will be fine again next year. So demand's perfect everywhere else. By the way, our supply issues with force majeures have cleaned up substantially, so we're not dealing with that. We're really dealing with just the semi thing, and of course, everyone's dealing with logistics and shipping and all that. So Steve, at the end of the day if you go to the end of 2022, your numbers are clearly in the zip code there. And as we highlighted in our remarks, there are a couple of M&A targets we love. We've been looking at for literally two to three years, and we also are going to stay very balanced with share repurchase,. But we don't need to make any of those decisions now. We won't get the cash for the M&M business until about October first of next year. And we'll see where things are at that point in time. Good morning, John. Yeah. If there is anything of this size, like a Rogers or something, just to give you a feel, it would be at least around the time or after the proceeds for M&M. So we're going to put this pre -payable debt in place here just in the interim period. We can pay that off when we get the proceeds, as Lori said. And then we will have, as Q - Steve Tusa   was alluding to there, some billions of dollars available at that point in time. So we'll really be looking hard. Is it share repurchase? Is there an M&A opportunity in one of the sweet spots for us? And we'll make that decision then. But I wouldn't expect that you would see us do anything before we are close to or around the time getting those proceeds in the fall. By the way, the team is very capable. It's a separate team that's doing a lot of the work on the separation of M&M. we can get a transaction place for M&M in the next 3-to-5-month time frame. They have us a closed deal, but then we can't spend it until we do all the separation work, which is why I say October of 2022 to get all that done where the cars are done, the separations are all done, the tax works all done, where we can separate it. So that team did extremely good at doing it. You've watched us do the RMT and all that. And Jon's team is very far and very quickly into the integration of Laird. And this will just overlay on to that. So I don't see any issues from a bandwidth standpoint of the Company. Steve [Indiscernible] just that overall for DuPont to your line of question. We've highlighted you that we've had over $400 million of raw material inflation this year. $300 million of the 400 is in the M&M division for the feedstocks there. And that by the way, again, it's a great business, but that's what jerks the results around. Most of our pricing, by the way, was in the M&M division because we needed it to cover the raw material inflation. So if you take the whole rest of the DuPont portfolio, we only had a $100 million raw material inflation. That's a pretty nice place to get to from that angle also. No. First of all, I would be very disappointed if we sold M&M for a 10x multiple. By [Indiscernible] is comparing to what I'm using as an 11 multiple. By the way, there has been assets out there, not as good as this one that has sold for 12 and a little above 12 times in the marketplace. We're going to get a good number for this one. I will stress again; I have personally had phone calls from people that have interest in this asset. I think the private equity world is going to be extremely interested in this asset.  By the way, I think there is a very interesting opportunity out there because it's publicly noted, DSM is going to market with an assets that would fit beautifully with this [indiscernible] an unbelievable Company. So I think you're going to see a lot of interest around this. And it's going to garner a nice multiple, which by the way back to my point, it's the lowest multiple in some of the parts in our Company. and we'll get more for it than DuPont trades at. Yes, David. Well, first of all, look, I'm not worried about PFAS. Look, you know I want to get it resolved. I know there's a little bit of a cloud still lingering out there. We will get it resolved. The last announcement we did was a settlement that cost us $12.5 million in the State of Delaware. We're actively working and comfortable we're going to get there and we'll clean that issue up for the Company. That's number 1. Number 2, spinning E&I out, you really got to go through the analysis of what that trades for, and I agree it would trade higher. But what will new DuPont trade at on a bigger EBITDA base with what we put together here. And we're taking up our top-line growth rate.  We're taking up our EBITDA margins. We're taking out the cyclicality in the portfolio. There's no way that doesn't benchmark well against some of these premier companies that we've used. So if you get some multiple uplift in DuPont, it negates the multiple uplift from the E&I, which is a smaller EBITDA base. I'd also say I get asked a lot about because I've done a fair amount of RMT stuff. I always getting asked back. There is no partner for E&I. It's the business. There's nothing that matches up in size, even pre the Laird deal, by the way, that makes sense.  And it would be pieces of E&I, which could leave just a partial business in DuPont and take the rest of it out. And then by the way, the beauty here, again, remember the tax leakage is literally mid-single digits to high-single digits depending on what price we get for it. That's a rare situation to be in. So it makes a lot of sense for us to do M&M. I'll let Jon cover that. We're excited about it, but let me highlight, we did not put it in our -- in our analysis of the deal. But the combo of the 3: of E&I, Laird, and Rogers has us really excited. I think we had a pretty neat chart in the deck if you want to go back and look at it, but Jon, why don't you talk about it a little bit? Good morning, Vincent. Yeah, Vincent, I will let Lori comment. Lori why don't you hop in on it? Yeah, and by the way, just on the M&M front going into next year, we've continued during the fourth quarter and implement some price increase actions to make sure we keep covering the raw materials. So I think 2022 will be -- it has to be a solid year for the business. John, they have very nice wins. We did a lot as we've been hearing it in the marketplace, and obviously, studying them for a few years, but we've done a lot of due diligence around the pipeline and the wins, and they're very well positioned as Jon said on ADAS, EV with wins and a lot of design opportunities that they are working on. So we feel very good about a high-single-digit growth rate going forward for the business. Look, when we talked about rep cost synergies, hopefully we're being conservative, and we can beat those numbers as we are already are on layered by the way. So we'll keep updating you as the year goes on. By the way, the multiple is actually, I hate to get right too adjustable, but it's 13.6 times, and if we find additional synergies, we reduced it from there, and we'll just keep updating. And now that we can sit down and actually with the teams in more detail, that's usually when we can really sharpen the pencil and really look at what else we can do. And we'll be doing that over the next few months. So highly confident, we'll get that amount, and we'll -- yes, we've always been in the past, let me just say that. Well, most of that would being in the M&M business. So you try to hold price as long as you can, when [indiscernible] come down. So you might get some benefit there. But I would say over a more intermediate time, they attract each other. You wouldn't have a margin problem. If [indiscernible] did comes down significant, you could give up some price. But you hold it as long as you could. By the way, the logistics issues, I don't think are getting any better out there. All the [Indiscernible] did get better as we said. So the raw material supplies into M&M has substantially improved, which is great.  And we're able to catch up a little bit last quarter with our customers and orders we couldn't ship in the first and second quarter, but we're looking right now at additional surcharges on freight, because that has continued to go up, especially ocean freight and all that. So I don't think -- we're probably will [Indiscernible] do some here. We're actually have a meeting in the next couple of days where we are going to do a surcharge instead of a price increase on the actual product itself. So people know, look, we're just testing us [Indiscernible] all because of the freight increases. So we want to be positioned well going into 2022. No. Good morning. Yes and our exposure in the housing commercial sector in China is minimal. That's a bigger business for us on the residential side in North America. So really no impact there. Yes. Sure. So look, the 19 times I would never do a standalone in 19 times. I can tell you that. But we comfortably have it down to 13.6 times with the synergies. We know we can get it, as I said a minute ago, hopefully, we can get some upside to that. So I feel very comfortable buying. This is a very high-quality Company. And one of the things, Jon and I, and Lori, we love about it, is really it's high in technology expertise. They're scientists. The products they developed are on the cutting edge. It's exactly what DuPont does.  So the barriers around that we like and it's always -- it's to our existing end customers and it also expand some markets where we think we can leverage our products, as Jon said, into these other markets. So it's a very high-quality asset. Again, we've watched it for years and seriously for 3 years. And the beauty about the 13.6 times, we feel like they -- with the funnel they have there on the cost of some real secular growth areas that we're getting in on a burly with them. By the way, we feel like we did that with Laird, and we're already seeing it in the performance of Laird there.  Nicely outperforming what we said we would do. So we have literally bought Laird now. If you just use the numbers they're running at this year, we bought Laird 10 times. I think when we announced it, we said it was 11 times. and the performance we're going to end the year out on layered is already brought that down to 10 times. Again, on very high-quality asset, we got at a great price. We think we're right at that point with Rogers, with the secular growth there. ADAS is growing 15%, EV's are growing 30%, just to name the auto industry and Rogers is very well-positioned there and these things are just beginning to really ramp. Yeah, I don't want to answer something out of '23. But look, I think we've teed up a portfolio. As we said, it's going to be higher growth and then very little volatility in itself. [Indiscernible] dependent, if we do another acquisition or we do more share repurchase. It depends on that also because I think it's back to Q - Steve Tusa 's comments. There are some billions of dollars sitting here at the end of 2022. So depends how we redeploy that to create shareholder value also.  So there's still some big moving pieces, but again, we expect nice growth in '22 in the core new portfolio. And we expect nice growth in 2023. As Lori has mentioned, 40% of the portfolio was clearly nicely growing way nicer than GDP because they are in the secular growth areas, take our water business, you take pretty much the whole E&I sector into account there. Just the name [indiscernible] and with the Laird now in there and the Rogers in there you get a nice part of our portfolio growing at a nice clip. Well, first of all, the comps, by the way, they really are good comps because if you take the broad bucket of multi - industrials, the end markets we're in are all the key end markets, a lot of the other multi-industrial. And so we're not drifting off from something else here that's different. In fact, I would say the one thing that was different actually from the compared group was more M&M. That was probably most people would lean more towards the chemical industry and not the multi-industrial. But the portfolio now lines up end market very, very well. Look, we'll work that issue on the multi-industrial over time.  We are putting an action plan together on it. We need our investors to focus on that. We need to talk to the right people at the right funds within the big companies that invest in us and we'll work that issue. But I think over time, we will get compared, I mean, we benchmark really nice against that group. No, the 2020 -- The closing the Rogers deal, I don't see any issues. We've obviously studied the antitrust extremely deeply. So I don't see any issues there. Could that close a little bit sooner? It could. But we're just targeting the second quarter to be safe; could be a little faster. I don't think M&M will be faster than October 1, because the long pole in the tent is more the work we have to do internally at DuPont to separate it. So we'll announce a sale to somebody way sooner than October 1, but we won't be able to actually separate it out of the Company until that point in time. Well, by the way, we're down to the [indiscernible] five platforms that we mentioned. So if it could come really in any of those [indiscernible we would love to have [Indiscernible] in the water space. We love it. It's high [Indiscernible] growth rate. I think it's a sector [Indiscernible] go on for many, many years. And it's a global issue, which we can help solve for people. So we do like that space. Look, let's see how this year goes, I'm highly confident people will recognize what's in this portfolio, I will also add, I think, which would be very helpful for everybody. We started doing the teachings.  Jon did one on Semiconductor a month or so ago. We have one coming up here shortly and we're going to walk you through every key piece of the portfolio and I think going really highlight the value of our -- internally, I'll use two companies we have, Vespel and Kalrez, and I don't think anyone has a clue what those businesses are like and how awesome they are, and how good in the growth trends in those businesses is. So just the name too that we didn't talk about today. So I think the teach-ins will be very, very powerful and people will see what we have, and the value in the technology that we have in the Company. And I think that's going to be helpful also."

As you alluded to, they do use some floral products, some floral-polymers in order to help achieve some of that performance. It's a world-class supplier. They've got a diversified supply base of blue-chip companies, globally-recognized suppliers of that, who are actively involved in all of the regulatory and other industry activity. They're leading the way on that in terms of how we address some of the floral materials. Our teams have done a detailed diligence on the EH&S, the environmental, the product stewardship components of that.  And we're comfortable with what that product line is doing, how it's performing right now, and the supplier base for those materials, as it relates to the inflationary pressures to the raw material, slash pressures. It's very consistent with our electronics business, our E&I business today, in the sense that you don't see a lot of the run-ups that we experience in some of the big commodity moves. These are value-based material and you get some exposure to obviously copper used in laminates and silicone. But not any different than what we have in the rest of the portfolio and it's been -- the team's fairly comfortable with our ability to manage that proactively. Yeah. David, maybe I'll give you two quick examples here. When you look at it, Rogers really adds complementary materials and components that really build on DuPont's position in the industry today. If you use just an -- if you pull out kind of two specific application areas around 5G in applications, in smartphones, wireless infrastructure, military and defense electronics, and automotive radar system, DuPont 's the leader in flexible laminates and Laird has E&I shielding and the thermal management solutions. Rogers is the market leader in rigid PCB substrates.  And so with that enhanced offering, not only can you cross-sell customers and expand your share of wallet with a global customer base, but one of the things we're really excited about and we're already starting to see this with the layered integration process, by the way, is engaging with customers to co-design, and it help address some of their most challenging needs. To give you 1 specific example there, everybody is trying to make electronic devices smaller. And one of the ways you get smaller is you use hybrid rigid flex construction on the circuit board, and now we've got a market-leading flex circuit business, a market-leading rigid business and those complex hybrid rigid flex substrates become a lot easier to work with our customers. and they are already asking for it.  If you switch over to the electric vehicle space, we've got quite a bit of content in automotive electronics today. But we really didn't have a lot of exposure prior to Laird or Rogers into things like the automotive -- ADAS systems or the battery. And Laird brought with the EMI shielding with some of the absorbers. A great position in ADAS systems. Rogers built on that with their high-frequency laminates. And then what we're really excited about is the opportunity that they have with the specialty busbars in the specialty foams, performance foams to really address some of the critical needs in the battery packs and power assembly, power electronics part s of the electric vehicles. So you put all that together with our adhesive business, with the rest of our automotive electronics, and we'll really be a preferred partner with both the tier one auto OEMs, as well as the OEMs themselves to design the hybrid and electric vehicles of the future. Yes. Sure, John. When you look at it, it's really different based on the individual product lines and the different divisions of the business. When you look at the high-frequency laminates business, the primary competitors there are companies like Asahi Glass, AGC, who did a couple of acquisitions in the last couple of years to build up their portfolio in that space. You've got some -- Panasonic is there. So primarily Japan-based competitors. And then you've got some local folks in China who are doing some of that as well, largely because of some of the geopolitical situation. All of that is outside and we're that's in the rear-view mirror now. And the Company is really well-positioned in continuing to grow that.  On the ceramic busbars and ceramic substrates and specialty busbars, that's a pretty fragmented business. You've got companies out there like Denka, Serotec, Heraeus, and multiple others. It's a fairly fragmented landscape. What differentiates this technology is really the quality of the ceramic thermal substrates and the synergy that's created with silicon carbide power module, especially for electric vehicles. And so when you combine that with the -- similarly with the specialty busbars, that's going to replace things like the wire harness that's in a power system, as Ed alluded to in his prepared remarks; the quality there is really what allows the step up in the growth acceleration really driven by electric vehicles.  On the elastomer side, it's Company like Saint - Goban, who are really \u2013 Woodbridge [indiscernible] Danco, are kind of a few names there across the board, each of these three businesses, Rogers, it has a leading market share. They're among the leaders. They're winning in the market. They've got a great pipeline of opportunities, especially on the automotive, the advanced mobility side with EV and ADAS. They're working with all the power electronic OEMs. And a lot of those are, by the way, are E&I customers as well. So we'll have great relationships across the industry to be able to deliver some of those growth synergies in the upside on a historical growth rate.  They've been growing mid-single-digits. And with the step-up from automotive opportunities and electric vehicles, which are markets that are growing anywhere for mid-teens in ADAS systems to 30% on the EV side, they'll see a nice growth acceleration as those start to scale over the next few years. Yeah, Alex. So I'll go ahead and take that one. You got kind of -- the way to think about it is you got 2/3 of the portfolio with established products that have very attractive margin profiles that closely match the types of things that we have in the rest of the portfolio. And then you've got kind of 1/3 that is in that power electronics space. That is really just starting to scale up based on the EV s. it's great technology with a differentiated position, it has a slightly smaller margin profile today as the volumes are starting to scale up for those applications. As we add the volume in, the margins drift up nicely and then you layer synergies on top of that and you'll have a really solid, very attractive margin profile for the overall business."

After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. To ask a question during the session you will need to [Operator instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. If you require any further assistance, please [Operator instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Leland Weaver, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nLeland Weaver: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for DuPont's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings conference call. We are making this call available to investors and media via webcast. We have prepared slides to supplement our comments during this conference call. These slides are posted on the Investor Relations section of DuPont's website, and through the link for our webcast. Joining me on the call today are Ed Breen, Chief Executive Officer, Lori Koch, our Chief Financial Officer, and Jon Kemp, President of our Electronics and Industrial segment. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the slides. During our call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, our actual performance and result may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Our 2020 Form 10-K, as updated by our current and periodic reports, includes a detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today exclude significant items. We will also refer to other non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in our press release and posted to the investor page of our website. I'll now turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Breen: Thanks, Leland. Good morning everyone. And thank you for joining us. I will provide comments on another overall strong quarter, including continued advancement of our strategic priorities as a premier multi-industrial company aimed at growth and creating value for our shareholders. But first, let me acknowledge the continued determination of our teams as we navigate through unprecedented circumstances of the pandemic. As a result of the principles and protocols that we adopted over the last year, we continue to operate safely and productively on-site and remotely. We have encouraged all employees to get vaccinated. And where possible, we are working with local governments to facilitate access, including on-site vaccinations at some locations. Our Wilmington-based office locations are fully reopened. And I have to say it is great to be back in the office with our teams. Starting on Slide 2 in line with our philosophy that consistent operating performance is a key factor in creating Shareholder value, I am pleased to note that this morning we announced another strong quarter with financial results above expectations. Lori will take you through the specifics. But in summary, broad-based organic growth was driven by continued strength in our key end markets, including ongoing recovery in those most impacted by the pandemic. Despite a challenging production environment with escalating raw material costs and continued supply chain and logistics constraints, strong operating discipline and quick pricing actions resulted in about 460 basis points of margin expansion versus the year-ago period. With strong order trends continuing and confidence in our team's ability to continue to navigate through raw material and supply chain challenges, we are raising our full-year guidance for net sales, operating EBITDA, and adjusted EPS. I will provide more details on our updated guidance shortly. In addition to our financial results, we continue to execute on our balanced approach to capital allocation during the quarter. In May we further de-levered our balance sheet by redeeming 2 billion of bonds, thereby reducing our gross financial debt to 10.6 billion at the end of the quarter. Since the end of last year, we have paid down a total of 5 billion of debt and do not have another debt maturity until the fourth quarter of 2023, which further solidifies our sound liquidity position. We also returned approximately 800 million of capital to shareholders during the second quarter through share repurchases and dividends. During the second quarter, we purchased a total of 640 million in shares, which includes completion of our previous share repurchase program and the start of repurchases under our new authorization, announced last quarter, which expires on June 30, 2022. Through the first six months of the year, we repurchased approximately 1.1 billion in shares, and plan to be opportunistic with our remaining authorization as we move throughout the year. And in July, we repurchased an additional 125 million of shares. With respect to dividends, we returned about 160 million of cash to shareholders during the quarter. As we previously mentioned, we intend to work with the Board to increase our dividend annually as we grow earnings.  Before I close, I'm pleased to note that in late June, we closed on the previously announced divestiture of our Solamet business for approximately $190 million. And on July 1, we completed the acquisition of Laird Performance Materials, utilizing cash on hand. The Laird acquisition advances DuPont's strategy of growing as a global innovation leader and strengthens our leadership position in advanced electronic materials. Joining us today is the president of our global E&I segment, Jon Kemp. I am excited to have Jon on the call today. And I will now turn it over to him to provide further detail on how this acquisition complements our Interconnect Solutions business within E&I.\nJon Kemp: Thanks, Ed. It's a pleasure to be on today's call and to share more information about the acquisition of Laird Performance Materials. It's an exciting transaction for DuPont that significantly advances our position in the electronics industry and accelerates the transformation of our Interconnect Solutions business into a Total Solutions provider. We've been following Laird for several years, and have admired their capabilities as a leading provider of electromagnetic shielding and thermal management solutions, and are excited to have added their capabilities and history of growth to our portfolio. As a reminder, Laird delivered 465 million of revenue with approximately 30% EBITDA margin in 2020. E&I and Laird are both recognized for innovation, quality, and reliability and have a strong relationship across the electronics industry. This combination brings together DuPont's premier applied material science expertise with Laird to industry-leading application engineering capabilities. It also adds more content on many of the devices that we're already in. We have already begun the process of integrating Laird into our existing Interconnect Solutions business, providing opportunities to further optimize business structure, functional support, and our global site network. We expect 60 million in run-rate cost synergies by the end of year 3 with approximately 60% realized in the first 18 months. We expect to achieve cost synergies through a mix of G&A, procurement, and site consolidation initiative. On the next slide, I'll share some of the key benefits of this transaction and describe how the combination enhances DuPont's position as a leading electronic materials provider. The acquisition of Laird expands our position as an essential partner of choice for major OEMs. Laird serves a broad set of overlapping and complementary end-market across consumer electronics, telecommunications, automotive, and other industrials, with a similar geographic representation to the rest of the Interconnect Solutions business with a particularly strong presence in Asia. The 2nd way it enhances our position is through innovation. This acquisition strategically aligns us to critical needs across thermal management, signal integrity, power management, miniaturization, and high reliability and it enables us to have early engagement with OEMs in both system design and material specification creating both greater product differentiation and higher margins. The next benefit of the acquisition is that it broadens our portfolio of solutions. With Laird's unique multifunctional capabilities, we will leverage an expanded customer base, broad product portfolio, global scale, and deep technical expertise to increase speed-to-market, create new efficiencies in the development of integrated and multifunctional solutions, and provide high-value next-generation products that will deliver additional growth in the next several years. We believe customers will see immediate benefits as a combined E&I organization engages across value chains to address the increasingly complex challenges in the industry. Our combined organization will advance our leadership to help customers accelerate solutions necessary for the adoption of high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, 5G communications, smart and autonomous vehicles, and the Internet of Things. We will be well-positioned to capture growth in these key secular growth areas. In addition, we expect revenue synergies from cross-selling into complementary accounts and channel, new and faster product development for a multifunctional solution, and deeper design and co-development partnerships with OEM. With that, I'll turn it over to Lori to provide details on our second-quarter financial performance.\nLori Koch: Thanks, Jon. And good morning, everyone. I'll cover our second-quarter financial performance beginning on Slide 5. Our results for the quarter reflect the diversity and strength of our portfolio. And our team's continued ability to execute in the face of escalating raw material costs and global supply chain and logistics headwinds. Net sales of 4.1 billion were up 26% versus the second quarter of 2020, up 23% on an organic basis. The organic sales growth resulted from a 20% increase in volumes and a 3% increase in price. Currency provided a 4% tailwind in the quarter, which was slightly offset by a 1% headwind as a result of non-core business divestitures in the prior year. Overall sales growth was broad-based with double-digit growth on an organic basis in all three reporting segments and across all regions. The most notable increase versus the year-ago period is in our M&M segment, reflecting the sizable change in the global automotive market versus the prior year and disciplined pricing actions. I will provide additional color on our segment top-line results on the next slide. From an earnings perspective, we delivered operating EBITDA of 1.06 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.06 per share, up 53% and about 240%, respectively, versus the year-ago period. The earnings improvement resulted from volume gain, most notably reflecting ongoing recovery in key end-markets adversely impacted by the pandemic, and the absence of approximately 150 million in charges associated with temporary, idling, certain facilities, partially offset by the absence of a $64 million gain associated with a joint venture that had since been divested. Strong operating EBITDA leverage drove operating EBITDA margin expansion of 460 basis points. Incremental margins for the quarter were about 43%. Given the unique nature of 2020 and the discrete items that impacted our operating results in the prior year, it's important to evaluate our year-over-year operating performance for our core results on an underlying basis. Specifically, operating EBITDA for our core results during the quarter was up about 40%, versus last year after excluding the impact of the 150 million in idle [mills] (ph) incurred in the prior year, with about 240 basis points of margin expansion, and operating leverage of 1.5 times.  Similarly, I continue to track our growth versus 2019, given the significant impact the pandemic had in key end markets last year. In comparing our current second-quarter results to a more normalized performance before the pandemic all reported sales in the quarter were up 6% versus the second quarter of 2019, and up 10% versus that same period for our core sales. Operating EBITDA for our core results during the quarter was up 15% versus the second quarter of 2019 or 1.5 times leverage. From a segment perspective, E&I delivered operating EBITDA margin of 32% with 190 basis points of expansion driven by broad-based volume gains. M&M delivered significant operating EBITDA improvement driven by an overall recovery and automotive market. And the absence of approximately 130 million in charges associated with temporarily idling polymer capacity in the year-ago period. Operating EBITDA margin for the quarter was 23%, reflecting volume growth and net pricing gains resulting from actions taken ahead of escalating raw material costs. In W&P, operating EBITDA increased 4% versus the year-ago period. Operating EBITDA margin and leverage were adversely impacted, primarily by 2 key drivers. First, given contractual commitments with customers, local selling price increases lagged a headwind from raw materials and supply chain cost escalation. We expect this to resolve in the second half as price increases start to kick in. Second, production volumes for Tyvek protective garments were at peak levels in the year-ago period, given the Company's response to the pandemic. This enabled us to minimize manufacturing changeover to other Tyvek grades resulting in an overall increase in production rates. As Tyvek's output shifted from protective garments to multiple other applications, the resulting increase in expected changeovers in the current quarter decreased production rates leading to lower volume. For the quarter, cash flow from operating activities and free-cash-flow were 440 million and 224 million respectively. While these amounts have improved since the first quarter, cash flow and conversion are not where we need them to be. The headwinds we faced are related to increased working capital levels, and capital spending, and access to D&A as we advance critical capacity expansion projects. With respect to working capital, we saw an increase in inventories due to our efforts to create a more stable supply chain for our customers, given the strong demand environment and numerous raw material and logistics constraints. In the second half of the year, we expect higher cash flow and conversion rates as the global supply chain and logistic environment stabilizes. Slide 6 provides more detail on the year-over-year changes in net sales for the quarter. Starting with E&I, organic sales were up 17% on 17% volume growth with double-digit volume growth increases in all regions. Volume gains were led by mid-20s percent growth in Industrial Solutions reflecting broad-based demand strength across most product lines, but most notably for OLED displays for new phones and television launches, medical silicones in healthcare, and Kalrez seals within electronics.  Interconnect Solutions also delivered organic growth of over 20% with high teens volume growth. The volume growth was driven by higher material content in premium next-generation smartphones, partially resulting from timing shifts as select OEM demand shifted from the second half this year along with some share gains for the printed circuit board. Semiconductor technologies continued to benefit from strong electronic demand and advancements in key growth areas such as 5G, high-performance computing, and electric vehicles. During the quarter, new technology ramps and advanced nodes within logic and boundary and higher demand for memory and servers and data centers drove double-digit volume growth. The continued recovery of key end markets within W&P drove organic growth of 11% driven by volume increases. Sales gains were led by a recovery in construction with Shelter Solutions reporting organic Sales growth of more than 30%, which reflects continued strength in North American residential construction for products like styrofoam and Tyvek house wrap, and in retail channels for do-it-yourself applications. Commercial construction recorded higher sales in the quarter for Corian surfaces as global demand continues to improve. Within Safety Solutions, organic sales were up high single-digits reflecting strong volume improvement for aramid fibers and industrial, oil and gas, and automotive end market. As previously noted, lower production volumes for Tyvek reduced overall safety volume. In Water Solutions. Broad-based demand for wire technologies remains strong. However, logistics challenges, primarily in our ultrafiltration business, impacted our ability to supply, resulting in a low single-digit volume decline versus the year-ago period. We expect organic sales growth for the year for Water Solutions to be in the mid to high single-digits. The most notable increase in topline improvement within our M&M segment which had organic sales growth of over 50%. The improvement was driven by the continuing recovery of the global automotive market, which represents about 60% of the segment from an end-market perspective and helps deliver strong volume growth across all 3 lines of business. Local pricing gains of 13% also contributed to organic sales growth, reflecting our actions taken to offset raw material costs and higher metals pricing in the advanced solutions business. Excluding metals pricing, the local price was up about 8%. within Engineering Polymers, global supply constraints of key raw materials continue to improve but are expected to remain tight through the end of the year. We continue to expect to recover lost volume related to these disruptions as the raw material constraints are alleviated. Turning to Slide 7, I mentioned earlier that adjusted EPS of $1.06 per share was up over 240% from $0.31 per share in the year-ago period. Higher segment earnings resulted in a Net benefit totaling over $0.40. This Net benefit resulted mainly from higher volumes and the absence of vital records in the prior year. Offset slightly by portfolio changes, which includes the absence of a gain recorded in the prior-year incorporate. Also providing a significant benefit to adjusted EPS, versus last year, was an approximate $0.30 per share benefit, due to a lower share count. The benefit from lower interest expense in the current quarter, as a result of our recent delivering actions, was mostly offset by a higher base tax rate compared to last year. Our base tax rate for the quarter of 19.8% was higher than the year-ago period, due to the absence of certain discrete gains benefiting the prior-year rate. For the full year 2021, we currently expect our base tax rate to be closer to the lower end, our expected range of 21 to 22%. With that, I'll now turn it back over to Ed.\nEd Breen: Thanks, Lori. Let me discuss our financial outlook on Slide 8, which includes our view of the third quarter and full-year 2021. We are raising our full-year guidance range for net sales, operating EBITDA, and adjusted EPS. Along with the underlying improvements that we are expecting compared to our previous estimates, our revised guide also reflects the acquisition of Laird and the divestiture of the Solamet business. In addition, this morning we announced the change in how we will treat intangible amortization expense, beginning in the third quarter for purposes of determining adjusted EPS. at the midpoint this range provided, we now expect net sales for the year to be about 16.5 billion and operating EBITDA to be about 4.235 billion. Also, we now expect adjusted EPS to be $4.27 per share at the midpoint of the range provided. This reflects about $0.23 underlying rates to our original estimate, a $0.10 benefit from the Portfolio changes, and a $0.27 full-year benefit related to the amortization reporting change. For the third quarter of 2021, we expect net sales to be about 4.2 billion, operating EBITDA to be about 1.07 billion, and adjusted EPS to be about $1.12 per share. All at the midpoints for the ranges provided. Before opening up for Q&A, I'd like to provide some highlights on our commitment to ESG, and what we're doing to sustainably grow and operate our businesses for the long term. In June, we published our 2021 sustainability report, which reflects our first full-year progress against the 2030 goals that we set in 2019. Our report highlights more than 50 examples of how our teams are addressing the environmental and social needs of our customers and communities. Some of the highlights from this report are reflected in Slide 9. ESG was fundamental to our core long-term strategy, which is why the Board of Directors and I made the decision to incorporate the progress on our sustainability goals into our incentive compensation program beginning this year. As an innovation leader, we believe our biggest lever to effect economic, environmental, and social progress is through working directly with our customers. Today, our R&D investment is focused on the intersection of key market trends and the needs of sustainable development. One example of how we're doing this is in the area of addressing the global need for clean water. Our Water Solutions business recently launched its B-Free technology. This pre-treatment solution enables a significant improvement in the reliability of reverse osmosis desalination plants. Another example is advanced mobility. The broad adoption of electric vehicles is fundamental in addressing climate change. Through leveraging our broad portfolio of expertise and battery assembly and thermal management for electric vehicles, our DuPont M&M team collaborated with General Motors to develop an advanced adhesive solution for use in electric vehicles. In June, as a result of our close collaboration, GM recognized the DuPont team with a GM Supplier of the Year award. The power of customer partnerships to drive sustainability is a key element to our long-term growth strategy. And I am confident that we will continue to deliver these types of wins in the future. With that, let me turn it to Leland to open the Q&A.\nLeland Weaver: Thank you, Ed. Before we move to the Q&A portion of our call, I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. We will allow for 1 question and 1 follow-up question per person. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.\nOperator: Again then I have a reminder to ask the question again. You will need to [Operator Intructions]. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster.\nLeland Weaver: Operator, do we have any questions?\nOperator: The first question comes from the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nJohn Walsh: Hi. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking the questions.\nEd Breen: Hey, John.\nLori Koch: Hey, John.\nJohn Walsh: Maybe just -- the first question is around your gross profit margin improvement in the quarter. I know there are some moving pieces there with the M&M idling, but by my calculation, you're up almost -- still almost 200 basis points year-on-year. So just curious, how much of that you think is sustainable. Maybe what's driven by some of your longer-term programs versus what might have been benefits from the year-ago comp or something else there to call out.\nLori Koch: Yeah. Our margins were around 36% in the second quarter. If you look to the back half and the guidance that we provided that we expect them to remain around that range. And so if you isolate all of the one-timers out of 2020, we were around 35%. We saw about 100 basis points of improvement underlying. We've mentioned in the past that we see a few hundred basis points of improvement in gross margin getting closer to that 40% range over the next few years. So we continue to execute against that commitment. Part of it, as you had mentioned, is just from -- with this year's improvement is just from the stronger volume resulting with higher yields for our facilities and higher results. But we're also driving improvement in reliability, enabling some digital tools across the organization and higher throughput throughout our organization with the one exception as we had mentioned, within our Tyvek operations, that we did see gross margin deceleration there. Just a result of the fact that last year we were to run only Tyvek medical grades in order to be able to meet the pandemic response. And this year as that demand waned we returned to other grades of Tyvek results in more changeovers and therefore some yield and volume hits. But overall, we're on track with our commitment to get closer to that 40% range over the next couple of years.\nJohn Walsh: Great. And then maybe just as a follow-up, I was curious if you could be a little bit more explicit with your views on the timing of smartphone demand and shipments in the back half. One of your competitors is expecting to see a decline there. I was just curious if you could provide a little bit more color there.\nEd Breen: Since we have Jon with us, we'll let Jon take that one.\nJon Kemp: Yeah. John, good question. So in the first half of the year, we definitely saw some acceleration of orders from smartphone customers really as a result of a couple of factors. There was a late timing to device launches in the back half of last year. Strong demand moved some of those orders into the first part of this year. And then you had a lot of folks just trying to secure supply reliability in the face of some of the raw material and logistics challenges. So in general, we think smartphones are going to grow about 10% over the course of the year, not quite as deep a seasonal curve as maybe what we've seen in the last couple of years. So the curve is flattened, but general demand continues to be strong.\nEd Breen: Jon you might want to mention for the group that this -- because this is part of ICS, the mix of ICS, because it's not all smartphones, is it?\nJon Kemp: Yeah, sure, Ed. The Interconnect Solutions business is about 25% driven by smartphone demand. About 30% of the demand is other consumer electronics, whether that's laptops, computers, tablets, and smart devices, about 20% is automotive, 20% broad industrial demand, and then the rest in telecommunications.\nJohn Walsh: Great. Appreciate the color and I'll pass the baton.\nEd Breen: Thanks, John.\nLori Koch: Thanks, John,\nOperator: The next question we have is Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.\nJeff Sprague: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nEd Breen: Hey, Jeff.\nLori Koch: Hey, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Good morning. Ed or Lori, could you just elaborate a little bit more on what you're thinking on cash flow, how the working capital might kind of unwind over the balance of the year here, and could you give us a range of what you expect actual free cash flow to be?\nEd Breen: Yeah, Jeff. Look, we purposely have to build up some inventory. Obviously look, our receivables were up with sales, were very good on payables. We purposely kind of took a turn here to build some inventory, by the way it\u2019s really in three categories, semi-finished, raw, and a little bit of finished goods inventories you will see when we come out with our Q. And it's mostly in the M&M business. And by the way, on the raw side, we've taken in inventory, and in many cases, we're waiting for glass fibers to do our compounding and finish it. But we wanted to supply in house just because of all the challenges out there in the supply chain. So we purposely have allowed that to build some. All of the inventory, by way, is good and we'll ship that out. So we are free cash flow conversion of the first half is not what we would normally run as a company obviously. We will clearly improve fairly significantly in the 2nd half of the year. And I think Jeff we\u2019ll give you a little more guidance when we get to the 3rd quarter on where we think we will land for the year, but we definitely took a little bit different tact to kind of be able to satisfy our customer base better in this challenging environment.\nLori Koch: Yeah. I\u2019d just add one more point to note on the headwind too is CapEx versus D&A.We're forecasting around $900 million in CapEx that compares to roughly 650 of depreciation, so we've -- advancing select capacity high return investments will wrap up the Kapton K4 investment in Circleville this year, and we continue to advance the Tyvek Line 8 expansion in Luxembourg, which are causing us to be a little higher than depreciation as we advanced those initiatives. But we still will have cash, we'll continue on the buyback path in the second half. We'd noted on the call that we did a 125 million in July. We'll be getting back in the market here shortly, and continue to execute against that open $1.5 billion plan.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Thanks for that color. And I guess maybe just as a natural follow-on to that. Obviously, all the puts and takes going on this year, but on the new EPS construct, would you expect to be able to normalize be converting in the low nineties on this EPS construct, free cash flow\u2026?\nLori Koch: I don't -- Yeah. I think -- I don't know that we'll get to the 90% this year. So I think with the headwinds that we're seeing and working capital as well as the CapEx in excess of D&A, I think 90 will be -- would be tougher this year. I think if you normalize where we've been in the past, it's very strong. We've had 170% roughly last year, and a previous couple of years, are right around a 100% mark. So as soon as we get through this difficult raw material and supply environment, we'll get back to our usual run rate, but I don't see it this year.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Understood. Thank you.\nEd Breen: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: The next question we have Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.\nSteve Tusa: Hey, good morning.\nEd Breen: Hey, good morning, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: I - you may have addressed it, but I guess I'm getting to an incremental in the second-half of mid to high 20s reported. And then, I think you had a few idling -- residual idling impact. So the core incremental would maybe be a bit below that. Is that -- am I looking at the math the right way or maybe there's some other puts and takes?\nLori Koch: You are. Yes, you're in the right ballpark. And really, that deceleration from incremental margins that we saw in the first-half is really just the impact of the pickup in raw material escalation. We are getting it all-in price that, as you know, will hurt margin percent, and then the incremental margin will be a little bit weaker as we navigate that in the back-half.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. That's helpful and then just price on -- in mobility materials, a huge number obviously this quarter. Does that kind of sustain itself in the low double-digit range in the back half, the price mix impact?\nLori Koch: It does, yeah. We see it strong again in Q3. We'll see how Q4 plays out and we'll also start to get price within W&P as we had mentioned. We didn't have price in and W&P and 2Q. We will look to have low to mid-single-digit price improvement in W&P. One thing to be careful of is the metals impact. That really plays with the results running through corporate, and then the results running through M&M. As silver price, for example, that impacts the M&M portfolio, rises, we've got contractual pass back that we get the price, but it does impact the cost. So that's one piece. So if you normalize that out from the M&M results, which were as reported 13, we are about closer to 8%. So that's more like the underlying polymer-driven price increases.\nSteve Tusa: And then just one, quick one on that last one, if these raws start to fade, do you give that price back? Is it -- is it that kind of contractual where that price would go in the other direction as we look out to '22?\nLori Koch: On the metal, Steve, yes. It would move directly with the metals price. Within the overall polymer portfolio we would envision that we would have to start to give it back if we see the nylon feedstocks, for example, start to reduce. We would imagine that we would be giving back that price. I don't know about the exact timing of it. We will obviously try to hold the price as best as what we can, but it would be a headwind if raws start to decelerate.\nEd Breen: Margin would hang in there obviously, Steve, in that environment. But you -- they won't price-hike quarter-to-quarter exactly but you'd give it up over a year period probably tie-out.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. Got it. Okay. Great. Thanks a lot for the color. Super helpful.\nEd Breen: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Next question we have Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is open.\nScott Davis: Good morning, everybody.\nEd Breen: Hey, Scott.\nScott Davis: Can we talk about the water business a little bit? I mean, the comment on the appendix, just water technologies hit due to logistics. What is it about that business in particular, that made it harder to get price, and we've seen price pretty broadly, I think across the industrial segment this quarter. So what is it about that business structurally, and can you capture it in real-time? Are you perpetually behind here on price, or can you catch up pretty quickly in the upcoming quarter?\nEd Breen: Yes. Scott. It's probably overall and Lori made this comment just overall, the water business seems very healthy as we move forward. And as Lori had mentioned, our topline should be mid to high single-digits this year. We had the logistics issue, by the way it was also I\u2019d call an export issue out of one of our product lines in Germany that held us up this -- at the end of the quarter, so we couldn't get it out the door; it was a fairly significant project shipment we were doing. So that'll come out in the third quarter, and we should have nice revenue growth in the third quarter. And then I\u2019d say just generally this is true of the water business, but W&P in general, we put price increases through during the second quarter. But a lot of them, we, especially in the water business, because there's some project-driven business we have locked contracts for some period of time, usually about a quarter by the way. So the price will lag about that much before we can implement it. So we expect to see positive price in the 3rd quarter in the whole W&P sector in general which we didn't see in the 2nd quarter. If we put the increases through we'll start to actually see it kick-in in the 3rd quarter.\nScott Davis: Okay. That's helpful. And then, since we got Jon on the line, are there more deals like Laird out there in electronics? I don't really know that -- many of us are in the line are huge in the weeds in that particular business, but if you can help us understand how fragmented that -- or if perhaps if there are more deals like that out there.\nJon Kemp: Yeah, Scott, thanks. We -- obviously, we've seen a number of deals across the electronics industry. I think it's an industry characterized by a -- with a fairly fragmented supplier base across a number of core technologies. We're obviously interested in continuing to build out our portfolio in places where the technology is adding value to help our customers solve problems, especially those that are aligned with leading-edge technology and semiconductor 5G materials. And even in our Industrial Solutions business with some of the precision parts and medical silicones continuing to strengthen those we believe that there will continue to be opportunities for us to continue to add and build onto that part of our Portfolio.\nScott Davis: Fantastic, thanks. Good luck, Jon. Thanks, everybody.\nJon Kemp: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question, we have David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you again and have a good quarter. Question for Jon. Jon, given the new rebrand, strengthened Portfolio, what is the underlying growth of this business over the next three years?\nJon Kemp: Yeah David, good question. Obviously, it's been a really strong demand environment for the last couple of years. 2020, even in a pandemic environment, was strong, and we were able to grow nicely. 2021 is also shaping up to see the continuation of those trends. Overall, broadly, we would expect it to be mid to high single-digit growth over the time horizon that they'll be puts-and-takes along the way. But really strong, robust demand conditions across all three of our businesses going forward.\nDavid Begleiter: Very good. And then, how is the M&A pipeline in the non -electronics areas of the business?\nEd Breen: Yeah, David, I'm not going to get into specifics on it, but we do have a few targets we're seriously studying. I'd say a little bit bigger than Bolton, but on the bigger end of Bolton, if I could use that term. Barry, I know I've highlighted before we were looking at one water asset that was tucked in and we talk about that. We didn't think the economics worked well for us. So that's off the table, but there is a couple of the areas we're interested in, but it would be something that we're already in. Like electronics, for instance, Jon just talked about where we can add on some technologies and grow so there is a couple of areas besides electronics, we're looking at. But again, down the sweet spot of what we know how to do.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you.\nEd Breen: Yeah, thanks, Dave.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question, we have Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.\nVincent Andrews: Thanks and good morning, everyone. Just maybe, Ed. How are you thinking about the fourth quarter in terms of maybe seasonality, as well as sort of what you think happens in terms of raw material costs and availability? Just help us understand what's baked in there.\nEd Breen: Yeah. So I think this year, the seasonality will be a little bit different Vincent. We'll start to recover some of the M&M volumes that we couldn't ship because of supply constraints. So I think that will plugin a little bit more in the fourth quarter, and I think if you look at the guide we gave, you'll kind of see that they're -- an overall picture is we went into the second quarter thinking that raw materials were about a $300 million headwind. We are now estimated to be 400 million of a headwind. Again, as Lori had mentioned though, we will get a price, it won't tie quarter-to-quarter. But we'll get Price to cover that and you can see obviously we got a nice price in M&M this quarter. We'll start getting Price in W&P next quarter. We think we'll see some -- a little bit more escalation on raws in a few areas in W&P, which will hold the margins back, maybe a little more than we would want to go into the third quarter. But again, still solid about where we were in the second quarter. And then, my -- I'll say my personal opinion is the raws have 80%, 90% peaked at where they are at here. And our guide plans that they hold through the year at these higher raw levels. But again, we get a price That's all.\nVincent Andrews: Okay. That's very helpful and then maybe this is a follow-up. I think a few weeks ago you did a settlement with Delaware. Maybe you could just speak to any update to the broader PFOS settlement strategy you have, and whether we should be anticipating further state by state settlements or -- particularly states where maybe you don't have manufacturing capabilities. I thought the idea was just to concentrate on where you did. But -- just a broad update on what's your thinking.\nEd Breen: Yeah, look, Delaware ended up costing us $12.5 million. And remember, Delaware was 1 of the ones I would say where we manufactured because our big plant is literally right across the Delaware River. And the state of Delaware actually owned and controls the Delaware river basin in that area. Look, I think the good news is we have a really good agreement between the three companies Comoze, Corteva, and DuPont. We're holding hands and working together really well, and I think that the Delaware one was a great example of that. So we have a few other states where we did have manufacturing locations. Let me just say, obviously we're in conversations. I think you could probably use Delaware as a blueprint. Some other states have wrapped us into legal issues where we absolutely didn't do anything at all. I would point out Vermont as one of them. We have nothing there and nothing even close to being there. So each one is a little bit of a different strategy, but we're very focused on trying to resolve more and more of those issues. And I think Delaware was the first step to see what we're up to.\nVincent Andrews: Okay. Thanks for the clarity on that. Appreciate it\nEd Breen: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And next question we have Stephen Byrne with Bank of America.\nStephen Byrne: Yes. Thank you. It's curious to hear your views on what you think the opportunity is to utilize your suite of water treatment technologies in direct lithium extraction, and assuming there are some brine deposits out there that you might be able to treat that others can't, do you think the best way to realize the value of your technology is just continuing to sell materials, or would you consider more of an investment in that business?\nLori Koch: Yeah, we're looking at the opportunity right now with our water filtration business in Lithium-ion battery space. And so it's early days looking at it, we're working with some partners as well to understand the opportunity. I don't know that we would do it. An investment in an area outside our current technology, we to take advantage of that right now. We'll continue to study and see if that's the right decision we've got. Capacity constraints that we're biting up against in the water business too. So we're studying some high-return water capacity expansion efforts. Right now, I'm actually on my way to Minnesota on Thursday to look at our current operations to understand what the opportunity is. So we're aware of the potential opportunity and landscape and we'll continue to study it.\nStephen Byrne: Thank you, Lori. And just to follow up on your comments about your settlement with the State of Delaware, and your focus on trying to resolve PFAS issues associated with your manufacturing plants. Just a couple of weeks ago there was a Hoosick Falls, New York case and you all chose not to settle that. Is that where -- a downstream manufacturing plant for you? Were you a materials supplier with that plan or do you just not want to open that door to other settlements?\nEd Breen: No. Well, I -- yeah. I'd say the combination of -- I know that the settlement came out. Three other companies were involved in the settlement. We decided not to settle. Look at some point, we will, but the precedent of even that low number you saw from the others was not something we were willing to do because we didn't do anything there. And we're not going to set a precedent that's inappropriate for the Company. So even though a single million dollars, we still thought that was not appropriate. And I'll just leave it at that. We're well on top of it. We have a strategy and we'll let it play out.\nStephen Byrne: Thank you.\nEd Breen: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. Next question, we have John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn McNulty: Taking my question. For the first one, just -- given the supply chain disruptions that you saw, some of the freight-related issues, can you quantify what the impact was on your sales? And is it fair to assume that whatever was lost or misplaced this quarter, you can make back up in 3Q or 4Q, or is there any risk that some of those sales just have disappeared? How should we be thinking about that?\nLori Koch: I think it breaks them really across M&M and W&P. And in M&M, it's the more raw material constraint. So we saw a $100 million of the top line in the first quarter and another $100 million in the second quarter. We'll look to eat away at that in the 2nd half, but I don't know that we'll get all of that in the 2nd half. It depends on raw material availability. Most of them have generally resolved themselves except glass fiber, which goes into a significant amount of our polymers.  And so, we'll see how the glass fiber market continues to evolve but as we see it right now, we don't see the full 200 million in the 2nd half. It will trickle in 2022 but we intend to get it all back over time. It's not lost sales, it's really just shifted. And then in W&P, it was more on the logistic side, hitting our water business. As I had mentioned, we had some logistical constraints in Europe. We would size on around $25 million and we would look to get those back this year.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. Fair enough. And then, maybe just to speak to the Semiconductor industry. I mean, the cycle seems like it's heated up. We're starting to see significant investments, especially with concerns about security, and national security, and that kind of thing. So we're also seeing further investment in the U.S. and maybe away from the more traditional Asian regions. I guess, can you speak to how that opportunity presents itself for DuPont and if there are incremental challenges just given some of the diversity or some incremental benefits and how we should be thinking about that in terms of your investment going forward there?\nJon Kemp: Yeah, great question. And when we think about the semiconductor market, clearly really strong investment trends by all of the leading OEM s in multiple regions. So you see the Tier 1 fabs who are investing up -- in aggregate, hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 2 or 3 years. Some in the U.S., some and Asian markets, some in Europe to expand and build capacity. Most of that capacity is going to be built to accommodate the leading edge, both on the logic foundry side as well as on the memory side. We see that as extremely favorable to our business dynamics when you make those investments at leading-edge boundaries than that increases the number of -- it increases the manufacturing complexity, as well as the purity of the materials, all of which plays the sweet spot of what we're able to provide for our customers. And our portfolio was broad enough that we're really touching every step of the manufacturing process for the wafer. So the partnerships that we have with the OEMs are strong. We continue to work together on qualifying materials for all of those next-generation leading-edge solutions. And as we start to see the wafer starts to come online, we've already seen some benefit this year to new wafer capacity. We'll continue to see wafer capacity ramp up over the next couple of years as some of those investments start to come online, and we're really well-positioned to capitalize on that trend.\nJohn McNulty: Thanks very much for the call. Appreciate it.\nEd Breen: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question, we have Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.\nBob Koort: Thank you very much. Good morning.\nEd Breen: Good morning, Bob.\nLori Koch: Good morning.\nBob Koort: And I wanted to talk about the characterization of the Company. I know when you came on board, and spun out and separated DuPont, there was an ambition to be a services provider and not necessarily a chemical Company, but it seems like the last few months you've traded a lot like a chemical Company. You get some devaluation and some raw material issues that hit you. Why do you think the market's not willing to look at you more through that multi-lens? And then, I know you looked at competitors at the time, ITW, Honeywell, 3M, those kind of names. How many benchmarked versus them, say over the last 6 or 9 months, how do you feel you are stacking up? Thanks.\nEd Breen: Yes. So look, we look at every end market we're in and analyze all the multi-industry companies. And I -- you can do -- I'm sure Bob, you've done it. I think we stack up extremely well. Bob, I think part of it is, and I don't disagree with your overall comment. We've created a little more like a Dow or Lyondell, obviously at a higher multiple. But I think over time the consistency of our results will prove out that we're a premier multi-industrial Company. It takes some time. We've had a year and a half of very consistent results. I think one thing we proved that -- I heard -- Lori and I heard this a lot, especially from people that follow multi-industry companies is, how would DuPont react in a downturn? And when the pandemic hit, I think our decremental margins were not the best but best-in-class with the top tier companies in our top-line in the worst drop 10% in our decremental jump right in there. So I think we proved a lot of people thought the chemical Company, you kind of do a general comment, you think we're going to drop pretty significantly in the downturn and we did not. So I think that was a big proof point through the cycle we can perform very well and obviously, we're performing very well with great incremental margins now. And on the upside is the revenue comes back. But if you really look at the pieces on the Company, there's very little what you would call direct chemical commodity exposure in the Company anymore. I mean, Jon sitting here next to me, you look at our electronics business. It's a steady, mid-to-high single rolling industry. should be pretty consistent along the way. So I think over time, we'll get to evaluation. But I think for our multiple cities versus the better multi-industry companies. I think we got a lot of runway in front of us. So I think consistency going forward will prove the day.\nBob Koort: Yeah. Perhaps. Old perceptions just die slowly. But Lori, I wanted to ask you one thing. You mentioned in Tyvek that a year ago, you guys were really pumping out the personal protection and maybe had more efficient runs through your plants. Was there also an issue where those who were higher-margin sales or was it just a function of you had better operating utilization, and that's what gave you better profitability there?\nLori Koch: It really just came down to the number of gains and productions. The margin profile across the different end markets is the same. It was really just the ability to just run out the protective garments, not have the changeovers, that enabled us to really reduce our downtime and up to our data protection.\nBob Koort: Got you. Thanks so much.\nEd Breen: Thanks, Rob.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question we have PJ Juvekar with Citi.\nPJ Juvekar: Good morning.\nEd Breen: Yes, good morning, PJ.\nPJ Juvekar: Good morning. Another question on the electronics. You talked about advanced nodes in your Semiconductor business. Can you talk about your market share in these advanced nodes? And then what happens with pricing? Because typically these new nodes you get better pricing while pricing tends to decline over time in the base business. And you didn't get much pricing this quarter. So generally, talk about pricing as well as you talked about advanced nodes and the market share there. Thank you.\nJon Kemp: Yeah, PJ. Good question. The advanced nodes, obviously, are critical for us. I would say the bulk of our Portfolio is positioned to be able to help our customers solve for solutions at the advanced nodes whether that's at below 20-nanometer and below be it the 1475 and now even 3. When it talked about market share, obviously each fab and each customer is different and I want to stay away from customer-specific comments. But in general, our Portfolio is weighted more towards the advanced nodes. And probably a little bit more on the logic side versus the memory side. Although we definitely participate broadly across both segments of the market. On the pricing question, we typically -- the electronics segments, in general, would be about -1% a year based on the cost down and performance expectations of our customers. And where we really can capture price is on the next-generation products and they tend to be fairly fast cycle launches of new technology. So we typically get a price on new technology and then, that technology pricing will erode overtime constantly, replaced with the next generation of products where we get to price. In general, we see price in the -- down 0.5% to maybe 1.5%. This year's pricing is relatively flat, so we're actually holding price pretty well in this environment. And I think as Lori alluded to earlier, we'll continue to see a positive price and a flat to positive price for the rest of the year.\nPJ Juvekar: Great. Thank you. And Ed, you sold N&B then bought Laird. Should we expect a phase of consolidation here where maybe you make some small bolt-on acquisitions and steady the ship? Or do you think a bigger divestiture could be on the card for the next 12 months? Thank you.\nEd Breen: Look, we've been looking at some other acquisition targets, as I mentioned earlier. Again, they're gonna be in the sweet spot of what we do. I put it right in the layer category, by the way. So the numbers in the math have to work first. So we'll see what occurs. We're always open to looking at things that will create value for our shareholders, so I would never say never on something bigger. But it's not at the forefront of our thinking at this point.\nPJ Juvekar: Thank you.\nEd Breen: Thanks.\nOperator: Again. The last question, we have John Roberts with UBS. Your line is open.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you. Which businesses are still down the most versus pre-pandemic? Pyramids for oil and gas and aerospace come to mind. Maybe printing solutions may be still down meaningfully from pre-pandemic. How much is left to go in terms of recovery?\nEd Breen: You hit breakeven. It looks like you're looking at one of our charts. Oil and gas are still down from 2019 by 15%, aerospace is down 23%. But by the way, just to give you, they're all off their bottom. Oil and Gas in the 2nd quarter of 2020, which is the rough quarter, was down 50%. Now it's only from 19% it's only down 15%. aerospace was down 31% in 20. Again, only down 23 now. In everything else or revenue was positive to '19 across auto smartphone, Semi, Tyvek, General Industrial are all positive to ' 19 levels. They're the two remaining ones, but again, lifting really nice off the bottom construction in total is also about 5% from ' 19 levels. So nice recovery there. That was another one a quarter ago, we were still negative.\nLori Koch: Yeah. And on the other side, our revenue is back. If -- but if you look at the volume side, we're still weaker. If you look at auto builds in 2Q, they were down 15%. We still see them being down for the full year versus '19, so not back to that 89 million build level. So upside as we head into 2022 as that market continues to stabilize them.\nJohn Roberts: Okay. And then it sounds like you didn't look at co-venture. I don't know whether that's a question for Jon or somebody else. But since you have some Industrial, in the electronics and industrial, why wouldn't that have made sense?\nJon Kemp: So look, we've got a really strong plating business. We're well-positioned in that industry. We look at a lot of different targets. Our plating Portfolio is more focused on consumer electronics as opposed to some of the more industrial applications that you may see from some of our plating competitors. So just strategically, it wasn't as strong a fit for us as maybe some other folks in the industry.\nJohn Roberts: Okay. Thank you.\nLeland Weaver: So thanks, everyone. Later this quarter, we will kick off a series of webinars to highlight some of the different lines of business within our reporting segment. Our first session happens to be on the 22nd of September. Well, Jon will cover semiconductor technology, so I hope that you all will be able to join us for that. Thanks for joining today's call. And for your reference, a copy of our transcript will be posted on our website. This concludes our call. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ed Breen",
            "content": "Thanks, Leland. Good morning everyone. And thank you for joining us. I will provide comments on another overall strong quarter, including continued advancement of our strategic priorities as a premier multi-industrial company aimed at growth and creating value for our shareholders. But first, let me acknowledge the continued determination of our teams as we navigate through unprecedented circumstances of the pandemic. As a result of the principles and protocols that we adopted over the last year, we continue to operate safely and productively on-site and remotely. We have encouraged all employees to get vaccinated. And where possible, we are working with local governments to facilitate access, including on-site vaccinations at some locations. Our Wilmington-based office locations are fully reopened. And I have to say it is great to be back in the office with our teams. Starting on Slide 2 in line with our philosophy that consistent operating performance is a key factor in creating Shareholder value, I am pleased to note that this morning we announced another strong quarter with financial results above expectations. Lori will take you through the specifics. But in summary, broad-based organic growth was driven by continued strength in our key end markets, including ongoing recovery in those most impacted by the pandemic. Despite a challenging production environment with escalating raw material costs and continued supply chain and logistics constraints, strong operating discipline and quick pricing actions resulted in about 460 basis points of margin expansion versus the year-ago period. With strong order trends continuing and confidence in our team's ability to continue to navigate through raw material and supply chain challenges, we are raising our full-year guidance for net sales, operating EBITDA, and adjusted EPS. I will provide more details on our updated guidance shortly. In addition to our financial results, we continue to execute on our balanced approach to capital allocation during the quarter. In May we further de-levered our balance sheet by redeeming 2 billion of bonds, thereby reducing our gross financial debt to 10.6 billion at the end of the quarter. Since the end of last year, we have paid down a total of 5 billion of debt and do not have another debt maturity until the fourth quarter of 2023, which further solidifies our sound liquidity position. We also returned approximately 800 million of capital to shareholders during the second quarter through share repurchases and dividends. During the second quarter, we purchased a total of 640 million in shares, which includes completion of our previous share repurchase program and the start of repurchases under our new authorization, announced last quarter, which expires on June 30, 2022. Through the first six months of the year, we repurchased approximately 1.1 billion in shares, and plan to be opportunistic with our remaining authorization as we move throughout the year. And in July, we repurchased an additional 125 million of shares. With respect to dividends, we returned about 160 million of cash to shareholders during the quarter. As we previously mentioned, we intend to work with the Board to increase our dividend annually as we grow earnings.  Before I close, I'm pleased to note that in late June, we closed on the previously announced divestiture of our Solamet business for approximately $190 million. And on July 1, we completed the acquisition of Laird Performance Materials, utilizing cash on hand. The Laird acquisition advances DuPont's strategy of growing as a global innovation leader and strengthens our leadership position in advanced electronic materials. Joining us today is the president of our global E&I segment, Jon Kemp. I am excited to have Jon on the call today. And I will now turn it over to him to provide further detail on how this acquisition complements our Interconnect Solutions business within E&I. Thanks, Lori. Let me discuss our financial outlook on Slide 8, which includes our view of the third quarter and full-year 2021. We are raising our full-year guidance range for net sales, operating EBITDA, and adjusted EPS. Along with the underlying improvements that we are expecting compared to our previous estimates, our revised guide also reflects the acquisition of Laird and the divestiture of the Solamet business. In addition, this morning we announced the change in how we will treat intangible amortization expense, beginning in the third quarter for purposes of determining adjusted EPS. at the midpoint this range provided, we now expect net sales for the year to be about 16.5 billion and operating EBITDA to be about 4.235 billion. Also, we now expect adjusted EPS to be $4.27 per share at the midpoint of the range provided. This reflects about $0.23 underlying rates to our original estimate, a $0.10 benefit from the Portfolio changes, and a $0.27 full-year benefit related to the amortization reporting change. For the third quarter of 2021, we expect net sales to be about 4.2 billion, operating EBITDA to be about 1.07 billion, and adjusted EPS to be about $1.12 per share. All at the midpoints for the ranges provided. Before opening up for Q&A, I'd like to provide some highlights on our commitment to ESG, and what we're doing to sustainably grow and operate our businesses for the long term. In June, we published our 2021 sustainability report, which reflects our first full-year progress against the 2030 goals that we set in 2019. Our report highlights more than 50 examples of how our teams are addressing the environmental and social needs of our customers and communities. Some of the highlights from this report are reflected in Slide 9. ESG was fundamental to our core long-term strategy, which is why the Board of Directors and I made the decision to incorporate the progress on our sustainability goals into our incentive compensation program beginning this year. As an innovation leader, we believe our biggest lever to effect economic, environmental, and social progress is through working directly with our customers. Today, our R&D investment is focused on the intersection of key market trends and the needs of sustainable development. One example of how we're doing this is in the area of addressing the global need for clean water. Our Water Solutions business recently launched its B-Free technology. This pre-treatment solution enables a significant improvement in the reliability of reverse osmosis desalination plants. Another example is advanced mobility. The broad adoption of electric vehicles is fundamental in addressing climate change. Through leveraging our broad portfolio of expertise and battery assembly and thermal management for electric vehicles, our DuPont M&M team collaborated with General Motors to develop an advanced adhesive solution for use in electric vehicles. In June, as a result of our close collaboration, GM recognized the DuPont team with a GM Supplier of the Year award. The power of customer partnerships to drive sustainability is a key element to our long-term growth strategy. And I am confident that we will continue to deliver these types of wins in the future. With that, let me turn it to Leland to open the Q&A. Hey, John. Since we have Jon with us, we'll let Jon take that one. Jon you might want to mention for the group that this -- because this is part of ICS, the mix of ICS, because it's not all smartphones, is it? Thanks, John. Hey, Jeff. Yeah, Jeff. Look, we purposely have to build up some inventory. Obviously look, our receivables were up with sales, were very good on payables. We purposely kind of took a turn here to build some inventory, by the way it's really in three categories, semi-finished, raw, and a little bit of finished goods inventories you will see when we come out with our Q. And it's mostly in the M&M business. And by the way, on the raw side, we've taken in inventory, and in many cases, we're waiting for glass fibers to do our compounding and finish it. But we wanted to supply in house just because of all the challenges out there in the supply chain. So we purposely have allowed that to build some. All of the inventory, by way, is good and we'll ship that out. So we are free cash flow conversion of the first half is not what we would normally run as a company obviously. We will clearly improve fairly significantly in the 2nd half of the year. And I think Jeff we'll give you a little more guidance when we get to the 3rd quarter on where we think we will land for the year, but we definitely took a little bit different tact to kind of be able to satisfy our customer base better in this challenging environment. Thanks, Jeff. Hey, good morning, Steve. Margin would hang in there obviously, Steve, in that environment. But you -- they won't price-hike quarter-to-quarter exactly but you'd give it up over a year period probably tie-out. Thanks, Steve. Hey, Scott. Yes. Scott. It's probably overall and Lori made this comment just overall, the water business seems very healthy as we move forward. And as Lori had mentioned, our topline should be mid to high single-digits this year. We had the logistics issue, by the way it was also I'd call an export issue out of one of our product lines in Germany that held us up this -- at the end of the quarter, so we couldn't get it out the door; it was a fairly significant project shipment we were doing. So that'll come out in the third quarter, and we should have nice revenue growth in the third quarter. And then I'd say just generally this is true of the water business, but W&P in general, we put price increases through during the second quarter. But a lot of them, we, especially in the water business, because there's some project-driven business we have locked contracts for some period of time, usually about a quarter by the way. So the price will lag about that much before we can implement it. So we expect to see positive price in the 3rd quarter in the whole W&P sector in general which we didn't see in the 2nd quarter. If we put the increases through we'll start to actually see it kick-in in the 3rd quarter. Yeah, David, I'm not going to get into specifics on it, but we do have a few targets we're seriously studying. I'd say a little bit bigger than Bolton, but on the bigger end of Bolton, if I could use that term. Barry, I know I've highlighted before we were looking at one water asset that was tucked in and we talk about that. We didn't think the economics worked well for us. So that's off the table, but there is a couple of the areas we're interested in, but it would be something that we're already in. Like electronics, for instance, Jon just talked about where we can add on some technologies and grow so there is a couple of areas besides electronics, we're looking at. But again, down the sweet spot of what we know how to do. Yeah, thanks, Dave. Yeah. So I think this year, the seasonality will be a little bit different Vincent. We'll start to recover some of the M&M volumes that we couldn't ship because of supply constraints. So I think that will plugin a little bit more in the fourth quarter, and I think if you look at the guide we gave, you'll kind of see that they're -- an overall picture is we went into the second quarter thinking that raw materials were about a $300 million headwind. We are now estimated to be 400 million of a headwind. Again, as Lori had mentioned though, we will get a price, it won't tie quarter-to-quarter. But we'll get Price to cover that and you can see obviously we got a nice price in M&M this quarter. We'll start getting Price in W&P next quarter. We think we'll see some -- a little bit more escalation on raws in a few areas in W&P, which will hold the margins back, maybe a little more than we would want to go into the third quarter. But again, still solid about where we were in the second quarter. And then, my -- I'll say my personal opinion is the raws have 80%, 90% peaked at where they are at here. And our guide plans that they hold through the year at these higher raw levels. But again, we get a price That's all. Yeah, look, Delaware ended up costing us $12.5 million. And remember, Delaware was 1 of the ones I would say where we manufactured because our big plant is literally right across the Delaware River. And the state of Delaware actually owned and controls the Delaware river basin in that area. Look, I think the good news is we have a really good agreement between the three companies Comoze, Corteva, and DuPont. We're holding hands and working together really well, and I think that the Delaware one was a great example of that. So we have a few other states where we did have manufacturing locations. Let me just say, obviously we're in conversations. I think you could probably use Delaware as a blueprint. Some other states have wrapped us into legal issues where we absolutely didn't do anything at all. I would point out Vermont as one of them. We have nothing there and nothing even close to being there. So each one is a little bit of a different strategy, but we're very focused on trying to resolve more and more of those issues. And I think Delaware was the first step to see what we're up to. Yes. Thank you. No. Well, I -- yeah. I'd say the combination of -- I know that the settlement came out. Three other companies were involved in the settlement. We decided not to settle. Look at some point, we will, but the precedent of even that low number you saw from the others was not something we were willing to do because we didn't do anything there. And we're not going to set a precedent that's inappropriate for the Company. So even though a single million dollars, we still thought that was not appropriate. And I'll just leave it at that. We're well on top of it. We have a strategy and we'll let it play out. Yeah. Thank you. Thanks, John. Good morning, Bob. Yes. So look, we look at every end market we're in and analyze all the multi-industry companies. And I -- you can do -- I'm sure Bob, you've done it. I think we stack up extremely well. Bob, I think part of it is, and I don't disagree with your overall comment. We've created a little more like a Dow or Lyondell, obviously at a higher multiple. But I think over time the consistency of our results will prove out that we're a premier multi-industrial Company. It takes some time. We've had a year and a half of very consistent results. I think one thing we proved that -- I heard -- Lori and I heard this a lot, especially from people that follow multi-industry companies is, how would DuPont react in a downturn? And when the pandemic hit, I think our decremental margins were not the best but best-in-class with the top tier companies in our top-line in the worst drop 10% in our decremental jump right in there. So I think we proved a lot of people thought the chemical Company, you kind of do a general comment, you think we're going to drop pretty significantly in the downturn and we did not. So I think that was a big proof point through the cycle we can perform very well and obviously, we're performing very well with great incremental margins now. And on the upside is the revenue comes back. But if you really look at the pieces on the Company, there's very little what you would call direct chemical commodity exposure in the Company anymore. I mean, Jon sitting here next to me, you look at our electronics business. It's a steady, mid-to-high single rolling industry. should be pretty consistent along the way. So I think over time, we'll get to evaluation. But I think for our multiple cities versus the better multi-industry companies. I think we got a lot of runway in front of us. So I think consistency going forward will prove the day. Thanks, Rob. Yes, good morning, PJ. Look, we've been looking at some other acquisition targets, as I mentioned earlier. Again, they're gonna be in the sweet spot of what we do. I put it right in the layer category, by the way. So the numbers in the math have to work first. So we'll see what occurs. We're always open to looking at things that will create value for our shareholders, so I would never say never on something bigger. But it's not at the forefront of our thinking at this point. Thanks. You hit breakeven. It looks like you're looking at one of our charts. Oil and gas are still down from 2019 by 15%, aerospace is down 23%. But by the way, just to give you, they're all off their bottom. Oil and Gas in the 2nd quarter of 2020, which is the rough quarter, was down 50%. Now it's only from 19% it's only down 15%. aerospace was down 31% in 20. Again, only down 23 now. In everything else or revenue was positive to '19 across auto smartphone, Semi, Tyvek, General Industrial are all positive to ' 19 levels. They're the two remaining ones, but again, lifting really nice off the bottom construction in total is also about 5% from ' 19 levels. So nice recovery there. That was another one a quarter ago, we were still negative."

            "name": "Jon Kemp",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed. It's a pleasure to be on today's call and to share more information about the acquisition of Laird Performance Materials. It's an exciting transaction for DuPont that significantly advances our position in the electronics industry and accelerates the transformation of our Interconnect Solutions business into a Total Solutions provider. We've been following Laird for several years, and have admired their capabilities as a leading provider of electromagnetic shielding and thermal management solutions, and are excited to have added their capabilities and history of growth to our portfolio. As a reminder, Laird delivered 465 million of revenue with approximately 30% EBITDA margin in 2020. E&I and Laird are both recognized for innovation, quality, and reliability and have a strong relationship across the electronics industry. This combination brings together DuPont's premier applied material science expertise with Laird to industry-leading application engineering capabilities. It also adds more content on many of the devices that we're already in. We have already begun the process of integrating Laird into our existing Interconnect Solutions business, providing opportunities to further optimize business structure, functional support, and our global site network. We expect 60 million in run-rate cost synergies by the end of year 3 with approximately 60% realized in the first 18 months. We expect to achieve cost synergies through a mix of G&A, procurement, and site consolidation initiative. On the next slide, I'll share some of the key benefits of this transaction and describe how the combination enhances DuPont's position as a leading electronic materials provider. The acquisition of Laird expands our position as an essential partner of choice for major OEMs. Laird serves a broad set of overlapping and complementary end-market across consumer electronics, telecommunications, automotive, and other industrials, with a similar geographic representation to the rest of the Interconnect Solutions business with a particularly strong presence in Asia. The 2nd way it enhances our position is through innovation. This acquisition strategically aligns us to critical needs across thermal management, signal integrity, power management, miniaturization, and high reliability and it enables us to have early engagement with OEMs in both system design and material specification creating both greater product differentiation and higher margins. The next benefit of the acquisition is that it broadens our portfolio of solutions. With Laird's unique multifunctional capabilities, we will leverage an expanded customer base, broad product portfolio, global scale, and deep technical expertise to increase speed-to-market, create new efficiencies in the development of integrated and multifunctional solutions, and provide high-value next-generation products that will deliver additional growth in the next several years. We believe customers will see immediate benefits as a combined E&I organization engages across value chains to address the increasingly complex challenges in the industry. Our combined organization will advance our leadership to help customers accelerate solutions necessary for the adoption of high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, 5G communications, smart and autonomous vehicles, and the Internet of Things. We will be well-positioned to capture growth in these key secular growth areas. In addition, we expect revenue synergies from cross-selling into complementary accounts and channel, new and faster product development for a multifunctional solution, and deeper design and co-development partnerships with OEM. With that, I'll turn it over to Lori to provide details on our second-quarter financial performance. Yeah. John, good question. So in the first half of the year, we definitely saw some acceleration of orders from smartphone customers really as a result of a couple of factors. There was a late timing to device launches in the back half of last year. Strong demand moved some of those orders into the first part of this year. And then you had a lot of folks just trying to secure supply reliability in the face of some of the raw material and logistics challenges. So in general, we think smartphones are going to grow about 10% over the course of the year, not quite as deep a seasonal curve as maybe what we've seen in the last couple of years. So the curve is flattened, but general demand continues to be strong. Yeah, sure, Ed. The Interconnect Solutions business is about 25% driven by smartphone demand. About 30% of the demand is other consumer electronics, whether that's laptops, computers, tablets, and smart devices, about 20% is automotive, 20% broad industrial demand, and then the rest in telecommunications. Yeah, Scott, thanks. We -- obviously, we've seen a number of deals across the electronics industry. I think it's an industry characterized by a -- with a fairly fragmented supplier base across a number of core technologies. We're obviously interested in continuing to build out our portfolio in places where the technology is adding value to help our customers solve problems, especially those that are aligned with leading-edge technology and semiconductor 5G materials. And even in our Industrial Solutions business with some of the precision parts and medical silicones continuing to strengthen those we believe that there will continue to be opportunities for us to continue to add and build onto that part of our Portfolio. Thanks, Scott. Yeah David, good question. Obviously, it's been a really strong demand environment for the last couple of years. 2020, even in a pandemic environment, was strong, and we were able to grow nicely. 2021 is also shaping up to see the continuation of those trends. Overall, broadly, we would expect it to be mid to high single-digit growth over the time horizon that they'll be puts-and-takes along the way. But really strong, robust demand conditions across all three of our businesses going forward. Yeah, great question. And when we think about the semiconductor market, clearly really strong investment trends by all of the leading OEM s in multiple regions. So you see the Tier 1 fabs who are investing up -- in aggregate, hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 2 or 3 years. Some in the U.S., some and Asian markets, some in Europe to expand and build capacity. Most of that capacity is going to be built to accommodate the leading edge, both on the logic foundry side as well as on the memory side. We see that as extremely favorable to our business dynamics when you make those investments at leading-edge boundaries than that increases the number of -- it increases the manufacturing complexity, as well as the purity of the materials, all of which plays the sweet spot of what we're able to provide for our customers. And our portfolio was broad enough that we're really touching every step of the manufacturing process for the wafer. So the partnerships that we have with the OEMs are strong. We continue to work together on qualifying materials for all of those next-generation leading-edge solutions. And as we start to see the wafer starts to come online, we've already seen some benefit this year to new wafer capacity. We'll continue to see wafer capacity ramp up over the next couple of years as some of those investments start to come online, and we're really well-positioned to capitalize on that trend. Yeah, PJ. Good question. The advanced nodes, obviously, are critical for us. I would say the bulk of our Portfolio is positioned to be able to help our customers solve for solutions at the advanced nodes whether that's at below 20-nanometer and below be it the 1475 and now even 3. When it talked about market share, obviously each fab and each customer is different and I want to stay away from customer-specific comments. But in general, our Portfolio is weighted more towards the advanced nodes. And probably a little bit more on the logic side versus the memory side. Although we definitely participate broadly across both segments of the market. On the pricing question, we typically -- the electronics segments, in general, would be about -1% a year based on the cost down and performance expectations of our customers. And where we really can capture price is on the next-generation products and they tend to be fairly fast cycle launches of new technology. So we typically get a price on new technology and then, that technology pricing will erode overtime constantly, replaced with the next generation of products where we get to price. In general, we see price in the -- down 0.5% to maybe 1.5%. This year's pricing is relatively flat, so we're actually holding price pretty well in this environment. And I think as Lori alluded to earlier, we'll continue to see a positive price and a flat to positive price for the rest of the year. So look, we've got a really strong plating business. We're well-positioned in that industry. We look at a lot of different targets. Our plating Portfolio is more focused on consumer electronics as opposed to some of the more industrial applications that you may see from some of our plating competitors. So just strategically, it wasn't as strong a fit for us as maybe some other folks in the industry."

        "content": "Leland Weaver: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for DuPont's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. We're making this call available to investors and media via webcast. We have prepared slides to supplement our comments during this conference call. These slides are posted on the Investor Relations section of DuPont's website and through the link to our webcast. Joining me on the call today are Ed Breen, Chief Executive Officer; and Lori Koch, our Chief Financial Officer. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the slides. During our call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Our 2020 Form 10-K, as updated by our current and periodic reports, includes detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties, which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today exclude significant items. We will also refer to other non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in our press release and posted to the Investor page of our website. I'll now turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Breen: Thanks, Leland. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will provide comments on the strong start that we had to 2021, including the advancement of a number of strategic priorities to make DuPont a premier multi-industrial company, equipped for growth and value creation. But first, let me acknowledge the tremendous dedication and determination of our teams around the world as we continue to manage the extraordinary circumstances of this pandemic. The health and well-being of our people remains our top priority. The principles and protocols we've implemented globally and locally to help to protect our people and ensure business continuity as countries face multiple waves of infection and lockdowns. As an innovation-led company, we believe in science and we're encouraging all employees to get vaccinated. And where possible, we're working with public health authorities to facilitate access and distribution. Starting on Slide 2, I will note that one of our priorities for generating value is consistent operating performance and financial results. This morning, we announced strong top line and earnings results for the first quarter, both above our expectations.  Lori will take you through the details in a moment. But I'd like to highlight the 7% organic revenue growth that we reported, reflecting broad and strong demand in key markets such as semiconductors, smartphones, water, residential construction and automotive. This revenue growth, along with continued cost discipline, led to strong operating leverage and EBITDA margin expansion in the quarter. Our first quarter financial results reflect the agility of our teams to navigate through a challenging environment while facing escalating raw material and logistics costs as well as global supply constraints of key raw materials, most notably in our M&M segment. With strong order trend continuing and confidence in our team's ability to navigate the supply chain challenges, we are raising our full year guidance for net sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS. I will provide more details regarding this increase shortly. In addition to our financial results, we advanced a number of our strategic priorities during the quarter. First, as previously announced, we completed the merger of our Nutrition & Biosciences business with IFF, creating an industry-leading company in the food and beverage, home and personal care and health and wellness markets. As you know, this transaction also unlocks significant value for DuPont and our shareholders. As part of the transaction, we received $7.3 billion cash from IFF and retired slightly more than 197 million coupon shares, or about 27% of our outstanding shares at the time with no cash outlay. We strengthened our balance sheet during the quarter by paying down our $3 billion term loan, and we will redeem $2 billion of our long-term debt later this month. As a reminder, our next debt maturity will not be due until the fourth quarter of 2023. In line with our balanced approach, we returned about $660 million of capital to shareholders during the first quarter through share repurchases and dividends. Under our existing share buyback program, we executed $500 million in share repurchases during the first quarter. As a reminder, we have about $500 million of repurchase authorization remaining under that program, which we intend to utilize by June 1 of this year. Earlier this quarter, we also announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new $1.5 billion share buyback program, which expires on June 30, 2022. We plan to be opportunistic under the new program as we move throughout the year. With respect to dividends, we returned about $160 million in cash to shareholders during the quarter. As we previously mentioned, going forward, we will target a payout ratio between 35% and 45%. And we intend to work with our Board to increase our dividend annually as we grow our earnings. In March, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Laird Performance Materials for $2.3 billion. When completed, a planned acquisition of Laird advances DuPont's strategy of growing as a global innovation leader and strengthens our leadership position in advanced electronic materials. The Laird business will complement our Interconnect Solutions business within E&I, and it will add critical capabilities and market-leading offerings in thermal management and electromagnetic shielding, which are essential to emerging electronic applications. Our E&I team, along with our customers, are excited for this opportunity. We recently received regulatory approval for the transaction in Germany and Brazil and cleared HSR in the U.S. last month. As previously indicated, we expect the transaction will close in the third quarter of this year. Finally, we announced previously that we have signed definitive agreements to sell our Biomaterials, Clean Technologies and Solamet businesses. We anticipate receiving more than $900 million in gross proceeds from those divestitures, and we expect those transactions to close in the second half of this year. Before turning it over to Lori to go through the details of the first quarter, I'd like to take a moment to provide some context regarding what we saw during the quarter in our key end markets that we serve. Combined, the electronics and automotive markets account for nearly half of our revenues. Electronics continues to perform very well, and auto is recovering nicely from its 2020 lows. Within electronics, demand continues to be broad-based as the ramp-up of advanced technology nodes and a need for more memory to servers and data centers has accelerated. The server market, which is a large consumer of semiconductor chips and circuit board chemistries, continues to show strength and is expected to remain robust as Internet network traffic continues to grow. Furthermore, the deployment of 5G infrastructure by leading telecom companies in preparation for the next generation of ultra-high-speed data transmission should help sustain demand for premium smartphones, which is further enhanced by our favorable content play. With respect to the automotive end market, demand is well above the lows of 2020 but not yet back to 2019 levels, which sold 22.9 million vehicles produced in the first quarter and nearly 90 million units for the year. The lack of stable supply of critical components, mainly semiconductors, impacted the ability of the auto OEMs to produce more vehicles and rebuild inventories during the quarter. Even where we participate in the value chain within M&M, I think it's important to note that our first quarter Engineering Polymers volumes were not materially affected by the chip shortages as our demand from the Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers was not lessened as a result of the chip shortage. However, our ability to supply customers was affected by supply constraints of key raw materials, predominantly in our nylon and polyester product lines. This supply situation is gradually improving while we anticipate several critical products will continue to constrain our production through the end of the second quarter. We expect that annual sales as a result of raw material constraints will be captured in the second half of the year. Additionally, we believe that the automotive market will remain strong for the balance of the year as OEMs look to meet robust demand as well as replenish global inventories, which are currently below historical averages. Moving on to the water and construction end markets. Collectively, these 2 markets account for approximately 20% of our total company sales. Versus first quarter of 2019, demand for advanced water filtration and purification has strengthened, driven by solid growth in Asia Pacific. Strength in residential and commercial water markets as well as industrial and desalination segments has shown growth. For construction, North America residential and do-it-yourself markets are up versus first quarter 2019. And while demand within the commercial construction segment has improved from the lows experienced in 2020, it is not back to 2019 levels. Lastly, demand within our industrial end markets versus 2019 levels is mixed. Within the electrical infrastructure and Tyvek protective garment markets, demand is at or above 2019 levels. However, demand in end markets such as aerospace and oil and gas is still below 2019 levels, but it's improved since the lows of the second and third quarter of last year. Sequentially, our sales in the aero and oil and gas were up over 40%. Our diversified portfolio of products and technologies will serve us as the global economy continues to recover from the pandemic. We are continuing to invest at competitive levels in R&D and innovation to further solidify our strong market positions and maintain our position as the partner of choice for our customers in 2021 and beyond. With that, let me turn it over to Lori to walk through the details of our first quarter financial performance.\nLori Koch: Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Let me cover our first quarter financial results on Slide 4. As Ed said earlier, I'd also like to acknowledge the commitment of our employees throughout the pandemic and our team in navigating through supply chain and logistics headwind this quarter to deliver the following results. Net sales of $4 billion were up 8% versus the first quarter of 2020, up 7% on an organic basis.  Overall sales growth was driven by strong volume, up 7% versus first quarter of last year, with volume increases in all 3 reporting segments. Currency provided a 3% tailwind in the quarter led by the euro. Portfolio was a 2% headwind, primarily due to the sale of the trichlorosilane business last year. Sales were up in all 3 segments, with E&I, M&M and W&P reflecting organic growth of 14%, 8% and 1%, respectively. On a regional basis, organic sales were up 20% in Asia Pacific, our largest region from a sales perspective, with strong results in all 3 reporting segments. Partially offsetting gains in Asia Pacific were organic sales decline in the U.S. and Canada and EMEA of 4% and 2%, respectively. The declines in U.S. and Canada and EMEA were driven by softness for aramid fibers, specifically continued softness in aerospace and timing delays in defense as well as auto builds, which were down in these regions. I'll provide more color on our segment top line results on the next slide. From an earnings perspective, we delivered operating EBITDA of $1.05 billion and adjusted EPS of $0.91 per share, up 15% and 90%, respectively. Volume gains as well as benefit from prior year cost initiatives and currency drove 160 basis points of operating EBITDA margin expansion and 1.9x operating leverage. Incremental margins for the quarter were 46%. I will walk you through the EPS later call in a moment. Our total company gross margin for the quarter was 36.8%, flat on a year-over-year basis. Gross margin improvement in E&I and M&M on higher volume and manufacturing productivity was offset by a margin decline in W&P, resulting from higher unit rates versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower production volumes of aramid fibers. Gross margin expanded about 280 basis points sequentially, with margin improvement in all 3 segments. From a segment perspective, E&I delivered operating EBITDA margin of 33.5% and 420 basis points of margin expansion versus the year ago period on strong volume growth and a onetime discrete gain related to an asset sale. Excluding the benefit of the asset sale, operating EBITDA margin would have been 31.7%, a year-over-year improvement of 240 basis points. M&M delivered operating EBITDA margins of 22.9% and 320 basis points of margin expansion versus the year ago period on higher volumes and savings from productivity actions. In W&P, operating EBITDA was flat versus the year ago period as sales gains and cost productivity actions were offset by higher manufacturing costs, primarily higher unit rates, driven by lower production of aramid fibers and increased supply chain costs. For the quarter, cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow were $378 million and $95 million, respectively. These amounts include 1 month of cash flow from our N&B business compared to 3 months of N&B cash burn in the prior year. In addition, cash flow and free cash flow conversion was negatively impacted by a working capital headwind of about $300 million, led by higher accounts receivable balances, which were up in line with sales. For the year, we continue to target free cash flow conversion of greater than 90%. Slide 5 provides more details on the year-over-year changes in net sales. Leading the way for the quarter was E&I with 15% volume growth, which had a record quarter. Volume gains were led by double-digit growth on robust demand for semiconductors across Asia. High fabrication utilization rates, driven by demand for new technologies and advanced nodes, along with the ongoing shift in digital transformation drove strong top line growth. In addition, share gains from recent wins for CMP slurry and lithography materials improved results. In Interconnect Solutions, double-digit growth was driven by higher material content in premium next-generation smartphones partially resulting from timing shifts that select OEM demand shifted earlier in the year this year, along with broader printed circuit board market recovery. Within Industrial Solutions, double-digit volume gains in display materials due to new time launches more than offset continued weakness in aerospace. The end markets within W&P were generally consistent with our expectations. Sales gains were led by Water Solutions with double-digit volume growth, reflecting strong demand for our reverse osmosis and ultrafiltration technology, led by Asia. Shelter  Solutions had low single-digit organic growth versus the year ago period, reflecting high single-digit organic growth in residential construction and retail channels for do-it-yourself application, offset partially by softness in commercial construction market. Within Safety Solutions, pricing gains, favorable currency and strengthening demand for aramid fibers in industrial and automotive end market was more than offset by continued weakness in aerospace and year-over-year volume declines for Tyvek. Lower Tyvek production volumes were a result of higher planned downtime in the quarter. Also contributing to strong first quarter top line growth was continued recovery of the global automotive market, which represents about [60%] of our M&M segment from an end market perspective. The most recent estimate of 1Q global auto builds were about 20.3 million units towards the quarter, up approximately 14% versus the first quarter of last year. As a result, volume in our Performance Resins business was up over 20% versus the year ago period. Another bright spot in M&M was improved demand for microcircuit materials, which we aligned to the M&M segment earlier this year. These specialized materials, along with adhesive growth, helped drive over 20% organic growth in Advanced Solutions growth in the year ago period. Demand in our Engineering Polymers business was strong. However, global supply constraints for key raw materials resulted in low single-digit volume decline. Our teams are experienced in navigating trading challenges and have worked diligently with our customers and suppliers to help mitigate the impact incurred as a result.  Additionally, we expect to recover volume lost in the quarter due to these disruptions and raw material constraints part of this unit. Turning to Slide 6. I mentioned that adjusted EPS for the quarter of $0.91 was up 90% versus the prior year. The largest driver of our year-over-year growth was a significantly lower share count, mainly resulting from the N&B exchange offer. The lower share count provided a $0.16 benefit versus the prior year. Excluding the lower share count, adjusted EPS growth was still significant, up 56% versus the prior year. Higher segment earnings provided a $0.13 tailwind in the quarter versus the prior year, along with benefits this year with a lower base tax rate and reduced interest expense. Our base tax rate for the quarter of 19.4% was lower than forecasted as a result of a few discrete tax benefits in the quarter. Our tax rate in the quarter was significantly lower than last year, resulting from the absence of certain discrete tax headwinds incurred in the prior year. For the full year 2021, we now expect our base tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 22%, down slightly from the 21% to 23% that we previously estimated at the beginning of the year. Turning to Slide 7. I will provide some commentary on our balance sheet and cash position. I mentioned earlier that net working capital provided headwinds in free cash flow in the quarter. However, I would like to point out that net working capital productivity gains of about $600 million that we have made in the first quarter of last year, increasing net working capital for about $3.5 billion at March 2020 to $2. 9 billion at March of 2021. Both of these were driving down past due receivables and inventory. From a debt perspective, we have stated that we are committed to maintaining our current strong investment-grade credit profile. We started the year with $15.6 billion in current debt. And as Ed mentioned, we paid down our $3 billion term loan in February, and we will pay down $2 billion of debt later this month. Moving on to cash. Our cash generated from operations last year put us in a strong cash position coming into this year, and that balance grew with a $7.3 billion special cash payment from the transaction with IFF. In addition, we expect to receive over $900 million in gross proceeds this year from the previously announced sale of the noncore businesses. Our current deployment plan for 2021 includes a balanced capital allocation approach. Along with our plan for internal investment this year, we plan to grow through targeted M&A in areas of secular growth and will fund the $2.3 billion planned acquisition of Laird Performance Materials with cash on hand. We intend to continue to return cash to shareholders. Along with our dividend policy, we completed $500 million of share repurchases in the first quarter at an average price of about $73 per share and will remain opportunistic with our remaining share repurchase authorization throughout the rest of the year. On a go-forward basis, our target run and maintain cash balance is about $1.5 billion. And from a leverage perspective, our net debt-to-EBITDA target remains at 2.75x. With that, I'll now turn it back over to Ed to talk about our financial outlook.\nEd Breen: Thanks, Lori. Let me close with our financial outlook on Slide 8, which includes our view of the second quarter and full year 2021. We are raising our full year guidance range for net sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS. At the midpoint of the range provided, we now expect net sales for the year to be about $15.8 billion, which reflects year-over-year growth of 10%, up from our previous estimate of 8% growth. We expect to improve leverage and now expect operating EBITDA for the year to be about $4.03 billion, at the midpoint of the range provided, a year-over-year increase of 17%. These revised estimates reflect our solid start to the year and confidence in our team's ability to continue to navigate global supply key challenges. We are also raising our adjusted EPS range for the full year by $0.30 per share and now expect adjusted EPS of $3.67 per share, at the midpoint of the range provided. In addition to the strong operating performance of our businesses, the share repurchases we are completing under our existing programs and the narrowing of our estimated tax range supporting the [indiscernible] while contributing to the revised [indiscernible] estimates. For the second quarter 2021, we expect net sales to be about $3.975 billion, and we expect the operating EBITDA to be about $1 billion, both at the midpoints of the ranges provided and both well above results in the second quarter last year.  At the midpoint of the range provided, we expect adjusted EPS for the second quarter of 2021 of $0.94 per share, which now reflects the full reduction in shares resulting from the N&B exchange offer and our weighted average [indiscernible]. With that, let me turn it over to Leland to open up for Q&A.\nLeland Weaver: Thank you, Ed. Before we move to the Q&A portion of our call, I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first response is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.\nSteve Tusa: Can you just maybe talk about the sequential kind of dynamics in your business into the second quarter and second half? I mean on the one hand, you guys are having some supply constraints, which I guess is -- has hurt volumes a bit. But then on the other hand, I'm sure that there's some kind of urgency around ordering, and maybe the electronics side seen some pretty big book-to-bills that guys like Tyco Electronics that are -- suggest that customers may be stocking up and kind of double ordering perhaps what they can. Everybody is kind of scrambling to get supply, I guess. It muddles the sequential. Maybe if you could just talk about what you see as kind of the sequential activity in those key stress areas heading into the second half.\nEd Breen: Yes. I'll start, and maybe Lori wants to jump in. If I may, I don't think our normal cyclicality plays out this year because of what you just described. Very different dynamics this year. I'd say one of the biggest issues is really the inflation cost on all materials here and then the pricing actions that we can take. So that's a pretty big dynamic for all of us that you see reporting here. But probably, the first quarter, the cost deflation was very little. It was about $20 million. We expect in the second quarter that lists to about $90 million. And we expect the full year impact of raw material inflation to be about $300 million. So it kind of goes up to kind of $90 million to $100 million in the second quarter, holds there for the year, which gets you kind of the $300 million. So we've been -- have been a constructive price market, Steve, and we think we'll catch most of the second quarter inflation, but maybe not all of it as we have some contracts that are 30, 60 days. But we're very confident that we'll be able to cover the walls. When you look at the year in total, that we'll be able to make that up. So we're expecting for total DuPont for our pricing to be up low single digits for the year. But clearly, more so in the M&M division where a lot of the world inflation is -- no price increase in electronics simply because you don't get it there, you get a new product introductions that you get fed and some price increase in Water & Protection, within water and safety business specifically. So I'd say that's a big dynamic there. And then from a kind of a revenue standpoint, I'd say the other big dynamic is because of the raw material constraints that we're seeing. When we did the fourth quarter call, Lori and I talked about a $60 million to $80 million miss in sales that we were expecting in the quarter. And then you had the freeze down in Texas. So we think it's -- we missed out about $100 million of sales in the quarter, which is $20 million to $25 million of EBITDA. We expect another $100 million in the second quarter, $100 million to $120 million missed revenue. But like you're hearing from all the others, we're not going to lose the business. We will make it up as the constraints kind of worked their way through because everyone was kind of dealing with the same issue here. So I'd say that's the large dynamics of sequentially and then going into the year, second half of the year. All the end markets, Steve, played out the way we thought they would. The ones we thought would be hot were hot. The ones we thought we saw, like commercial construction, residential oil and gas are all lifting nicely on the lows of last year, but not back to '19 levels. So we expect that to continue through the year also.\nOperator: Your next response is from John Inch of Gordon Haskett.\nJohn Inch: I would like to just pick up on that theme. So Ed, when you're saying you missed $100 million of sales in the first quarter, roughly $100 million to $120 million expected in the second quarter, does that imply then that the second half is up $200 million to $220 million more than it would have been if you haven't had any supply chain disruptions, like you're going to see that in terms of sequential growth -- or I'm sorry, in terms of the year-over-year growth dynamic? And doesn't that create a bit of a tough compare? Or is that not the way to think about it?\nEd Breen: Yes. First of all, I'm not sure this will resolve itself in the year either. You've heard quite a few suppliers talk about this going and potentially into next year, depending on what it is. So inventory levels in new autos chain are very, very low in the supply chain itself. Finished goods are low. You still got the semiconductor ratio that's going to mute things, which I've heard most people think of going into 2022. So I think you got that dynamic going on here. So I wouldn't gauge at all just throwing it into the second half of the year at all.\nLori Koch: Yes. I think the guidance that we provided essentially assumes a similar quarter for revenue like we saw in 1Q, so pushing $4 billion between -- around a $3.9 billion and $4 billion range in the second quarter. And then if you look at the full year outlook, you can back into a similar number in the back half of the year. So whatever upside we may see from the M&M portfolio getting back that lost volume in the first half, so still that tends to be a little bit of seasonality in our results that would offset that. Still landed at flat number dollar-wise from a revenue perspective.\nJohn Inch: Okay. So no, that makes sense. And then just as a follow-up, how big -- can you remind us, how big is DuPont in India? And I mean India is obviously in the news as COVID sweeps that country. I'm just wondering, does Tyvek garments, do they have much of a presence there? And didn't really seem to hurt your Asia Pac numbers this quarter. Does it create for a little bit of a headwind in future quarters?\nEd Breen: No. India is not a big impact at all in that one. The biggest upside for us though is India in the water business. That's a real key market for us, but it's not that big in the scheme of things yet. So no, it didn't have any significant impact for us. If we add N&B in the portfolio, it would have been bigger, but that was really where our bigger presence was in our portfolio.\nOperator: Your next response is from Scott Davis of Melius Research.\nScott Davis: Wanted to follow up a little bit on comments that Steve made just about supply chain and John as well. But are you seeing kind of any unusual purchasing patterns by your customers? Are your customers double ordering? Or any kind of unusual inventory build?\nEd Breen: We don't think much. I mean we cited a couple of customers we know they are building inventory. It's some in Asia that we think preorder, but it's like $30 million to $40 million business. We're not seeing it. The people just can't get their hands on enough right now. I mean there's so many force majeures out there across the supply chain, again, mostly in the auto business I'm talking about. But I don't see inventory build in the channel. And you know historically, finished goods at autos is very low right now globally. So we don't see a lot of that. Our people trying to double order. I think there's some of that going on, but everyone's getting allocated product at this point in time. So it's not like they're able to build an inventory base. I'll use DuPont as an example. Our inventory well of about $100 million, and it's in mostly in our M&M business, and we couldn't get it up on the other walls to get the product out the door. So we did plan on -- we're not double ordering. We just couldn't get it out the door to have a finished good. So again, in the scheme of our numbers, that's not a big deal. But I'm sure there's a decent amount of that going on, but I wouldn't call it double ordering the stockpile.\nScott Davis: Okay. Good. Helpful. And then just a different cleanup here is just what was the average price kind of the asset sales that you -- maybe just any valuation metric that we can think about?\nLori Koch: You mean for the noncore businesses that we're divesting?\nScott Davis: Yes, for the noncore stuff, in terms if you have.\nLori Koch: Yes. We have been somewhere in the range of -- yes, we had mentioned somewhere in the range of 6 to 8x EBITDA multiple on those businesses.\nOperator: Your next response is from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners.\nJeff Sprague: Two for me. One, just on the theme, a little bit one more item for me anyhow. On interconnect, Lori, that sounded like maybe it wasn't a pull forward, but demand was -- the demand pattern was different than what you would typically see. Could you just elaborate on kind of what you said and meant there as you went through that segment?\nLori Koch: Sure. Yes, I think you said it correctly. So we did see a little bit of acceleration from an order perspective in the first quarter, probably the first half versus what we normally see from some of the smart homes provider. So from a site perspective, probably about a $10 million benefit for the quarter. They're not hugely material to DuPont raw materials. I think they're [indiscernible] segment. If you look at the full year, we've got Interconnect Solutions. We expect to be up kind of in the mid-single digits, so it will normalize as the year goes on. Part of that is due to very strong comps from last year. So if you recall, in the fourth quarter of last year, we [indiscernible] interconnect as some of those producers pulled some volume into 2020 as well.\nJeff Sprague: And then secondly, Ed, just on the M&A front. You're able to acquire Laird here at what looked like a pretty decent price. And I just -- I've noticed there's been a few deals going on kind of in some of the spaces I travel that the valuations actually, all things considered, are not off the chart. So I just wonder if you're seeing that kind of what your confidence level on being able to do bolt-ons here at a reasonable valuation as we progress through the year?\nEd Breen: Yes. So Jeff, we're looking at a couple of bolt-ons. One of them is exactly what we've described the last couple of quarters in the water space. I think what we're looking at is very similar to Laird where with synergies, high confidence in, by the way, cost synergies, we can get it up at a multiple that makes sense for DuPont, or by the way, we just won't buy it. We just don't know that final answer yet. So yes, I think there's -- some of those opportunities are out there to do that in some of the spaces we really like there's going to be a great secular growth areas for us in the future. But I'm not talking huge things at this point in time. As I always say, we'll always look at transformative moves if it makes sense for the company -- there's something a couple long, and these are truly a couple bolt-ons in the hundreds of millions, not billions that we're looking at. But similar dynamic I would say to Laird.  So maybe to your question, yes, those opportunities are there for us.\nOperator: Your next response is from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.\nDavid Begleiter: Can you talk a little more about Tyvek? You mentioned a shift back to the more traditional industrial business going forward, I guess, versus some tough comps versus a year ago in protective?\nLori Koch: Yes. I think what we had mentioned about Tyvek in the quarter was garment volume. It adds, it wanes, it picks volume back up in some of the more medical or industrial end markets. And so from a demand perspective, there's not a headwind overall. The headwind that we saw in the quarter was more so around production capabilities. And so we have pushed some of our planned maintenance activity that was planned for 2020 into 2021 just given the COVID response that was needed in last year. And so that tamped down the volume that we were able to produce and then sell in Q1. If I were to size it, I would probably size it around $20 million of a headwind in general for Tyvek. And back on the comment on the garment demand potentially being mainly picked up by other end markets, it's a similar margin profile. So there's no headwind there from that perspective.\nEd Breen: And we're sold-out on those assets. So as we move things around, it's not like we're picking up extra volume. Right now, we'll get the same margin impact. And that's why our biggest CapEx program is a new line over in Europe that will come on in 2023. It's our single biggest CapEx program, and we're flat out.\nDavid Begleiter: Got it. And just on working capital for the full year, where do you think you'll end up when it is all done?\nLori Koch: Yes. I expect to drive improvement from where we were in the first quarter, and that will also translate to improvement in free cash flow conversion. So we'll continue to target greater than 90% of the year, which implies a significant improvement from where we were in Q1. So Q1 was really a function of the higher sales. So we were up about 8% in sales that translated to about a 7% increase in AR. And as I had mentioned, we were opportunistic in buying lots and we could get them. But surely, inventory increased. So I would expect on a full year basis, I might be in right now for working capital to be used, just given the top line growth as we're expecting, probably more so in the $200 million range. So improvement coming out of Q1. But I think more importantly, the measure that we pay attention to is net working capital term. And so we saw significant improvement last year to the June, ending the year at about 5.2 turns. We'll look to target about 5.3 turns as we close the year.\nOperator: Your next response is from Steve Byrne, Bank of America.\nSteve Byrne: Yes. This Water Solutions business of yours seems to be increasingly a growth engine for you. Can you split that growth between municipalities that are using your technology to purified drinking water versus industrial applications? And on the industrial side, do you see any opportunity down the road, not so much on the purification side, but on the filtrate side, such as trying to extract particular materials like lithium?\nLori Koch: Yes. I think the growth, a lot of it is coming from the desalination side. Also, we have a large growing -- it's small today, but it's growing nicely opportunity within the residential space. And so we've now got the leading technology from all 3 applications between reverse osmosis, ion exchange and also filtration in our acquisition. So we feel comfortable, and as Ed had mentioned, continue to look at opportunities for us to expand our presence there. So I think filtration continues to be a large opportunity for us as well. So as Ed had mentioned, whether it's lithium or other types of filtration, we will continue to be a big player in that space.\nEd Breen: Yes. I mean with all of us with our ESG goals out there in the industrial world, I mean, the secular growth opportunity here looks like it's going to be pretty awesome for the next couple of decades. So I mean we all have metrics we're trying to hit on clean water, and we all have these facilities around the world. So it should be a really nice opportunity. And by the way, one of the reasons we would like to grow this business organically and inorganically.\nLori Koch: And I think about our opportunity in addition to ESG is the potential underneath the infrastructure plan that has targeted investments in the water filtration require a perfect purification space.\nSteve Byrne: And just to follow up on this Laird acquisition, and as you mentioned, some cost synergies, but do you -- how would you compare that opportunity versus your ability to maybe cross-sell since that will be a drop in and it's some different technologies and chemistries that you don't seem to have? So is it a cross-selling opportunity and/or maybe an expansion of some of their technologies into new end markets? Do you see any opportunities to do that as well?\nEd Breen: It's definitely -- look, we bought it on the cross-sell, i.e., when you get right down, the way it broadens out the portfolio very significantly in a couple of key technology areas that are needed as there's more advanced technologies coming here, especially thermal management being a key one. So look, the closer we're delivering our -- just going to go at it real quickly just to get it out of the way, but we want it for the growth opportunity, the cross-sell opportunity to be able to bring more solutions to our customers. Remember, in that business, we have a lot of application engineers that are resolving customer issues. And with shrinkage in size of all these components, some of these technologies become more and more important. And so that's the reason we bought it strategically, we think it's a great fit. It's where the industry is headed. And it's more of really the growth reason in that business, but we'll get the cost synergies. So we bought it at a nice number from a multiple standpoint.\nOperator: Your next response is from John Roberts of UBS.\nJohn Roberts: Ed, my understanding is IFF has recommended against you going on to the IFF Board. Are there any remaining connections between DuPont and IFF that would create a conflict? Or that's just the position they have against previous management being on the Board of a new owner?\nEd Breen: Yes. So usually, John, it's an issue of CEO sitting on 2 boards, external boards. But I think in general, and by the way, they have -- also have the issue you just raised. My thoughts, in general, our investors understand why I'm doing it. I don't need to do other things in my life. But I think they understand it, it's very important to me and to DuPont that this goes well, we go opening more than half the company is what we put into IFF. So it's extremely important to our shareholder base. So I think it's morally the right thing to do. But under the definition by an independent director, there's absolutely no doubt about that. And it's very similar driver on the Corteva Board, the help and the transition there. I don't see this is any different than I think it's the right thing to do.\nOperator: Your next response is from Mike Sison, Wells Fargo.\nMike Sison: I just want to get a little better feel for the second half. EBITDA does -- looks like it's going to grow high single digits. And just curious, do you expect demand to improve in the second half as the pandemic sort of subsides, hopefully? And is the lower growth rate more maybe raw materials and other issues? And then longer term, what do you think the EBITDA growth potential for the new DuPont is?\nLori Koch: Yes. I think the potential lower growth in the second half is really just a comparison. So obviously, the second half -- second quarter is going to be the largest year-over-year growth driver for us just given that was the lead point of last year, and then we approved as the year went on. So I don't see a material change in the actual EBITDA number kind of similar to the revenue conversation we had earlier, so I think a similar environment. As I've mentioned earlier, from an end market perspective, we're generally that and even above 2019 in those cases, the full year guidance that we had out there has our revenue up 6% versus 2019. And the guide that we put, I think, was the EBITDA kind of low teens. And so we're generally back and then the markets that are weak are really just a handful. And they're more around the aerospace which is up off the bottom, but still off of 2019 and commercial construction, which in the aggregate don't make up a material portion of our portfolio.\nOperator: Your next response is from Arun Viswanathan, RBC Capital Markets.\nArun Viswanathan: Great. I'm just curious now that the portfolio, you've gone through health and nutrition or the separation thereafter you've made some acquisitions here to bulk up E&I, you separated into new segments as well with water. What else are you guys thinking of as far as continued kind of portfolio management? Also the noncore is mostly out. Is the business kind of operating at a level that you're comfortable with? I know you've also undertaken a lot of cost reductions. But maybe strategically, you can just give us your thoughts on maybe some of the next steps as you see moving forward for the new DuPont.\nEd Breen: Yes. Look, I would say, short term here, we're very focused operationally running the company. But remember, we just closed the N&B transaction 2 months ago. It seems like forever, and there's a lot of heavy lift there. We still have to finish cars and do the 3 noncore businesses, which we'll get out after mid-year out of the portfolio, and that will bring in $900 million of proceeds. So we still have a heavy lift going on there. And then remember, at the same time, we're going to be starting the integration of the Laird business into the portfolio. So we definitely got a lot of that type of work, in addition to looking at a couple of targeted M&A opportunities as I had mentioned. So -- but I think that has a lot going on portfolio-wise still this year and with all of the issues we talked about managing raw material inputs and pricing through all that in a kind of a crazy but fun year. We've got our hands full. So I'd say portfolio kind of getting to kind of where we want it. Again, we would never take off the table looking some transformative things. But generally, cleaning up the noncore, getting Laird in and operationally, really just knows as a grindstone here.\nOperator: Your next response is from Alex Yefremov with KeyBanc.\nAlex Yefremov: Could you elaborate on the share gains in the CMP slurry? Did you introduce new products there? And do you expect additional share gains in this product or maybe anywhere else in semiconductors in coming quarters?\nLori Koch: Yes, I.t really comes from the new products we had mentioned within CMP slurring lithography also within company in the advanced packaging space. So if you look at our revenue performance within semiconductor technology versus where the market does, we were up about 18% in total. We estimate FSI, which is the market indicator that we look at, which is the amount that we first produced was probably up about 9% in the quarter. We think we got about 4% or so just from where we play. So some of the spaces within the semiconductor space grew higher than the market average. And then the remaining 4% would have been from that share gain perspective.\nOperator: At this time, there are no further questions in the queue. Thank you.\nLeland Weaver: Thank you, everyone, for joining our call. For your reference, a copy of our transcript will be posted on the DuPont website. This concludes our call.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Lori Koch",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Let me cover our first quarter financial results on Slide 4. As Ed said earlier, I'd also like to acknowledge the commitment of our employees throughout the pandemic and our team in navigating through supply chain and logistics headwind this quarter to deliver the following results. Net sales of $4 billion were up 8% versus the first quarter of 2020, up 7% on an organic basis.  Overall sales growth was driven by strong volume, up 7% versus first quarter of last year, with volume increases in all 3 reporting segments. Currency provided a 3% tailwind in the quarter led by the euro. Portfolio was a 2% headwind, primarily due to the sale of the trichlorosilane business last year. Sales were up in all 3 segments, with E&I, M&M and W&P reflecting organic growth of 14%, 8% and 1%, respectively. On a regional basis, organic sales were up 20% in Asia Pacific, our largest region from a sales perspective, with strong results in all 3 reporting segments. Partially offsetting gains in Asia Pacific were organic sales decline in the U.S. and Canada and EMEA of 4% and 2%, respectively. The declines in U.S. and Canada and EMEA were driven by softness for aramid fibers, specifically continued softness in aerospace and timing delays in defense as well as auto builds, which were down in these regions. I'll provide more color on our segment top line results on the next slide. From an earnings perspective, we delivered operating EBITDA of $1.05 billion and adjusted EPS of $0.91 per share, up 15% and 90%, respectively. Volume gains as well as benefit from prior year cost initiatives and currency drove 160 basis points of operating EBITDA margin expansion and 1.9x operating leverage. Incremental margins for the quarter were 46%. I will walk you through the EPS later call in a moment. Our total company gross margin for the quarter was 36.8%, flat on a year-over-year basis. Gross margin improvement in E&I and M&M on higher volume and manufacturing productivity was offset by a margin decline in W&P, resulting from higher unit rates versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower production volumes of aramid fibers. Gross margin expanded about 280 basis points sequentially, with margin improvement in all 3 segments. From a segment perspective, E&I delivered operating EBITDA margin of 33.5% and 420 basis points of margin expansion versus the year ago period on strong volume growth and a onetime discrete gain related to an asset sale. Excluding the benefit of the asset sale, operating EBITDA margin would have been 31.7%, a year-over-year improvement of 240 basis points. M&M delivered operating EBITDA margins of 22.9% and 320 basis points of margin expansion versus the year ago period on higher volumes and savings from productivity actions. In W&P, operating EBITDA was flat versus the year ago period as sales gains and cost productivity actions were offset by higher manufacturing costs, primarily higher unit rates, driven by lower production of aramid fibers and increased supply chain costs. For the quarter, cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow were $378 million and $95 million, respectively. These amounts include 1 month of cash flow from our N&B business compared to 3 months of N&B cash burn in the prior year. In addition, cash flow and free cash flow conversion was negatively impacted by a working capital headwind of about $300 million, led by higher accounts receivable balances, which were up in line with sales. For the year, we continue to target free cash flow conversion of greater than 90%. Slide 5 provides more details on the year-over-year changes in net sales. Leading the way for the quarter was E&I with 15% volume growth, which had a record quarter. Volume gains were led by double-digit growth on robust demand for semiconductors across Asia. High fabrication utilization rates, driven by demand for new technologies and advanced nodes, along with the ongoing shift in digital transformation drove strong top line growth. In addition, share gains from recent wins for CMP slurry and lithography materials improved results. In Interconnect Solutions, double-digit growth was driven by higher material content in premium next-generation smartphones partially resulting from timing shifts that select OEM demand shifted earlier in the year this year, along with broader printed circuit board market recovery. Within Industrial Solutions, double-digit volume gains in display materials due to new time launches more than offset continued weakness in aerospace. The end markets within W&P were generally consistent with our expectations. Sales gains were led by Water Solutions with double-digit volume growth, reflecting strong demand for our reverse osmosis and ultrafiltration technology, led by Asia. Shelter  Solutions had low single-digit organic growth versus the year ago period, reflecting high single-digit organic growth in residential construction and retail channels for do-it-yourself application, offset partially by softness in commercial construction market. Within Safety Solutions, pricing gains, favorable currency and strengthening demand for aramid fibers in industrial and automotive end market was more than offset by continued weakness in aerospace and year-over-year volume declines for Tyvek. Lower Tyvek production volumes were a result of higher planned downtime in the quarter. Also contributing to strong first quarter top line growth was continued recovery of the global automotive market, which represents about [60%] of our M&M segment from an end market perspective. The most recent estimate of 1Q global auto builds were about 20.3 million units towards the quarter, up approximately 14% versus the first quarter of last year. As a result, volume in our Performance Resins business was up over 20% versus the year ago period. Another bright spot in M&M was improved demand for microcircuit materials, which we aligned to the M&M segment earlier this year. These specialized materials, along with adhesive growth, helped drive over 20% organic growth in Advanced Solutions growth in the year ago period. Demand in our Engineering Polymers business was strong. However, global supply constraints for key raw materials resulted in low single-digit volume decline. Our teams are experienced in navigating trading challenges and have worked diligently with our customers and suppliers to help mitigate the impact incurred as a result.  Additionally, we expect to recover volume lost in the quarter due to these disruptions and raw material constraints part of this unit. Turning to Slide 6. I mentioned that adjusted EPS for the quarter of $0.91 was up 90% versus the prior year. The largest driver of our year-over-year growth was a significantly lower share count, mainly resulting from the N&B exchange offer. The lower share count provided a $0.16 benefit versus the prior year. Excluding the lower share count, adjusted EPS growth was still significant, up 56% versus the prior year. Higher segment earnings provided a $0.13 tailwind in the quarter versus the prior year, along with benefits this year with a lower base tax rate and reduced interest expense. Our base tax rate for the quarter of 19.4% was lower than forecasted as a result of a few discrete tax benefits in the quarter. Our tax rate in the quarter was significantly lower than last year, resulting from the absence of certain discrete tax headwinds incurred in the prior year. For the full year 2021, we now expect our base tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 22%, down slightly from the 21% to 23% that we previously estimated at the beginning of the year. Turning to Slide 7. I will provide some commentary on our balance sheet and cash position. I mentioned earlier that net working capital provided headwinds in free cash flow in the quarter. However, I would like to point out that net working capital productivity gains of about $600 million that we have made in the first quarter of last year, increasing net working capital for about $3.5 billion at March 2020 to $2. 9 billion at March of 2021. Both of these were driving down past due receivables and inventory. From a debt perspective, we have stated that we are committed to maintaining our current strong investment-grade credit profile. We started the year with $15.6 billion in current debt. And as Ed mentioned, we paid down our $3 billion term loan in February, and we will pay down $2 billion of debt later this month. Moving on to cash. Our cash generated from operations last year put us in a strong cash position coming into this year, and that balance grew with a $7.3 billion special cash payment from the transaction with IFF. In addition, we expect to receive over $900 million in gross proceeds this year from the previously announced sale of the noncore businesses. Our current deployment plan for 2021 includes a balanced capital allocation approach. Along with our plan for internal investment this year, we plan to grow through targeted M&A in areas of secular growth and will fund the $2.3 billion planned acquisition of Laird Performance Materials with cash on hand. We intend to continue to return cash to shareholders. Along with our dividend policy, we completed $500 million of share repurchases in the first quarter at an average price of about $73 per share and will remain opportunistic with our remaining share repurchase authorization throughout the rest of the year. On a go-forward basis, our target run and maintain cash balance is about $1.5 billion. And from a leverage perspective, our net debt-to-EBITDA target remains at 2.75x. With that, I'll now turn it back over to Ed to talk about our financial outlook. Yes. I think the guidance that we provided essentially assumes a similar quarter for revenue like we saw in 1Q, so pushing $4 billion between -- around a $3.9 billion and $4 billion range in the second quarter. And then if you look at the full year outlook, you can back into a similar number in the back half of the year. So whatever upside we may see from the M&M portfolio getting back that lost volume in the first half, so still that tends to be a little bit of seasonality in our results that would offset that. Still landed at flat number dollar-wise from a revenue perspective. You mean for the noncore businesses that we're divesting? Yes. We have been somewhere in the range of -- yes, we had mentioned somewhere in the range of 6 to 8x EBITDA multiple on those businesses. Sure. Yes, I think you said it correctly. So we did see a little bit of acceleration from an order perspective in the first quarter, probably the first half versus what we normally see from some of the smart homes provider. So from a site perspective, probably about a $10 million benefit for the quarter. They're not hugely material to DuPont raw materials. I think they're [indiscernible] segment. If you look at the full year, we've got Interconnect Solutions. We expect to be up kind of in the mid-single digits, so it will normalize as the year goes on. Part of that is due to very strong comps from last year. So if you recall, in the fourth quarter of last year, we [indiscernible] interconnect as some of those producers pulled some volume into 2020 as well. Yes. I think what we had mentioned about Tyvek in the quarter was garment volume. It adds, it wanes, it picks volume back up in some of the more medical or industrial end markets. And so from a demand perspective, there's not a headwind overall. The headwind that we saw in the quarter was more so around production capabilities. And so we have pushed some of our planned maintenance activity that was planned for 2020 into 2021 just given the COVID response that was needed in last year. And so that tamped down the volume that we were able to produce and then sell in Q1. If I were to size it, I would probably size it around $20 million of a headwind in general for Tyvek. And back on the comment on the garment demand potentially being mainly picked up by other end markets, it's a similar margin profile. So there's no headwind there from that perspective. Yes. I expect to drive improvement from where we were in the first quarter, and that will also translate to improvement in free cash flow conversion. So we'll continue to target greater than 90% of the year, which implies a significant improvement from where we were in Q1. So Q1 was really a function of the higher sales. So we were up about 8% in sales that translated to about a 7% increase in AR. And as I had mentioned, we were opportunistic in buying lots and we could get them. But surely, inventory increased. So I would expect on a full year basis, I might be in right now for working capital to be used, just given the top line growth as we're expecting, probably more so in the $200 million range. So improvement coming out of Q1. But I think more importantly, the measure that we pay attention to is net working capital term. And so we saw significant improvement last year to the June, ending the year at about 5.2 turns. We'll look to target about 5.3 turns as we close the year. Yes. I think the growth, a lot of it is coming from the desalination side. Also, we have a large growing -- it's small today, but it's growing nicely opportunity within the residential space. And so we've now got the leading technology from all 3 applications between reverse osmosis, ion exchange and also filtration in our acquisition. So we feel comfortable, and as Ed had mentioned, continue to look at opportunities for us to expand our presence there. So I think filtration continues to be a large opportunity for us as well. So as Ed had mentioned, whether it's lithium or other types of filtration, we will continue to be a big player in that space. And I think about our opportunity in addition to ESG is the potential underneath the infrastructure plan that has targeted investments in the water filtration require a perfect purification space. Yes. I think the potential lower growth in the second half is really just a comparison. So obviously, the second half -- second quarter is going to be the largest year-over-year growth driver for us just given that was the lead point of last year, and then we approved as the year went on. So I don't see a material change in the actual EBITDA number kind of similar to the revenue conversation we had earlier, so I think a similar environment. As I've mentioned earlier, from an end market perspective, we're generally that and even above 2019 in those cases, the full year guidance that we had out there has our revenue up 6% versus 2019. And the guide that we put, I think, was the EBITDA kind of low teens. And so we're generally back and then the markets that are weak are really just a handful. And they're more around the aerospace which is up off the bottom, but still off of 2019 and commercial construction, which in the aggregate don't make up a material portion of our portfolio. Yes, I.t really comes from the new products we had mentioned within CMP slurring lithography also within company in the advanced packaging space. So if you look at our revenue performance within semiconductor technology versus where the market does, we were up about 18% in total. We estimate FSI, which is the market indicator that we look at, which is the amount that we first produced was probably up about 9% in the quarter. We think we got about 4% or so just from where we play. So some of the spaces within the semiconductor space grew higher than the market average. And then the remaining 4% would have been from that share gain perspective."

            "content": "Thanks, Leland. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will provide comments on the strong start that we had to 2021, including the advancement of a number of strategic priorities to make DuPont a premier multi-industrial company, equipped for growth and value creation. But first, let me acknowledge the tremendous dedication and determination of our teams around the world as we continue to manage the extraordinary circumstances of this pandemic. The health and well-being of our people remains our top priority. The principles and protocols we've implemented globally and locally to help to protect our people and ensure business continuity as countries face multiple waves of infection and lockdowns. As an innovation-led company, we believe in science and we're encouraging all employees to get vaccinated. And where possible, we're working with public health authorities to facilitate access and distribution. Starting on Slide 2, I will note that one of our priorities for generating value is consistent operating performance and financial results. This morning, we announced strong top line and earnings results for the first quarter, both above our expectations.  Lori will take you through the details in a moment. But I'd like to highlight the 7% organic revenue growth that we reported, reflecting broad and strong demand in key markets such as semiconductors, smartphones, water, residential construction and automotive. This revenue growth, along with continued cost discipline, led to strong operating leverage and EBITDA margin expansion in the quarter. Our first quarter financial results reflect the agility of our teams to navigate through a challenging environment while facing escalating raw material and logistics costs as well as global supply constraints of key raw materials, most notably in our M&M segment. With strong order trend continuing and confidence in our team's ability to navigate the supply chain challenges, we are raising our full year guidance for net sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS. I will provide more details regarding this increase shortly. In addition to our financial results, we advanced a number of our strategic priorities during the quarter. First, as previously announced, we completed the merger of our Nutrition & Biosciences business with IFF, creating an industry-leading company in the food and beverage, home and personal care and health and wellness markets. As you know, this transaction also unlocks significant value for DuPont and our shareholders. As part of the transaction, we received $7.3 billion cash from IFF and retired slightly more than 197 million coupon shares, or about 27% of our outstanding shares at the time with no cash outlay. We strengthened our balance sheet during the quarter by paying down our $3 billion term loan, and we will redeem $2 billion of our long-term debt later this month. As a reminder, our next debt maturity will not be due until the fourth quarter of 2023. In line with our balanced approach, we returned about $660 million of capital to shareholders during the first quarter through share repurchases and dividends. Under our existing share buyback program, we executed $500 million in share repurchases during the first quarter. As a reminder, we have about $500 million of repurchase authorization remaining under that program, which we intend to utilize by June 1 of this year. Earlier this quarter, we also announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new $1.5 billion share buyback program, which expires on June 30, 2022. We plan to be opportunistic under the new program as we move throughout the year. With respect to dividends, we returned about $160 million in cash to shareholders during the quarter. As we previously mentioned, going forward, we will target a payout ratio between 35% and 45%. And we intend to work with our Board to increase our dividend annually as we grow our earnings. In March, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Laird Performance Materials for $2.3 billion. When completed, a planned acquisition of Laird advances DuPont's strategy of growing as a global innovation leader and strengthens our leadership position in advanced electronic materials. The Laird business will complement our Interconnect Solutions business within E&I, and it will add critical capabilities and market-leading offerings in thermal management and electromagnetic shielding, which are essential to emerging electronic applications. Our E&I team, along with our customers, are excited for this opportunity. We recently received regulatory approval for the transaction in Germany and Brazil and cleared HSR in the U.S. last month. As previously indicated, we expect the transaction will close in the third quarter of this year. Finally, we announced previously that we have signed definitive agreements to sell our Biomaterials, Clean Technologies and Solamet businesses. We anticipate receiving more than $900 million in gross proceeds from those divestitures, and we expect those transactions to close in the second half of this year. Before turning it over to Lori to go through the details of the first quarter, I'd like to take a moment to provide some context regarding what we saw during the quarter in our key end markets that we serve. Combined, the electronics and automotive markets account for nearly half of our revenues. Electronics continues to perform very well, and auto is recovering nicely from its 2020 lows. Within electronics, demand continues to be broad-based as the ramp-up of advanced technology nodes and a need for more memory to servers and data centers has accelerated. The server market, which is a large consumer of semiconductor chips and circuit board chemistries, continues to show strength and is expected to remain robust as Internet network traffic continues to grow. Furthermore, the deployment of 5G infrastructure by leading telecom companies in preparation for the next generation of ultra-high-speed data transmission should help sustain demand for premium smartphones, which is further enhanced by our favorable content play. With respect to the automotive end market, demand is well above the lows of 2020 but not yet back to 2019 levels, which sold 22.9 million vehicles produced in the first quarter and nearly 90 million units for the year. The lack of stable supply of critical components, mainly semiconductors, impacted the ability of the auto OEMs to produce more vehicles and rebuild inventories during the quarter. Even where we participate in the value chain within M&M, I think it's important to note that our first quarter Engineering Polymers volumes were not materially affected by the chip shortages as our demand from the Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers was not lessened as a result of the chip shortage. However, our ability to supply customers was affected by supply constraints of key raw materials, predominantly in our nylon and polyester product lines. This supply situation is gradually improving while we anticipate several critical products will continue to constrain our production through the end of the second quarter. We expect that annual sales as a result of raw material constraints will be captured in the second half of the year. Additionally, we believe that the automotive market will remain strong for the balance of the year as OEMs look to meet robust demand as well as replenish global inventories, which are currently below historical averages. Moving on to the water and construction end markets. Collectively, these 2 markets account for approximately 20% of our total company sales. Versus first quarter of 2019, demand for advanced water filtration and purification has strengthened, driven by solid growth in Asia Pacific. Strength in residential and commercial water markets as well as industrial and desalination segments has shown growth. For construction, North America residential and do-it-yourself markets are up versus first quarter 2019. And while demand within the commercial construction segment has improved from the lows experienced in 2020, it is not back to 2019 levels. Lastly, demand within our industrial end markets versus 2019 levels is mixed. Within the electrical infrastructure and Tyvek protective garment markets, demand is at or above 2019 levels. However, demand in end markets such as aerospace and oil and gas is still below 2019 levels, but it's improved since the lows of the second and third quarter of last year. Sequentially, our sales in the aero and oil and gas were up over 40%. Our diversified portfolio of products and technologies will serve us as the global economy continues to recover from the pandemic. We are continuing to invest at competitive levels in R&D and innovation to further solidify our strong market positions and maintain our position as the partner of choice for our customers in 2021 and beyond. With that, let me turn it over to Lori to walk through the details of our first quarter financial performance. Thanks, Lori. Let me close with our financial outlook on Slide 8, which includes our view of the second quarter and full year 2021. We are raising our full year guidance range for net sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS. At the midpoint of the range provided, we now expect net sales for the year to be about $15.8 billion, which reflects year-over-year growth of 10%, up from our previous estimate of 8% growth. We expect to improve leverage and now expect operating EBITDA for the year to be about $4.03 billion, at the midpoint of the range provided, a year-over-year increase of 17%. These revised estimates reflect our solid start to the year and confidence in our team's ability to continue to navigate global supply key challenges. We are also raising our adjusted EPS range for the full year by $0.30 per share and now expect adjusted EPS of $3.67 per share, at the midpoint of the range provided. In addition to the strong operating performance of our businesses, the share repurchases we are completing under our existing programs and the narrowing of our estimated tax range supporting the [indiscernible] while contributing to the revised [indiscernible] estimates. For the second quarter 2021, we expect net sales to be about $3.975 billion, and we expect the operating EBITDA to be about $1 billion, both at the midpoints of the ranges provided and both well above results in the second quarter last year.  At the midpoint of the range provided, we expect adjusted EPS for the second quarter of 2021 of $0.94 per share, which now reflects the full reduction in shares resulting from the N&B exchange offer and our weighted average [indiscernible]. With that, let me turn it over to Leland to open up for Q&A. Yes. I'll start, and maybe Lori wants to jump in. If I may, I don't think our normal cyclicality plays out this year because of what you just described. Very different dynamics this year. I'd say one of the biggest issues is really the inflation cost on all materials here and then the pricing actions that we can take. So that's a pretty big dynamic for all of us that you see reporting here. But probably, the first quarter, the cost deflation was very little. It was about $20 million. We expect in the second quarter that lists to about $90 million. And we expect the full year impact of raw material inflation to be about $300 million. So it kind of goes up to kind of $90 million to $100 million in the second quarter, holds there for the year, which gets you kind of the $300 million. So we've been -- have been a constructive price market, Steve, and we think we'll catch most of the second quarter inflation, but maybe not all of it as we have some contracts that are 30, 60 days. But we're very confident that we'll be able to cover the walls. When you look at the year in total, that we'll be able to make that up. So we're expecting for total DuPont for our pricing to be up low single digits for the year. But clearly, more so in the M&M division where a lot of the world inflation is -- no price increase in electronics simply because you don't get it there, you get a new product introductions that you get fed and some price increase in Water & Protection, within water and safety business specifically. So I'd say that's a big dynamic there. And then from a kind of a revenue standpoint, I'd say the other big dynamic is because of the raw material constraints that we're seeing. When we did the fourth quarter call, Lori and I talked about a $60 million to $80 million miss in sales that we were expecting in the quarter. And then you had the freeze down in Texas. So we think it's -- we missed out about $100 million of sales in the quarter, which is $20 million to $25 million of EBITDA. We expect another $100 million in the second quarter, $100 million to $120 million missed revenue. But like you're hearing from all the others, we're not going to lose the business. We will make it up as the constraints kind of worked their way through because everyone was kind of dealing with the same issue here. So I'd say that's the large dynamics of sequentially and then going into the year, second half of the year. All the end markets, Steve, played out the way we thought they would. The ones we thought would be hot were hot. The ones we thought we saw, like commercial construction, residential oil and gas are all lifting nicely on the lows of last year, but not back to '19 levels. So we expect that to continue through the year also. Yes. First of all, I'm not sure this will resolve itself in the year either. You've heard quite a few suppliers talk about this going and potentially into next year, depending on what it is. So inventory levels in new autos chain are very, very low in the supply chain itself. Finished goods are low. You still got the semiconductor ratio that's going to mute things, which I've heard most people think of going into 2022. So I think you got that dynamic going on here. So I wouldn't gauge at all just throwing it into the second half of the year at all. No. India is not a big impact at all in that one. The biggest upside for us though is India in the water business. That's a real key market for us, but it's not that big in the scheme of things yet. So no, it didn't have any significant impact for us. If we add N&B in the portfolio, it would have been bigger, but that was really where our bigger presence was in our portfolio. We don't think much. I mean we cited a couple of customers we know they are building inventory. It's some in Asia that we think preorder, but it's like $30 million to $40 million business. We're not seeing it. The people just can't get their hands on enough right now. I mean there's so many force majeures out there across the supply chain, again, mostly in the auto business I'm talking about. But I don't see inventory build in the channel. And you know historically, finished goods at autos is very low right now globally. So we don't see a lot of that. Our people trying to double order. I think there's some of that going on, but everyone's getting allocated product at this point in time. So it's not like they're able to build an inventory base. I'll use DuPont as an example. Our inventory well of about $100 million, and it's in mostly in our M&M business, and we couldn't get it up on the other walls to get the product out the door. So we did plan on -- we're not double ordering. We just couldn't get it out the door to have a finished good. So again, in the scheme of our numbers, that's not a big deal. But I'm sure there's a decent amount of that going on, but I wouldn't call it double ordering the stockpile. Yes. So Jeff, we're looking at a couple of bolt-ons. One of them is exactly what we've described the last couple of quarters in the water space. I think what we're looking at is very similar to Laird where with synergies, high confidence in, by the way, cost synergies, we can get it up at a multiple that makes sense for DuPont, or by the way, we just won't buy it. We just don't know that final answer yet. So yes, I think there's -- some of those opportunities are out there to do that in some of the spaces we really like there's going to be a great secular growth areas for us in the future. But I'm not talking huge things at this point in time. As I always say, we'll always look at transformative moves if it makes sense for the company -- there's something a couple long, and these are truly a couple bolt-ons in the hundreds of millions, not billions that we're looking at. But similar dynamic I would say to Laird.  So maybe to your question, yes, those opportunities are there for us. And we're sold-out on those assets. So as we move things around, it's not like we're picking up extra volume. Right now, we'll get the same margin impact. And that's why our biggest CapEx program is a new line over in Europe that will come on in 2023. It's our single biggest CapEx program, and we're flat out. Yes. I mean with all of us with our ESG goals out there in the industrial world, I mean, the secular growth opportunity here looks like it's going to be pretty awesome for the next couple of decades. So I mean we all have metrics we're trying to hit on clean water, and we all have these facilities around the world. So it should be a really nice opportunity. And by the way, one of the reasons we would like to grow this business organically and inorganically. It's definitely -- look, we bought it on the cross-sell, i.e., when you get right down, the way it broadens out the portfolio very significantly in a couple of key technology areas that are needed as there's more advanced technologies coming here, especially thermal management being a key one. So look, the closer we're delivering our -- just going to go at it real quickly just to get it out of the way, but we want it for the growth opportunity, the cross-sell opportunity to be able to bring more solutions to our customers. Remember, in that business, we have a lot of application engineers that are resolving customer issues. And with shrinkage in size of all these components, some of these technologies become more and more important. And so that's the reason we bought it strategically, we think it's a great fit. It's where the industry is headed. And it's more of really the growth reason in that business, but we'll get the cost synergies. So we bought it at a nice number from a multiple standpoint. Yes. So usually, John, it's an issue of CEO sitting on 2 boards, external boards. But I think in general, and by the way, they have -- also have the issue you just raised. My thoughts, in general, our investors understand why I'm doing it. I don't need to do other things in my life. But I think they understand it, it's very important to me and to DuPont that this goes well, we go opening more than half the company is what we put into IFF. So it's extremely important to our shareholder base. So I think it's morally the right thing to do. But under the definition by an independent director, there's absolutely no doubt about that. And it's very similar driver on the Corteva Board, the help and the transition there. I don't see this is any different than I think it's the right thing to do. Yes. Look, I would say, short term here, we're very focused operationally running the company. But remember, we just closed the N&B transaction 2 months ago. It seems like forever, and there's a lot of heavy lift there. We still have to finish cars and do the 3 noncore businesses, which we'll get out after mid-year out of the portfolio, and that will bring in $900 million of proceeds. So we still have a heavy lift going on there. And then remember, at the same time, we're going to be starting the integration of the Laird business into the portfolio. So we definitely got a lot of that type of work, in addition to looking at a couple of targeted M&A opportunities as I had mentioned. So -- but I think that has a lot going on portfolio-wise still this year and with all of the issues we talked about managing raw material inputs and pricing through all that in a kind of a crazy but fun year. We've got our hands full. So I'd say portfolio kind of getting to kind of where we want it. Again, we would never take off the table looking some transformative things. But generally, cleaning up the noncore, getting Laird in and operationally, really just knows as a grindstone here."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DuPont Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Chris Mecray, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\nChris Mecray: Good morning and thank you for joining us for DuPont\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results conference call. Joining me today are Ed Breen, Chief Executive Officer; and Lori Koch, Chief Financial Officer. We have prepared slides to supplement our remarks, which are posted on DuPont\u2019s website under the Investor Relations tab and through the webcast link. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the slides. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Our Form 10-K, as updated by our current and periodic reports, includes detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today exclude significant items. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures included in our press release and has been posted to DuPont\u2019s Investor Relations website. I will now turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Breen: Good morning and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial review. We posted strong quarterly top and bottom line results in line with our previously communicated guidance in an uneven global economy. Fourth quarter revenue included a 5% organic growth versus the year ago period, strong volume in water and auto adhesives, as well as ongoing strength in industrial end markets such as healthcare and aerospace, helped mitigate volume declines in consumer electronics end markets and softening conditions in North American construction markets. Strong pricing growth in the quarter reflects actions taken largely prior to the fourth quarter to offset persistent inflationary pressures in raw materials, logistics and energy. We sold over $800 million in year-over-year inflation headwinds for full year 2022. We delivered year-over-year operating EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter despite a slight volume decline, currency headwinds and the impact of portfolio divestitures. We also saw a margin improvement of 120 basis points, demonstrating solid operational execution and focus on items we can control within the highly diverse end markets where we participate. The closing of the M&M sale was a milestone event in the fourth quarter and our last contemplated large-scale divestiture. The transaction further transforms our portfolio to concentrate in more stable, secular, higher growth and higher margin end markets. As you can see on Slide 4, our transformation actions have significantly strengthened our balance sheet, increased our financial flexibility and positioned the company to continue to generate shareholder value through disciplined capital allocation. Following the M&M sale, we acted quickly in accelerating return of capital to shareholders. We authorized a new $5 billion share repurchase program in November and launched an accelerated share repurchase transaction for $3.25 billion of common stock, allowing the retirement of about 39 million common shares in the fourth quarter. We anticipate completing this ASR in the third quarter of 2023 and plan to execute share repurchases under the planned remaining authorization as soon as we can. In the quarter, we also retired $2.5 billion of long-term debt, which is due to mature in November 2023 and reduced our commercial paper balance to zero as of year end. The long-term debt retirement reduced refinancing risk and generated pre-tax annualized interest expense savings of approximately $100 million. We also announced today an increase in our quarterly dividend of $0.36 per share or a 9% increase versus last year. Going forward, we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of between 35% and 45% and expect to increase our dividend annually alongside earnings growth. In total, we deployed more than $7.5 billion of capital in 2022 through significant share repurchases, deleveraging and dividend payments, which reflects our overall balanced capital allocation strategy. We exited the year in a favorable balance sheet and liquidity position and we look to further allocate excess capital over time to max on value creation through both opportunistic M&A and incremental share repurchases. Our M&A focus remains on targets that fit within our growth pillars and are aligned with key secular growth trends that we have highlighted. Further, our disciplined approach to portfolio management will ensure that DuPont focuses on growing businesses where we are the best strategic owner. Regarding the Delrin sale process, we continue to advance our internal work required to divest the business. We are being prudent with the deal process to ensure suitable market conditions and still expect to have a completed sale in 2023. Finally, we also continue to invest internally in innovation and incremental operating capacity to fuel and support our organic growth. In 2023, we expect to allocate CapEx at about 5% of sales as we wrap up some larger scale projects this year and we target R&D spending at about 4% of sales on a consolidated basis longer term, investing differentially within our business lines based on growth potential. Turning to Slide 5 before I hand it over to Lori, I want to thank our teams who remain focused on operational execution in a difficult environment, which allowed us to produce solid revenue and earnings growth this fish year. I also want to thank our teams for their continued efforts made during 2022 in transforming our portfolio. We are excited about the longer term growth potential of our business in its newly constituted form, centered around the secular high-growth pillars of electronics, water, protection, industrial technologies and next-generation automotive. Our end market mix is notably tilted towards electronics at about one-third of our portfolio. Within electronics, we have a key presence in consumer-based end markets, namely chips, films, displays and printed circuit board materials used in smartphones, PCs and tablets. The bulk of our remaining electronics exposure is in areas such as data centers and telecommunications as well as industrial and automotive applications, primarily consumables used in the semiconductor chip manufacturing process. Despite short-term volume pressure, we are pleased with our electronics market position and confident this exposure will help generate strong growth over time. Our presence in electronics is enviable, with higher margins versus the company average and a solid competitive position across the key products we supply. Likewise, our water business at 12% of our portfolio operates in markets that are expected to grow mid to high single-digits, driven by the global response to concerns such as water scarcity and circularity. Additionally, our participation in the auto market at about 13% of sales is much more connected to high-growth advanced technologies, enabling long-term secular trends like hybrid and electric vehicles for items such as battery applications. A solid portion of our auto exposure is aligned to EVs, which are growing at a significant pace. Given these and our equally strong market positions in many other end markets, including within our protection and industrial technologies pillars, we believe that our financial results over time will bear out the view that the new DuPont will grow and generate returns on par with the best industrial assets in the public markets. In response to near-term short-cycle end market slowing expected in the first half of 2023, we have been doing scenario planning for some time now and are proactively taking actions within our control to minimize volume impacts on margins. As a result, we expect to be able to show the resiliency of the new DuPont portfolio this year. I look forward to providing you with updates as we progress through 2023. With that, let me turn it over to Lori to review our financial performance and outlook.\nLori Koch: Thanks, Ed and good morning. The quality of our portfolio was highlighted this quarter as strong top line results across the majority of our business lines offset weaker conditions in consumer electronics and construction. The global economy remains challenging, but our team\u2019s focus on execution drove solid fourth quarter earnings growth and operating EBITDA margin expansion against the prior year period. Turning to our financial highlights on Slide 6, fourth quarter net sales of $3.1 billion decreased 4% as reported and increased 5% on an organic basis versus the year ago period. Global currency volatility resulted in a 5% headwind from U.S. dollar strength against key currencies, most notably the yen, yuan and euro. We also saw a 4% portfolio headwind driven by the impact of non-core divestitures. Breaking down the 5% organic sales growth, 7% pricing gains were partially offset by 2% volume declines. Continued strength in water solutions and over 20% volume gains in auto adhesives were more than offset by further softening in smartphones and personal computing within interconnect solutions, a slowdown in semiconductor and construction market, as well as continued lower year-over-year volume from Tyvek protective garments within safety solutions. As we exited the year, we saw lower volumes in areas we have highlighted with total December organic sales up 2% year-over-year, including down high single-digits in China, driven by acceleration of COVID disruptions and low single-digit organic sales growth in the U.S. and Canada due to muted demand in construction and destocking by customers. From an earnings perspective, operating EBITDA of $758 million increased 1% versus the year ago period despite currency headwinds and the impact of portfolio. Organic earnings growth was driven by pricing and disciplined cost control, which more than offset inflationary cost pressure and lower volumes, including the impact of production rates. Operating EBITDA margin during the quarter of 24.4% increased 120 basis points versus the year ago period. Adjusted EPS in the quarter of $0.89 per share increased 16%, which I will detail shortly. Cash used in operations during the quarter of $126 million, less capital expenditures of $185 million and transaction-related adjustments totaling $213 million resulted in a free cash outflow of $98 million. The transaction-related adjustments consist of $163 million termination fee related to the intended Rogers acquisition, with the remainder from a tax prepayment for the M&M divestiture. Further headwinds to free cash flow during the quarter included transaction costs related to closing the M&M deal of about $200 million and an approximately $100 million cash outflow related to prepaid accounts payable in advance of the M&M deal closing, which was subsequently reimbursed to us at closing and reported as an inflow within investing activities. I call out these items to provide visibility into our underlying cash flow performance. Additionally, free cash flow included a working capital benefit during the quarter of about $120 million related to inventory reductions resulting both from our productivity efforts and from our decision to slow production in certain lines of business given the lower volume environment. Turning to Slide 7, adjusted EPS for the quarter of $0.89 per share increased 16% compared to $0.77 per share in the year ago period. The strong EPS growth came primarily from below-the-line items as organic earnings from our ongoing businesses were mostly offset by the absence of earnings from non-core divestitures as well as currency headwinds. Ongoing share repurchase continues to drive earnings per share growth, providing a $0.07 benefit to adjusted EPS. Lower net interest expense provided a $0.05 benefit to adjusted EPS, driven by both interest income resulting from additional cash on hand from the M&M divestiture and also lower interest expense resulting from the pay-down of $2.5 billion of senior notes during the quarter. Our tax rate for the quarter was 22.2%, up notably from 18.6% in the year ago period, resulting in a $0.06 tax headwind to adjusted EPS driven primarily by geographic mix of earnings and currency. Our full year base tax rate for 2022 was 23.2% and our 2023 outlook assumes a base tax rate in the range of 23% to 24%. Turning to Slide 8. Just to note a few metrics on a full year basis, net sales of $13 billion in 2022 increased 4% for the full year. On an organic basis, full year sales increased 8% due to a 7% increase in price and a 1% increase in volume. W&T and E&I delivered organic sales growth of 11% and 5% respectively and net sales in all four regions increased organically. Further, we delivered high single-digits or better organic sales growth in 5 of our 6 lines of business as well as in the retained businesses within corporate led by auto adhesives. Interconnect Solutions was the only business line down organically due to the slowdown in smartphones and personal computing since last summer. Full year operating EBITDA of $3.26 billion increased 3% due primarily to volume gains as pricing gains were mostly offset by continued pressure associated with higher raw material, logistics and energy costs. Operating EBITDA margin was flat at 25.1%, inclusive of price cost headwind of about 150 basis points. Full year adjusted EPS of $3.41 per share increased 12% versus 2021. The increase was driven by a lower share count from share repurchases, higher segment earnings and lower net interest expense, which was partially offset by a higher tax rate. Cash flow from operations for the year of $588 million, less capital expenditures of $743 million and transaction-related adjustments totaling $328 million for items that I mentioned earlier, resulted in free cash flow for the year of $173 million. Full year discrete headwinds included in free cash flow totaled about $650 million, which mainly reflect transaction costs. Turning to segment results, beginning with E&I on Slide 9. E&I fourth quarter net sales decreased 8% as organic sales declined 2%, along with currency and portfolio headwinds of 5% and 1% respectively. The organic sales decline reflects a 5% decrease in volumes, partially offset by a 3% increase in average price. The organic sales decrease for E&I was led by a 10% decline in Interconnect Solutions driven by volume linked with further weakening in smartphone, PC and tablet demand, along with channel inventory destocking and the negative impact of COVID-related disruptions in China. In Semiconductor Technologies, lower volumes resulted from reduced semi fab utilization rates due to weaker end market demand along with channel inventory destocking. End market weakness was seen mainly in smartphones and personal computing. In Industrial Solutions, volumes were muted as lower demand in consumer printing and weakness in LED silicones for conventional lighting in China more than offset ongoing strength in broad-based industrial end markets, including Best Bell product lines in aerospace and for applications in healthcare markets. Operating EBITDA for E&I of $407 million decreased 4% in the quarter as volume declines were partially offset by disciplined cost control with operating EBITDA margin up 150 basis points from the year ago period. For the full year, E&I net sales of $5.9 billion increased 7% versus 2021, up 5% on an organic basis as the portfolio benefit from last year\u2019s Laird acquisition was partially offset by currency headwinds. Organic sales growth for the year of 5% consisted of a 3% increase in volume and a 2% increase in price. From a line of business view, organic sales growth was led by Semi Tech, up low double-digits and Industrial Solutions up high single-digits, partially offset by mid single-digit declines in Interconnect Solutions related to weakness in smartphones and personal computing end markets during the second half of 2022. Full year operating EBITDA of $1.8 billion increased 4% as volume gains, a full year of earnings associated with the Laird acquisition and higher pricing more than offset inflationary cost pressure and weaker mix in interconnect. Turning to Slide 10, W&P fourth quarter net sales increased 6% as organic sales growth of 12% was partially offset by a 6% currency headwind. Organic growth reflects broad-based pricing actions taken across the segment to offset cost inflation as WP volumes were flat. Organic sales growth was led by Water Solutions, which increased over 20% on strong global demand for water technologies, led by reverse osmosis membrane as well as capacity increases and pricing gains. Water continues to be an area of consistent strength with long-term top line growth expectations in the mid to high single digits. Sales for Safety Solutions were up high single digits on an organic basis as pricing actions were somewhat offset by lower Tyvek volumes given the demand shift from garments to other applications and the resulting impact of line changeovers on production efficiency. Excluding the year-over-year garment headwind, total W&P volumes increased approximately 2% in the quarter. In Shelter Solutions, sales were up high single digits on an organic basis as pricing gains were partially offset by volume declines primarily in North America construction. Operating EBITDA for W&P of $360 million increased 11% as pricing actions and disciplined cost control more than offset inflationary cost pressures and currency headwinds with operating EBITDA margin up 100 basis points from the year ago period. For the full year, W&P net sales of $6 billion increased 7% versus 2021 as organic growth of 11%, partially offset by a 4% currency headwind. Organic sales growth for the year consisted of a 12% increase in price, slightly offset by a 1% volume decline. Excluding the year-over-year garment headwinds, total W&P volumes increased 2% for the year. From a line of business view, organic sales growth was driven by mid-teens growth in Shelter Solutions, low teens growth in Water Solutions and high single-digit growth in Safety Solutions. Full year operating EBITDA of $1.4 billion increased 3% as higher pricing and disciplined cost more than offset inflationary cost pressure as well as currency headwinds. I\u2019ll close with a few comments on our financial outlook and guidance for 2023 on Slide 11. We expect solid top line growth trends to continue into 2023 in businesses such as water and auto adhesives as well as stable demand across diversified industrial end markets, including aerospace and healthcare. We do, however, anticipate lower volumes during the first half of 2023 in consumer electronics and semiconductors, resulting from decreased consumer spending, inventory destocking and COVID-related impacts in China, largely within E&I. We also expect ongoing softness in construction end markets within W&T during 2023. For the first quarter of 2023, we anticipate continued weakness in these consumer-driven short-cycle end markets, resulting in a first quarter net sales expectation of about $2.9 billion or down mid-single digits on an organic basis versus the year ago period. As 2023 progresses, we assume stabilization of consumer electronics demand, normalization of customer inventory levels and improved China demand to drive sequential quarterly improvement in operating results, most notably in the second half of the year. Within the Interconnect Solutions business, where the printed circuit board market has been down since mid-2022. We anticipate that channel destocking and customer production rates begin to improve during the second quarter. Within semiconductor technologies, fab utilization rates are also expected to bottom during the first half of this year and improve around midyear. As a result of these assumptions, coupled with expectation of improvement in China across our product lines, we expect full year 2023 net sales to be between $12.3 billion and $12.9 billion. In response to the expected lower volume environment, we are focused on minimizing decremental margin impacts. To achieve this, we are focused on the operational levers within our control, including appropriate actions to increase productivity at our plant sites, reduce discretionary spending and realization of savings enabled by cost actions initiated during the fourth quarter. For first quarter 2023, we expect operating EBITDA of about $710 million. For full year 2023, we expect operating EBITDA to be between $3 billion and $3.3 billion, expecting to hold full year operating EBITDA margin flat at the midpoint of the ranges provided compared to last year. These same midpoints imply a decremental margin of 27% for the full year despite a mixed headwind resulting from volume pressure in our higher-margin business, mainly semi. Our first quarter adjusted EPS expectation of about $0.80 per share and full year adjusted EPS guidance range of between $3.50 and $4 per share assumes continued growth from below-the-line benefits related to a lower share count and lower interest expense. The midpoint of our full year adjusted EPS guidance implies growth of 10% versus last year, driven by these benefits from our ongoing capital allocation strategy. With that, we are pleased to take your questions, let me turn it back to the operator to open the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Melius Research. Your line is open.\nScott Davis: Hi, good morning, everybody.\nEd Breen: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Davis: Let\u2019s \u2013 if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d love to get a little bit more color on the inventory levels. When you think about, I mean, two different businesses really with the interconnect and the semiconductor side. But how high did inventories get? Meaning kind of how above normal were they? And where would you characterize them today versus where perhaps they were maybe a quarter ago?\nEd Breen: Yes. So on ICS, as Lori just mentioned, Scott, that started its downturn actually middle of 2022. So that\u2019s been going through a downturn. It\u2019s obviously lower demand. And a lot of that lower demand, by the way, is China related lower demand because of COVID and lockdowns and all that. And so we have talked to our 10 largest PCP customers mainly in China, and it looks like they are going to begin their ramp in the second quarter. We\u2019re thinking more in the middle of the second quarter. And maybe to give you a couple of numbers behind it, their PCB fabs usually run in the high 70% utilization rate. They have been \u2013 they are all a little bit different, but they have been running kind of between 40% and 60% and they expect the second half of the second quarter to be kind of up to 60% to 65% and then ramp up from there. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re getting granularly on the ground. And of course, smartphones are supposed to pick up in 2023 from last year. And remember, the smartphones in China were down 20% last year. So it was just a big down. I mean nobody \u2013 none of the consumers were shopping. So I think just China coming back on its own from kind of this artificial COVID thing alone is going to help with demand. And remember, we\u2019re high on electronics in that market in general. So I think we will see a boost there. And then if we\u2019re right with our customers on the PCB side, we will start seeing that in the middle of the second quarter. And then on the semi side, I think that\u2019s pretty public knowledge. But those fabs were all running high, kind of 95%. They are now running in the low 80s. Now remember, a lot of that is destocking going on. Most of the chip guys are saying the biggest down quarter is the first quarter. We think it\u2019s the first and second quarter. So in our planning, as Lori mentioned, that\u2019s what we planned that we start seeing our ramp towards the end of the second quarter. And if you look at the MSI data, it\u2019s kind of minus 10 and then minus 12 versus the second quarter, and then it improves and gets actually positive in the fourth quarter. And then, of course, we will \u2013 our demand will happen slightly before that MSI number. So I think we \u2013 the way we laid it out, we\u2019re sequencing it properly. And by the way, maybe just to give you the rest of the landscape the way we put \u201823 together. We plan that the construction markets will be down all of 2023. And then pretty much every other business, we have all the industrial businesses will be stable in 2023 and the water business will grow mid to high single digits. So that\u2019s kind of a lay of the land of how we put it together.\nLori Koch: Yes. If I can just add to, we referenced the market research inventory index for semi to get an understanding of what inventory exists in the channel. And right now, usually, it says it kind of goes into surplus mode when the inventory index is above 1.2. We\u2019re looking to be in that \u2013 butting up against the 1.2 as we close the first quarter. And the second quarter to our earlier point is the peak where it gets a little bit higher than 1.2, and then it starts to come back down. For reference, back at the last semi downturn in the late 2018, 2019 downstream, it was much higher. So it doesn\u2019t feel like we have the same dynamics going on at what we had back then. But it does feel like there is more in the channel than where we were definitely last year at this time, we were kind of at a below one level with respect to the inventory index.\nScott Davis: Okay, I am going to stick to one question. It\u2019s main issue for me. Thank you and best of luck.\nEd Breen: Thanks, Scott. Good to hear from you.\nLori Koch: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nSteve Tusa: Hi, guys. Good morning. \nEd Breen: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: So just looking at the guide, I think you guys have like $0.60 or something like that of tailwinds off of the 340 base kind of gets to just above $4. The low end of the range at 350 just seems like what\u2019s embedded in the low end of that 350 range? I feel like the math gets us to something a little bit higher, at least at the low end?\nLori Koch: Yes. So the low end on both the top and bottom line really assumes not much improvement coming out of Q1. So a little bit mainly driven by seasonality, but not a lot of recovery in the end markets that we had spoke about. So it is more on the pessimistic side. We believe a lot of indicators that we\u2019re seeing and the conversations that we\u2019re having with our customers would suggest that wouldn\u2019t come to fruition, but we wanted to bucket it on the low end just to be cautious.\nSteve Tusa: Yes, got it.\nEd Breen: I mean, Steve, it would be more a global recession scenario. So we\u2019re just bracketing it. But I would point you to the midpoint of our guidance is we\u2019re obviously trying to zero in at.\nSteve Tusa: Yes, that\u2019s where we are anyway. I saw some news on an employment contract. I got a lot going on this morning. But can you just maybe give us a little bit of color there for you?\nEd Breen: Yes, Steve. So I had a contract in place, I think it was a 3-year contract that ends at the end of this calendar year. And a question I get pretty frequently from investors is that your retirement date because that\u2019s when your contract expires. So the Board and I wanted to take that off the table. I\u2019m going to continue employment after the end of the year. And I don\u2019t need a contract anymore because some of the stipulations were back in from the DowDuPont days. And so I\u2019m just an at-will employee, but excited to continue after the end of the year.\nSteve Tusa: Okay, great. Thanks a lot, guys.\nEd Breen: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nVincent Andrews: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. You guys had really strong pricing in 2022, obviously, to get after that $800 million of inflation. How do we think about that price cost relationship in \u201823? Presumably, there\u2019ll be parts of your business that will hopefully see some deflation, and then maybe wages and stuff are still a headwind. But how should we be thinking about carryover pricing into \u201823? And how you\u2019ll manage pricing where you might see some deflation?\nEd Breen: Yes. So we haven\u2019t seen any positive impact yet in our numbers, but I would expect on the logistics and freight side, maybe we will start to see something towards the end of the second quarter there. We\u2019ve baked very little into our 2023 business plan for any benefit from price cost A. little bit is in the second half of the year. But not much when we start to see it, we will highlight it obviously and look at our forecast again. But I mean, obviously, it looks like some of these roles are going to start to come down here and again, see some benefit from the extreme freight rates in the middle of last year. But again, we\u2019ve baked very little of that in so far.\nLori Koch: Yes. And from a price \u2013 carryover price perspective, we do see a little bit in Q1 in the low single-digit range and then it pretty well waned as we lap. The significance of the price increases that we drove happened in Q1 of last year. So you\u2019ll pretty well lap that in the first quarter.\nVincent Andrews: Okay. And then, Lori, just a follow-up, do you have a sort of rough guide for free cash flow conversion for \u201823? I mean it\u2019s very clear there was a lot of moving parts and noise in the \u201822 number. But how are you thinking about \u201823 at this point?\nLori Koch: Yes. Obviously, 2022, as you had mentioned, was noisy with the transaction cost, coupled also with the supply chain environment that caused us to hold more inventory than what we normally would. So we don\u2019t see that repeating. Obviously, on the transaction side from that perspective and the working capital situation should get better. So we should target to be at that 90% conversion range that we target for the full company. So you can use kind of the midpoint of guide that we had provided and a calculated into a number, making sure that you contemplate that roughly $150 million to $200 million in transaction costs that are primarily associated with some straggling carryover from the M&M separation and then the Delrin Divestiture.\nEd Breen: We did start to bring inventory down in the fourth quarter. So we\u2019re going to start hopefully trending here. Now the supply chains are kind of moving back to sort of normal.\nVincent Andrews: Okay. Great. Good news. Thank you.\nEd Breen: Thanks, Vincent.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson from Mizuho. Your line is open.\nChristopher Parkinson: Great. Thank you so much. You posted pretty solid results, water, protection, specifically in water and safety. Can you just go over some of the guide framework you hit on a lot on E&I? Can you get on some of the guide framework as it pertains to W&P and just speak about kind of what\u2019s driving that and as well as the sustainability as we think throughout \u201823 and even into \u201824? Thank you so much.\nLori Koch: Yes. From an organic basis, we will continue to see strength within water. So we had really nice performance in the water segment in general in 2022 with organic sales up kind of high single digits, and we would expect a similar performance this year. The one end market that will be weak for us, as Ed had mentioned, is Shelter. So in the first quarter, we do see Shelter down kind of in the mid-teens, that will moderate as you go \u2013 as you go through the year, is down into the mid-single digits potentially on a full year basis. But we don\u2019t see a full recovery in shelter within the 2023 timeframe. And then generally, in safety, those are industrial end markets for the most part, minus maybe a little bit of destocking that\u2019s happening at some of the big distributors that should generally perform in line with industrial production on a full year basis.\nEd Breen: Yes. And on the Shelter side, remember, there is seasonality in that business. So the first quarter is usually the lowest that we\u2019ve planned kind of a recession scenario for construction throughout the whole year, but then you will get some seasonality lift as you\u2019re in the middle of the year, just naturally off of a tougher bottom, but.\nChristopher Parkinson: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And then you also hit on some remarks regarding just the Delrin timing and just how do we think about that? Do you have anything else that you\u2019d be comfortable adding at this time in terms of just the process, where you stand, your confidence level versus a few quarters ago? That would be very helpful. Thank you so much.\nEd Breen: Yes. So we\u2019ve done all the clean room work that\u2019s all set. We\u2019ve been doing some education on the business externally. If I had to kind of guess at this point, I think we\u2019re going to launch more formally at the end of this quarter that we\u2019re now in. We think the markets are better than they were in the fourth quarter. There is probably strategic and private equity interest. So that\u2019s why we are being careful on the timing. And so my gut is we will launch around them. And the business looks like it\u2019s having a pretty decent first quarter as we can see it right now. So I think that the timing might be good there. And we should be able to wrap up a deal fairly quickly in that business. So it\u2019s not that complicated. So that\u2019s why we made the comment that we should be able to close that, obviously, in 2023.\nChristopher Parkinson: Very helpful. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead from Barclays. Your line is open.\nMike Leithead: Great. Thank you. Good morning.\nEd Breen: Good morning, Mike.\nMike Leithead: First, I just wanted to go back and talk about the expected cadence for full year earnings. It sounds like kind of reading between the lines, you\u2019re indicating late in 2Q things start to pick up, inflect in electronics and some input deflation. So should we model a pickup really starting in the second quarter? Or does the recovery begin more notably in the third quarter in your view?\nEd Breen: You\u2019ll get some lift in the second quarter, and I would say, predominantly because of China coming back kind of online, if I should say it that way. So I would model \u2013 we\u2019ve given you the first quarter. I would model some sequential improvement, but the bulk of it would be the third and fourth quarter. And again, it lays out. We think the middle of the second quarter, the ICS business start, the fab start ramping up. So most of that benefit, you\u2019ll see third and fourth quarter, a little bit in the second quarter. And then we don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not planning on semi picking up until the third quarter. Maybe it will happen in the middle of the second quarter, but somewhere in that ZIP code. And so you get a little bit of China uplift, maybe a little on ICS. But again, planning mostly third quarter for that. Maybe a little in semi. But again, planning more third quarter for that. So I think you can kind of build that out. to get to kind of maybe our midpoint that we\u2019ve guided to for the year.\nMike Leithead: Great. That\u2019s super helpful. And then quickly, just a second question just on M&A. we have seen a few transactions start to pick up a bit as of late. Can you just talk about are you seeing some of the potential acquisition size?\nEd Breen: Yes. We are looking at a couple of things we have been interested in. Of my \u2013 my gut is we will do a bolt-on acquisition this year, but that\u2019s not a given. We are in no rush. We want to get it at the right price. So, we will see. But we are definitely looking and zero in on a couple of things. But I will put them more on the bolt-on size, from a spend category, and it would clearly be in one of our growth pillars where we have the expertise. And what we really want to do is pick up innovation and R&D and technologies in core areas to build out a couple of the platforms.\nMike Leithead: Great. Thank you.\nEd Breen: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nAleksey Yefremov: Thank you and good morning everyone. In E&I, you are discussing several new products launched in both interconnect and semiconductor technologies. So, I wonder how are your customers looking at adoption of new technologies, things like new nodes for your fab customers, is it getting pushed out or there is policy interaction on that?\nLori Koch: No. I mean, the interaction still remain very robust and they are a key portion of our delivery of top line growth, especially within semi. So, we would still expect that 200 basis points to 300 basis point outperformance versus the end markets and the discussions are still very frequent and common for us to be able to continue to drive that relationship.\nEd Breen: Yes. I mean \u2013 and let\u2019s keep in mind that when the semi thing picks up for the second half of the year on the next decade looks pretty incredible for the semi business. You see all the announcements on the fabs. Almost all of these fabs are the denser small or high end chips. And that\u2019s why we, as Lori just mentioned, we get the 200 basis point to 300 basis point overgrowth from the market is because we get to participate more and more on the advanced node side. So, the \u2013 we are going to have a couple of soft quarters here, but the outlook over the next decade is pretty incredible in this space. So, we stay very much up on the R&D, and we are very close to the top semiconductor customers doing design and work with them.\nAleksey Yefremov: Thanks a lot.\nEd Breen: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Spector from UBS. Your line is open.\nJosh Spector: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just your guidance doesn\u2019t appear to really factor in any further buybacks beyond the ASR you have ongoing. I was just wondering if you could talk about your willingness to either deploy that additional $2 billion on top of the ASR immediately following. How you are thinking about when that plays into your framework?\nLori Koch: Yes. So, the guide does contemplate starting potentially another ASR when this was one is completed like the beginning of the fourth quarter. So, our guidance that we provided for EPS has a reduction in the full year versus the first quarter outlook, and that reflects getting started on that second tranche of $2 billion that we have remaining on the authorization. But we also have the ability to still purchase over the top on the existing ASR should we feel it prudent. So, we have some volume that we can purchase as needed while the current ASR is open. Generally, you try to keep your volume under 15% of daily purchases, so that you don\u2019t work against yourself and our current contracts on the ASR allow us to do a little bit over the top.\nEd Breen: Josh, as a reminder, Page 16 of our slide deck has some additional modeling guidance, including share count, but don\u2019t miss the fact that we took quite a few shares out in the fourth quarter associated with the ASR that was enacted in mid-November. So, you may have been missing that effect in the fourth quarter and then the guide for \u201823 on the year-over-year.\nJosh Spector: No. Got it. I appreciate that. And just Ed, I guess a follow-up on the contract you have in place to keep going beyond this year. I guess it\u2019s become a bigger question for investors around long-term transition planning. So, I guess where would you say you and the Board are in terms of thinking about kind of the next step for DuPont, maybe it\u2019s multiple years out, but where are we in that process?\nEd Breen: Yes. The Board is well aware of internal candidates being developed and continuing to go through their career. So, we \u2013 the Board is clearly aware of who internally is an option for the next CEO role. But we are also not at that point, but we do discuss it regularly in the development plans for the internal candidates. So, I will just leave it at that.\nJosh Spector: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you. Ed, you didn\u2019t mention the U.S.-China trade technology restrictions, including the new Huawei controls. Is that an immaterial issue for DuPont?\nEd Breen: Yes, it\u2019s 50 \u2013 John, the reason we didn\u2019t \u2013 I know we mentioned it last quarter, but it\u2019s about $50 million to $60 million of revenue. So, it\u2019s not that significant, though. But we did bake that obviously into our forecasting that we did. And so whether you can take that as \u2013 you can extract that down to EBITDA, it\u2019s not that big in the scheme of things. But that\u2019s definitely in place, yes.\nLori Koch: Yes. And that\u2019s on that Ed said on the direct Huawei exposure, there is really not much there. So, we don\u2019t have exposure there.\nEd Breen: Right, that $50 million to $60 million is semi.\nLori Koch: Yes.\nJohn Roberts: Can you remind us when the first PFAS trial is scheduled and any update on the negotiations there?\nEd Breen: Yes. John, it\u2019s scheduled in June of this year. And we have ongoing conversations for a settlement. By the way, I think having a \u2013 the judge appointed a mediator, I think that was around the time we did last earnings call, if I remember. And I would say that\u2019s very helpful to the process. So, I will leave it there.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nArun Viswanathan: Thanks for taking my question. Just kind of understanding kind of the back half cadence and you will be exiting the year on. So, if you think about the guidance you offered, does it look like maybe the back half is kind of at a run rate basis, maybe at the upper end or maybe at the middle end of the range, say, Q3, Q4 averaging close to $1 or \u2013 and what is it going to take to really get to that kind of level of earnings power? Is it mainly a macro recovery, or are there other levers within your control that you can leverage? Thanks.\nLori Koch: Yes. So, you are pretty well spot on the second half EPS trajectory, and it really is all impingent upon the pace of the recovery in the end markets that we highlighted. So, seeing the semi destock and the demand return, seeing the smartphone and consumer electronics destock stop and the demand return. And then obviously, the continued China reopening will have a positive impact on our business. So, that impacted us in December and it will impact us on Q1 as they continue their reopening. But remember, we have got 20% of our sales into China. So, a nice opportunity as they continue to recover from the full COVID lockdown. So, it\u2019s really that the shift between the first half and the second half is really all from the top line and expected to recover\u2026\nEd Breen: Yes. And you get, sorry Chris, you do get a nice lift in margins and it benefits from mix in part. I mean as E&I comes back, remember, you have got a nice margin lift. So, you are kind of in the mid-24s on a margin in the first half and then you are up in the low to mid-25s in the second half, again benefiting from that mix and the timing of that E&I rebound from first half to second half. So, you end up averaging. The overall margins for the year end up being relatively flat, but there is a nice lift on a run rate basis when you are in the second half there.\nArun Viswanathan: And just as a follow-up then, if you look at \u201824, you will be facing easier comps, especially in the first half in E&I. Do we return kind of to a double-digit EPS growth rate in \u201824? Again, would you be inclined to increase the repurchase activity to reach that level if needed? Thanks.\nLori Koch: Yes. I mean I think it\u2019s a little early to start looking at \u201824. Obviously, this should \u2013 we have got nice EPS growth from the capital allocation decisions that we have made, and we will see that carry into 2024 as well because the second piece of the existing authorization really won\u2019t be put in place until the fourth quarter. So, you won\u2019t get the full benefit on a full year basis from that. But yes, in a normal environment, we should drive really nice top and bottom line growth. We have got end markets that would suggest in total, you would be in that mid-single digit range on the top line if they perform in a normal macro perspective. And then I think we have proven that we do a really nice job of driving margin improvement and leverage across the P&L. So, we wouldn\u2019t see any material change there from that dynamic.\nArun Viswanathan: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nBhavesh Lodaya: Hi. Good morning Ed and team. This is Bhavesh Lodaya for John. In your guide, you have a cautious outlook on the construction end markets pretty much throughout the year. Is there a way to quantify what the year-over-year EBITDA impact is from the downturn? And then I realize it\u2019s early, but when do you expect to get more clarity on a potential trajectory of recovery there?\nLori Koch: Yes. So, for the Shelter segment, it\u2019s about 13% of sales. And we had mentioned on a full year basis, we would expect that to be down mid-single digits. And we have sized the EBITDA margin profile of shelter as below the W&P segment average. So, I think we have given you several data points there that you can back into what we believe the EBITDA headwind will be to W&P and the total company from shelter in 2023.\nBhavesh Lodaya: And then you highlighted cost \u2013 yes, sorry, please.\nLori Koch: You go ahead.\nBhavesh Lodaya: You highlighted cost control measures initiated during the fourth quarter and those clearly helped from the margin perspective. Is there a way to quantify the benefit? And do you need to do more of these in 2023, or maybe what\u2019s built into your guide around these?\nLori Koch: Yes. So, we took costs out in the fourth quarter. We opened a restructuring program. And under the restructuring program, we took about a $60 million charge. And a lot of that was to get after the stranded costs that we saw coming out of the completion of the M&M divestiture, and there also were some actions in the business is able to drive productivity. So, we have got further room under the restructuring program if we would need it to be able to continue to drive margin and the decremental margin that we target. As of now, there is really nothing planned or baked into the guide incrementally, but we have the flexibility as we need to.\nBhavesh Lodaya: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMike Sison: Hey. Good morning guys. Nice end of the quarter. Nice end of the year. In terms of your outlook for construction, I mean are you hearing from your customers now that their backlogs are really weak at the end of the second half, or is it just more planning for difficult environment that with high interest rates and such?\nEd Breen: Yes. It\u2019s just the planning at this point. And by the way, not to get overly optimistic, I heard a couple of homebuilders during this last quarter, actually reported numbers that were kind of nicely better than were expected with decent backlog, actually. So, I think it\u2019s mixed out there. I think certain regions of the country, if you look at the detail, are doing better, in construction, some of the Southeast and Southwest areas. But having said that, again, we are also in a deleveraging mode here right now. And remember, some of our construction materials go into big box for do-it-yourself stuff and there is clearly destocking going on there. So, that part of it will end. But we have just planned look with interest rates where they are at the macro on the shelter business right now, just assume the whole year stays at about the level it\u2019s at. And Lori mentioned the percentages. So, I think it\u2019s just prudent planning on our part.\nMike Sison: Got it. And then for E&I, it does seem like you need some volume growth in the second half to hit the midpoint. How much of that is from new products and some of your innovation that you have done and maybe wins on new nodes and memory?\nEd Breen: Well, let me just give you, overall, our new products are \u2013 that have been launched in the last few years or like 30% of our sales. So, we track that very, very closely. We are constantly bringing out new versions, I would say, of our technology all the time. And that\u2019s what keeps us ahead of the pack on, for instance, the advanced nodes in semi. And as \u2013 so it\u2019s constantly happened. But I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s not going to have a material effect on where our revenue ends up. That\u2019s just a month-by-month that happens.\nLori Koch: Yes. I think I mean back to the outperformance that we highlighted. So, currently the full year MSI expectations are in the down mid-single digit range, obviously vary dramatically by the quarters with the first quarter starting at it, down kind of low-double digits. But our expectations opposite that full year down low-single digit MSI number or down mid-single digit MSI number would be to be down low-single digits. So, we would still expect that outperformance by the innovation engine that we have that allows us to be able to be more exposed to the high-end nodes and continuing to build relationships with those customers.\nEd Breen: And that, again, that low mid-single digits for MSI is very negative in the first quarter and build during the year, and it gets positive in the back half of the year, which we believe that also having talked to our semi customers.\nMike Sison: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you. Ed and Laurie, how should we think of \u2013 in E&I, how should we think about incremental margins in the back half of the year?\nLori Koch: Yes. We would expect in the back half of the year, the overall EBITDA margins to be more in that 31%-ish range that we would expect from the E&I perspective. So, they will be a little bit muted in the first half and we would expect a return from the EBITDA margin profile in the second half.\nDavid Begleiter: So, what is implied for incrementals in the back half of the year, mid-30s or higher?\nLori Koch: A little higher, yes, mid-30s, maybe upper-30s incremental margins. They shouldn\u2019t be too different than the \u2013 obviously, the gross margin you would see within the E&I segment.\nDavid Begleiter: Understood. And just in W&P, what drives earnings higher in \u201823?\nLori Koch: I mean I think if you see a little bit of deflation that would drive earnings higher, we had mentioned in 2022 and the current expectation for 2023 is, there is about a 100 basis point headwind from net price cost. We haven\u2019t baked any material benefit in from that perspective. So, that would be one tailwind that would help to drive the EBITDA margins higher. And then the other would just come within E&I mix enrichment. So, the quicker recovery in summary, that\u2019s obviously our highest margin segment. So, that would help as well to drive the E&I margins.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you.\nOperator: And the last question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Your line is open.\nFrank Mitsch: Thank you so much for squeezing me in under wire. I appreciate the granularity on China, your expectation that you are going to see a pickup by the mid-second quarter. But just curious, what are you seeing here real time post Chinese New Year in terms of economic activity there?\nLori Koch: Yes. I mean obviously, we can see January is also a little hard to see through given the timing of Lunar New Year. So, this year, it was full in January, last year full in February, so it makes it a little bit different from a year-over-year comp perspective. But the reopening is definitely happening. Right now, I think the benefit of the reopening is more on the essential side. So, spend is more towards those essential needs, and we would need it to obviously tend over to the discretionary needs that we would expect to see as you get further into the first half. But definitely, the lockdown appears to be well behind them and they are returning to some form of normalcy.\nFrank Mitsch: Very helpful. And if I could stick to the geographic theme, your year-over-year volume declines in Europe moderated from the third quarter here in the fourth quarter. So, I am just curious as to what are you seeing on the ground in that part of the world and what your expectations are for \u201823 over in Europe?\nLori Koch: Yes. So, Europe does feel a little bit better as they get the concerns around the access to energy behind them. And obviously, the energy rates or it\u2019s a tailwind for everybody. So, you have seen a really material pullback in the European natural gas rates. And so we are cautiously optimistic on Europe and the continued benefit there. For a full year basis, we are still generally flat for overall volumes in Europe. We will see how that trends as the year plays out.\nFrank Mitsch: Very helpful. Thank you. \nEd Breen: I think \u2013 is a big part of how that plays out because of water [ph] in Europe is fairly significant.\nFrank Mitsch: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And this ends our question-and-answer session. Mr. Chris Mecray, I will turn the call back over to you for some final closing comments.\nChris Mecray: Yes. Thanks everybody for joining our call. We appreciate your participation and for your reference, and a transcript will be posted on our website. This does conclude our call. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Lori Koch",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed and good morning. The quality of our portfolio was highlighted this quarter as strong top line results across the majority of our business lines offset weaker conditions in consumer electronics and construction. The global economy remains challenging, but our team's focus on execution drove solid fourth quarter earnings growth and operating EBITDA margin expansion against the prior year period. Turning to our financial highlights on Slide 6, fourth quarter net sales of $3.1 billion decreased 4% as reported and increased 5% on an organic basis versus the year ago period. Global currency volatility resulted in a 5% headwind from U.S. dollar strength against key currencies, most notably the yen, yuan and euro. We also saw a 4% portfolio headwind driven by the impact of non-core divestitures. Breaking down the 5% organic sales growth, 7% pricing gains were partially offset by 2% volume declines. Continued strength in water solutions and over 20% volume gains in auto adhesives were more than offset by further softening in smartphones and personal computing within interconnect solutions, a slowdown in semiconductor and construction market, as well as continued lower year-over-year volume from Tyvek protective garments within safety solutions. As we exited the year, we saw lower volumes in areas we have highlighted with total December organic sales up 2% year-over-year, including down high single-digits in China, driven by acceleration of COVID disruptions and low single-digit organic sales growth in the U.S. and Canada due to muted demand in construction and destocking by customers. From an earnings perspective, operating EBITDA of $758 million increased 1% versus the year ago period despite currency headwinds and the impact of portfolio. Organic earnings growth was driven by pricing and disciplined cost control, which more than offset inflationary cost pressure and lower volumes, including the impact of production rates. Operating EBITDA margin during the quarter of 24.4% increased 120 basis points versus the year ago period. Adjusted EPS in the quarter of $0.89 per share increased 16%, which I will detail shortly. Cash used in operations during the quarter of $126 million, less capital expenditures of $185 million and transaction-related adjustments totaling $213 million resulted in a free cash outflow of $98 million. The transaction-related adjustments consist of $163 million termination fee related to the intended Rogers acquisition, with the remainder from a tax prepayment for the M&M divestiture. Further headwinds to free cash flow during the quarter included transaction costs related to closing the M&M deal of about $200 million and an approximately $100 million cash outflow related to prepaid accounts payable in advance of the M&M deal closing, which was subsequently reimbursed to us at closing and reported as an inflow within investing activities. I call out these items to provide visibility into our underlying cash flow performance. Additionally, free cash flow included a working capital benefit during the quarter of about $120 million related to inventory reductions resulting both from our productivity efforts and from our decision to slow production in certain lines of business given the lower volume environment. Turning to Slide 7, adjusted EPS for the quarter of $0.89 per share increased 16% compared to $0.77 per share in the year ago period. The strong EPS growth came primarily from below-the-line items as organic earnings from our ongoing businesses were mostly offset by the absence of earnings from non-core divestitures as well as currency headwinds. Ongoing share repurchase continues to drive earnings per share growth, providing a $0.07 benefit to adjusted EPS. Lower net interest expense provided a $0.05 benefit to adjusted EPS, driven by both interest income resulting from additional cash on hand from the M&M divestiture and also lower interest expense resulting from the pay-down of $2.5 billion of senior notes during the quarter. Our tax rate for the quarter was 22.2%, up notably from 18.6% in the year ago period, resulting in a $0.06 tax headwind to adjusted EPS driven primarily by geographic mix of earnings and currency. Our full year base tax rate for 2022 was 23.2% and our 2023 outlook assumes a base tax rate in the range of 23% to 24%. Turning to Slide 8. Just to note a few metrics on a full year basis, net sales of $13 billion in 2022 increased 4% for the full year. On an organic basis, full year sales increased 8% due to a 7% increase in price and a 1% increase in volume. W&T and E&I delivered organic sales growth of 11% and 5% respectively and net sales in all four regions increased organically. Further, we delivered high single-digits or better organic sales growth in 5 of our 6 lines of business as well as in the retained businesses within corporate led by auto adhesives. Interconnect Solutions was the only business line down organically due to the slowdown in smartphones and personal computing since last summer. Full year operating EBITDA of $3.26 billion increased 3% due primarily to volume gains as pricing gains were mostly offset by continued pressure associated with higher raw material, logistics and energy costs. Operating EBITDA margin was flat at 25.1%, inclusive of price cost headwind of about 150 basis points. Full year adjusted EPS of $3.41 per share increased 12% versus 2021. The increase was driven by a lower share count from share repurchases, higher segment earnings and lower net interest expense, which was partially offset by a higher tax rate. Cash flow from operations for the year of $588 million, less capital expenditures of $743 million and transaction-related adjustments totaling $328 million for items that I mentioned earlier, resulted in free cash flow for the year of $173 million. Full year discrete headwinds included in free cash flow totaled about $650 million, which mainly reflect transaction costs. Turning to segment results, beginning with E&I on Slide 9. E&I fourth quarter net sales decreased 8% as organic sales declined 2%, along with currency and portfolio headwinds of 5% and 1% respectively. The organic sales decline reflects a 5% decrease in volumes, partially offset by a 3% increase in average price. The organic sales decrease for E&I was led by a 10% decline in Interconnect Solutions driven by volume linked with further weakening in smartphone, PC and tablet demand, along with channel inventory destocking and the negative impact of COVID-related disruptions in China. In Semiconductor Technologies, lower volumes resulted from reduced semi fab utilization rates due to weaker end market demand along with channel inventory destocking. End market weakness was seen mainly in smartphones and personal computing. In Industrial Solutions, volumes were muted as lower demand in consumer printing and weakness in LED silicones for conventional lighting in China more than offset ongoing strength in broad-based industrial end markets, including Best Bell product lines in aerospace and for applications in healthcare markets. Operating EBITDA for E&I of $407 million decreased 4% in the quarter as volume declines were partially offset by disciplined cost control with operating EBITDA margin up 150 basis points from the year ago period. For the full year, E&I net sales of $5.9 billion increased 7% versus 2021, up 5% on an organic basis as the portfolio benefit from last year's Laird acquisition was partially offset by currency headwinds. Organic sales growth for the year of 5% consisted of a 3% increase in volume and a 2% increase in price. From a line of business view, organic sales growth was led by Semi Tech, up low double-digits and Industrial Solutions up high single-digits, partially offset by mid single-digit declines in Interconnect Solutions related to weakness in smartphones and personal computing end markets during the second half of 2022. Full year operating EBITDA of $1.8 billion increased 4% as volume gains, a full year of earnings associated with the Laird acquisition and higher pricing more than offset inflationary cost pressure and weaker mix in interconnect. Turning to Slide 10, W&P fourth quarter net sales increased 6% as organic sales growth of 12% was partially offset by a 6% currency headwind. Organic growth reflects broad-based pricing actions taken across the segment to offset cost inflation as WP volumes were flat. Organic sales growth was led by Water Solutions, which increased over 20% on strong global demand for water technologies, led by reverse osmosis membrane as well as capacity increases and pricing gains. Water continues to be an area of consistent strength with long-term top line growth expectations in the mid to high single digits. Sales for Safety Solutions were up high single digits on an organic basis as pricing actions were somewhat offset by lower Tyvek volumes given the demand shift from garments to other applications and the resulting impact of line changeovers on production efficiency. Excluding the year-over-year garment headwind, total W&P volumes increased approximately 2% in the quarter. In Shelter Solutions, sales were up high single digits on an organic basis as pricing gains were partially offset by volume declines primarily in North America construction. Operating EBITDA for W&P of $360 million increased 11% as pricing actions and disciplined cost control more than offset inflationary cost pressures and currency headwinds with operating EBITDA margin up 100 basis points from the year ago period. For the full year, W&P net sales of $6 billion increased 7% versus 2021 as organic growth of 11%, partially offset by a 4% currency headwind. Organic sales growth for the year consisted of a 12% increase in price, slightly offset by a 1% volume decline. Excluding the year-over-year garment headwinds, total W&P volumes increased 2% for the year. From a line of business view, organic sales growth was driven by mid-teens growth in Shelter Solutions, low teens growth in Water Solutions and high single-digit growth in Safety Solutions. Full year operating EBITDA of $1.4 billion increased 3% as higher pricing and disciplined cost more than offset inflationary cost pressure as well as currency headwinds. I'll close with a few comments on our financial outlook and guidance for 2023 on Slide 11. We expect solid top line growth trends to continue into 2023 in businesses such as water and auto adhesives as well as stable demand across diversified industrial end markets, including aerospace and healthcare. We do, however, anticipate lower volumes during the first half of 2023 in consumer electronics and semiconductors, resulting from decreased consumer spending, inventory destocking and COVID-related impacts in China, largely within E&I. We also expect ongoing softness in construction end markets within W&T during 2023. For the first quarter of 2023, we anticipate continued weakness in these consumer-driven short-cycle end markets, resulting in a first quarter net sales expectation of about $2.9 billion or down mid-single digits on an organic basis versus the year ago period. As 2023 progresses, we assume stabilization of consumer electronics demand, normalization of customer inventory levels and improved China demand to drive sequential quarterly improvement in operating results, most notably in the second half of the year. Within the Interconnect Solutions business, where the printed circuit board market has been down since mid-2022. We anticipate that channel destocking and customer production rates begin to improve during the second quarter. Within semiconductor technologies, fab utilization rates are also expected to bottom during the first half of this year and improve around midyear. As a result of these assumptions, coupled with expectation of improvement in China across our product lines, we expect full year 2023 net sales to be between $12.3 billion and $12.9 billion. In response to the expected lower volume environment, we are focused on minimizing decremental margin impacts. To achieve this, we are focused on the operational levers within our control, including appropriate actions to increase productivity at our plant sites, reduce discretionary spending and realization of savings enabled by cost actions initiated during the fourth quarter. For first quarter 2023, we expect operating EBITDA of about $710 million. For full year 2023, we expect operating EBITDA to be between $3 billion and $3.3 billion, expecting to hold full year operating EBITDA margin flat at the midpoint of the ranges provided compared to last year. These same midpoints imply a decremental margin of 27% for the full year despite a mixed headwind resulting from volume pressure in our higher-margin business, mainly semi. Our first quarter adjusted EPS expectation of about $0.80 per share and full year adjusted EPS guidance range of between $3.50 and $4 per share assumes continued growth from below-the-line benefits related to a lower share count and lower interest expense. The midpoint of our full year adjusted EPS guidance implies growth of 10% versus last year, driven by these benefits from our ongoing capital allocation strategy. With that, we are pleased to take your questions, let me turn it back to the operator to open the Q&A. Yes. If I can just add to, we referenced the market research inventory index for semi to get an understanding of what inventory exists in the channel. And right now, usually, it says it kind of goes into surplus mode when the inventory index is above 1.2. We're looking to be in that \u2013 butting up against the 1.2 as we close the first quarter. And the second quarter to our earlier point is the peak where it gets a little bit higher than 1.2, and then it starts to come back down. For reference, back at the last semi downturn in the late 2018, 2019 downstream, it was much higher. So it doesn't feel like we have the same dynamics going on at what we had back then. But it does feel like there is more in the channel than where we were definitely last year at this time, we were kind of at a below one level with respect to the inventory index. Thank you. Yes. So the low end on both the top and bottom line really assumes not much improvement coming out of Q1. So a little bit mainly driven by seasonality, but not a lot of recovery in the end markets that we had spoke about. So it is more on the pessimistic side. We believe a lot of indicators that we're seeing and the conversations that we're having with our customers would suggest that wouldn't come to fruition, but we wanted to bucket it on the low end just to be cautious. Yes. And from a price \u2013 carryover price perspective, we do see a little bit in Q1 in the low single-digit range and then it pretty well waned as we lap. The significance of the price increases that we drove happened in Q1 of last year. So you'll pretty well lap that in the first quarter. Yes. Obviously, 2022, as you had mentioned, was noisy with the transaction cost, coupled also with the supply chain environment that caused us to hold more inventory than what we normally would. So we don't see that repeating. Obviously, on the transaction side from that perspective and the working capital situation should get better. So we should target to be at that 90% conversion range that we target for the full company. So you can use kind of the midpoint of guide that we had provided and a calculated into a number, making sure that you contemplate that roughly $150 million to $200 million in transaction costs that are primarily associated with some straggling carryover from the M&M separation and then the Delrin Divestiture. Yes. From an organic basis, we will continue to see strength within water. So we had really nice performance in the water segment in general in 2022 with organic sales up kind of high single digits, and we would expect a similar performance this year. The one end market that will be weak for us, as Ed had mentioned, is Shelter. So in the first quarter, we do see Shelter down kind of in the mid-teens, that will moderate as you go \u2013 as you go through the year, is down into the mid-single digits potentially on a full year basis. But we don't see a full recovery in shelter within the 2023 timeframe. And then generally, in safety, those are industrial end markets for the most part, minus maybe a little bit of destocking that's happening at some of the big distributors that should generally perform in line with industrial production on a full year basis. No. I mean, the interaction still remain very robust and they are a key portion of our delivery of top line growth, especially within semi. So, we would still expect that 200 basis points to 300 basis point outperformance versus the end markets and the discussions are still very frequent and common for us to be able to continue to drive that relationship. Yes. So, the guide does contemplate starting potentially another ASR when this was one is completed like the beginning of the fourth quarter. So, our guidance that we provided for EPS has a reduction in the full year versus the first quarter outlook, and that reflects getting started on that second tranche of $2 billion that we have remaining on the authorization. But we also have the ability to still purchase over the top on the existing ASR should we feel it prudent. So, we have some volume that we can purchase as needed while the current ASR is open. Generally, you try to keep your volume under 15% of daily purchases, so that you don't work against yourself and our current contracts on the ASR allow us to do a little bit over the top. Yes. And that's on that Ed said on the direct Huawei exposure, there is really not much there. So, we don't have exposure there. Yes. Yes. So, you are pretty well spot on the second half EPS trajectory, and it really is all impingent upon the pace of the recovery in the end markets that we highlighted. So, seeing the semi destock and the demand return, seeing the smartphone and consumer electronics destock stop and the demand return. And then obviously, the continued China reopening will have a positive impact on our business. So, that impacted us in December and it will impact us on Q1 as they continue their reopening. But remember, we have got 20% of our sales into China. So, a nice opportunity as they continue to recover from the full COVID lockdown. So, it's really that the shift between the first half and the second half is really all from the top line and expected to recover... Yes. I mean I think it's a little early to start looking at \u201824. Obviously, this should \u2013 we have got nice EPS growth from the capital allocation decisions that we have made, and we will see that carry into 2024 as well because the second piece of the existing authorization really won't be put in place until the fourth quarter. So, you won't get the full benefit on a full year basis from that. But yes, in a normal environment, we should drive really nice top and bottom line growth. We have got end markets that would suggest in total, you would be in that mid-single digit range on the top line if they perform in a normal macro perspective. And then I think we have proven that we do a really nice job of driving margin improvement and leverage across the P&L. So, we wouldn't see any material change there from that dynamic. Yes. So, for the Shelter segment, it's about 13% of sales. And we had mentioned on a full year basis, we would expect that to be down mid-single digits. And we have sized the EBITDA margin profile of shelter as below the W&P segment average. So, I think we have given you several data points there that you can back into what we believe the EBITDA headwind will be to W&P and the total company from shelter in 2023. You go ahead. Yes. So, we took costs out in the fourth quarter. We opened a restructuring program. And under the restructuring program, we took about a $60 million charge. And a lot of that was to get after the stranded costs that we saw coming out of the completion of the M&M divestiture, and there also were some actions in the business is able to drive productivity. So, we have got further room under the restructuring program if we would need it to be able to continue to drive margin and the decremental margin that we target. As of now, there is really nothing planned or baked into the guide incrementally, but we have the flexibility as we need to. Yes. I think I mean back to the outperformance that we highlighted. So, currently the full year MSI expectations are in the down mid-single digit range, obviously vary dramatically by the quarters with the first quarter starting at it, down kind of low-double digits. But our expectations opposite that full year down low-single digit MSI number or down mid-single digit MSI number would be to be down low-single digits. So, we would still expect that outperformance by the innovation engine that we have that allows us to be able to be more exposed to the high-end nodes and continuing to build relationships with those customers. Yes. We would expect in the back half of the year, the overall EBITDA margins to be more in that 31%-ish range that we would expect from the E&I perspective. So, they will be a little bit muted in the first half and we would expect a return from the EBITDA margin profile in the second half. A little higher, yes, mid-30s, maybe upper-30s incremental margins. They shouldn't be too different than the \u2013 obviously, the gross margin you would see within the E&I segment. I mean I think if you see a little bit of deflation that would drive earnings higher, we had mentioned in 2022 and the current expectation for 2023 is, there is about a 100 basis point headwind from net price cost. We haven't baked any material benefit in from that perspective. So, that would be one tailwind that would help to drive the EBITDA margins higher. And then the other would just come within E&I mix enrichment. So, the quicker recovery in summary, that's obviously our highest margin segment. So, that would help as well to drive the E&I margins. Yes. I mean obviously, we can see January is also a little hard to see through given the timing of Lunar New Year. So, this year, it was full in January, last year full in February, so it makes it a little bit different from a year-over-year comp perspective. But the reopening is definitely happening. Right now, I think the benefit of the reopening is more on the essential side. So, spend is more towards those essential needs, and we would need it to obviously tend over to the discretionary needs that we would expect to see as you get further into the first half. But definitely, the lockdown appears to be well behind them and they are returning to some form of normalcy. Yes. So, Europe does feel a little bit better as they get the concerns around the access to energy behind them. And obviously, the energy rates or it's a tailwind for everybody. So, you have seen a really material pullback in the European natural gas rates. And so we are cautiously optimistic on Europe and the continued benefit there. For a full year basis, we are still generally flat for overall volumes in Europe. We will see how that trends as the year plays out."

            "name": "Ed Breen",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial review. We posted strong quarterly top and bottom line results in line with our previously communicated guidance in an uneven global economy. Fourth quarter revenue included a 5% organic growth versus the year ago period, strong volume in water and auto adhesives, as well as ongoing strength in industrial end markets such as healthcare and aerospace, helped mitigate volume declines in consumer electronics end markets and softening conditions in North American construction markets. Strong pricing growth in the quarter reflects actions taken largely prior to the fourth quarter to offset persistent inflationary pressures in raw materials, logistics and energy. We sold over $800 million in year-over-year inflation headwinds for full year 2022. We delivered year-over-year operating EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter despite a slight volume decline, currency headwinds and the impact of portfolio divestitures. We also saw a margin improvement of 120 basis points, demonstrating solid operational execution and focus on items we can control within the highly diverse end markets where we participate. The closing of the M&M sale was a milestone event in the fourth quarter and our last contemplated large-scale divestiture. The transaction further transforms our portfolio to concentrate in more stable, secular, higher growth and higher margin end markets. As you can see on Slide 4, our transformation actions have significantly strengthened our balance sheet, increased our financial flexibility and positioned the company to continue to generate shareholder value through disciplined capital allocation. Following the M&M sale, we acted quickly in accelerating return of capital to shareholders. We authorized a new $5 billion share repurchase program in November and launched an accelerated share repurchase transaction for $3.25 billion of common stock, allowing the retirement of about 39 million common shares in the fourth quarter. We anticipate completing this ASR in the third quarter of 2023 and plan to execute share repurchases under the planned remaining authorization as soon as we can. In the quarter, we also retired $2.5 billion of long-term debt, which is due to mature in November 2023 and reduced our commercial paper balance to zero as of year end. The long-term debt retirement reduced refinancing risk and generated pre-tax annualized interest expense savings of approximately $100 million. We also announced today an increase in our quarterly dividend of $0.36 per share or a 9% increase versus last year. Going forward, we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of between 35% and 45% and expect to increase our dividend annually alongside earnings growth. In total, we deployed more than $7.5 billion of capital in 2022 through significant share repurchases, deleveraging and dividend payments, which reflects our overall balanced capital allocation strategy. We exited the year in a favorable balance sheet and liquidity position and we look to further allocate excess capital over time to max on value creation through both opportunistic M&A and incremental share repurchases. Our M&A focus remains on targets that fit within our growth pillars and are aligned with key secular growth trends that we have highlighted. Further, our disciplined approach to portfolio management will ensure that DuPont focuses on growing businesses where we are the best strategic owner. Regarding the Delrin sale process, we continue to advance our internal work required to divest the business. We are being prudent with the deal process to ensure suitable market conditions and still expect to have a completed sale in 2023. Finally, we also continue to invest internally in innovation and incremental operating capacity to fuel and support our organic growth. In 2023, we expect to allocate CapEx at about 5% of sales as we wrap up some larger scale projects this year and we target R&D spending at about 4% of sales on a consolidated basis longer term, investing differentially within our business lines based on growth potential. Turning to Slide 5 before I hand it over to Lori, I want to thank our teams who remain focused on operational execution in a difficult environment, which allowed us to produce solid revenue and earnings growth this fish year. I also want to thank our teams for their continued efforts made during 2022 in transforming our portfolio. We are excited about the longer term growth potential of our business in its newly constituted form, centered around the secular high-growth pillars of electronics, water, protection, industrial technologies and next-generation automotive. Our end market mix is notably tilted towards electronics at about one-third of our portfolio. Within electronics, we have a key presence in consumer-based end markets, namely chips, films, displays and printed circuit board materials used in smartphones, PCs and tablets. The bulk of our remaining electronics exposure is in areas such as data centers and telecommunications as well as industrial and automotive applications, primarily consumables used in the semiconductor chip manufacturing process. Despite short-term volume pressure, we are pleased with our electronics market position and confident this exposure will help generate strong growth over time. Our presence in electronics is enviable, with higher margins versus the company average and a solid competitive position across the key products we supply. Likewise, our water business at 12% of our portfolio operates in markets that are expected to grow mid to high single-digits, driven by the global response to concerns such as water scarcity and circularity. Additionally, our participation in the auto market at about 13% of sales is much more connected to high-growth advanced technologies, enabling long-term secular trends like hybrid and electric vehicles for items such as battery applications. A solid portion of our auto exposure is aligned to EVs, which are growing at a significant pace. Given these and our equally strong market positions in many other end markets, including within our protection and industrial technologies pillars, we believe that our financial results over time will bear out the view that the new DuPont will grow and generate returns on par with the best industrial assets in the public markets. In response to near-term short-cycle end market slowing expected in the first half of 2023, we have been doing scenario planning for some time now and are proactively taking actions within our control to minimize volume impacts on margins. As a result, we expect to be able to show the resiliency of the new DuPont portfolio this year. I look forward to providing you with updates as we progress through 2023. With that, let me turn it over to Lori to review our financial performance and outlook. Good morning, Scott. Yes. So on ICS, as Lori just mentioned, Scott, that started its downturn actually middle of 2022. So that's been going through a downturn. It's obviously lower demand. And a lot of that lower demand, by the way, is China related lower demand because of COVID and lockdowns and all that. And so we have talked to our 10 largest PCP customers mainly in China, and it looks like they are going to begin their ramp in the second quarter. We're thinking more in the middle of the second quarter. And maybe to give you a couple of numbers behind it, their PCB fabs usually run in the high 70% utilization rate. They have been \u2013 they are all a little bit different, but they have been running kind of between 40% and 60% and they expect the second half of the second quarter to be kind of up to 60% to 65% and then ramp up from there. So that's what we're getting granularly on the ground. And of course, smartphones are supposed to pick up in 2023 from last year. And remember, the smartphones in China were down 20% last year. So it was just a big down. I mean nobody \u2013 none of the consumers were shopping. So I think just China coming back on its own from kind of this artificial COVID thing alone is going to help with demand. And remember, we're high on electronics in that market in general. So I think we will see a boost there. And then if we're right with our customers on the PCB side, we will start seeing that in the middle of the second quarter. And then on the semi side, I think that's pretty public knowledge. But those fabs were all running high, kind of 95%. They are now running in the low 80s. Now remember, a lot of that is destocking going on. Most of the chip guys are saying the biggest down quarter is the first quarter. We think it's the first and second quarter. So in our planning, as Lori mentioned, that's what we planned that we start seeing our ramp towards the end of the second quarter. And if you look at the MSI data, it's kind of minus 10 and then minus 12 versus the second quarter, and then it improves and gets actually positive in the fourth quarter. And then, of course, we will \u2013 our demand will happen slightly before that MSI number. So I think we \u2013 the way we laid it out, we're sequencing it properly. And by the way, maybe just to give you the rest of the landscape the way we put \u201823 together. We plan that the construction markets will be down all of 2023. And then pretty much every other business, we have all the industrial businesses will be stable in 2023 and the water business will grow mid to high single digits. So that's kind of a lay of the land of how we put it together. Thanks, Scott. Good to hear from you. Good morning, Steve. I mean, Steve, it would be more a global recession scenario. So we're just bracketing it. But I would point you to the midpoint of our guidance is we're obviously trying to zero in at. Yes, Steve. So I had a contract in place, I think it was a 3-year contract that ends at the end of this calendar year. And a question I get pretty frequently from investors is that your retirement date because that's when your contract expires. So the Board and I wanted to take that off the table. I'm going to continue employment after the end of the year. And I don't need a contract anymore because some of the stipulations were back in from the DowDuPont days. And so I'm just an at-will employee, but excited to continue after the end of the year. Thank you. Yes. So we haven't seen any positive impact yet in our numbers, but I would expect on the logistics and freight side, maybe we will start to see something towards the end of the second quarter there. We've baked very little into our 2023 business plan for any benefit from price cost A. little bit is in the second half of the year. But not much when we start to see it, we will highlight it obviously and look at our forecast again. But I mean, obviously, it looks like some of these roles are going to start to come down here and again, see some benefit from the extreme freight rates in the middle of last year. But again, we've baked very little of that in so far. We did start to bring inventory down in the fourth quarter. So we're going to start hopefully trending here. Now the supply chains are kind of moving back to sort of normal. Thanks, Vincent. Yes. And on the Shelter side, remember, there is seasonality in that business. So the first quarter is usually the lowest that we've planned kind of a recession scenario for construction throughout the whole year, but then you will get some seasonality lift as you're in the middle of the year, just naturally off of a tougher bottom, but. Yes. So we've done all the clean room work that's all set. We've been doing some education on the business externally. If I had to kind of guess at this point, I think we're going to launch more formally at the end of this quarter that we're now in. We think the markets are better than they were in the fourth quarter. There is probably strategic and private equity interest. So that's why we are being careful on the timing. And so my gut is we will launch around them. And the business looks like it's having a pretty decent first quarter as we can see it right now. So I think that the timing might be good there. And we should be able to wrap up a deal fairly quickly in that business. So it's not that complicated. So that's why we made the comment that we should be able to close that, obviously, in 2023. Good morning, Mike. You'll get some lift in the second quarter, and I would say, predominantly because of China coming back kind of online, if I should say it that way. So I would model \u2013 we've given you the first quarter. I would model some sequential improvement, but the bulk of it would be the third and fourth quarter. And again, it lays out. We think the middle of the second quarter, the ICS business start, the fab start ramping up. So most of that benefit, you'll see third and fourth quarter, a little bit in the second quarter. And then we don't \u2013 we're not planning on semi picking up until the third quarter. Maybe it will happen in the middle of the second quarter, but somewhere in that ZIP code. And so you get a little bit of China uplift, maybe a little on ICS. But again, planning mostly third quarter for that. Maybe a little in semi. But again, planning more third quarter for that. So I think you can kind of build that out. to get to kind of maybe our midpoint that we've guided to for the year. Yes. We are looking at a couple of things we have been interested in. Of my \u2013 my gut is we will do a bolt-on acquisition this year, but that's not a given. We are in no rush. We want to get it at the right price. So, we will see. But we are definitely looking and zero in on a couple of things. But I will put them more on the bolt-on size, from a spend category, and it would clearly be in one of our growth pillars where we have the expertise. And what we really want to do is pick up innovation and R&D and technologies in core areas to build out a couple of the platforms. Yes. Thank you. Yes. I mean \u2013 and let's keep in mind that when the semi thing picks up for the second half of the year on the next decade looks pretty incredible for the semi business. You see all the announcements on the fabs. Almost all of these fabs are the denser small or high end chips. And that's why we, as Lori just mentioned, we get the 200 basis point to 300 basis point overgrowth from the market is because we get to participate more and more on the advanced node side. So, the \u2013 we are going to have a couple of soft quarters here, but the outlook over the next decade is pretty incredible in this space. So, we stay very much up on the R&D, and we are very close to the top semiconductor customers doing design and work with them. Yes. Josh, as a reminder, Page 16 of our slide deck has some additional modeling guidance, including share count, but don't miss the fact that we took quite a few shares out in the fourth quarter associated with the ASR that was enacted in mid-November. So, you may have been missing that effect in the fourth quarter and then the guide for \u201823 on the year-over-year. Yes. The Board is well aware of internal candidates being developed and continuing to go through their career. So, we \u2013 the Board is clearly aware of who internally is an option for the next CEO role. But we are also not at that point, but we do discuss it regularly in the development plans for the internal candidates. So, I will just leave it at that. Yes, it's 50 \u2013 John, the reason we didn't \u2013 I know we mentioned it last quarter, but it's about $50 million to $60 million of revenue. So, it's not that significant, though. But we did bake that obviously into our forecasting that we did. And so whether you can take that as \u2013 you can extract that down to EBITDA, it's not that big in the scheme of things. But that's definitely in place, yes. Right, that $50 million to $60 million is semi. Yes. John, it's scheduled in June of this year. And we have ongoing conversations for a settlement. By the way, I think having a \u2013 the judge appointed a mediator, I think that was around the time we did last earnings call, if I remember. And I would say that's very helpful to the process. So, I will leave it there. Yes. And you get, sorry Chris, you do get a nice lift in margins and it benefits from mix in part. I mean as E&I comes back, remember, you have got a nice margin lift. So, you are kind of in the mid-24s on a margin in the first half and then you are up in the low to mid-25s in the second half, again benefiting from that mix and the timing of that E&I rebound from first half to second half. So, you end up averaging. The overall margins for the year end up being relatively flat, but there is a nice lift on a run rate basis when you are in the second half there. Yes. It's just the planning at this point. And by the way, not to get overly optimistic, I heard a couple of homebuilders during this last quarter, actually reported numbers that were kind of nicely better than were expected with decent backlog, actually. So, I think it's mixed out there. I think certain regions of the country, if you look at the detail, are doing better, in construction, some of the Southeast and Southwest areas. But having said that, again, we are also in a deleveraging mode here right now. And remember, some of our construction materials go into big box for do-it-yourself stuff and there is clearly destocking going on there. So, that part of it will end. But we have just planned look with interest rates where they are at the macro on the shelter business right now, just assume the whole year stays at about the level it's at. And Lori mentioned the percentages. So, I think it's just prudent planning on our part. Well, let me just give you, overall, our new products are \u2013 that have been launched in the last few years or like 30% of our sales. So, we track that very, very closely. We are constantly bringing out new versions, I would say, of our technology all the time. And that's what keeps us ahead of the pack on, for instance, the advanced nodes in semi. And as \u2013 so it's constantly happened. But I wouldn't say that it's not going to have a material effect on where our revenue ends up. That's just a month-by-month that happens. And that, again, that low mid-single digits for MSI is very negative in the first quarter and build during the year, and it gets positive in the back half of the year, which we believe that also having talked to our semi customers. I think \u2013 is a big part of how that plays out because of water [ph] in Europe is fairly significant."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to DuPont's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Please note, today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. Chris Mecray, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nChristopher Mecray: Good morning, and thank you for joining us for DuPont's Third Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining me today are Ed Breen, Chief Executive Officer; and Lori Koch, Chief Financial Officer. We have prepared slides to supplement our remarks which are posted on DuPont's website under the Investor Relations tab through the webcast link. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the slides.  During this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance or results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Our 2021 Form 10-K, as updated by our current and periodic reports, includes detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences.  Unless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today exclude significant items. We will also refer to other non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in our press release and also posted to DuPont's Investor Relations website.  I'll now turn the call over to Ed.\nEdward Breen: Good morning, and thank you for joining our third quarter financial review. We posted strong quarterly results, above our previously communicated guidance, in an extremely challenging environment due to uneven macro conditions and persistent inflation globally.  Our revenue growth of 4% versus the year ago period included solid organic growth of 11%. Customer demand remains strong across most of our key end markets, during the period, highlighted by double-digit volume increases in select areas, including Kalrez, Vespel, Laird, Semi, Water and Auto Adhesives.  To combat persistent inflationary headwinds in raw materials, logistics and energy, we continue to implement necessary pricing actions, which have fully offset such headwinds to date.  Given continued energy cost inflation, we now expect full year 2022 inflation of about $800 million year-over-year, which we anticipate will be fully offset by pricing actions.  Our third quarter results also demonstrated year-over-year operating EBITDA growth and margin improvement, reflecting DuPont's unique business mix, innovative solutions and highly diverse end markets as well as strong operational execution during the period. We are pleased to have reported strong performance during each of the first 3 quarters of 2022, and we remain firmly committed to continued strong execution in the coming periods.  Turning to Slide 4, I will comment on the details of our transformation progress. First, last week's announcement that we completed the sale of the majority of our M&M segment to Celanese marks the completion of our last contemplated large-scale divestiture for which we received $11 billion in gross cash. The M&M business is an excellent set of assets that we know will prosper, and we are confident that Celanese is the right owner going forward.  We are excited by the prospect of proving to the market that our multiyear transformation has brought DuPont to a truly different place. After the Dow merger, followed by the spins that created the new DuPont, we have further transformed our business with large-scale deals, including the N&B split-off and now the M&M transaction. We further sold 8 smaller businesses over the last 3 years, with proceeds totaling over $2 billion.  We are starting the next phase of our growth from a position of strength, leveraging highly profitable businesses with strong and leading market position centered in growing markets as well as a healthy balance sheet. These assets include some of the best intellectual property in their respective industry verticals with globally recognized brands familiar to us all as well as the thousands of long-time B2B industrial customers.  For DuPont, we are confident that our remaining mix of businesses offers a different dynamic with significantly lower volatility and higher expected long-term growth given our revenue mix. This is driven by a focus on secular tailwinds, including the 5G build-out and other electronics drivers, the global clean water infrastructure development, continued demand for safety and personal protection solutions, secular growth across multiple industrial technology verticals that we serve and from next-generation automotive growth. We believe we have built a portfolio that can perform alongside the best diversified industrial companies. Our businesses are aligned with secular growth trends, we deliver top-tier levels of profitability and we should clearly benefit from dampened business volatility compared to our portfolio from just a few years ago. These advantages are clear and will help us to generate superior shareholder value over time.  Regarding the Delrin divestiture process, we continue to advance our internal work required to divest that business. We are being diligent with our overall marketing process to ensure we maximize value in proper market conditions and expect to have completed a sale in 2023.  Before I move on, I'd like to briefly address the intended Rogers acquisition. We terminated this deal on November 1, which was the outside date of the transaction agreement originally signed a year ago. This was an unfortunate outcome in that the potential strategic fit of Rogers with our business was strong and we saw a lot of opportunity, but we're unable to secure regulatory approval for the transaction. We wish the Rogers team well.  For DuPont, the inability to close the acquisition has no material impact on our ongoing business outside of the obvious loss of opportunity. We remain confident in the quality of our portfolio and its growth potential, and we'll look to be opportunistic with select and targeted M&A moving forward.  Shifting to capital allocation on Slide 5. With the receipt of the proceeds from the M&M sale, we are now able to accelerate our capital return options and further strengthen our balance sheet, while maintaining flexibility to continue to grow the business through disciplined and targeted M&A.  Today, we announced that our Board has authorized a new $5 billion share repurchase program which expires June 30, 2024. We intend to act immediately and enter an accelerated share repurchase agreement for $3.25 billion of common stock which includes the remaining $250 million under the previous authorization. We anticipate completing this ASR within about 9 months, with 80% of the shares retired upfront during the fourth quarter. We currently expect to complete the full $5 billion of repurchases within the authorization period.  In addition, we will retire $2.5 billion of our senior notes due 2023 in the fourth quarter. The prepayment reduces refinancing risk in a rising rate environment, while generating pretax annualized savings of over $100 million. Further, we plan to reduce our commercial paper balance to 0 by year-end, of which we had $1.3 billion outstanding at the end of the third quarter.  In combination, the significant share repurchase authorization and our deleveraging plan demonstrates our continued commitment to returning capital to shareholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our approach remains balanced and in line with our overall capital allocation strategy. We expect to finish the year with a leverage ratio significantly below our longer-term target, maintaining balance sheet capacity to further allocate excess capital through a combination of bolt-on M&A and potential share repurchases over time. Our M&A focus remains on targets that fit within our growth pillars and are aligned with key secular growth trends.  With that, let me turn it over to Lori to discuss third quarter details as well as our financial outlook.\nLori Koch: Thanks, Ed, and good morning. As mentioned, we saw continued strong demand during the quarter in most of our end markets, with organic growth better than our expectations coming into the quarter. The global economy remains challenged in some respects, but our team's focus on disciplined pricing and operational execution contributed to operating EBITDA margin expansion on a year-over-year basis.  Turning to our financial highlights for the quarter on Slide 6. Net sales of $3.3 billion increased 4% as reported and increased 11% on an organic basis versus the prior year quarter. Global currencies remained highly dynamic as we saw a 4% headwind resulting from U.S. dollar strength against key currencies, including the euro, yen and yuan. The 3% portfolio headwind reflects the impact of noncore divestitures.  Breaking down organic sales growth, we saw 8% pricing gains and 3% higher volume. Volume growth reflects continued strong demand, most notably in semiconductor, water and general industrial, reduced somewhat by lower volumes for protective garments within Safety Solutions and ongoing softness in smartphone and personal computing markets globally within Interconnect Solutions.  On a segment basis, third quarter organic growth was 15% for W&T, 7% for E&I, and I'll highlight 25% organic growth for the retained businesses that we report in Corporate [indiscernible] representing the adhesive portfolio from the former M&M segment.  On a regional basis, we delivered organic sales growth in all four regions, led by volume increases in North America and Asia Pacific. From an earnings perspective, operating EBITDA of $856 million increased 5% versus the year ago period and adjusted EPS of $0.82 per share increased 4%. These increases were driven primarily by volume gains as pricing actions were offset by higher inflationary cost pressure. Adjusted EPS in the quarter included a higher-than-expected tax rate, which I'll detail shortly.  Operating EBITDA margin of 25.8% increased 30 basis points year-over-year on stronger volumes and productivity. Operating EBITDA margin in the quarter, adjusted to exclude price cost, was over 27%. Finally, incremental margin was 33% on a as-reported basis. Cash flow from operations during the quarter of $419 million, adjusted for capital expenditures of $172 million and the $115 million tax prepayment related to the M&M divestiture resulted in free cash flow of $362 million. We continue to experience significant headwinds from transaction costs related to the M&M separation as well as working capital headwinds primarily from the divested M&M business.  Free cash flow conversion in the quarter for the total company was 73%. For the ongoing portfolio, if M&M was excluded, free cash conversion in the quarter would have been in line with our target of greater than 90%.  Turning to Slide 7. Adjusted EPS of $0.82 increased 4% compared to $0.79 in the year ago period. Stronger segment results versus the prior year contributed 8% to adjusted EPS growth or $0.06 driven primarily by volume growth. Benefits from ongoing share repurchases continue to drive earnings growth, providing a $0.04 benefit to adjusted EPS.  The absence of earnings related to noncore business divestitures and the impact of currency headwinds negatively impacted third quarter results, and we expect both to be more significant headwinds to year-over-year earnings in the fourth quarter.  Our tax rate for the quarter was 26.2%, up notably from 23.5% in the prior year, resulting in a year-over-year headwind to adjusted EPS of $0.03 and a $0.05 headwind in the quarter compared to the midpoint of our previous modeling guidance. Our full year base tax rate is now expected to be about 24%, with the increase driven by currency and mix and geographic earnings.  Turning to segment results, beginning with E&I on slide. E&I delivered third quarter net sales growth of 3% and organic growth of 7%, including a 4% increase in volume and a 3% increase in price, partially offset by a 4% currency headwind. Sales growth was led by Semiconductor Technologies, which increased mid-teens organically as strong demand continued led by the ongoing transition to more advanced new technologies and high semiconductor fab utilization along with growth in 5G communications and data centers.  Industrial Solutions posted another strong quarter with organic sales growth of high single digits led by ongoing strength from Kalrez semiconductor-related product offerings, Vespel products serving recovering aerospace markets, OLED materials for new electronic displays related model launches and for health care applications such as biopharma tubing. Interconnect Solutions sales decreased mid-single digits on an organic basis due to volume decline.  Coming into the quarter, we expected a return to positive organic growth within Interconnect, but continued softness in consumer electronics specifically smartphones and lower PC and tablet demand globally, more than offset strong demand for Kapton film product applications in industrial end markets such as rail and defense and strength in Laird product offerings, including electromagnetic shielding and thermal management. Given this demand softening, we now expect Interconnect Solutions organic sales for the full year to be down mid-single digits.  Operating EBITDA for E&I of $473 million was relatively flat as volume gains in semi and Industrial Solutions were offset by lower volumes and weaker product mix in Interconnect Solutions, along with lower JV earnings. Operating EBITDA margin of 31.3% was down 110 basis points from the prior year due primarily to the impact of price cost.  Turning to Slide 9. W&P delivered net sales growth of 10% as organic sales growth of 15% was partially offset by a 5% currency headwind. Organic growth for W&P reflected a 13% increase in price and a 2% increase in volume. Organic sales growth was led by Shelter Solutions, which increased high teens driven by pricing actions and further aided by volume growth on continued demand in North America commercial construction.  Sales for Water Solutions were up an impressive mid-teens organic growth rate on strong global demand for reverse osmosis and on-exchange resin technologies as well as pricing gains. Sales for Safety Solutions were up low double digits on an organic basis as pricing actions were slightly offset by lower Tyvek volumes given the shift from garments to other Tyvek applications and the resulting impact of manufacturing line changeovers on production efficiency. Excluding the year-over-year Tyvek garment headwind, total W&P volumes would have been up approximately 5%.  I will also acknowledge the dedicated work of our teams for safely and promptly restoring operations at our Spruance plant earlier in the third quarter from an unforeseen utility disruption with minimal impact on the quarter's results.  Operating EBITDA for W&P of $382 million increased 8% versus last year as pricing actions and volume gains more than offset higher product costs driven by inflationary pressure, weaker product mix and currency headwinds. Operating EBITDA margin of 24.9% included a 170-basis point headwind related to price cost. Excluding this price/cost impact, operating EBITDA margin would have been 26.6% during the quarter.  I'll close with a few comments on our financial outlook and guidance for the full year 2022 on Slide 10. We expect solid demand trends to continue in the fourth quarter in many of our key end markets such as Water, Industrial and Auto Adhesives, to name a few. That said, we anticipate continued softness within Interconnect Solutions related to smartphones and personal computing globally and expect some slowing in customer fab production rates in our semi business. Additionally, we expect some impact from reducing our production to drive down inventories on a consolidated basis. Lastly, we expect further currency headwinds to negatively impact both top and bottom-line results.  Based on these assumptions, we are adjusting the midpoint of our full year 2022 net sales guidance to the low end of our previous range and now expect net sales to be about $13 billion. Compared to our previous midpoint, this change reflects about $150 million of incremental foreign currency headwinds, with the majority of those headwinds impacting the fourth quarter.  For the full year, we now expect foreign currency to be approximately a 4% headwind to reported net sales. Our organic net sales growth expectation of high single digits for the full year remains unchanged.  Due to the same factors just noted, we are adjusting the midpoint of our operating EBITDA guidance to the low end of our previous range and now expect full year 2022 operating EBITDA to be about $3.25 billion.  We now expect full year adjusted EPS to be about $3.30 per share, within our previous range. The higher-than-anticipated base tax rate for the full year that I discussed earlier, which equates to a $0.09 headwind versus our previous guide, is expected to be offset by a lower share count and net interest benefits resulting from a higher cash balance and the capital deployment actions we are taking in the fourth quarter.  In closing, our team remains focused on operational execution and expect to use the levers within our control to meet our financial goals and continue to drive value for our shareholders.  With that, we are pleased to take your questions, and let me turn it back to the operator to open the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.\nJeffrey Sprague: Congrats on getting all that done. Just would love to put a finer point on how you're thinking about capital deployment beyond what you announced today. And specifically, as it relates to kind of M&A. Should we really think this will be bolt-ons and kind of neatly fitting with inside of how the portfolio is positioned? Certainly seems like you could benefit from just letting things settle down for a while and allowing people to digest kind of what you do and how the portfolio is taking shape.\nEdward Breen: Yes. Jeff, I think very good points you're making. We're in no rush to do an M&A deal. Eventually, especially in this environment. I don't think any of us know where things are actually headed. So we're going to take a pause here, see how the next set of months play out.  We do have targets we've been interested in for quite a period of time, whether they're actionable or not is another kind of story. And they clearly would be in the pillars of the secular growth areas, the 5 areas that we've talked about. So we're not going to deviate off into anything else. But we're in the same mode, I think, as your opening comment, Jeff, let things settle down. We've made a lot of moves. We've pretty much finished our transformation except still for the sale of Delrin, which will happen in 2023.  And so no rush to do anything. But we do have the capacity to do some bolt-on-type M&A, and that's the way we're thinking about it, is more on the bolt-on size of the deal.\nJeffrey Sprague: Great. And then maybe just a follow-up for Lori. Can you just kind of level set us on what you're expecting for the actual net proceeds for M&M, paid some tax here in Q3. And also you did note some free cash flow headwind from M&M. And I think you were talking about that all throughout the year. So are there actually some kind of favorable working capital adjustments here kind of on top of the gross kind of sales proceeds that we're talking about?\nLori Koch: Yes. So to your first question, I expect about $10.4 billion net after tax on all of the customary closing adjustments from the Milan transaction. So if you look to the end of the year with all the puts and takes, about -- we announced today on the capital allocation between the share repurchase authorization getting started with $3.25 billion and the fixed portion of the November 2023 is being paid down at $2.5 billion, that would put our year-end cash at roughly $4.8 billion, so a nice position to be in.  As far as the working capital headwind, so there's no working capital benefit to be had from a cash flow perspective. It was more just calling out the headwinds that were in our numbers prior to the separation of the M&M business. And so if you look at our cash used kind of prior to their separation, the largest portion of the working capital headwind was from the M&M business. So we were just highlighting our actual cash performance would have been better without them in the portfolio.  So in the quarter, we were 73% as reported for free cash flow conversion. We would have been more in the range of the greater than 90% that we target for the Remainco portfolio had we not had them in the results.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Credit Suisse.\nJohn Roberts: I'll ask just one here. In semiconductor materials, Entegris reduced the December quarter sales by about 10% for the new U.S. restrictions on China. And they also noted the memory chip weakness was affecting CMP disproportionately. Are you seeing anything different in the semiconductor market?\nEdward Breen: Yes. Well, on the export control issue in China, there's really 3 restrictions on that. And by the way I would put it in a category of it's more because of advanced chip technology. So the -- for instance, one of them is logic chips at 14 nanometers or below is restricted, it's one of the key ones.  So for us, it's not that big. Most of the fabs in China are not the high-end advanced chips. So if you look at it on an annual basis, if we are restricted and cannot get a license to supply that, there would be about $60 million of revenue for us on an annual basis, so say about $15 million on a quarterly basis, which we took that $15 million into account in our fourth quarter guide that we gave.  Overall, on the semi side, we look at the inventory index, for instance, like Gartner puts out and it's, give or take, 1.1 right now. If you kind of go back to the last downturn of semi back in 2019, it peaked out at 1.31. So just to give you a little bit of a parameter on where that sits. So it's on the high end. We think there's 2 or 3 quarters of correction there that we'll see. But the downturn in 2019 was like 6% to 7% year-over-year downturn. So just to give you some perspective. But at this point in time, it's not at the peak of where it was in the '19 time frame.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research.\nScott Davis: Are you guys surprised that the 8% price didn't fully cover cost this quarter? Were there some kind of intra-quarter cost increases or surprises there that caught you a little flat-footed?\nEdward Breen: No, Scott, it did not. Maybe we misstated it. We did cover all the costs. So our cost inflation, I think last quarter we reported we thought it was around $700 million. It's now $800 million for the year, and that's all based on mostly energy increase in Europe, as you're all aware of, on natural gas.  And by the way, just to give you kind of more color to that, we are obviously seeing commodities start to come off their peak. We thought we would start to maybe start seeing some benefit and hopefully we do in 2023. But then energy spike, so the energy just about to offset what we've been seeing the benefit on the commodity. So hopefully, now as we progress over the next months, we start to see some spread there, that would be helpful.  But no, we did implement more price increase. We covered the whole $800 million that we're going to have for the year at this point in time. And just to remind you, every price increase we did, we put it into the product cost. We did not do it as surcharges that would fluctuate off an index. So customers would have to negotiate with us when there's any price changes.\nScott Davis: All right. That's super helpful, Ed. And just a little follow-up on Interconnect. I mean, are you guys -- I assume you're selling to Foxconn, are you impacted by the plant shutdown that's been announced?\nLori Koch: Yes. So we did announce a deceleration in our expectations for the Interconnect Solutions in general. So it will be covered by what you're hearing in the headlines with respect to smartphone and consumer electronics and then, ultimately, the underlying PCB demand. So for the year, we now expect Interconnect Solutions to be down mid-single digits. So that would all be wrapped up in that number.\nEdward Breen: Yes. Just to give you a perspective, we thought in the second half of the year, ICS would be up mid-single digits. Now it's down mid-single digits. So I think we've taken all that into account.  And by the way, just to remind you, it's hard to remember this, but we're already two quarters into the ICS, that whole PCB smartphone, laptop downturn. So they don't last forever, but we've already had 2 quarters of it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.\nCharles Tusa: Given its election day, I'll make a recommendation, you should run for office someday, Ed.\nEdward Breen: I like what I do now.\nCharles Tusa: Yes. I think you get the 10 -- votes from the 10 guys who cover the stock, for sure. So just on the fourth quarter price cost, you were 130 bps, I think, headwind this quarter, I believe you said. I might have missed that. Does that -- I assume that gets a little better in the fourth quarter. The math suggests that it may not get better in the fourth quarter.\nLori Koch: Yes. So the dollar does get a little bit less in the fourth quarter because we start to lap some of the prior year increases. And so we're expecting about a 5% price increase in the fourth quarter versus the 8% that we posted in third quarter and then 7% in the second quarter.  As far as the margin headwind, it would be a little bit less, but our underlying guidance does suggest overall EBITDA margin improvement in the fourth quarter. So if you back into the fourth quarter from the full year guide that we gave, we'd be more in the low 24% range from an EBITDA margin perspective versus last year it's 23.2%. And I'd highlighted that sequential decline, expected decline in EBITDA margin is really from one seasonality.  So we tend to see some seasonality as our volumes are lowest in the fourth quarter. And also, we did elect to take down production to be able to better align our inventory levels. So we are seeing some stabilization in the supply chain that gives us confidence we can start to tweak down these inventory levels. And so there will be a unit cost headwind in the fourth quarter. So those two combined are the drivers of the sequential EBITDA margins' decline.\nCharles Tusa: And then just one more question on this. I know you gave the margin headwind, but just so we're on the same page, what was the -- out of the $800 million, how much of that came in 3Q?\nLori Koch: About $240 million.\nCharles Tusa: Of inflation?\nEdward Breen: Yes.\nLori Koch: Yes. So we're at $650 million year-to-date and another $150 million in 4Q to get to the $800 million for the full year.\nCharles Tusa: Okay. And any carryover for next year when it comes to price? And you said now inflation, you probably won't get relief there, but any carryover on price into next year?\nLori Koch: Yes, there should be some, especially in first quarter. So that's when we really started to ramp the price increases. And then we did see some inflation start to ramp in the first quarter. Our number hasn't materially changed. I believe, back in Q2, we thought the full year would be $500 million. So we did see some escalation in the 2Q time frame. But the numbers have been starting to normalize in the back half of the year. So the increases that we just saw recently have been more in the European natural gas side versus the underlying raw material side.\nEdward Breen: Steve, it's going to be interesting for all of us going into 2023 as we work our way through it how carry through and handles this price cost issue because the commodities are definitely coming down pretty uniformly. Not crazy, but they're down 20%, 25% in many cases. So if the natural gas thing settles out, I think we've peaked on all this inflation and then how do we handle price cost as we move forward with all the price that we got.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays.\nMichael Leithead: Great. Just one for me. Ed, I was hoping you could provide what -- to the degree you can, a bit more color about the decision to walk away from Rogers as opposed to pursuing another extension or rework transaction. It sounds like you're saying it was ultimately unworkable from a regulatory perspective. Is that fair? Was it just an issue of sitting in limbo for an elongated period of time here?\nEdward Breen: No, it's very simple. We did not get regulatory approval in China. It had been a full year. That was our outside date. And we ended it, which was the contractual agreement. So really, there's nothing more to it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn McNulty: Ed, you spoke a little bit to the Interconnect Solutions' weakness. Can you speak a little bit broader in terms of the macro trends that you're starting to see right now? Some of your business is pretty resilient through that. But are you starting to pull any levers just on macro concerns at this point that we should be thinking about?\nEdward Breen: Yes. I'll let Lori start out, and I'll add some color.\nLori Koch: Yes. I think as far as pulling leverage to make sure that we drive the best margin profile that we can, we did announce in the Q that we'll come out this afternoon a restructuring program. Initially, it's really just to get after the stranded cost from the M&M transaction now that it has closed. So we signaled about $50 million of stranded costs associated with the M&M transaction. So we'll get at those first to take those out to be able to drive further profitability.  And then we've got room underneath the restructuring that we announced to take further cost action as appropriate if we start to see further deceleration in the top line.\nEdward Breen: And we have already, as a management team, laid out what those. So we'll do the stranded costs, as Lori said, but we've already laid out the detailed actions we do for some additional restructuring if we felt it was needed. And then I'll go back to the point I made a minute ago, there's a big lever in price cost that we're going to have to figure how that plays out through 2023.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. Got it. No, makes sense. Fair enough. And then just -- maybe just a follow-up on the M&A questions from before. So I guess with Rogers clearly having some problems on the regulatory front, and maybe it's a political thing, U.S. and China or not, it seems like a lot of things are kind of getting held up at this point. Does it make it hard for DuPont going forward to make acquisitions in the electronics area? And should we be thinking going forward that bolt-ons would be more focused on the Water and protection area? Or is that really not the right read on this?\nEdward Breen: Let me say it this way, just by the way it's played out, some of the things we're interested in happened to be in Water and happened to be in the industrial technology space. So I guess if it stays their kind of targeted for down the road when we want to do something, it's probably not an issue that we would have to deal with. And who knows on the electronics? I just don't know the answer to that. We don't know what we don't know.  But having said that, I mean, we loved Rogers coming in because it added some tools in the toolkit. But we have a very comprehensive portfolio in electronics. With the Laird in there, it's really been beneficial. Laird has been performing awesome. And they've gotten -- as we highlighted, I think last earnings, they've gotten some wins for DuPont technology with some Laird customers. And also, I don't feel bad about where we're at, at all in the electronics side.  Again, it would have been nice to have Rogers, but -- and we're not probably looking at an electronics deal anyway at this point in time. So not going to be an issue.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nAleksey Yefremov: How do you think about the debt reduction versus potentially doing even larger buyback for this trench of capital allocation?\nEdward Breen: Well, first of all, and we said this in our prepared comments, we'll do the $5 billion repurchase. And by the way, we can be in the market -- in the open market doing some of that if we feel it's appropriate during the year, depending on what the economy is looking like. So it's -- the ASR will take us 8, 9 months, but we can be over the top doing some additional purchase. So we'll just see how that plays out. But -- and have the opportunity to do another ASR right on the heels, if that's how we want to handle it. So we have our options open to us there.  But we also have a fair amount of firepower as we kind of go through 2023, if you do the math. And again, it would be for bolt-on potential acquisition, but we also have the opportunity to do more share repurchase if we want. So we don't need to make those decisions now, but we'll contemplate that as we go through 2023.\nAleksey Yefremov: Thanks, Ed. And going back to Interconnect business, would you try to maybe forecast when this reaches a bottom? Do you think Q4 or Q1 could be when it starts -- stops going negative?\nLori Koch: Yes. It does feel like we have reached the bottom in the Interconnect space between the PCB application. So as Ed had mentioned, we're a good 2 quarters in, so it feels like we bottomed out. We're not ready to call kind of growth in the next quarter or anything, but we do feel like the deceleration has plateaued.\nEdward Breen: Yes, we got a peak pretty deep into it at this point in time. I mean the PCB players in China really shut down. So I think they're correcting their inventory really quickly. I mean, they truly shut down. It's not like they cut back on production. So I think they can fix things pretty quickly. And so I don't want to put a date on kind of building out of it. But again, we are pretty far into it months wise at this point in time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Sison: Nice quarter. Just one question for me. It seems like the consensus view is for a recession next year. Can you maybe talk about each of the businesses and how it should perform in a downturn? And just when I think about the fourth quarter outlook, multiplying that by 4 probably isn't the right way to think about a recession case and maybe walk through the puts and takes of that sort of potential.\nLori Koch: Yes. I mean, I think, first, starting in the financials, I think you're right to take the fourth quarter, it tends to be usually our seasonally weakest quarter. And so to take it and run rate it could be difficult.  I wanted to highlight, too, just the natural EPS growth that we have from the actions that we've taken on the capital allocation side which will bolster us as we head into 2023. So between the share repurchase that we announced today at the $3.25 billion, the lower interest income that we called out of -- lower interest expense that we called out of $100 million and further interest income from the cash that we'll be holding in the balance sheet, we've got north of 15% EPS growth just from those actions alone. So nice to be -- positioned to be in as we head into 2023.  As Ed had mentioned, we'll aim to maintain favorability on the price/cost side as we start to continue to see the commodity prices decline. And I did highlight that we have initiated a cost restructuring program should we need it beyond the stranded costs that we've highlighted to take out.  So from that perspective and from maintaining a good margin profile, I feel like we're protected as we head into next year. And from an end market perspective, we've highlighted that we probably feel like we're already 2 quarters into the consumer electronics downturn and the semi piece that I had highlighted, the inventory index that we pay attention to. And so while it is elevated versus where it was during the pandemic, it's not as elevated as it was back in the 2019 time frame when we saw semi volumes down in the mid-single-digit range.  From the industrial side of the portfolio, so the remaining piece of electronics and then the broadness of W&P beside the shelter piece, those pieces, they're pretty stable. So Water, we've got a really nice backlog, at least 6 months of backlog in the Water business. A nice performance on the defense side, especially on the aero piece within the safety portfolio as we see those markets continue to recover.  The one piece besides consumer electronics and semi that we're paying close attention to is obviously the Shelter business. The North America residential side, which is about 40% of the business, we'll pay close attention to, obviously, with the news out there on the potential headwinds in that space, but we're not seeing anything material at this point, so...\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.\nDaniel Rizzo: This is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. You mentioned before about having prices not be surcharges, but just kind of be in the production cost or in the cost of the product. I was wondering, historically speaking, have you ever -- with that scenario, have you ever had to give price concessions? Or are they generally relatively sticky?\nEdward Breen: Well, I think for all of us, it's hard to totally answer that question because we never had inflation like this in at least in my career and raised prices as much as all of us have. So our game plan clearly is to keep a spread there because I'm a strong believer we have big intellectual property, a lot of our products are needed, they're the best in the industry and they should have good EBITDA margins with them. And generally, we do have very good EBIT margins across the board. So the game will be to keep that spread there.  But when you've had this kind of inflation, I don't think you'll hold on to all of it, and I don't think any company holds on to all of it, by and large, but can you keep a spread will be the real game.\nDaniel Rizzo: That's helpful. And then just one other question. In terms of FX, you mentioned the headwinds. I was wondering if there's -- if you've ever given a rule of thumb, like a $0.05 move in the euro versus $1 or something like that where the basket translates into x percent in -- I'm sorry, in sales or EBITDA?\nLori Koch: So we've never given a rule of thumb the drop-down from the top line headwind. So in the fourth quarter, we expect about a 6% year-over-year headwind from a currency perspective. The drop through down into EBIT is not materially different than the overall EBITDA margin that we have for the total company. So you could use that to kind of model where we think the roughly $200 million year-over-year headwind in currency translates to EBITDA.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho Securities.\nChristopher Parkinson: Just given the solid result on W&P margins on your longer-term pathway back to '27, '28, has the calculus changed at all between the buckets of price cost over intermediate to long term, improving ops and just overall business mix? Is there any change of thought process? Or is just hey, we have a lot of things going in the right direction, and we'll get there in due course.\nLori Koch: No, there's no change in the EBITDA margin improvement drivers that you had mentioned. The one piece that we'll continue to watch, as I had mentioned, was can we drive continued favorability within the margin improvement from price cost? So as the costs start to decelerate, are we able to maintain a more favorable price profile?\nChristopher Parkinson: Got it. And just very quickly on E&I., are you seeing any changes in deferrals in leading-edge capacity ramps in any way, shape or form in terms of core MSI heading into 2023? In any way, does that change your expectation for 200 to 300 basis points of outperformance? Just any color on that, let's just say, preliminary framework would be very helpful.\nLori Koch: Yes. I would say longer term, there's no material change in the profile of high single-digit CapEx going in and driving high single-digit increases in production. Some of the numbers, as we head into 2023 from a market research expectations, do see a decline in MSI. So the initial numbers right now are around a 5% decline in MSI, but we would still expect that same outperformance of 200 to 300 basis points. And so if MSI is down 5% next year, we would expect to be down 200 to 300 basis points ahead of that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS.\nJoshua Spector: I wanted to follow up on the recession question earlier. So you said not annualizing -- annualizing fourth quarter is not the right way to look at it. That's about $3 billion in EBITDA. Talked a lot about positive points that you could have on the price cost side and some of the restructuring items. I mean is it fair to say that you're starting bogey for next year from an EBITDA perspective is about flat year-over-year even in a recessionary environment?\nLori Koch: Yes. I think it's a little too early to call what 2023 EBITDA looks like. So we highlighted the actions that we're taking to drive EPS improvement from the share repurchase and from overall improved performance in interest expense and interest income. But we haven't really indicated anything yet about what the EBITDA profile would look like beyond the actions that we're taking on the cost side to take out the stranded costs and then we've got the ability to do more there should we see further need to.\nEdward Breen: A lot of it, by the way, comes down to how you will individually model a recession scenario next year, and therefore, how do you model commodity inflation or deflation coming, because that's going to have a big bearing on all our -- all the multi-industrial companies if you start seeing that benefit.  And then back to a question earlier, can you hold some of that, I think is really going to be an interesting question for all the multi-industrials. So how that plays out is very different than any other recession we've been through.\nJoshua Spector: Yes. Understood. Fair point. And I just wanted to follow up on W&P and just specifically, I guess, the Shelter side. Are you seeing any destocking? Is that baked into your fourth quarter guidance? I guess, we've seen other firms talk about pretty severe destocking globally and even in North America into construction markets. So I'm just curious where you stand on that cycle or what the risk is of that increasing or accelerating into early next year?\nLori Koch: Yes, I wouldn't say there's anything material at this point. There are elevated inventory levels at some of the big box retailers, but we haven't seen any material destocking yet at this point. So we did see positive volume growth in Shelter in Q4. And I'll just remind you of the distribution of the Shelter business, roughly $1.8 billion of sales, about 40% of it is commercial, which seems -- which remains to be very strong for us. So that's selling into health care and education and other types of commercial applications. 40% residential and then 20% kind of the do-it-yourself market.\nEdward Breen: And we did -- just as a correction, we did see positive volume growth in Shelter in Q3. We're assuming that moderates a little bit going forward as Lori noted, given inventory in the channel. But it really hasn't changed materially in the order book today.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets.\nArun Viswanathan: I guess I had two questions. So first off, when you think about the volume outlook, could you just describe maybe the volume outlook for Water in some of the portfolio -- parts of the portfolio that are less economically sensitive? Do you see kind of the lower peak-to-trough variability on earnings playing out as you expected with your earlier communication?\nLori Koch: Yes, we do see continued strength in water. So in the quarter -- third quarter, volumes were up low double digits and we see kind of mid-single-digit growth in Q4. And as I had mentioned, we've got a really nice backlog there. So should there be any moderation in demand, we've got over 6 months of the backlog that we can work down to be able to bolster the overall volume profile for the Water business.\nArun Viswanathan: And then just a question on capital allocation. You obviously have some proceeds left over after the debt reduction and the share repurchase. Is there a time line that you'd look to deploy that, say, $2-plus billion? Is there any kind of thoughts you could offer for us how to think about that will be deployed?\nEdward Breen: Well, we -- so it's interesting. We're moving as fast as we can on the share repurchase. We can only take out so much volume so quick, so we'll move as fast as we can there. And then as we said earlier, just to puncture again, we are in no rush to do anything from a bolt-on M&A standpoint. We want to see how the economy is going to play out. There might even be a better entry point 6 months, 8 months, a year down the road. So I wouldn't answer that we have -- whatever excess cash we have at this point in time, there's really nothing we're going to do with it presently and we'll just monitor the next few months on that.  And remember, we still have to sell Delrin, so we don't have the money for that yet, and that's probably more towards the back half of 2023 at this point in time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.\nDavid Begleiter: Ed, Auto Adhesive is doing quite well. What are the prospects of this business? And will it always -- will it stay in Corporate & Other going forward?\nEdward Breen: Well, Lori manages it, and it's growing like a weed so I'll let her answer it.\nLori Koch: Yes. So we are seeing really nice growth in the Auto Adhesives, primarily driven by the conversion and the opportunity that we have on the battery side. And so we saw the 25% organic growth in the third quarter, and we expect further growth as we move forward. The distribution between ICE and EV from a 2022 builds perspective is really pretty disparate. So the overall expectation for ICE vehicles is actually, I think, to be slightly down. And for EV, EV-related materials is to be up well into the double digits. And so that dynamic is what is playing into our growth portfolio as we move forward.  As far as finding the permanent home for the Adhesives business, it will not stay in corporate. So here in short order, we'll figure out where those businesses need to be aligned. We wanted to make the decision after we had got through the Rogers decision. And now that we know that path forward, we can figure out where these businesses reside permanently going forward.\nEdward Breen: Yes. We think we can leverage it well with some of our other auto exposure, especially on the EV side. So we'll organize ourselves to advantage ourselves as we talk to that customer base that we have other products and opportunities to sell into. So it will advantage the adhesive business over time.  But by the way, we're feeling very good about our win rate there. And you can see by the organic growth, Lori, what was that? Yes, 25% growth is pretty spectacular in that business. And I don't see it slowing down just because of what Lori just described, the EV build rates coming over the next 5 years.\nDavid Begleiter: Very good. Ed, do you have an update on PFAS and the South Carolina MDL?\nEdward Breen: Nothing really new to report, although we've been in pretty intense conversations. Just let you know; I am personally involved with my General Counsel. And we're really hoping we get to a resolution, but I don't want to put a time line on it.  But -- and just I think this is public knowledge. The judge has continued to encourage settlement talks with the plaintiffs here. And that's a good sign and potentially even using a mediator. And so we've made tremendous progress, but I don't want to put a time line on it. It's a continuing process. And you know very well, we want to get the water district cases settled, that's really the big focus for us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nStephen Byrne: Yes. Ed, you made a comment about some cross-selling between Laird and legacy DuPont. And you also made the comment about [Technical Difficulty].\nChristopher Mecray: Steve, are you there?\nEdward Breen: We lost Steve.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research.\nFrank Mitsch: Looking geographically, obviously, very strong growth in North America for the quarter, but still high single digits in Asia and in Europe. And I'm curious if you could provide an outlook here in Q4. What are you seeing so far in those regions as many others have talked about some of the difficulties that they've been seeing there?\nLori Koch: Yes. So as you had noted, we had really strong performance in North America and Asia Pacific. As we look into the fourth quarter, our overall volume expectation in the guidance that we had provided was to be about flat. So that's versus about the 3% that we saw in Q3, where the top of the house North America had mid-single-digit volume and Asia Pacific had kind of low single-digit volumes.  So as we head into 4Q, we don't see a material change in the Asia Pacific volumes or Europe, we do see a little bit of a deceleration in the North America volumes, so more in the low single-digit range. And so overall, racking up to about flat year-over-year. On top of that, there was the price piece that would provide us with a nice organic number. And so we will continue to see, as I had mentioned earlier in the call about 5% price increase.\nFrank Mitsch: Understood. And you indicated that you're going to lower operating rates in the fourth quarter. Obviously, Interconnect stands out as an area. Where else may be looking to lower your operating rates in the fourth quarter?\nLori Koch: Yes. It's generally across all the lines of business just as we get more comfortable with the supply chain environment. So we feel like things have normalized there so that we can be a little bit more aggressive on the inventory front. And so it's across all the lines of business that we'll be reducing production rates.\nEdward Breen: Yes. So look, we made a fundamental decision, we did it a couple of years ago. We were losing some EBITDA at the expense of lowering working capital, and we decided to make that decision to get more in line going into 2023 with where we want to be from an inventory standpoint.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nStephen Byrne: Will give it another shot here. I just wanted to hear your view on your pipeline, in R&D in each of your businesses. Putting end market outlook aside, where do you see the potential for the most growth from internal R&D discovery?\nEdward Breen: Well, the biggest -- look, the biggest area always for us and it's quicker cycle is the E&I business and more centered in electronics business. We have an 8% R&D spend there. It's very, very robust, and we're constantly introducing new products in that area, Steve. But one of the areas we're really focusing on -- remember, one of the strengths at DuPont is the application engineering expertise. We live with our customers and we do design and work with them. And we're really focused on leveraging, for instance, the Laird platform with the existing DuPont technology.  So one of the things I was alluding to, we've got a couple of auto customers where Laird was already into an electromagnetic shielding thermal management and they have now been pulling in some DuPont applications and products for wiring protection and all that. So there's a lot of focus there on how can we get the synergies from a revenue standpoint from those. So I'd say that's the biggest area.  But remember, R&D for us is the heart of the company and application engineering is the heart of the company. So it's across the board here. we're very big on intellectual property. When we look to do a bolt-on, I think I mentioned this in my remarks, intellectual property to us is very key. And the ability to have strong application engineering across the board in all our end verticals is very key for us.\nStephen Byrne: And maybe just one more to drill into your Water business. Do you monitor your customers' water treatment systems to seek ways to lower their energy costs or to upgrade into newer technologies?\nLori Koch: We do. Yes. We've got a really nice portfolio that we're growing in the lithium battery space that we've mentioned for the Water business. So there's about 30% of water is in the specialty, so kind of outside the Industrial applications. And that's where all of those high-growth opportunities sit. Also obviously, we're well aligned with the UN sustainability goals, and that sits front and center with the Water business as well.\nEdward Breen: And to your point, by the way, one of the big things we work on with our technology is right to the heart of the question you asked, is reducing the energy consumption. So we're working on technologies around that, and that could be cutting-edge for us, give us a competitive advantage.\nOperator: And at this time, I'll turn the call over to Chris Mecray for closing remarks.\nChristopher Mecray: Yes. Just thank you, everyone, for joining our call. And for your reference, a copy of the transcript will be posted on our website. This concludes the call. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Lori Koch",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed, and good morning. As mentioned, we saw continued strong demand during the quarter in most of our end markets, with organic growth better than our expectations coming into the quarter. The global economy remains challenged in some respects, but our team's focus on disciplined pricing and operational execution contributed to operating EBITDA margin expansion on a year-over-year basis.  Turning to our financial highlights for the quarter on Slide 6. Net sales of $3.3 billion increased 4% as reported and increased 11% on an organic basis versus the prior year quarter. Global currencies remained highly dynamic as we saw a 4% headwind resulting from U.S. dollar strength against key currencies, including the euro, yen and yuan. The 3% portfolio headwind reflects the impact of noncore divestitures.  Breaking down organic sales growth, we saw 8% pricing gains and 3% higher volume. Volume growth reflects continued strong demand, most notably in semiconductor, water and general industrial, reduced somewhat by lower volumes for protective garments within Safety Solutions and ongoing softness in smartphone and personal computing markets globally within Interconnect Solutions.  On a segment basis, third quarter organic growth was 15% for W&T, 7% for E&I, and I'll highlight 25% organic growth for the retained businesses that we report in Corporate [indiscernible] representing the adhesive portfolio from the former M&M segment.  On a regional basis, we delivered organic sales growth in all four regions, led by volume increases in North America and Asia Pacific. From an earnings perspective, operating EBITDA of $856 million increased 5% versus the year ago period and adjusted EPS of $0.82 per share increased 4%. These increases were driven primarily by volume gains as pricing actions were offset by higher inflationary cost pressure. Adjusted EPS in the quarter included a higher-than-expected tax rate, which I'll detail shortly.  Operating EBITDA margin of 25.8% increased 30 basis points year-over-year on stronger volumes and productivity. Operating EBITDA margin in the quarter, adjusted to exclude price cost, was over 27%. Finally, incremental margin was 33% on a as-reported basis. Cash flow from operations during the quarter of $419 million, adjusted for capital expenditures of $172 million and the $115 million tax prepayment related to the M&M divestiture resulted in free cash flow of $362 million. We continue to experience significant headwinds from transaction costs related to the M&M separation as well as working capital headwinds primarily from the divested M&M business.  Free cash flow conversion in the quarter for the total company was 73%. For the ongoing portfolio, if M&M was excluded, free cash conversion in the quarter would have been in line with our target of greater than 90%.  Turning to Slide 7. Adjusted EPS of $0.82 increased 4% compared to $0.79 in the year ago period. Stronger segment results versus the prior year contributed 8% to adjusted EPS growth or $0.06 driven primarily by volume growth. Benefits from ongoing share repurchases continue to drive earnings growth, providing a $0.04 benefit to adjusted EPS.  The absence of earnings related to noncore business divestitures and the impact of currency headwinds negatively impacted third quarter results, and we expect both to be more significant headwinds to year-over-year earnings in the fourth quarter.  Our tax rate for the quarter was 26.2%, up notably from 23.5% in the prior year, resulting in a year-over-year headwind to adjusted EPS of $0.03 and a $0.05 headwind in the quarter compared to the midpoint of our previous modeling guidance. Our full year base tax rate is now expected to be about 24%, with the increase driven by currency and mix and geographic earnings.  Turning to segment results, beginning with E&I on slide. E&I delivered third quarter net sales growth of 3% and organic growth of 7%, including a 4% increase in volume and a 3% increase in price, partially offset by a 4% currency headwind. Sales growth was led by Semiconductor Technologies, which increased mid-teens organically as strong demand continued led by the ongoing transition to more advanced new technologies and high semiconductor fab utilization along with growth in 5G communications and data centers.  Industrial Solutions posted another strong quarter with organic sales growth of high single digits led by ongoing strength from Kalrez semiconductor-related product offerings, Vespel products serving recovering aerospace markets, OLED materials for new electronic displays related model launches and for health care applications such as biopharma tubing. Interconnect Solutions sales decreased mid-single digits on an organic basis due to volume decline.  Coming into the quarter, we expected a return to positive organic growth within Interconnect, but continued softness in consumer electronics specifically smartphones and lower PC and tablet demand globally, more than offset strong demand for Kapton film product applications in industrial end markets such as rail and defense and strength in Laird product offerings, including electromagnetic shielding and thermal management. Given this demand softening, we now expect Interconnect Solutions organic sales for the full year to be down mid-single digits.  Operating EBITDA for E&I of $473 million was relatively flat as volume gains in semi and Industrial Solutions were offset by lower volumes and weaker product mix in Interconnect Solutions, along with lower JV earnings. Operating EBITDA margin of 31.3% was down 110 basis points from the prior year due primarily to the impact of price cost.  Turning to Slide 9. W&P delivered net sales growth of 10% as organic sales growth of 15% was partially offset by a 5% currency headwind. Organic growth for W&P reflected a 13% increase in price and a 2% increase in volume. Organic sales growth was led by Shelter Solutions, which increased high teens driven by pricing actions and further aided by volume growth on continued demand in North America commercial construction.  Sales for Water Solutions were up an impressive mid-teens organic growth rate on strong global demand for reverse osmosis and on-exchange resin technologies as well as pricing gains. Sales for Safety Solutions were up low double digits on an organic basis as pricing actions were slightly offset by lower Tyvek volumes given the shift from garments to other Tyvek applications and the resulting impact of manufacturing line changeovers on production efficiency. Excluding the year-over-year Tyvek garment headwind, total W&P volumes would have been up approximately 5%.  I will also acknowledge the dedicated work of our teams for safely and promptly restoring operations at our Spruance plant earlier in the third quarter from an unforeseen utility disruption with minimal impact on the quarter's results.  Operating EBITDA for W&P of $382 million increased 8% versus last year as pricing actions and volume gains more than offset higher product costs driven by inflationary pressure, weaker product mix and currency headwinds. Operating EBITDA margin of 24.9% included a 170-basis point headwind related to price cost. Excluding this price/cost impact, operating EBITDA margin would have been 26.6% during the quarter.  I'll close with a few comments on our financial outlook and guidance for the full year 2022 on Slide 10. We expect solid demand trends to continue in the fourth quarter in many of our key end markets such as Water, Industrial and Auto Adhesives, to name a few. That said, we anticipate continued softness within Interconnect Solutions related to smartphones and personal computing globally and expect some slowing in customer fab production rates in our semi business. Additionally, we expect some impact from reducing our production to drive down inventories on a consolidated basis. Lastly, we expect further currency headwinds to negatively impact both top and bottom-line results.  Based on these assumptions, we are adjusting the midpoint of our full year 2022 net sales guidance to the low end of our previous range and now expect net sales to be about $13 billion. Compared to our previous midpoint, this change reflects about $150 million of incremental foreign currency headwinds, with the majority of those headwinds impacting the fourth quarter.  For the full year, we now expect foreign currency to be approximately a 4% headwind to reported net sales. Our organic net sales growth expectation of high single digits for the full year remains unchanged.  Due to the same factors just noted, we are adjusting the midpoint of our operating EBITDA guidance to the low end of our previous range and now expect full year 2022 operating EBITDA to be about $3.25 billion.  We now expect full year adjusted EPS to be about $3.30 per share, within our previous range. The higher-than-anticipated base tax rate for the full year that I discussed earlier, which equates to a $0.09 headwind versus our previous guide, is expected to be offset by a lower share count and net interest benefits resulting from a higher cash balance and the capital deployment actions we are taking in the fourth quarter.  In closing, our team remains focused on operational execution and expect to use the levers within our control to meet our financial goals and continue to drive value for our shareholders.  With that, we are pleased to take your questions, and let me turn it back to the operator to open the Q&A. Yes. So to your first question, I expect about $10.4 billion net after tax on all of the customary closing adjustments from the Milan transaction. So if you look to the end of the year with all the puts and takes, about -- we announced today on the capital allocation between the share repurchase authorization getting started with $3.25 billion and the fixed portion of the November 2023 is being paid down at $2.5 billion, that would put our year-end cash at roughly $4.8 billion, so a nice position to be in.  As far as the working capital headwind, so there's no working capital benefit to be had from a cash flow perspective. It was more just calling out the headwinds that were in our numbers prior to the separation of the M&M business. And so if you look at our cash used kind of prior to their separation, the largest portion of the working capital headwind was from the M&M business. So we were just highlighting our actual cash performance would have been better without them in the portfolio.  So in the quarter, we were 73% as reported for free cash flow conversion. We would have been more in the range of the greater than 90% that we target for the Remainco portfolio had we not had them in the results. Yes. So we did announce a deceleration in our expectations for the Interconnect Solutions in general. So it will be covered by what you're hearing in the headlines with respect to smartphone and consumer electronics and then, ultimately, the underlying PCB demand. So for the year, we now expect Interconnect Solutions to be down mid-single digits. So that would all be wrapped up in that number. Yes. So the dollar does get a little bit less in the fourth quarter because we start to lap some of the prior year increases. And so we're expecting about a 5% price increase in the fourth quarter versus the 8% that we posted in third quarter and then 7% in the second quarter.  As far as the margin headwind, it would be a little bit less, but our underlying guidance does suggest overall EBITDA margin improvement in the fourth quarter. So if you back into the fourth quarter from the full year guide that we gave, we'd be more in the low 24% range from an EBITDA margin perspective versus last year it's 23.2%. And I'd highlighted that sequential decline, expected decline in EBITDA margin is really from one seasonality.  So we tend to see some seasonality as our volumes are lowest in the fourth quarter. And also, we did elect to take down production to be able to better align our inventory levels. So we are seeing some stabilization in the supply chain that gives us confidence we can start to tweak down these inventory levels. And so there will be a unit cost headwind in the fourth quarter. So those two combined are the drivers of the sequential EBITDA margins' decline. About $240 million. Yes. So we're at $650 million year-to-date and another $150 million in 4Q to get to the $800 million for the full year. Yes, there should be some, especially in first quarter. So that's when we really started to ramp the price increases. And then we did see some inflation start to ramp in the first quarter. Our number hasn't materially changed. I believe, back in Q2, we thought the full year would be $500 million. So we did see some escalation in the 2Q time frame. But the numbers have been starting to normalize in the back half of the year. So the increases that we just saw recently have been more in the European natural gas side versus the underlying raw material side. Yes. I think as far as pulling leverage to make sure that we drive the best margin profile that we can, we did announce in the Q that we'll come out this afternoon a restructuring program. Initially, it's really just to get after the stranded cost from the M&M transaction now that it has closed. So we signaled about $50 million of stranded costs associated with the M&M transaction. So we'll get at those first to take those out to be able to drive further profitability.  And then we've got room underneath the restructuring that we announced to take further cost action as appropriate if we start to see further deceleration in the top line. Yes. It does feel like we have reached the bottom in the Interconnect space between the PCB application. So as Ed had mentioned, we're a good 2 quarters in, so it feels like we bottomed out. We're not ready to call kind of growth in the next quarter or anything, but we do feel like the deceleration has plateaued. Yes. I mean, I think, first, starting in the financials, I think you're right to take the fourth quarter, it tends to be usually our seasonally weakest quarter. And so to take it and run rate it could be difficult.  I wanted to highlight, too, just the natural EPS growth that we have from the actions that we've taken on the capital allocation side which will bolster us as we head into 2023. So between the share repurchase that we announced today at the $3.25 billion, the lower interest income that we called out of -- lower interest expense that we called out of $100 million and further interest income from the cash that we'll be holding in the balance sheet, we've got north of 15% EPS growth just from those actions alone. So nice to be -- positioned to be in as we head into 2023.  As Ed had mentioned, we'll aim to maintain favorability on the price/cost side as we start to continue to see the commodity prices decline. And I did highlight that we have initiated a cost restructuring program should we need it beyond the stranded costs that we've highlighted to take out.  So from that perspective and from maintaining a good margin profile, I feel like we're protected as we head into next year. And from an end market perspective, we've highlighted that we probably feel like we're already 2 quarters into the consumer electronics downturn and the semi piece that I had highlighted, the inventory index that we pay attention to. And so while it is elevated versus where it was during the pandemic, it's not as elevated as it was back in the 2019 time frame when we saw semi volumes down in the mid-single-digit range.  From the industrial side of the portfolio, so the remaining piece of electronics and then the broadness of W&P beside the shelter piece, those pieces, they're pretty stable. So Water, we've got a really nice backlog, at least 6 months of backlog in the Water business. A nice performance on the defense side, especially on the aero piece within the safety portfolio as we see those markets continue to recover.  The one piece besides consumer electronics and semi that we're paying close attention to is obviously the Shelter business. The North America residential side, which is about 40% of the business, we'll pay close attention to, obviously, with the news out there on the potential headwinds in that space, but we're not seeing anything material at this point, so... So we've never given a rule of thumb the drop-down from the top line headwind. So in the fourth quarter, we expect about a 6% year-over-year headwind from a currency perspective. The drop through down into EBIT is not materially different than the overall EBITDA margin that we have for the total company. So you could use that to kind of model where we think the roughly $200 million year-over-year headwind in currency translates to EBITDA. No, there's no change in the EBITDA margin improvement drivers that you had mentioned. The one piece that we'll continue to watch, as I had mentioned, was can we drive continued favorability within the margin improvement from price cost? So as the costs start to decelerate, are we able to maintain a more favorable price profile? Yes. I would say longer term, there's no material change in the profile of high single-digit CapEx going in and driving high single-digit increases in production. Some of the numbers, as we head into 2023 from a market research expectations, do see a decline in MSI. So the initial numbers right now are around a 5% decline in MSI, but we would still expect that same outperformance of 200 to 300 basis points. And so if MSI is down 5% next year, we would expect to be down 200 to 300 basis points ahead of that. Yes. I think it's a little too early to call what 2023 EBITDA looks like. So we highlighted the actions that we're taking to drive EPS improvement from the share repurchase and from overall improved performance in interest expense and interest income. But we haven't really indicated anything yet about what the EBITDA profile would look like beyond the actions that we're taking on the cost side to take out the stranded costs and then we've got the ability to do more there should we see further need to. Yes, I wouldn't say there's anything material at this point. There are elevated inventory levels at some of the big box retailers, but we haven't seen any material destocking yet at this point. So we did see positive volume growth in Shelter in Q4. And I'll just remind you of the distribution of the Shelter business, roughly $1.8 billion of sales, about 40% of it is commercial, which seems -- which remains to be very strong for us. So that's selling into health care and education and other types of commercial applications. 40% residential and then 20% kind of the do-it-yourself market. Yes, we do see continued strength in water. So in the quarter -- third quarter, volumes were up low double digits and we see kind of mid-single-digit growth in Q4. And as I had mentioned, we've got a really nice backlog there. So should there be any moderation in demand, we've got over 6 months of the backlog that we can work down to be able to bolster the overall volume profile for the Water business. Yes. So we are seeing really nice growth in the Auto Adhesives, primarily driven by the conversion and the opportunity that we have on the battery side. And so we saw the 25% organic growth in the third quarter, and we expect further growth as we move forward. The distribution between ICE and EV from a 2022 builds perspective is really pretty disparate. So the overall expectation for ICE vehicles is actually, I think, to be slightly down. And for EV, EV-related materials is to be up well into the double digits. And so that dynamic is what is playing into our growth portfolio as we move forward.  As far as finding the permanent home for the Adhesives business, it will not stay in corporate. So here in short order, we'll figure out where those businesses need to be aligned. We wanted to make the decision after we had got through the Rogers decision. And now that we know that path forward, we can figure out where these businesses reside permanently going forward. Yes. So as you had noted, we had really strong performance in North America and Asia Pacific. As we look into the fourth quarter, our overall volume expectation in the guidance that we had provided was to be about flat. So that's versus about the 3% that we saw in Q3, where the top of the house North America had mid-single-digit volume and Asia Pacific had kind of low single-digit volumes.  So as we head into 4Q, we don't see a material change in the Asia Pacific volumes or Europe, we do see a little bit of a deceleration in the North America volumes, so more in the low single-digit range. And so overall, racking up to about flat year-over-year. On top of that, there was the price piece that would provide us with a nice organic number. And so we will continue to see, as I had mentioned earlier in the call about 5% price increase. Yes. It's generally across all the lines of business just as we get more comfortable with the supply chain environment. So we feel like things have normalized there so that we can be a little bit more aggressive on the inventory front. And so it's across all the lines of business that we'll be reducing production rates. We do. Yes. We've got a really nice portfolio that we're growing in the lithium battery space that we've mentioned for the Water business. So there's about 30% of water is in the specialty, so kind of outside the Industrial applications. And that's where all of those high-growth opportunities sit. Also obviously, we're well aligned with the UN sustainability goals, and that sits front and center with the Water business as well."

            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining our third quarter financial review. We posted strong quarterly results, above our previously communicated guidance, in an extremely challenging environment due to uneven macro conditions and persistent inflation globally.  Our revenue growth of 4% versus the year ago period included solid organic growth of 11%. Customer demand remains strong across most of our key end markets, during the period, highlighted by double-digit volume increases in select areas, including Kalrez, Vespel, Laird, Semi, Water and Auto Adhesives.  To combat persistent inflationary headwinds in raw materials, logistics and energy, we continue to implement necessary pricing actions, which have fully offset such headwinds to date.  Given continued energy cost inflation, we now expect full year 2022 inflation of about $800 million year-over-year, which we anticipate will be fully offset by pricing actions.  Our third quarter results also demonstrated year-over-year operating EBITDA growth and margin improvement, reflecting DuPont's unique business mix, innovative solutions and highly diverse end markets as well as strong operational execution during the period. We are pleased to have reported strong performance during each of the first 3 quarters of 2022, and we remain firmly committed to continued strong execution in the coming periods.  Turning to Slide 4, I will comment on the details of our transformation progress. First, last week's announcement that we completed the sale of the majority of our M&M segment to Celanese marks the completion of our last contemplated large-scale divestiture for which we received $11 billion in gross cash. The M&M business is an excellent set of assets that we know will prosper, and we are confident that Celanese is the right owner going forward.  We are excited by the prospect of proving to the market that our multiyear transformation has brought DuPont to a truly different place. After the Dow merger, followed by the spins that created the new DuPont, we have further transformed our business with large-scale deals, including the N&B split-off and now the M&M transaction. We further sold 8 smaller businesses over the last 3 years, with proceeds totaling over $2 billion.  We are starting the next phase of our growth from a position of strength, leveraging highly profitable businesses with strong and leading market position centered in growing markets as well as a healthy balance sheet. These assets include some of the best intellectual property in their respective industry verticals with globally recognized brands familiar to us all as well as the thousands of long-time B2B industrial customers.  For DuPont, we are confident that our remaining mix of businesses offers a different dynamic with significantly lower volatility and higher expected long-term growth given our revenue mix. This is driven by a focus on secular tailwinds, including the 5G build-out and other electronics drivers, the global clean water infrastructure development, continued demand for safety and personal protection solutions, secular growth across multiple industrial technology verticals that we serve and from next-generation automotive growth. We believe we have built a portfolio that can perform alongside the best diversified industrial companies. Our businesses are aligned with secular growth trends, we deliver top-tier levels of profitability and we should clearly benefit from dampened business volatility compared to our portfolio from just a few years ago. These advantages are clear and will help us to generate superior shareholder value over time.  Regarding the Delrin divestiture process, we continue to advance our internal work required to divest that business. We are being diligent with our overall marketing process to ensure we maximize value in proper market conditions and expect to have completed a sale in 2023.  Before I move on, I'd like to briefly address the intended Rogers acquisition. We terminated this deal on November 1, which was the outside date of the transaction agreement originally signed a year ago. This was an unfortunate outcome in that the potential strategic fit of Rogers with our business was strong and we saw a lot of opportunity, but we're unable to secure regulatory approval for the transaction. We wish the Rogers team well.  For DuPont, the inability to close the acquisition has no material impact on our ongoing business outside of the obvious loss of opportunity. We remain confident in the quality of our portfolio and its growth potential, and we'll look to be opportunistic with select and targeted M&A moving forward.  Shifting to capital allocation on Slide 5. With the receipt of the proceeds from the M&M sale, we are now able to accelerate our capital return options and further strengthen our balance sheet, while maintaining flexibility to continue to grow the business through disciplined and targeted M&A.  Today, we announced that our Board has authorized a new $5 billion share repurchase program which expires June 30, 2024. We intend to act immediately and enter an accelerated share repurchase agreement for $3.25 billion of common stock which includes the remaining $250 million under the previous authorization. We anticipate completing this ASR within about 9 months, with 80% of the shares retired upfront during the fourth quarter. We currently expect to complete the full $5 billion of repurchases within the authorization period.  In addition, we will retire $2.5 billion of our senior notes due 2023 in the fourth quarter. The prepayment reduces refinancing risk in a rising rate environment, while generating pretax annualized savings of over $100 million. Further, we plan to reduce our commercial paper balance to 0 by year-end, of which we had $1.3 billion outstanding at the end of the third quarter.  In combination, the significant share repurchase authorization and our deleveraging plan demonstrates our continued commitment to returning capital to shareholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our approach remains balanced and in line with our overall capital allocation strategy. We expect to finish the year with a leverage ratio significantly below our longer-term target, maintaining balance sheet capacity to further allocate excess capital through a combination of bolt-on M&A and potential share repurchases over time. Our M&A focus remains on targets that fit within our growth pillars and are aligned with key secular growth trends.  With that, let me turn it over to Lori to discuss third quarter details as well as our financial outlook. Yes. Jeff, I think very good points you're making. We're in no rush to do an M&A deal. Eventually, especially in this environment. I don't think any of us know where things are actually headed. So we're going to take a pause here, see how the next set of months play out.  We do have targets we've been interested in for quite a period of time, whether they're actionable or not is another kind of story. And they clearly would be in the pillars of the secular growth areas, the 5 areas that we've talked about. So we're not going to deviate off into anything else. But we're in the same mode, I think, as your opening comment, Jeff, let things settle down. We've made a lot of moves. We've pretty much finished our transformation except still for the sale of Delrin, which will happen in 2023.  And so no rush to do anything. But we do have the capacity to do some bolt-on-type M&A, and that's the way we're thinking about it, is more on the bolt-on size of the deal. Yes. Well, on the export control issue in China, there's really 3 restrictions on that. And by the way I would put it in a category of it's more because of advanced chip technology. So the -- for instance, one of them is logic chips at 14 nanometers or below is restricted, it's one of the key ones.  So for us, it's not that big. Most of the fabs in China are not the high-end advanced chips. So if you look at it on an annual basis, if we are restricted and cannot get a license to supply that, there would be about $60 million of revenue for us on an annual basis, so say about $15 million on a quarterly basis, which we took that $15 million into account in our fourth quarter guide that we gave.  Overall, on the semi side, we look at the inventory index, for instance, like Gartner puts out and it's, give or take, 1.1 right now. If you kind of go back to the last downturn of semi back in 2019, it peaked out at 1.31. So just to give you a little bit of a parameter on where that sits. So it's on the high end. We think there's 2 or 3 quarters of correction there that we'll see. But the downturn in 2019 was like 6% to 7% year-over-year downturn. So just to give you some perspective. But at this point in time, it's not at the peak of where it was in the '19 time frame. No, Scott, it did not. Maybe we misstated it. We did cover all the costs. So our cost inflation, I think last quarter we reported we thought it was around $700 million. It's now $800 million for the year, and that's all based on mostly energy increase in Europe, as you're all aware of, on natural gas.  And by the way, just to give you kind of more color to that, we are obviously seeing commodities start to come off their peak. We thought we would start to maybe start seeing some benefit and hopefully we do in 2023. But then energy spike, so the energy just about to offset what we've been seeing the benefit on the commodity. So hopefully, now as we progress over the next months, we start to see some spread there, that would be helpful.  But no, we did implement more price increase. We covered the whole $800 million that we're going to have for the year at this point in time. And just to remind you, every price increase we did, we put it into the product cost. We did not do it as surcharges that would fluctuate off an index. So customers would have to negotiate with us when there's any price changes. Yes. Just to give you a perspective, we thought in the second half of the year, ICS would be up mid-single digits. Now it's down mid-single digits. So I think we've taken all that into account.  And by the way, just to remind you, it's hard to remember this, but we're already two quarters into the ICS, that whole PCB smartphone, laptop downturn. So they don't last forever, but we've already had 2 quarters of it. I like what I do now. Yes. Steve, it's going to be interesting for all of us going into 2023 as we work our way through it how carry through and handles this price cost issue because the commodities are definitely coming down pretty uniformly. Not crazy, but they're down 20%, 25% in many cases. So if the natural gas thing settles out, I think we've peaked on all this inflation and then how do we handle price cost as we move forward with all the price that we got. No, it's very simple. We did not get regulatory approval in China. It had been a full year. That was our outside date. And we ended it, which was the contractual agreement. So really, there's nothing more to it. Yes. I'll let Lori start out, and I'll add some color. And we have already, as a management team, laid out what those. So we'll do the stranded costs, as Lori said, but we've already laid out the detailed actions we do for some additional restructuring if we felt it was needed. And then I'll go back to the point I made a minute ago, there's a big lever in price cost that we're going to have to figure how that plays out through 2023. Let me say it this way, just by the way it's played out, some of the things we're interested in happened to be in Water and happened to be in the industrial technology space. So I guess if it stays their kind of targeted for down the road when we want to do something, it's probably not an issue that we would have to deal with. And who knows on the electronics? I just don't know the answer to that. We don't know what we don't know.  But having said that, I mean, we loved Rogers coming in because it added some tools in the toolkit. But we have a very comprehensive portfolio in electronics. With the Laird in there, it's really been beneficial. Laird has been performing awesome. And they've gotten -- as we highlighted, I think last earnings, they've gotten some wins for DuPont technology with some Laird customers. And also, I don't feel bad about where we're at, at all in the electronics side.  Again, it would have been nice to have Rogers, but -- and we're not probably looking at an electronics deal anyway at this point in time. So not going to be an issue. Well, first of all, and we said this in our prepared comments, we'll do the $5 billion repurchase. And by the way, we can be in the market -- in the open market doing some of that if we feel it's appropriate during the year, depending on what the economy is looking like. So it's -- the ASR will take us 8, 9 months, but we can be over the top doing some additional purchase. So we'll just see how that plays out. But -- and have the opportunity to do another ASR right on the heels, if that's how we want to handle it. So we have our options open to us there.  But we also have a fair amount of firepower as we kind of go through 2023, if you do the math. And again, it would be for bolt-on potential acquisition, but we also have the opportunity to do more share repurchase if we want. So we don't need to make those decisions now, but we'll contemplate that as we go through 2023. Yes, we got a peak pretty deep into it at this point in time. I mean the PCB players in China really shut down. So I think they're correcting their inventory really quickly. I mean, they truly shut down. It's not like they cut back on production. So I think they can fix things pretty quickly. And so I don't want to put a date on kind of building out of it. But again, we are pretty far into it months wise at this point in time. Well, I think for all of us, it's hard to totally answer that question because we never had inflation like this in at least in my career and raised prices as much as all of us have. So our game plan clearly is to keep a spread there because I'm a strong believer we have big intellectual property, a lot of our products are needed, they're the best in the industry and they should have good EBITDA margins with them. And generally, we do have very good EBIT margins across the board. So the game will be to keep that spread there.  But when you've had this kind of inflation, I don't think you'll hold on to all of it, and I don't think any company holds on to all of it, by and large, but can you keep a spread will be the real game. A lot of it, by the way, comes down to how you will individually model a recession scenario next year, and therefore, how do you model commodity inflation or deflation coming, because that's going to have a big bearing on all our -- all the multi-industrial companies if you start seeing that benefit.  And then back to a question earlier, can you hold some of that, I think is really going to be an interesting question for all the multi-industrials. So how that plays out is very different than any other recession we've been through. And we did -- just as a correction, we did see positive volume growth in Shelter in Q3. We're assuming that moderates a little bit going forward as Lori noted, given inventory in the channel. But it really hasn't changed materially in the order book today. Well, we -- so it's interesting. We're moving as fast as we can on the share repurchase. We can only take out so much volume so quick, so we'll move as fast as we can there. And then as we said earlier, just to puncture again, we are in no rush to do anything from a bolt-on M&A standpoint. We want to see how the economy is going to play out. There might even be a better entry point 6 months, 8 months, a year down the road. So I wouldn't answer that we have -- whatever excess cash we have at this point in time, there's really nothing we're going to do with it presently and we'll just monitor the next few months on that.  And remember, we still have to sell Delrin, so we don't have the money for that yet, and that's probably more towards the back half of 2023 at this point in time. Well, Lori manages it, and it's growing like a weed so I'll let her answer it. Yes. We think we can leverage it well with some of our other auto exposure, especially on the EV side. So we'll organize ourselves to advantage ourselves as we talk to that customer base that we have other products and opportunities to sell into. So it will advantage the adhesive business over time.  But by the way, we're feeling very good about our win rate there. And you can see by the organic growth, Lori, what was that? Yes, 25% growth is pretty spectacular in that business. And I don't see it slowing down just because of what Lori just described, the EV build rates coming over the next 5 years. Nothing really new to report, although we've been in pretty intense conversations. Just let you know; I am personally involved with my General Counsel. And we're really hoping we get to a resolution, but I don't want to put a time line on it.  But -- and just I think this is public knowledge. The judge has continued to encourage settlement talks with the plaintiffs here. And that's a good sign and potentially even using a mediator. And so we've made tremendous progress, but I don't want to put a time line on it. It's a continuing process. And you know very well, we want to get the water district cases settled, that's really the big focus for us. We lost Steve. Yes. So look, we made a fundamental decision, we did it a couple of years ago. We were losing some EBITDA at the expense of lowering working capital, and we decided to make that decision to get more in line going into 2023 with where we want to be from an inventory standpoint. Well, the biggest -- look, the biggest area always for us and it's quicker cycle is the E&I business and more centered in electronics business. We have an 8% R&D spend there. It's very, very robust, and we're constantly introducing new products in that area, Steve. But one of the areas we're really focusing on -- remember, one of the strengths at DuPont is the application engineering expertise. We live with our customers and we do design and work with them. And we're really focused on leveraging, for instance, the Laird platform with the existing DuPont technology.  So one of the things I was alluding to, we've got a couple of auto customers where Laird was already into an electromagnetic shielding thermal management and they have now been pulling in some DuPont applications and products for wiring protection and all that. So there's a lot of focus there on how can we get the synergies from a revenue standpoint from those. So I'd say that's the biggest area.  But remember, R&D for us is the heart of the company and application engineering is the heart of the company. So it's across the board here. we're very big on intellectual property. When we look to do a bolt-on, I think I mentioned this in my remarks, intellectual property to us is very key. And the ability to have strong application engineering across the board in all our end verticals is very key for us. And to your point, by the way, one of the big things we work on with our technology is right to the heart of the question you asked, is reducing the energy consumption. So we're working on technologies around that, and that could be cutting-edge for us, give us a competitive advantage."

Chris Mecray, you may begin your conference.\nChris Mecray: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for review of DuPont's Second Quarter 2022 Financial Results. Joining me today are Ed Breen, Chief Executive Officer; and Lori Koch, Chief Financial Officer.  We prepared slides to supplement our comments during this review, which are posted on the Investor Relations section of DuPont's website and through the webcast link. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the slides.  During this financial review, we'll make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Our 2021 Form 10-K, as updated by current and periodic reports, includes detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences.  Unless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today exclude significant items. We'll also refer to other non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in our press release and posted to the Investor page of our website.  I'll now turn the call over to Ed.\nEdward Breen: Good morning. Thank you for joining our second quarter financial review. We posted strong quarterly results above expectations in a difficult environment. Our top line revenue growth of 7% versus the year ago period included solid organic growth of 9%.  Overall, customer demand remained strong across our key end markets as E&I delivered a 6% volume increase, driven by ongoing strength in Semiconductor Technologies and Industrial Solutions.  In terms of inflation, our pricing actions continue to fully offset higher costs associated with raw materials, logistics and energy. Early in the quarter, our expectation for full year 2022 was about $600 million of increased costs, and that number has now risen to over $700 million, mainly due to higher energy and logistics costs. We still expect to remain price/cost-neutral in the second half and for the full year based on pricing actions we have taken.  Overall, our second quarter results reflect year-over-year and sequential earnings growth. These results highlight the strength of our end markets and our team's efforts to successfully navigate a challenging macro environment, which was further complicated by China's COVID lockdowns during the quarter. We were very pleased with the lockdowns alleviated by mid-June and that our China-based colleagues who operated diligently under difficult circumstances have been able to return to some form of normalcy. More broadly, our focus on execution continues to drive results as we increase our use of digital tools and other plant site investments to drive additional productivity and capacity release.  Finally, with regards to sustainability, I am pleased to highlight that last month, we announced our commitment to setting targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with the Paris Accord Science-Based Targets initiative, or SBTi. This is an important step toward reducing our overall climate impact, and it builds on our existing commitment to protect the planet by reducing the carbon footprint across our value chain in partnership with customers and suppliers.  Turning to Slide 4. I'd like to update you on key initiatives for 2022 stakeholder value creation, namely our portfolio transformation and our balanced approach to capital allocation. In addition, I will highlight our continued focus on growth execution on the following slide.  First, as it relates to the Rogers acquisition, the progress is being made on the required regulatory reviews, with China being the last jurisdiction outstanding. We expect the deal to close during the third quarter. Regarding Rogers' first quarter 2022 performance, we were satisfied with top line progress for the business, with growth in the high single digits, and we're especially pleased to see new wins and ongoing growth in the electric vehicle space. Rogers' business in the period was impacted by a price/cost gap and several operational challenges that held back full earnings potential, but we remain confident in the actions that the Rogers team is taking, and we expect improvement as we move forward.  For the M&M transactions, we are on track regarding timing associated with the M&M divestiture to Celanese, with a completion anticipated around year-end. We continue to make the necessary progress to separate the business, and we were pleased to see Celanese secure permanent financing in the last few weeks. We also continue to move forward with plans to divest the Delrin business and affirm our expectation for completion around midyear 2023.  This past July 1 marked the 1-year anniversary of our acquisition of Laird Performance Materials. I've commented previously on how successful this acquisition has been for us, including overall financial performance ahead of plan on both the top and bottom lines. We also continue to advance commercial synergy opportunities on top of cost synergies previously noted.  Finally, we completed the sale of the Biomaterials business at the end of May, which was the last of our previously announced noncore business divestitures. Since 2019, we generated gross proceeds of over $2.2 billion by divesting 8 noncore businesses, which collectively produced lower growth, lower margins and overall higher volatility in earnings. We received solid value for these divestitures, selling them at a low double-digit EBITDA multiple.  Shifting to capital allocation. We continue to pursue a balanced strategy that includes prioritizing the return of excess capital to shareholders as well as bolt-on M&A. During the second quarter, we repurchased $500 million of shares, bringing our year-to-date total to $875 million, which represents 2.5% of total shares outstanding. We anticipate completing the $500 million of authorization remaining on our existing share repurchase program during the remainder of this year.  As I noted during our last earnings call, given the magnitude of anticipated proceeds from the M&M divestitures, we expect there will be room to execute substantial, incremental share buybacks while disciplined M&A will also remain a key deployment priority over time as we continue to seek accretive and opportunistic transactions that can leverage our existing growth even further.  Finally, our balance sheet remains strong. And this remains a key priority, particularly in uncertain, volatile macro environment.  Turning to Slide 5. Another key value driver for us is innovation-led growth. Greater focus on secular high-growth end markets in electronics, water, protection, industrial technologies and next-generation automotive will serve as a sound basis for our organic growth execution. We continue to invest actively in both advancing the technology within our existing product portfolio and also introducing new products around the pillars highlighted here, with an overall R&D investment rate of around 4% of total sales, in line with best-in-class peers. This investment is coupled with substantial application engineering focus where our technical personnel have a seat at our customers' table in the design phases of their products.  This past quarter, we had a number of highlights, which we note on the slide, but I'd emphasize that we are proud to have won 4 Edison Awards across different technology platforms, and we continue to make progress in introducing new technologies, such as applications and EV batteries, which have strong growth potential.  With that, let me turn it to Lori to discuss the details of the quarter as well as our financial outlook.\nLori Koch: Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. As Ed mentioned, we saw continued strong demand during the quarter in key end markets, with volumes higher than our expectations coming into the quarter. Cost inflation intensified further compared to previous estimates, but additional pricing actions are anticipated to fully offset these higher costs. These factors, along with our team's continued strong execution focus, contributed to both top and bottom line results well above expectations for the quarter. We also delivered a consistent operating EBITDA margin on both a year-over-year and sequential basis.  Focusing on financial highlights for the quarter on Slide 6. Net sales of $3.3 billion increased 7% as reported versus the second quarter of 2021 and increased 9% on an organic basis. The acquisition of Laird, partially offset by noncore divestitures, provided a 1% net tailwind in net sales, while currency was a 3% headwind during the quarter as the U.S. dollar strengthened against key currencies, including the euro and the yen.  Organic sales growth included 8% pricing gains and 1% higher volume. Volume growth reflects continued strong demand in key end markets, namely semiconductor, general industrial, water and construction, muted primarily by lower volumes for protective garments within Safety Solutions. These factors resulted in organic sales growth during the quarter, up 9% for W&P, 8% for E&I and 15% for the retained businesses of the former M&M segment they report in corporate, which predominantly reflects our adhesive portfolio tied to next-generation auto.  On a regional basis, we delivered organic sales growth in all 4 regions globally, including volume increases in Asia Pacific, North America and Latin America. In China, organic sales growth was up slightly versus the year ago period, and volumes in China were up low single digits sequentially from first quarter despite government-mandated lockdowns in parts of the country into early June.  From an earnings perspective, operating EBITDA of $829 million was up 6% versus the year ago period, and adjusted EPS of $0.88 per share increased 11%. The increase in operating EBITDA was driven by pricing actions, stronger earnings contribution from the Laird acquisition and volume gains, which more than offset higher inflationary cost pressures.  Operating EBITDA margin of 25% was slightly better than our expectations set earlier this quarter and flat on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. Our pricing actions have fully offset cost inflation on a dollar basis but have impacted EBITDA margins.  Our operating EBITDA margin adjusted to exclude price/cost with 26.6% or 150 basis points higher than the year ago, driven by productivity and higher volume. Our incremental margin was 22% on an as-reported basis. Excluding the impact of price/cost, incremental margin for our core businesses was almost 60%, demonstrating strong cost discipline and operational productivity.  From a cash perspective, cash flow from operations during the quarter of $86 million and capital expenditures of $135 million resulted in a free cash outflow of $49 million. Working capital was an additional headwind during the quarter as we continue to secure inventory given tight supply chains and incur higher inventory costs related to inflation. We expect improvement in free cash flow during the second half of the year, consistent with our typical pattern and factoring in a reduction of working capital level. As we separate the M&M business, we continue to encourage transaction-related expenses, with over $100 million of transaction costs incurred during the second quarter and about $700 million in costs related to the M&M separations expected in full year 2022. These costs, combined with higher working capital related to the M&M business that we are divesting, are significant headwinds to our 2022 cash flow.  Turning to Slide 7. Adjusted EPS of $0.88 per share increased 11% compared to $0.79 per share in the year ago period. Higher volumes and earnings from Laird provided a benefit to adjusted EPS in the quarter of $0.11 per share. These gains were partially offset by weaker mix in W&P related to lower garment production and Kapton's plant start-up costs totaling $0.03 per share. A lower share count from ongoing share repurchases provided a $0.04 benefit to adjusted EPS, while other below-the-line items, including a higher tax rate and exchange gains, netted to a $0.03 headwind.  Our base tax rate for the quarter was 22.6%, up slightly from 21.8% in the first quarter and up notably from the year ago period given certain discrete tax benefits recorded in the prior year, resulting from tax law changes. We are maintaining an expected base tax rate range for the full year 2022 of 21% to 23%.  Turning to segment results, beginning with E&I on Slide 8. E&I delivered net sales growth of 16%, including 8% organic growth, an 11% portfolio benefit from Laird and a 3% headwind from currency.  Organic growth for E&I included a 6% increase in volume and a 2% increase in pricing. The line of business view, organic sales growth was led by Semiconductor Technologies, which increased mid-teens as strong demand continued, led by the ongoing transition to more advanced node technologies and ongoing high semiconductor fab utilization, along with growth in 5G communications and data centers.  Within Industrial Solutions, organic sales growth was up high single digits, led by continued demand for OLED materials for displays, ongoing strength for Kalrez semi CapEx-related product offerings, Vespel products serving recovering aerospace markets and for health care applications such biopharma tubing.  Interconnect Solutions sales decreased low single digits on an organic basis as expected due to a slight volume decline. Volume gains for films and laminates in certain industrial end markets were more than offset by lower smartphone volumes due to the anticipated return to more normal seasonal order pattern compared to last year and the including softness in China smartphones. The business was also impacted somewhat by lower global PC and tablet demand and continued constraints in automotive production.  Looking forward, we expect similar growth patterns for Semiconductor Technologies and Industrial Solutions to continue into the second half of 2022. Within interconnect, we expect to return to positive organic growth in the second half given seasonal strength and added capacity from our Kapton expansion.  For the full year, we expect Interconnect Solutions to be up low to mid-single digits on an organic basis. This reflects a slight decline from our previous expectations as supply chain constraints and softer consumer demand are expected to mute volumes for smartphones, PCs and tablets.  Operating EBITDA for E&I of $480 million increased 13% as strong earnings from Laird, volume gains and pricing actions were partially offset by higher raw material and logistics costs.  Operating EBITDA margin of 31.4% reflects sequential improvement of 40 basis points. On a year-over-year basis, operating EBITDA margin was down 70 basis points due primarily to a 100-basis-point headwind from price/cost.  Turning to Slide 9. W&P delivered net sales growth of 6% as organic sales growth of 9% was partially offset by a 3% headwind from currency. Organic growth for W&P reflects a 12% increase in price and a 3% volume headwind. Pricing gains reflect broad-based actions across the segment, most notably in Shelter and Safety Solutions. Volume declines were driven by Safety Solutions.  From a line of business view, organic sales growth was led by Shelter Solutions, which increased high teens, driven by pricing actions and continued robust demand in North America residential construction as well as ongoing growth in commercial construction and strength in repair- and remodel-related demand during the quarter.  Within Safety Solutions, sales were up mid-single digits on an organic basis as pricing actions were partially offset by lower Tyvek volumes, given the shift from garments to other end market applications and the resulting negative impact of increased manufacturing line changeovers on overall production.  Sales for Water Solutions were up mid-single digits on an organic basis on pricing gains and continued steady demand for water filtration technologies, muted by supply chain constraints in Asia Pacific due to COVID lockdowns in China and an earthquake in Japan impacting our production.  Operating EBITDA for W&P of $348 million declined 1% versus last year as pricing actions taken to offset higher costs are more than offset by volume declines.  Operating EBITDA margin of 23.2% was 170 basis points below the year ago period as the impact of price/cost was an approximate 200-basis-point headwind to margins. Excluding the price/cost impact, operating EBITDA margin was over 25%.  I'll close with a few comments on our financial outlook on Slide 10. We are still seeing solid demand, and our order book is sound in most of our end markets. However, future uncertainties continue to exist in the macro environment driven by inflationary pressure, challenging supply chain and U.S. dollar strength. Our teams remain focused keenly on execution, and we are concentrated on a leverage within our control in order to continue to drive value for our shareholders.  For the full year 2022, we are narrowing our adjusted EPS range while maintaining the midpoint of our previous range. We now expect full year adjusted EPS in the range of $3.27 to $3.43 per share versus our previous range of $3.20 to $3.50 per share.  We are updating our full year '22 net sales guidance range to be between $13 billion and $13.4 billion reflecting a $200 million of incremental foreign currency headwinds, along with the removal of about $120 million in net sales related to the Biomaterials business, given its divestiture at the end of May. We continue to expect organic sales growth for the year to be up high single digits.  After adjusting the high end of our operating EBITDA guidance primarily for incremental currency headwinds and the removal of the Biomaterials business, we now expect full year 2022 operating EBITDA to be between $3.25 billion and $3.35 billion.  For third quarter 2022, we expect net sales to be between $3.17 billion and $3.37 billion and operating EBITDA to be about $810 million. We expect third quarter net sales and operating EBITDA to be slightly weaker than the second quarter as sequential volume increases are expected to be offset by further foreign currency headwinds and the absence of the Biomaterials business. We are also expecting impact during the third quarter on operating EBITDA of approximately $15 million from unplanned downtime at our W&P screw-in site in Virginia associated with an unforeseen utility disruption from a third-party supplier.  On a year-over-year basis, we expect third quarter net sales to be up 2% at the midpoint and up high single digits on an organic basis. We expect third quarter 2022 adjusted EPS of approximately $0.81 per share.  With that, we are pleased to take your questions, and let me turn it back to the operator to open the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research.\nJeffrey Sprague: Ed or Lori, could you just comment on kind of the visibility on the top line in the back half kind of around some of the economic worry points, right, the U.S. resi, some of the consumer electronic, cell phone and the like? Just what you're seeing from your customer and channel partners there and your comfort level that that's all dialed now properly relative to the guidance.\nEdward Breen: Yes, Jeff. So we looked over the weekend at our order rates as of the end of last week, and across the board, our order rates are hanging right in there where we would expect them to be. The only softness that we've seen, which we've mentioned before, is smartphones in China. Demand is down, and I don't know how much of that is because of the lockdowns versus just true demand down. And we're seeing some lightness on the PCB board side, which is really for PCs, tablets, things like that, not significant but a little bit of a downdraft there. And besides that, everything, at least in our order rate, is holding in.  And now remember, we have a really solid look, I would say, on our orders out about 30 days and the bulk of the businesses, some of them longer than that. Like, the water business is actually some months. So we're a little bit shorter cycle on the order rate. But as we sit today, it looks like things are hanging in there.  We have seen no downdraft to your specific point on the construction side. Both the resi was -- order rates are good in the last week. The commercial was good, and the do-it-yourself piece of that business was still good.  By having said that, Jeff, we're not naive. We see data points out there. And obviously, we're doing recession planning, just to be ready if things do soften up. But at this point in time, I'm not seeing it.\nJeffrey Sprague: Great. And then just wondering back to the ultimate deployment of cash, particularly as it comes to the M&M proceeds. Is it still your bias to wait until that cash is in the door? Or now that Celanese has secured funding and maybe we're a little bit further down the kind of regulatory path, perhaps there's some comfort to get a running start on some of that.\nEdward Breen: Yes, Jeff. So we're talking to the Board about it, and just to reiterate the prepared comments we made, we're clearly thinking heavy on a share repurchase here with the amount of cash available. But -- and I wouldn't say the cash has to be in the door. I just want to see kind of -- I'd use the term green lights through town that the timing is what we think we're going to be ready to do this by November 1 with all the internal work, both we're doing and Celanese is doing. But my gut is by the time you get through regulatory, we and -- our comment was kind of end of the year right at the first of the year 2023. So -- but you never know with regulatory and if there's COVID lockdowns, you just -- you don't know for sure. So I just want to get closer, and then we'll make a final decision.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research.\nScott Davis: Ed, you mentioned in your remarks, Rogers is having kind of a challenging price/cost, I think you said, GAAP. Is it off the deal model then for '22? Is it materially off or it impacts kind of your '23 look at it?\nEdward Breen: Yes. So the night -- there's a good and a bad. I guess I'll just put it that way. The good is the revenue line is right on what the planning assumptions were, and the win rate is looking really, really nice. The EBITDA is off the planning model, and by the way, I'd say it's for -- putting price/cost aside, which you can catch up on, which will happen, there were 4 or 5 operational issues that have been hitting them that are really impacting the EBITDA percent. By the way, all fixable, all within the control of the team to fix those. So we expect improvement to come.  And by the way, I'll just give you 2. One of them is not really even something they can control. They're being shorted as the whole industry is on the silicon side, and it's a very high-margin application for them. So obviously, we're trying to -- they're trying to secure more silicon supply. And at some point here, that'll even out, but that's off.  And then just to give you one other example, they used more contract manufacturing because they're bringing up a facility that they -- that had a fire in it that they're bringing that back up online. But in the meantime, to satisfy the customers, they're using contract manufacturing, which is really eating into the margin of that business. So that's 2 examples, but there's 3 other ones.  So those things, that's being worked on, and they're getting ready to launch that facility again and bring the production back in-house. So it's items like that. We'll work through that. My hope and gut is we'll be in good shape going into 2023 as we get these operational issues fixed.\nLori Koch: Yes, I think to Ed's point too just on the top line, one of the areas that we're really impressed with is their penetration in EV. And so they've seen really nice growth there. We'll continue to take advantage of the opportunity, especially the combined opportunity in DuPont when we put it together with our EV applications. I think we've mentioned, in the past, the 2 portfolios generate about $400 million of revenue today. So we're excited to get those 2 together and see what we can do.\nScott Davis: Right. And then just on Laird, I assume based on what I see in the slides here that Laird is a little ahead of its steel model?\nEdward Breen: Yes. Both revenue and earnings are ahead. And we got good synergies out of that. We're getting -- we're probably about 80% through that. We've identified real solidly $63 million in synergies. But what I'm more excited about on Laird, and I think the same is going to play out with Rogers, is really the revenue opportunities between the 2 as Lori was sort of just alluding to. We just had another one in European auto, customer who Laird had a direct relationship with and we were able to use some of our existing DuPont technology and an application to resolve an issue for them. And it seems like a nice new revenue stream with that customer. So that's really exciting with the kind of putting this tool kit together.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.\nCharles Tusa: On this -- the price/cost side, what's your estimate for the year now? I think you had $350 million in raw material headwind prior. This quarter, obviously, inflation is tough, but this quarter seemed a little bit higher than I was expecting. And then also, are you including logistics in that? And if not, I think you had given like a $225 million headwind prior. Maybe just an update on those two.\nLori Koch: Yes. So we're now expecting between raw materials, logistics and higher energy costs about $700 million. So it's about a $100 million increase from where we were sitting when we did the prior earnings call. But we still expect to fully cover that with price increases. So we'll be net-neutral on the bottom line. It just creates the headwinds on the margin profile as we have telegraphed. It was about 150 basis points in total this quarter. So underlying -- we held flat on margins year-over-year. But if you take out that delta, we were actually up about 140, 150 basis points, a nice leverage through the P&L.\nEdward Breen: Steve, I'll breakdown for you because you were just using raws. The breakdown of the inflation is about 60% is raws, 20% is logistics, and 20% is energy. Just to give you kind of a feel for it. And by about 70% of our inflation is in the W&P segment, where you can see we got phenomenal pricing.\nCharles Tusa: Yes. That energy cost, was that previously recorded through the raw materials line? I don't recall you guys kind of breaking that out explicitly. Had that been running through that raw materials number in prior quarters? Or is that new line item?\nLori Koch: It would have been in the raw -- yes, it wouldn't have been in the raws, but it would have been in the total $600 million. So it's not new in total. But the increase from the prior $600 million to the current $700 million is really primarily the increase in energy costs and then the knock-on effect to logistics as we see higher fuel costs.\nCharles Tusa: Yes. Okay. That makes a lot of sense. And then just one last one on the W&P business, I guess, how do you see that performing through -- let's say, you have kind of a consumer recession where housing takes a bit of a hit. I mean can that business grow through that on a volume basis? Or is there kind of too much cyclical exposure in that business? How do you look at that business through that type of recession?\nEdward Breen: Well, remember, Steve, one of the -- first of all, it just depends how deep recession is. So far, it's a hard one to answer. But remember that the Tyvek product line, which is one of the biggest segments in there, that's a sold-out asset. So we can divert product to other end markets. For instance, we are shorting right now, unfortunately, the medical market -- medical packaging market. We're trying to work through that backlog as we speak. So we have other applications for it in the sold-out asset. And by the way, I think the water business -- just to use W&P, I think the water business would hold in there pretty well in a recession.  So yes, we'll see some effect of it. Nomex would probably go down a little bit. Kevlar might go down a little bit, but I think we can hang in there pretty well.\nLori Koch: And I think you know the statistics, just to be sure. So the residential piece of construction is about 40%. The rest is 40% commercial and then about 20% repair and remodel. In the commercial, the largest end markets underneath there are more on the health care side and the restaurant side. So those are -- they make up the bulk of the commercial opportunity for us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Walsh from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nJohn Walsh: Just following up to Steve's question there, maybe we could talk a little bit on the pricing side. You highlighted strong pricing there in W&P. But as you look forward, where do you think you have the most structural pricing? And then where might you have to give back as potentially we see some material deflation in the future?\nEdward Breen: Yes. Well, John, that is a great question. We talk about it all the time. So we made a, I'd say, strategic decision that all the price increases we did were all baked into the product price. So we did not do surcharges that are tied to some index or something like that. So I feel good about the approach that we took. And obviously, our goal, if a recession hits and commodity costs come down, would be to then get a gap, maintain a gap going forward where obviously, we're maintaining more price than the decrease on the commodity.  And we're -- by the way, we've been working on these scenarios for the last month with our teams like where do we feel and how much can we hold in each of our end markets. But our goal is going to clearly be to hold a gap so that we can help our EBITDA margin percent, which is -- as Lori just mentioned, obviously, has been hit the other way with the price/cost thing but where we can benefit from it. So I won't get into each end market, but I think we have the opportunity to do what I just said. To what extent, we'll see as it plays out.  But that -- by the way, that's interesting. And this -- if a recession hits, that's the one thing that is very, very different for companies like ours and many others, where in the past, you didn't have this dynamic. You had a recession, you were cutting your costs or whatever you did. And this time, you have -- this is probably the single biggest dynamic that improved financial performance that clearly we have and many, many global companies have.\nJohn Walsh: No, that's a very interesting perspective. And then the $15 million headwind that you're going to see in W&P in Q3, does that fully reverse out in Q4? And kind of what's the confidence level that, that third party can get beyond their disruption?\nEdward Breen: So we're already getting past the disruption. We've been bringing lines up this week. This problem hit 1.5 weeks ago. And it's just -- it's a safety issue, by the way. We have to methodically go through, look at all the lines, what ended up being cogs just caught stuck in them when it went down. So it's a little bit of a process. But we're bringing some lines up a day ago, and later today, we bring a line up again. So we know we're out of the problem here over the next few days. But we don't make that up. Because for instance, Tyvek is one of the products -- big products there. It's a sold-out asset. So we can only make so much, and we're sold out.  But by the way, just to give you a sequence from the third to the fourth quarter, you see a little bit of a lift, which is not necessarily the seasonal pattern. But what's happening there is we have the Spruance not being down, so we don't have that third quarter to fourth quarter problem. We'll be running full tilt there. We have a new water line that we've been telling you about that's coming up at Edina, which will give us incremental volume. On a sold-out business, also our reverse osmosis product line.  And then remember, we have the Kapton line coming up in our electronics business and our Circleville facility, and they all hit in the fourth quarter and give us the incremental volume. And Kapton's also a sold-out asset. So we're not expecting a sequential third to fourth necessary change in demand in the marketplace. They just happen to be the sold-out assets where we start getting some production out of them.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn McNulty: I believe about 20% of your sales come from the EMEA region. Can you give us a little bit of color as to your exposure to Germany and any precautions that you're taking or any levers that you can pull if there are any issues with regard to gas and power as we kind of progress through the rest of the season?\nLori Koch: Yes. Right now, we're not expecting any material impact as they start to ration energy in Germany. There's one plant site in our existing go-forward portfolio that doesn't use it, so we don't see an impact there. It's in the businesses that we retained from M&M. M&M does have a plant in Germany so that they could be impacted minimally if there were some rationing going on there. But as we see it right now, we don't see a headwind from a utilization perspective. We'll obviously continue to watch the European natural gas prices, which have an impact on primarily W&P and the Remainco portfolio. They've got a few plant sites in Europe. So they're up again. I think they were EUR 210 or so as of the last couple of days. So we'll continue to keep an eye on those to see where that moves.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. Okay. And then just in the Tyvek garment business, I guess how far back to normal or reversing kind of that big surge would you say we are? And it sounds like you had some incremental headwinds that aren't just on the mix shift but also on the line shifting. I guess can you break that out in terms of how much of a hit that might have been on the margin and how we should be thinking about that going forward through the rest of the year?\nLori Koch: Yes. So in the second quarter, garment volumes were down about $40 million. So we were able to make up a little of that with increasing sales in the medical and other end markets. But in total, garments were down $40 million. We expect that to be a hit again in 3Q on a year-over-year basis. And then in the fourth quarter, we start to get out of that year-over-year comp headwind.  The piece too on the production side, you -- not so much a demand because you can shift the demand to other end markets from the garments. It's more around the product produced that you net out to a headwind. And so when we were making garments, we were able to just run garments the entire time and minimize the changeovers on the lines. Now that we're back to a more normal product mix, we're having to have more changeovers than we had last year, so therefore, translating to lower pounds produced.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Christopher Parkinson from Mizuho.\nChristopher Parkinson: Just pretty much a corollary of the last 2.5 questions or so. Can you just give us your updated thoughts on the intermediate- to long-term margin outlook for W&P, just given the question about structural price increases, improving reliability across the asset base, product mix and so on and so forth? Just any updated color there and your confidence in those numbers would be very helpful.\nEdward Breen: Yes. I'll give you really both of the bigger businesses here. I think E&I, and you've seen us do this ex the price cost, we should be able to run that 32%, 33% EBITDA margin. And this quarter, we weren't far off of that and then a little bit of price/cost there. And I think that's about where that will run and pretty consistently have been there.  In the W&P business, we really think we can get that over time to kind of more of a 27%, 28% business. Now by the way, we're planning on getting some of that as commodities at some point here, drift down, and we maintain, as I mentioned a minute ago, some incremental pricing above that. But then internally, in our own control is really capacity release at our facilities. And that would be specifically on Tyvek, our water assets, and our Nomex product line would be the big ones for continued capacity release.  And in our prepared remarks, Chris, one of the things you see we've been working heavily on is working on a lot of digital tools that we're implementing on our facilities that are helping us on the reliability side. These are big heavy assets on the W&P side, so you get a 1% improvement. You get quite a bit of throughput. So we're really spending our time working kind of our operational excellence playbook. And that's what will really help us on the W&P to keep incrementing that up.\nLori Koch: Yes. I think as we look towards the second half, we don't see any material margin movement in the second half versus the first half. We were around 23%, more like 25%, 26% when you take away the price/cost headwinds in the first half. And so as we look to the second half, we would expect that same 23% roughly underlying and then you have 25-ish, 26% when you take away the price/cost headwind.\nChristopher Parkinson: That's very helpful. And just as a very quick follow-up. To the extent you can, can you just give us a little bit more color on the expectations for Delrin versus your commentary over the past few quarters in terms of price, number of suitors and so on and so forth?\nEdward Breen: Yes, Chris. So what we've been doing on Delrin is we've been working on standing it up. It was a division in a division. So it was a little extra of work for us. We finished up the data room. We're going to actually really launch the process here in the early fall. We're just waiting to get through the summer. So I can't give you any color commentary on detailed number of people. But I would think it's more strategics that are going to be interested in this asset. By the way, it's a business that has 30% EBITDA margins. It's doing very well still in this environment. So that's probably the timing of it. And that's why we said, so if that's the timing, by the time you get to the -- to close the deal, you're probably about the middle of 2023. And that would really be the end of the kind of the divestiture and getting the portfolio where we want it. But now remember that asset is already in discontinued operations.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America.\nStephen Byrne: I wanted to ask you a little bit about your semiconductor business and a couple of potential longer-term drivers, one being whether the product mix is potentially shifting with any of the semiconductor fabs that you support where they are shifting to other products. Is that possible? Is that a way for those businesses to remain pretty robust? And then the other driver being the new semiconductor fabs under construction, do you have already some awarded business for fabs that are coming online in the intermediate term?\nLori Koch: Yes. I think as to your first part of your question, I don't see them changing the product mix that they make on the fabs, but they can kind of shift around the end markets. And so we've seen them move away as there's been some weakness in the consumer electronics space to more of the data center applications, where the demand remains very, very robust, which is favorable to our portfolio, just given the higher advanced technologies associated with those end market data center applications. And so you can see in our results in the second quarter, we continue to post very strong results. And we're well positioned as we go forward to take advantage of the increase in the fabs through the construction that's taking place.  And so right now, I believe, over the next few years, we'll bring on an incremental about 7% capacity when it comes to wafer starts, and we're very well positioned. We've got great relationships with the majority of those fabs that are putting in capacity. And so while it's hard to say if you want any new capacity from those new lines coming on, I don't know if they actually have had all that in place, but we'll continue to maintain very strong relationships with those large players that are putting in capacity.  We've said in the past that we'll be about 200 to 300 basis points ahead of MSI growth. We're posting those results this year. So I don't see any reason why we wouldn't continue to do that. And I think it's important to know, the semi market and the revenue that's posted is a function of both price and volume. And our exposure is to the volume piece. And so price can be volatile in the semi market. That doesn't impact our results. It's really a focus on the wafer starts and the MSI so that the millions of square inches of wafer is produced.\nStephen Byrne: And Ed, just curious if you can comment on any update on PFAS litigation settlement discussions.\nEdward Breen: Yes. It's ongoing conversations. And as you know, the judge just encouraged that to go on. But I don't have anything new to say. We continue to have pretty consistent conversations to try to resolve the issues, and I'm still optimistic. But nothing new to say.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.\nDavid Begleiter: Just on your EV exposure with Rogers, how large will be and what type of growth are you looking forward to going forward?\nLori Koch: Yes. So we see the opportunity in EV between our portfolio and Rogers' portfolio to be about $250 a car. So a really nice content number. As I had mentioned earlier, today, we have about $400 million of revenue between the 2 portfolios. So about $200 million coming in from Rogers and about $200 million in our existing portfolio, which is predominantly made up of adhesives. And then we have a Nomex paper application for the e-motor piece. So a very nice opportunity, as I had mentioned for the 2 companies to come together to continue to drive opportunities in the space. It's a really high growth rate as we've mentioned before, too. So EV applications are, overall, growing in the mid-teens, ADAS applications even higher than that. We've got a nice ADAS portfolio today with the incoming Laird acquisition, so lots of opportunities for growth.\nDavid Begleiter: Great. And just on tieback between now when Line 8 comes online, is there anything you can do to bring out more -- get more capacity or further improve the mix in this business to keep on growing earnings until the new capacity is on stream?\nLori Koch: Yes. That's a key opportunity for us is to continue to get capacity to release also sold-out assets. And so during a pandemic, recall that we brought Line 1 back up, so we were able to bring on a little bit of incremental capacity. Line 1 is the oldest line in the portfolio, so it doesn't have as much production as the newer lines, but it was incremental capacity for us. So we'll continue to try to get more pounds off of all the lines between both Spruance and Luxembourg as we await the new Tyvek asset, which we expect sometime around the end of 2023.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.\nVincent Andrews: Ed, well articulated that your preference is for share buybacks with the proceeds, but you still mentioned bolt-on. So if you could just give us an update on what's out there and then maybe give us an update on -- I think in the past, you've sort of sized bolt-ons. So maybe you just want to redefine what a bolt-on could look like on a go-forward basis.\nEdward Breen: Yes. Thanks for the question, Vincent. So any bolt-on that we would do, first of all, would be on 1 of the 5 pillars that we talk about. And we've been looking at things that are -- let me say, a bolt-on would be more like Laird, not as big as Rogers. That $1 billion, $2 billion type range, and it would be something that would bring additional technology to play in one of those pillars that was, back to the electronics example, just give us more tools in the toolkit to resolve issues for our customers because we're so strong in application engineering, and we're really seeing the benefit of that with Laird tied together with the DuPont electronics portfolio. I know we're going to see it with the Rogers one. So it would be something like that in one of those pillars that we would look at.\nVincent Andrews: Okay. And then just may be less of an issue for your -- for the refined DuPont portfolio now. But in the past, when we've been in these tricky macro outlooks we'd get into 4Q, and customers could destock more than they typically do seasonally just sort of to manage uncertainty going into year-end. Are you picking up any whiff of that in your sort of C-level to C-level conversations or anything that we should be thinking about?\nEdward Breen: No, we're not, and trust me, we're watching it closely. But no, we're not seeing that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov from KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nAleksey Yefremov: In your E&I segment overall and in semis in particular, is your outlook for third quarter kind of better or worse or about in line with normal seasonality?\nLori Koch: I would say it's in line with normal seasonality, so the -- with the one exception of we will start to return to posting growth within the Interconnect Solutions business on a year-over-year basis, just given that last year was a little odd with respect to the smartphone shipments of what they normally do this year. It's more on a normal pattern. So you saw the headwind in the first half as we posted volume declines. We expect to have volume increases in the second half within the Interconnect Solutions. That's a year-over-year basis, but sequentially, no, no material change to our usual pattern, with the one exception, as Ed had mentioned, that the Kapton line coming on, which will provide some incremental revenue in the back half of the year.\nAleksey Yefremov: Makes sense. And to follow up on W&P, your margin comments that margins would be similar in the back half compared to the first half, is this also a function of the outage that you see? Because I seem to remember you were expecting higher margins in the back half. Is this still an expectation maybe just delayed into fourth quarter or first quarter of '23?\nLori Koch: Yes. I mean I think maybe coming into the year, we had expected some margin improvement as we went into the back half, but the last quarter and this quarter, we've seen those more flatten out. It's a function of, one, the incremental price headwinds that we've seen. So a lot of it is that. So recall back when we originally gave guidance for the full year, we thought overall raw materials, logistics and energy would only be $350 million. That number has now went to $700 million as we have mentioned, and the majority of that increase is in W&P. So that creates as reported margin headwind for us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Josh Spector from UBS.\nJoshua Spector: I guess within Safety Solutions, can you comment on how the business, excluding Tyvek is running? I guess is there anything materially different there we should be thinking about from a volume perspective that might be better or worse relative to industrial production or any other metrics we should be looking out for?\nLori Koch: Yes. No, those are generally performing well. We had a little bit of a shortfall in the second quarter with access to raw materials within our Nomex. So it really wasn't a structural demand issue or an operational issue. It's we couldn't get access to some of the key inputs to make the Nomex product. But nothing to work through on the aramid side as far as asset utilization like we're seeing on the Tyvek side with the increased changeovers as we ride through the garment change.\nJoshua Spector: I guess just on the demand side as well, anything changing through the quarter? Or are you seeing any weakening with customers may be pulling back on spending? Or is demand still relatively steady?\nLori Koch: No, demand is still steady in different markets, yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Sison from Wells Fargo.\nMichael Sison: Nice quarter. In terms of Rogers, can you remind us what type of sales growth you expect in 2022? It sounds like it's coming on plan and looks pretty good. And then if there is a shortfall versus the $270 million in EBITDA, it sounds like, as you head into '23, the bulk of the shortfall will be somewhat within their control to close the gap?\nEdward Breen: Yes, the items they're having operationally all are in their control, I would say, except for the silicon supply, which obviously we're having the same issues here, so we understand it.  But yes, the others are in their control, so they can work through those. As you said, it hopefully tee up well for of 2023. The modeling, by the way, for them was for growth in the high single digits in 2022. And they hit that, obviously, in the first quarter. I can't say anything about the second quarter. I'm not allowed to, but we would expect them to perform high single digits this year on top line. So that's nice, and to Lori's point a few minutes ago, they're really seeing nice opportunities as we are on the EV side. So feeling good about that work through the operational issues.\nMichael Sison: Got it. And as a quick follow-up, at the midpoint for your 2022 guidance would imply that the fourth quarter could be up sequentially versus the third quarter. That's seasonally difficult, I guess, when you look back historically. So any thoughts on why it could be better fourth quarter versus third, if you were to hit the midpoint?\nLori Koch: Yes. So the math you're getting to is about a $30 million sequential increase from 3Q at approximately $810 million, and then you back into about $840 million. So it's really coming from 3 primary drivers. One is you don't have the headwind from the outage at Spruance. And so we had sized that at $15 million. So you're able to get that volume back in the fourth quarter. And then the other 2 key drivers are the capacity additions that we have from the water asset that we spoke about earlier and then Kapton getting production off that cap online. So no underlying change in market of those 3 items.\nOperator: Your next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi.\nPrashant Juvekar: What do you see in terms of semiconductor shortages? And how quickly can automotive production come back? Do you think it's a snapback next year? Or is it more of an extended recovery in '23 and '24?\nLori Koch: Yes. I mean I think the expectations right now are for 86 million cars produced next year. That's off of 80 million this year, so still well below the high 90s where we used to be. So there's still some opportunity. We see continued strength and growth heading into 2024. Obviously, it will all depend on is the semiconductor chip shortage resolving itself. But even beyond that, I mean, the third quarter is expected to be up 22% and 7% sequentially. So it feels like things are getting a little bit better there as we resolve some of the supply chain issues.\nEdward Breen: P.J., I had also mentioned, back to points Lori was talking about earlier too, we very much care about production on the EV side of things. The new portfolio -- new DuPont portfolio is very much weighted towards that and not the ICE engine. We are more ICE engine-related, I'll say, because of the M&M portfolio, which, by the way, M&M will also sell nice in the EVs. But this new portfolio was very EV-driven. So the growth rate of that becomes way more important. Obviously, we like the overall growth rate of autos to go up, but it's even very weighted towards that piece.\nPrashant Juvekar: Great. And quickly, another question on China. You talked about slowdown in smartphones, but what about the property market there, which has been under pressure. And I know the government is trying to revive it. What are you seeing there? And what's your exposure to the property market in China?\nLori Koch: Yes, we actually saw sequential improvement in China, 2Q over 1Q, and that was on top of that extended lockdown. So we were pleased with the results there. To your specific question on the construction market, we don't really have a construction footprint in China. So it wouldn't impact our overall business. The majority of our construction is in the U.S. and in Japan within Asia.\nOperator: Your next question comes from our last caller for today, Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research.\nFrank Mitsch: Just a follow-up on China, actually. You did 6% organic growth in Asia. Obviously, the data on PMI that just came out was somewhat concerning. What are you actually seeing right now in the third quarter as you progress in that part of the world?\nLori Koch: Yes. We expect to see improvement in China again into the third quarter. And so while we still year-over-year, probably see the flat, we see sequential improvement as you go from 2Q to 3Q.\nFrank Mitsch: Great. And then overall, you expect volumes to be up 3Q versus 2Q. Is most of that -- is Kapton the big driver there? Or are there other businesses that you're seeing volumes materially pick up sequentially in 3Q?\nLori Koch: No. I mean Kapton is a piece of it. It's that the smartphone seasonality as well. So usually, we see very high smartphone sales as we head into the Christmas season within the E&I segment and overall electronics, in general, as they prepare for the holidays.\nOperator: I will turn the call back over to Chris Mecray for closing remarks.\nChris Mecray: Okay. Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. For your reference, a copy of this transcript will be posted on DuPont's website. This concludes our call. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Lori Koch",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. As Ed mentioned, we saw continued strong demand during the quarter in key end markets, with volumes higher than our expectations coming into the quarter. Cost inflation intensified further compared to previous estimates, but additional pricing actions are anticipated to fully offset these higher costs. These factors, along with our team's continued strong execution focus, contributed to both top and bottom line results well above expectations for the quarter. We also delivered a consistent operating EBITDA margin on both a year-over-year and sequential basis.  Focusing on financial highlights for the quarter on Slide 6. Net sales of $3.3 billion increased 7% as reported versus the second quarter of 2021 and increased 9% on an organic basis. The acquisition of Laird, partially offset by noncore divestitures, provided a 1% net tailwind in net sales, while currency was a 3% headwind during the quarter as the U.S. dollar strengthened against key currencies, including the euro and the yen.  Organic sales growth included 8% pricing gains and 1% higher volume. Volume growth reflects continued strong demand in key end markets, namely semiconductor, general industrial, water and construction, muted primarily by lower volumes for protective garments within Safety Solutions. These factors resulted in organic sales growth during the quarter, up 9% for W&P, 8% for E&I and 15% for the retained businesses of the former M&M segment they report in corporate, which predominantly reflects our adhesive portfolio tied to next-generation auto.  On a regional basis, we delivered organic sales growth in all 4 regions globally, including volume increases in Asia Pacific, North America and Latin America. In China, organic sales growth was up slightly versus the year ago period, and volumes in China were up low single digits sequentially from first quarter despite government-mandated lockdowns in parts of the country into early June.  From an earnings perspective, operating EBITDA of $829 million was up 6% versus the year ago period, and adjusted EPS of $0.88 per share increased 11%. The increase in operating EBITDA was driven by pricing actions, stronger earnings contribution from the Laird acquisition and volume gains, which more than offset higher inflationary cost pressures.  Operating EBITDA margin of 25% was slightly better than our expectations set earlier this quarter and flat on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. Our pricing actions have fully offset cost inflation on a dollar basis but have impacted EBITDA margins.  Our operating EBITDA margin adjusted to exclude price/cost with 26.6% or 150 basis points higher than the year ago, driven by productivity and higher volume. Our incremental margin was 22% on an as-reported basis. Excluding the impact of price/cost, incremental margin for our core businesses was almost 60%, demonstrating strong cost discipline and operational productivity.  From a cash perspective, cash flow from operations during the quarter of $86 million and capital expenditures of $135 million resulted in a free cash outflow of $49 million. Working capital was an additional headwind during the quarter as we continue to secure inventory given tight supply chains and incur higher inventory costs related to inflation. We expect improvement in free cash flow during the second half of the year, consistent with our typical pattern and factoring in a reduction of working capital level. As we separate the M&M business, we continue to encourage transaction-related expenses, with over $100 million of transaction costs incurred during the second quarter and about $700 million in costs related to the M&M separations expected in full year 2022. These costs, combined with higher working capital related to the M&M business that we are divesting, are significant headwinds to our 2022 cash flow.  Turning to Slide 7. Adjusted EPS of $0.88 per share increased 11% compared to $0.79 per share in the year ago period. Higher volumes and earnings from Laird provided a benefit to adjusted EPS in the quarter of $0.11 per share. These gains were partially offset by weaker mix in W&P related to lower garment production and Kapton's plant start-up costs totaling $0.03 per share. A lower share count from ongoing share repurchases provided a $0.04 benefit to adjusted EPS, while other below-the-line items, including a higher tax rate and exchange gains, netted to a $0.03 headwind.  Our base tax rate for the quarter was 22.6%, up slightly from 21.8% in the first quarter and up notably from the year ago period given certain discrete tax benefits recorded in the prior year, resulting from tax law changes. We are maintaining an expected base tax rate range for the full year 2022 of 21% to 23%.  Turning to segment results, beginning with E&I on Slide 8. E&I delivered net sales growth of 16%, including 8% organic growth, an 11% portfolio benefit from Laird and a 3% headwind from currency.  Organic growth for E&I included a 6% increase in volume and a 2% increase in pricing. The line of business view, organic sales growth was led by Semiconductor Technologies, which increased mid-teens as strong demand continued, led by the ongoing transition to more advanced node technologies and ongoing high semiconductor fab utilization, along with growth in 5G communications and data centers.  Within Industrial Solutions, organic sales growth was up high single digits, led by continued demand for OLED materials for displays, ongoing strength for Kalrez semi CapEx-related product offerings, Vespel products serving recovering aerospace markets and for health care applications such biopharma tubing.  Interconnect Solutions sales decreased low single digits on an organic basis as expected due to a slight volume decline. Volume gains for films and laminates in certain industrial end markets were more than offset by lower smartphone volumes due to the anticipated return to more normal seasonal order pattern compared to last year and the including softness in China smartphones. The business was also impacted somewhat by lower global PC and tablet demand and continued constraints in automotive production.  Looking forward, we expect similar growth patterns for Semiconductor Technologies and Industrial Solutions to continue into the second half of 2022. Within interconnect, we expect to return to positive organic growth in the second half given seasonal strength and added capacity from our Kapton expansion.  For the full year, we expect Interconnect Solutions to be up low to mid-single digits on an organic basis. This reflects a slight decline from our previous expectations as supply chain constraints and softer consumer demand are expected to mute volumes for smartphones, PCs and tablets.  Operating EBITDA for E&I of $480 million increased 13% as strong earnings from Laird, volume gains and pricing actions were partially offset by higher raw material and logistics costs.  Operating EBITDA margin of 31.4% reflects sequential improvement of 40 basis points. On a year-over-year basis, operating EBITDA margin was down 70 basis points due primarily to a 100-basis-point headwind from price/cost.  Turning to Slide 9. W&P delivered net sales growth of 6% as organic sales growth of 9% was partially offset by a 3% headwind from currency. Organic growth for W&P reflects a 12% increase in price and a 3% volume headwind. Pricing gains reflect broad-based actions across the segment, most notably in Shelter and Safety Solutions. Volume declines were driven by Safety Solutions.  From a line of business view, organic sales growth was led by Shelter Solutions, which increased high teens, driven by pricing actions and continued robust demand in North America residential construction as well as ongoing growth in commercial construction and strength in repair- and remodel-related demand during the quarter.  Within Safety Solutions, sales were up mid-single digits on an organic basis as pricing actions were partially offset by lower Tyvek volumes, given the shift from garments to other end market applications and the resulting negative impact of increased manufacturing line changeovers on overall production.  Sales for Water Solutions were up mid-single digits on an organic basis on pricing gains and continued steady demand for water filtration technologies, muted by supply chain constraints in Asia Pacific due to COVID lockdowns in China and an earthquake in Japan impacting our production.  Operating EBITDA for W&P of $348 million declined 1% versus last year as pricing actions taken to offset higher costs are more than offset by volume declines.  Operating EBITDA margin of 23.2% was 170 basis points below the year ago period as the impact of price/cost was an approximate 200-basis-point headwind to margins. Excluding the price/cost impact, operating EBITDA margin was over 25%.  I'll close with a few comments on our financial outlook on Slide 10. We are still seeing solid demand, and our order book is sound in most of our end markets. However, future uncertainties continue to exist in the macro environment driven by inflationary pressure, challenging supply chain and U.S. dollar strength. Our teams remain focused keenly on execution, and we are concentrated on a leverage within our control in order to continue to drive value for our shareholders.  For the full year 2022, we are narrowing our adjusted EPS range while maintaining the midpoint of our previous range. We now expect full year adjusted EPS in the range of $3.27 to $3.43 per share versus our previous range of $3.20 to $3.50 per share.  We are updating our full year '22 net sales guidance range to be between $13 billion and $13.4 billion reflecting a $200 million of incremental foreign currency headwinds, along with the removal of about $120 million in net sales related to the Biomaterials business, given its divestiture at the end of May. We continue to expect organic sales growth for the year to be up high single digits.  After adjusting the high end of our operating EBITDA guidance primarily for incremental currency headwinds and the removal of the Biomaterials business, we now expect full year 2022 operating EBITDA to be between $3.25 billion and $3.35 billion.  For third quarter 2022, we expect net sales to be between $3.17 billion and $3.37 billion and operating EBITDA to be about $810 million. We expect third quarter net sales and operating EBITDA to be slightly weaker than the second quarter as sequential volume increases are expected to be offset by further foreign currency headwinds and the absence of the Biomaterials business. We are also expecting impact during the third quarter on operating EBITDA of approximately $15 million from unplanned downtime at our W&P screw-in site in Virginia associated with an unforeseen utility disruption from a third-party supplier.  On a year-over-year basis, we expect third quarter net sales to be up 2% at the midpoint and up high single digits on an organic basis. We expect third quarter 2022 adjusted EPS of approximately $0.81 per share.  With that, we are pleased to take your questions, and let me turn it back to the operator to open the Q&A. Yes, I think to Ed's point too just on the top line, one of the areas that we're really impressed with is their penetration in EV. And so they've seen really nice growth there. We'll continue to take advantage of the opportunity, especially the combined opportunity in DuPont when we put it together with our EV applications. I think we've mentioned, in the past, the 2 portfolios generate about $400 million of revenue today. So we're excited to get those 2 together and see what we can do. Yes. So we're now expecting between raw materials, logistics and higher energy costs about $700 million. So it's about a $100 million increase from where we were sitting when we did the prior earnings call. But we still expect to fully cover that with price increases. So we'll be net-neutral on the bottom line. It just creates the headwinds on the margin profile as we have telegraphed. It was about 150 basis points in total this quarter. So underlying -- we held flat on margins year-over-year. But if you take out that delta, we were actually up about 140, 150 basis points, a nice leverage through the P&L. It would have been in the raw -- yes, it wouldn't have been in the raws, but it would have been in the total $600 million. So it's not new in total. But the increase from the prior $600 million to the current $700 million is really primarily the increase in energy costs and then the knock-on effect to logistics as we see higher fuel costs. And I think you know the statistics, just to be sure. So the residential piece of construction is about 40%. The rest is 40% commercial and then about 20% repair and remodel. In the commercial, the largest end markets underneath there are more on the health care side and the restaurant side. So those are -- they make up the bulk of the commercial opportunity for us. Yes. Right now, we're not expecting any material impact as they start to ration energy in Germany. There's one plant site in our existing go-forward portfolio that doesn't use it, so we don't see an impact there. It's in the businesses that we retained from M&M. M&M does have a plant in Germany so that they could be impacted minimally if there were some rationing going on there. But as we see it right now, we don't see a headwind from a utilization perspective. We'll obviously continue to watch the European natural gas prices, which have an impact on primarily W&P and the Remainco portfolio. They've got a few plant sites in Europe. So they're up again. I think they were EUR 210 or so as of the last couple of days. So we'll continue to keep an eye on those to see where that moves. Yes. So in the second quarter, garment volumes were down about $40 million. So we were able to make up a little of that with increasing sales in the medical and other end markets. But in total, garments were down $40 million. We expect that to be a hit again in 3Q on a year-over-year basis. And then in the fourth quarter, we start to get out of that year-over-year comp headwind.  The piece too on the production side, you -- not so much a demand because you can shift the demand to other end markets from the garments. It's more around the product produced that you net out to a headwind. And so when we were making garments, we were able to just run garments the entire time and minimize the changeovers on the lines. Now that we're back to a more normal product mix, we're having to have more changeovers than we had last year, so therefore, translating to lower pounds produced. Yes. I think as we look towards the second half, we don't see any material margin movement in the second half versus the first half. We were around 23%, more like 25%, 26% when you take away the price/cost headwinds in the first half. And so as we look to the second half, we would expect that same 23% roughly underlying and then you have 25-ish, 26% when you take away the price/cost headwind. Yes. I think as to your first part of your question, I don't see them changing the product mix that they make on the fabs, but they can kind of shift around the end markets. And so we've seen them move away as there's been some weakness in the consumer electronics space to more of the data center applications, where the demand remains very, very robust, which is favorable to our portfolio, just given the higher advanced technologies associated with those end market data center applications. And so you can see in our results in the second quarter, we continue to post very strong results. And we're well positioned as we go forward to take advantage of the increase in the fabs through the construction that's taking place.  And so right now, I believe, over the next few years, we'll bring on an incremental about 7% capacity when it comes to wafer starts, and we're very well positioned. We've got great relationships with the majority of those fabs that are putting in capacity. And so while it's hard to say if you want any new capacity from those new lines coming on, I don't know if they actually have had all that in place, but we'll continue to maintain very strong relationships with those large players that are putting in capacity.  We've said in the past that we'll be about 200 to 300 basis points ahead of MSI growth. We're posting those results this year. So I don't see any reason why we wouldn't continue to do that. And I think it's important to know, the semi market and the revenue that's posted is a function of both price and volume. And our exposure is to the volume piece. And so price can be volatile in the semi market. That doesn't impact our results. It's really a focus on the wafer starts and the MSI so that the millions of square inches of wafer is produced. Yes. So we see the opportunity in EV between our portfolio and Rogers' portfolio to be about $250 a car. So a really nice content number. As I had mentioned earlier, today, we have about $400 million of revenue between the 2 portfolios. So about $200 million coming in from Rogers and about $200 million in our existing portfolio, which is predominantly made up of adhesives. And then we have a Nomex paper application for the e-motor piece. So a very nice opportunity, as I had mentioned for the 2 companies to come together to continue to drive opportunities in the space. It's a really high growth rate as we've mentioned before, too. So EV applications are, overall, growing in the mid-teens, ADAS applications even higher than that. We've got a nice ADAS portfolio today with the incoming Laird acquisition, so lots of opportunities for growth. Yes. That's a key opportunity for us is to continue to get capacity to release also sold-out assets. And so during a pandemic, recall that we brought Line 1 back up, so we were able to bring on a little bit of incremental capacity. Line 1 is the oldest line in the portfolio, so it doesn't have as much production as the newer lines, but it was incremental capacity for us. So we'll continue to try to get more pounds off of all the lines between both Spruance and Luxembourg as we await the new Tyvek asset, which we expect sometime around the end of 2023. I would say it's in line with normal seasonality, so the -- with the one exception of we will start to return to posting growth within the Interconnect Solutions business on a year-over-year basis, just given that last year was a little odd with respect to the smartphone shipments of what they normally do this year. It's more on a normal pattern. So you saw the headwind in the first half as we posted volume declines. We expect to have volume increases in the second half within the Interconnect Solutions. That's a year-over-year basis, but sequentially, no, no material change to our usual pattern, with the one exception, as Ed had mentioned, that the Kapton line coming on, which will provide some incremental revenue in the back half of the year. Yes. I mean I think maybe coming into the year, we had expected some margin improvement as we went into the back half, but the last quarter and this quarter, we've seen those more flatten out. It's a function of, one, the incremental price headwinds that we've seen. So a lot of it is that. So recall back when we originally gave guidance for the full year, we thought overall raw materials, logistics and energy would only be $350 million. That number has now went to $700 million as we have mentioned, and the majority of that increase is in W&P. So that creates as reported margin headwind for us. Yes. No, those are generally performing well. We had a little bit of a shortfall in the second quarter with access to raw materials within our Nomex. So it really wasn't a structural demand issue or an operational issue. It's we couldn't get access to some of the key inputs to make the Nomex product. But nothing to work through on the aramid side as far as asset utilization like we're seeing on the Tyvek side with the increased changeovers as we ride through the garment change. No, demand is still steady in different markets, yes. Yes. So the math you're getting to is about a $30 million sequential increase from 3Q at approximately $810 million, and then you back into about $840 million. So it's really coming from 3 primary drivers. One is you don't have the headwind from the outage at Spruance. And so we had sized that at $15 million. So you're able to get that volume back in the fourth quarter. And then the other 2 key drivers are the capacity additions that we have from the water asset that we spoke about earlier and then Kapton getting production off that cap online. So no underlying change in market of those 3 items. Yes. I mean I think the expectations right now are for 86 million cars produced next year. That's off of 80 million this year, so still well below the high 90s where we used to be. So there's still some opportunity. We see continued strength and growth heading into 2024. Obviously, it will all depend on is the semiconductor chip shortage resolving itself. But even beyond that, I mean, the third quarter is expected to be up 22% and 7% sequentially. So it feels like things are getting a little bit better there as we resolve some of the supply chain issues. Yes, we actually saw sequential improvement in China, 2Q over 1Q, and that was on top of that extended lockdown. So we were pleased with the results there. To your specific question on the construction market, we don't really have a construction footprint in China. So it wouldn't impact our overall business. The majority of our construction is in the U.S. and in Japan within Asia. Yes. We expect to see improvement in China again into the third quarter. And so while we still year-over-year, probably see the flat, we see sequential improvement as you go from 2Q to 3Q. No. I mean Kapton is a piece of it. It's that the smartphone seasonality as well. So usually, we see very high smartphone sales as we head into the Christmas season within the E&I segment and overall electronics, in general, as they prepare for the holidays."

            "name": "Edward Breen",
            "content": "Good morning. Thank you for joining our second quarter financial review. We posted strong quarterly results above expectations in a difficult environment. Our top line revenue growth of 7% versus the year ago period included solid organic growth of 9%.  Overall, customer demand remained strong across our key end markets as E&I delivered a 6% volume increase, driven by ongoing strength in Semiconductor Technologies and Industrial Solutions.  In terms of inflation, our pricing actions continue to fully offset higher costs associated with raw materials, logistics and energy. Early in the quarter, our expectation for full year 2022 was about $600 million of increased costs, and that number has now risen to over $700 million, mainly due to higher energy and logistics costs. We still expect to remain price/cost-neutral in the second half and for the full year based on pricing actions we have taken.  Overall, our second quarter results reflect year-over-year and sequential earnings growth. These results highlight the strength of our end markets and our team's efforts to successfully navigate a challenging macro environment, which was further complicated by China's COVID lockdowns during the quarter. We were very pleased with the lockdowns alleviated by mid-June and that our China-based colleagues who operated diligently under difficult circumstances have been able to return to some form of normalcy. More broadly, our focus on execution continues to drive results as we increase our use of digital tools and other plant site investments to drive additional productivity and capacity release.  Finally, with regards to sustainability, I am pleased to highlight that last month, we announced our commitment to setting targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with the Paris Accord Science-Based Targets initiative, or SBTi. This is an important step toward reducing our overall climate impact, and it builds on our existing commitment to protect the planet by reducing the carbon footprint across our value chain in partnership with customers and suppliers.  Turning to Slide 4. I'd like to update you on key initiatives for 2022 stakeholder value creation, namely our portfolio transformation and our balanced approach to capital allocation. In addition, I will highlight our continued focus on growth execution on the following slide.  First, as it relates to the Rogers acquisition, the progress is being made on the required regulatory reviews, with China being the last jurisdiction outstanding. We expect the deal to close during the third quarter. Regarding Rogers' first quarter 2022 performance, we were satisfied with top line progress for the business, with growth in the high single digits, and we're especially pleased to see new wins and ongoing growth in the electric vehicle space. Rogers' business in the period was impacted by a price/cost gap and several operational challenges that held back full earnings potential, but we remain confident in the actions that the Rogers team is taking, and we expect improvement as we move forward.  For the M&M transactions, we are on track regarding timing associated with the M&M divestiture to Celanese, with a completion anticipated around year-end. We continue to make the necessary progress to separate the business, and we were pleased to see Celanese secure permanent financing in the last few weeks. We also continue to move forward with plans to divest the Delrin business and affirm our expectation for completion around midyear 2023.  This past July 1 marked the 1-year anniversary of our acquisition of Laird Performance Materials. I've commented previously on how successful this acquisition has been for us, including overall financial performance ahead of plan on both the top and bottom lines. We also continue to advance commercial synergy opportunities on top of cost synergies previously noted.  Finally, we completed the sale of the Biomaterials business at the end of May, which was the last of our previously announced noncore business divestitures. Since 2019, we generated gross proceeds of over $2.2 billion by divesting 8 noncore businesses, which collectively produced lower growth, lower margins and overall higher volatility in earnings. We received solid value for these divestitures, selling them at a low double-digit EBITDA multiple.  Shifting to capital allocation. We continue to pursue a balanced strategy that includes prioritizing the return of excess capital to shareholders as well as bolt-on M&A. During the second quarter, we repurchased $500 million of shares, bringing our year-to-date total to $875 million, which represents 2.5% of total shares outstanding. We anticipate completing the $500 million of authorization remaining on our existing share repurchase program during the remainder of this year.  As I noted during our last earnings call, given the magnitude of anticipated proceeds from the M&M divestitures, we expect there will be room to execute substantial, incremental share buybacks while disciplined M&A will also remain a key deployment priority over time as we continue to seek accretive and opportunistic transactions that can leverage our existing growth even further.  Finally, our balance sheet remains strong. And this remains a key priority, particularly in uncertain, volatile macro environment.  Turning to Slide 5. Another key value driver for us is innovation-led growth. Greater focus on secular high-growth end markets in electronics, water, protection, industrial technologies and next-generation automotive will serve as a sound basis for our organic growth execution. We continue to invest actively in both advancing the technology within our existing product portfolio and also introducing new products around the pillars highlighted here, with an overall R&D investment rate of around 4% of total sales, in line with best-in-class peers. This investment is coupled with substantial application engineering focus where our technical personnel have a seat at our customers' table in the design phases of their products.  This past quarter, we had a number of highlights, which we note on the slide, but I'd emphasize that we are proud to have won 4 Edison Awards across different technology platforms, and we continue to make progress in introducing new technologies, such as applications and EV batteries, which have strong growth potential.  With that, let me turn it to Lori to discuss the details of the quarter as well as our financial outlook. Yes, Jeff. So we looked over the weekend at our order rates as of the end of last week, and across the board, our order rates are hanging right in there where we would expect them to be. The only softness that we've seen, which we've mentioned before, is smartphones in China. Demand is down, and I don't know how much of that is because of the lockdowns versus just true demand down. And we're seeing some lightness on the PCB board side, which is really for PCs, tablets, things like that, not significant but a little bit of a downdraft there. And besides that, everything, at least in our order rate, is holding in.  And now remember, we have a really solid look, I would say, on our orders out about 30 days and the bulk of the businesses, some of them longer than that. Like, the water business is actually some months. So we're a little bit shorter cycle on the order rate. But as we sit today, it looks like things are hanging in there.  We have seen no downdraft to your specific point on the construction side. Both the resi was -- order rates are good in the last week. The commercial was good, and the do-it-yourself piece of that business was still good.  By having said that, Jeff, we're not naive. We see data points out there. And obviously, we're doing recession planning, just to be ready if things do soften up. But at this point in time, I'm not seeing it. Yes, Jeff. So we're talking to the Board about it, and just to reiterate the prepared comments we made, we're clearly thinking heavy on a share repurchase here with the amount of cash available. But -- and I wouldn't say the cash has to be in the door. I just want to see kind of -- I'd use the term green lights through town that the timing is what we think we're going to be ready to do this by November 1 with all the internal work, both we're doing and Celanese is doing. But my gut is by the time you get through regulatory, we and -- our comment was kind of end of the year right at the first of the year 2023. So -- but you never know with regulatory and if there's COVID lockdowns, you just -- you don't know for sure. So I just want to get closer, and then we'll make a final decision. Yes. So the night -- there's a good and a bad. I guess I'll just put it that way. The good is the revenue line is right on what the planning assumptions were, and the win rate is looking really, really nice. The EBITDA is off the planning model, and by the way, I'd say it's for -- putting price/cost aside, which you can catch up on, which will happen, there were 4 or 5 operational issues that have been hitting them that are really impacting the EBITDA percent. By the way, all fixable, all within the control of the team to fix those. So we expect improvement to come.  And by the way, I'll just give you 2. One of them is not really even something they can control. They're being shorted as the whole industry is on the silicon side, and it's a very high-margin application for them. So obviously, we're trying to -- they're trying to secure more silicon supply. And at some point here, that'll even out, but that's off.  And then just to give you one other example, they used more contract manufacturing because they're bringing up a facility that they -- that had a fire in it that they're bringing that back up online. But in the meantime, to satisfy the customers, they're using contract manufacturing, which is really eating into the margin of that business. So that's 2 examples, but there's 3 other ones.  So those things, that's being worked on, and they're getting ready to launch that facility again and bring the production back in-house. So it's items like that. We'll work through that. My hope and gut is we'll be in good shape going into 2023 as we get these operational issues fixed. Yes. Both revenue and earnings are ahead. And we got good synergies out of that. We're getting -- we're probably about 80% through that. We've identified real solidly $63 million in synergies. But what I'm more excited about on Laird, and I think the same is going to play out with Rogers, is really the revenue opportunities between the 2 as Lori was sort of just alluding to. We just had another one in European auto, customer who Laird had a direct relationship with and we were able to use some of our existing DuPont technology and an application to resolve an issue for them. And it seems like a nice new revenue stream with that customer. So that's really exciting with the kind of putting this tool kit together. Steve, I'll breakdown for you because you were just using raws. The breakdown of the inflation is about 60% is raws, 20% is logistics, and 20% is energy. Just to give you kind of a feel for it. And by about 70% of our inflation is in the W&P segment, where you can see we got phenomenal pricing. Well, remember, Steve, one of the -- first of all, it just depends how deep recession is. So far, it's a hard one to answer. But remember that the Tyvek product line, which is one of the biggest segments in there, that's a sold-out asset. So we can divert product to other end markets. For instance, we are shorting right now, unfortunately, the medical market -- medical packaging market. We're trying to work through that backlog as we speak. So we have other applications for it in the sold-out asset. And by the way, I think the water business -- just to use W&P, I think the water business would hold in there pretty well in a recession.  So yes, we'll see some effect of it. Nomex would probably go down a little bit. Kevlar might go down a little bit, but I think we can hang in there pretty well. Yes. Well, John, that is a great question. We talk about it all the time. So we made a, I'd say, strategic decision that all the price increases we did were all baked into the product price. So we did not do surcharges that are tied to some index or something like that. So I feel good about the approach that we took. And obviously, our goal, if a recession hits and commodity costs come down, would be to then get a gap, maintain a gap going forward where obviously, we're maintaining more price than the decrease on the commodity.  And we're -- by the way, we've been working on these scenarios for the last month with our teams like where do we feel and how much can we hold in each of our end markets. But our goal is going to clearly be to hold a gap so that we can help our EBITDA margin percent, which is -- as Lori just mentioned, obviously, has been hit the other way with the price/cost thing but where we can benefit from it. So I won't get into each end market, but I think we have the opportunity to do what I just said. To what extent, we'll see as it plays out.  But that -- by the way, that's interesting. And this -- if a recession hits, that's the one thing that is very, very different for companies like ours and many others, where in the past, you didn't have this dynamic. You had a recession, you were cutting your costs or whatever you did. And this time, you have -- this is probably the single biggest dynamic that improved financial performance that clearly we have and many, many global companies have. So we're already getting past the disruption. We've been bringing lines up this week. This problem hit 1.5 weeks ago. And it's just -- it's a safety issue, by the way. We have to methodically go through, look at all the lines, what ended up being cogs just caught stuck in them when it went down. So it's a little bit of a process. But we're bringing some lines up a day ago, and later today, we bring a line up again. So we know we're out of the problem here over the next few days. But we don't make that up. Because for instance, Tyvek is one of the products -- big products there. It's a sold-out asset. So we can only make so much, and we're sold out.  But by the way, just to give you a sequence from the third to the fourth quarter, you see a little bit of a lift, which is not necessarily the seasonal pattern. But what's happening there is we have the Spruance not being down, so we don't have that third quarter to fourth quarter problem. We'll be running full tilt there. We have a new water line that we've been telling you about that's coming up at Edina, which will give us incremental volume. On a sold-out business, also our reverse osmosis product line.  And then remember, we have the Kapton line coming up in our electronics business and our Circleville facility, and they all hit in the fourth quarter and give us the incremental volume. And Kapton's also a sold-out asset. So we're not expecting a sequential third to fourth necessary change in demand in the marketplace. They just happen to be the sold-out assets where we start getting some production out of them. Yes. I'll give you really both of the bigger businesses here. I think E&I, and you've seen us do this ex the price cost, we should be able to run that 32%, 33% EBITDA margin. And this quarter, we weren't far off of that and then a little bit of price/cost there. And I think that's about where that will run and pretty consistently have been there.  In the W&P business, we really think we can get that over time to kind of more of a 27%, 28% business. Now by the way, we're planning on getting some of that as commodities at some point here, drift down, and we maintain, as I mentioned a minute ago, some incremental pricing above that. But then internally, in our own control is really capacity release at our facilities. And that would be specifically on Tyvek, our water assets, and our Nomex product line would be the big ones for continued capacity release.  And in our prepared remarks, Chris, one of the things you see we've been working heavily on is working on a lot of digital tools that we're implementing on our facilities that are helping us on the reliability side. These are big heavy assets on the W&P side, so you get a 1% improvement. You get quite a bit of throughput. So we're really spending our time working kind of our operational excellence playbook. And that's what will really help us on the W&P to keep incrementing that up. Yes, Chris. So what we've been doing on Delrin is we've been working on standing it up. It was a division in a division. So it was a little extra of work for us. We finished up the data room. We're going to actually really launch the process here in the early fall. We're just waiting to get through the summer. So I can't give you any color commentary on detailed number of people. But I would think it's more strategics that are going to be interested in this asset. By the way, it's a business that has 30% EBITDA margins. It's doing very well still in this environment. So that's probably the timing of it. And that's why we said, so if that's the timing, by the time you get to the -- to close the deal, you're probably about the middle of 2023. And that would really be the end of the kind of the divestiture and getting the portfolio where we want it. But now remember that asset is already in discontinued operations. Yes. It's ongoing conversations. And as you know, the judge just encouraged that to go on. But I don't have anything new to say. We continue to have pretty consistent conversations to try to resolve the issues, and I'm still optimistic. But nothing new to say. Yes. Thanks for the question, Vincent. So any bolt-on that we would do, first of all, would be on 1 of the 5 pillars that we talk about. And we've been looking at things that are -- let me say, a bolt-on would be more like Laird, not as big as Rogers. That $1 billion, $2 billion type range, and it would be something that would bring additional technology to play in one of those pillars that was, back to the electronics example, just give us more tools in the toolkit to resolve issues for our customers because we're so strong in application engineering, and we're really seeing the benefit of that with Laird tied together with the DuPont electronics portfolio. I know we're going to see it with the Rogers one. So it would be something like that in one of those pillars that we would look at. No, we're not, and trust me, we're watching it closely. But no, we're not seeing that. Yes, the items they're having operationally all are in their control, I would say, except for the silicon supply, which obviously we're having the same issues here, so we understand it.  But yes, the others are in their control, so they can work through those. As you said, it hopefully tee up well for of 2023. The modeling, by the way, for them was for growth in the high single digits in 2022. And they hit that, obviously, in the first quarter. I can't say anything about the second quarter. I'm not allowed to, but we would expect them to perform high single digits this year on top line. So that's nice, and to Lori's point a few minutes ago, they're really seeing nice opportunities as we are on the EV side. So feeling good about that work through the operational issues. P.J., I had also mentioned, back to points Lori was talking about earlier too, we very much care about production on the EV side of things. The new portfolio -- new DuPont portfolio is very much weighted towards that and not the ICE engine. We are more ICE engine-related, I'll say, because of the M&M portfolio, which, by the way, M&M will also sell nice in the EVs. But this new portfolio was very EV-driven. So the growth rate of that becomes way more important. Obviously, we like the overall growth rate of autos to go up, but it's even very weighted towards that piece."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the DuPont First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Chris Mecray, you may begin your conference.\nChris Mecray: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our review of DuPont's first quarter 2022 financial results. Joining me today are Ed Breen, Chief Executive Officer; and Lori Koch, Chief Financial Officer. We prepared slides to supplement our comments during this review, which are posted on the Investor Relations section of DuPont's website and through the webcast link. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the slides. During this financial review, we'll make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Our 2021 Form 10-K as updated by current and periodic reports includes a detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties, which may cause differences. Unless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today exclude significant items. We'll also refer to other non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in our press release and posted to the Investor page of our website. I'll now turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Breen: Good morning, and thank you for joining our first quarter financial review. We posted strong results this quarter, but before we discuss that, I would like to thank each of our employees for their continued dedication and strong commitment to our customers. Their perseverance in the face of many obstacles is what made our results possible. I'd especially like to express our appreciation for our China-based colleagues, many of whom have endured weeks of lockdowns, but have continued to operate and get necessary work done. Also, our hearts go out to those affected by the war in Ukraine, and we sincerely hope this conflict can be ended as soon as possible. Our first quarter results from continuing operations included a strong 9% organic sales increase from the prior year or 14% growth, including the Laird acquisition contribution. Organic volume increased 3%, led by an 8% increase in the E&I segment. Overall customer demand remains strong across the vast majority of end markets, led by low double-digit volume growth in both semiconductor and industrial technologies with the E&I segment and mid-single-digit volume growth in water and shelter solutions within the water and protection business.  Our top line growth included 6% average pricing increases that we took to offset the continued cost inflation that we are experiencing. We realized price increases in all businesses totaling about 190 million, and a fully offset raw material, logistics and energy cost deflation. I continue to be impressed by the job our teams are doing as we remain -- a target to remain price cost neutral for the full year 2022, including the incremental actions taken in March, largely in reaction to the conflict-driven spike in energy and related costs during the period. Turning to Slide 4, I'd like to update you on key focus areas for 2022 stakeholder value creation, including our portfolio transformation, our balanced approach to capital allocation and our continued focus on growth execution. First, we believe we are on track with what we noted previously regarding the timing associated with the M&M divestiture to Celanese. The M&M transaction is anticipated to be complete around the end of the year, and we are also continuing with the process to divest the Delrin business.  For the Rogers acquisition, progress is being made on the required regulatory reviews, while we remain optimistic by closing by the end of the second quarter, the process could extend into early third quarter. We continue to see no issue that would prevent a close of this transaction. I'd like to reiterate that DuPont's financial profile -- pro forma for these transactions will firmly position the company with top quartile revenue growth, operating EBITDA margins and low cyclicality relative to top tier multi-industrial companies. Greater focus on secular high-growth end markets in electronics, water, industrial technologies, protection and next-generation automotive will serve as a sound basis for our innovation-led organic growth execution. Regarding the Laird Performance Materials acquisition, we are also on track to achieve cost synergies of $63 million, somewhat ahead of initial expectations. The deal has been a success so far, including overall financial performance ahead of plan for both top and bottom line results, and early progress to achieve commercial synergies on top of the cost synergies noted. As one example, we are starting to see some nice synergies with Laird process and equipment technology, enabling more effective solutions for downstream customers, including auto OEMs, as well as consumer electronics applications. Regarding future capital allocation and namely the net cash we will receive from our planned divestitures, we will continue to pursue a balanced strategy that includes prioritizing the return of excess capital to shareholders as well as strategic M&A. This is consistent with our actions taken over the last year, during which we increased our share repurchase and dividend allocation, as well as completed the Laird acquisition. Once the Rogers and M&M transactions are completed, we'll be poised to continue to improve our portfolio and financial position as well as accelerate capital return options Given the magnitude of the anticipated deal proceeds, we expect that there will be room to execute substantial incremental share buybacks, while disciplined M&A will also remain a key deployment priority. Regarding our existing $1 billion share repurchase program authorized during Q1, we anticipate completing that authorization during 2022, ahead of the 1-year duration initially guided. Turning to core growth, we continue to focus on execution of our innovation-based organic growth opportunities. We are pleased with 3% volume growth in the quarter given production constraints due to lack of raw material availability and supply chain challenges. We are excited about visible growth drivers enabled by our technical innovation teams and application engineers who are squarely focused on helping customers solve their most complex challenges.  In E&I, continued top line growth momentum this year is being driven by growth in semiconductor, health care and displays end markets, by cyclical recovery in aerospace markets and by new share gains and innovation wins, muted somewhat in auto by supply chain constraints. Key examples of recent new product successes driving growth and strong margin performance include newly launched mechanical planarization pads for semiconductor manufacturing as well as new lithographic photoresist for the high-performance computing market. In W&P, we expect growth in 2022 coming from each of the lines of business. Safety has seen market growth across major segments, including aerospace, electrical infrastructure, oil and gas and health care, but muted by lower demand for protective garments. Shelter continues to experience growth opportunities from strong construction and remodeling trends. Water is experiencing strong mid- to high single-digit growth globally across all technologies.  Examples of new innovation drivers for this segment include several new membrane product families within water to drive growth in desalination and wastewater markets, as well as the launch of a new building insulation product offering increased sustainability solutions for customers. We also have a strong adhesive business that is positioned well to capture growth with its product offerings in next-generation auto and electric vehicles, especially through the commercial synergy opportunities that we expect through the Rogers acquisition. With that, let me turn it to Lori to discuss the details of the quarter, as well as our financial outlook.\nLori Koch: Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. As Ed mentioned, we saw continued strong demand during the quarter in key end markets. Global supply chain challenges and cost inflation have persisted and even intensified during the quarter due to the war in Ukraine. In response to inflation, we continued our strategic pricing actions and were able to fully offset higher costs during the quarter related to raw material, logistics and energy. These factors, along with our team's continued focus on execution, contributed to net sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS results well above expectations. Focusing on financial highlights on Slide 5 for the quarter. Net sales of $3.3 billion were up 9% on both an as-reported and organic basis versus the first quarter of 2021. The acquisition of Laird, partially offset by non-core divestitures, provided 2% net tailwind to net sales, while currency was a 2% headwind during the quarter. Organic sales growth included 6% pricing gains and 3% higher volume. Pricing gains reflect the actions taken to offset overall cost inflation, including the spike in energy cost that we are seeing at our site. Volume growth reflected continued strong customer demand with order patterns remaining solid, led by electronics, industrial technologies, water and construction end markets. These factors resulted in organic sales growth during the quarter of 10% and 9% for W&P and E&I, respectively. On a regional basis, organic sales growth was broad-based globally with W&P driving growth in North America and EMEA and E&I driving growth in Asia Pacific. From an earnings perspective, operating EBITDA of $818 million was up 2% versus the year ago period and adjusted EPS of $0.82 per share was up 19%. The increase in operating EBITDA was driven by pricing actions, volume gains and strong earnings from the Laird acquisitions, which more than offset higher inflationary cost pressures, as well as weaker product mix in W&P and the absence of a gain on asset divestiture in E&I last year. Operating EBITDA margin during the quarter was 25%, which was better than our expectations set earlier this quarter, about 160 basis points below the year ago period, which I'll explain further. Navigating cost inflation was a key focus during the quarter and our success in doing so was a significant driver in our results. While the majority of the raw material inflation that we have discussed in the past relates to the M&M businesses, which are now part of discontinued operations, our Remainco businesses also have inflation exposure, and we saw a spike in energy costs during the quarter, most notably in W&P. We fully offset about $190 million of cost inflation during the quarter, which kept our results hold on a dollars basis.  While these pricing actions enabled us to maintain a neutral earnings profile, price cost dynamics resulted in 150 basis point headwind to operating EBITDA margin during the quarter. Our underlying operating EBITDA margin adjusted to exclude price cost factors was 26.5% or essentially flat compared to the year ago period. Further, as you adjust margins in the prior period to exclude the onetime gain related to the asset sale in E&I, our underlying margin of 26.5% would have increased about 70 basis points from the last year. Another key metric that we track is incremental margins. On a reported basis, incremental margin for the quarter was 6% from the year ago period. However, I indicated previously the importance of evaluating the results on an underlying basis. If you remove the impact of price cost, incremental margin was over 20%, and if you also exclude the headwind from the onetime asset sales, on top of that, incremental margin was almost 60%. I mentioned these data points to illustrate the volume strength we are seeing within the portfolio. From a cash perspective, cash flow from operations during the quarter of $209 million and capital expenditures of $251 million resulted in a free cash outflow of $42 million. The cash outflow was the result of variable compensation payments to our employees, which were approximately $100 million more this year than our normal payout, and higher working capital trade includes set of actions taken to increase inventory in reaction to continued product supply constraints. We expect significant improvement in free cash flow as we move towards the second half of the year consistent with our typical seasonal pattern. Turning to Slide 6. Adjusted EPS of $0.82 per share was up 19% compared to $0.69 per share in the year ago period. Higher volumes and strong results from Laird collectively provided a benefit to adjusted EPS in the quarter of $0.11 per share. These gains more than offset other previously disclosed portfolio related actions, weaker product mix in W&P and additional tax Kapton bind start-up costs in E&I totaling $0.09 per share in the aggregate. A lower share count and reduced interest expense from deleveraging actions continue to benefit our EPS results. Our base tax rate for the quarter was 21.8% and we continue to expect our base tax rate for the full year 2022 to be in the range of 21% to 23%. Turning to segment results, beginning with E&I on Slide 7, E&I delivered net sales growth of 18%, including 9% organic growth and 11% portfolio benefit from Laird and a 2% headwind from currency. Organic growth for E&I includes an 8% increase in volume and a 1% increase in price. For line of business view, organic sales growth was led by semiconductor technologies, which increased mid-teens as robust demand continued, led by the ongoing transition to more advanced nodes, growth in high-performance computing and 5G communications as well as share gains.  Within Industrial Solutions, organic sales growth was up low double digits on a continuation of strong volume growth led by OLED materials for new phone and television launches, ongoing strength for Kalrez product offerings, most notably for semi CapEx and strong demand for health care applications such as biopharma and tubing. Interconnect Solutions sales decreased low single digits on an organic basis due to a slight volume decline. Volume gains for films and laminates in certain industrial end markets were more than offset by declines in consumer electronics, primarily related to China.,, as well as the anticipated return to more normal seasonal order patterns for smartphone. For the full year, we expect Interconnect Solutions to be up mid-single digits on an organic basis, led by strong demand in the second half and additional capacity coming online later this year from our Kapton expansion. From a regional perspective, E&I delivered sales growth in all regions with high single-digit organic growth in Asia Pacific, noting China was down slightly. Operating EBITDA for E&I of $476 million increased 9% as volume gains, strong earnings from Laird and pricing actions more than offset the absence of a prior year asset sale gain, higher raw material and logistics costs and a continuation of start-up costs associated with our Kapton capacity expansion. Operating EBITDA margin of 31% reflects sequential improvement from the fourth quarter of more than 200 basis points. On a year-over-year basis, the primary driver of the decline in operating EBITDA margin was the absence of a prior year gain. Adjusting margins in the prior year to exclude the onetime benefit, operating EBITDA margin was down 70 basis points year-over-year as a result of price cost and Kapton start-up costs more than offsetting volume gains. Turning to Slide 8, W&P delivered net sales growth of 8%, consisting of 10% organic growth and a 2% headwind from currency. Organic growth for W&P reflects broad-based pricing actions across the segment implemented to offset cost inflation. Volumes were flat as gains in shelter and water solutions were offset by declines in safety. From a line of business view, organic sales growth was led by Shelter Solutions, which was up high teens driven by pricing actions and continued robust demand in North American residential construction for products such as Tyvek house wrap, as well as ongoing improvement in commercial construction for quarry and surface products. Sales for Water Solutions were up high single digits on an organic basis on volume and pricing gains. Global demand remains strong for all water technologies and across all regions. Within Safety Solutions, sales were up mid-single digits on an organic basis as pricing actions were partially offset by lower volumes of Tyvek as we shifted production from garments to other end market applications. Volumes were up slightly for aramid fibers on continued improvement in industrial end markets. Operating EBITDA for W&P of $341 million declined 4% versus last year due to a weaker product mix. Operating EBITDA margin was better than our expectations set earlier in the quarter, but the impact of price cost was about a 210 basis point headwind to margin. Excluding the price cost impacts, operating EBITDA margin was about 26%, approaching more normalized levels for W&P. Before I turn it back over to Ed, I'll close with a few comments on our financial outlook on Slide 5. Despite the strong start to the year and solid demand, the macro environment remains volatile with several key uncertain factors. Based on our expectations and in consideration of these uncertainties, our full year guidance ranges for operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS remain unchanged at $3.25 billion to $3.45 billion and $3.20 to $3.50 per share, respectively. These ranges include a $35 million earnings headwind as a result of suspending operations in Russia. We are increasing our guidance range for net sales to be between $13.3 billion and $13.7 billion to reflect price increases needed to offset cost inflation, which we now anticipate at $600 million in year-over-year headwinds. Although underlying demand in key end markets such as electronics, industrial technologies and water remains strong, we are seeing further supply chain constraints, primarily from additional government-mandated lockdowns in China, which will likely impact volume growth in the second quarter. Based on these anticipated headwinds, as well as an element of previously projected Q2 sales realized in the first quarter, we expect second quarter 2022 sales to be between $3.2 billion and $3.3 billion or up about 5% year-over-year at the midpoint. Based on these same assumptions, we expect second quarter operating EBITDA between $750 million and $800 million, and adjusted EPS decrease $0.70 and $0.80 per share.  At the midpoint of our guidance, second quarter operation EBITDA margin is expected to decline just over 100 basis points sequentially as supply chain constraints are assumed to impact production rates. We expect operating EBITDA margin in the back half of 2022 to improve on typical seasonal volume strength and improved plant utilization as we clear COVID-related production challenges impacting the first half of the year. This outlook assumes moderating China lockdown impacts as we get into mid-May, given the positive trajectory in the Shanghai region and our limited exposure around Beijing. However, further outlook risks could be triggered as the lockdown spreads to Shenzhen and the Pearl River Delta region, given the concentration of manufacturing and shipping there for DuPont as well as our suppliers. With that, let me turn the call back to Ed.\nEd Breen: Before we take your questions, I'd like to highlight that we published our annual sustainability report this week, and I'm really proud of the progress we made on our 2030 goals. Our sustainability strategy is grounded in 3 pillars: innovation, protecting people and the planet and empowering employees and customers. I'll just note a few highlights. DuPont is leveraging our innovation focus to help customers meet their sustainability goals. A great example of that is the new formulations within our building installation products that helped increase energy efficiency, as well as new technologies from our Water Solutions business that reduce energy intensity. We're also focusing on renewable energy as part of our integrated climate and energy approach.  Last year, we signed a virtual power purchase agreement that will supply about 25% of DuPont's total electricity starting in 2023. Additionally, Apple just announced that DuPont was selected to join their Supplier Clean Energy Program. which is an example of DuPont working with industry partners to drive sustainability progress at scale. We continue to advance our commitments to DE&I. We are excited about the newest female nominee to our Board of Directors, Christina Johnson. Also the strong gender and ethnic representation of our leadership teams continues despite competitive labor markets. There are many great examples and stories in the report of how our teams are delivering on our purpose and driving sustainability. Overall, our teams have done a tremendous job. With that, we are pleased to take your questions. And let me turn it back to the operator to open the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is actually Sam [Indiscernible] on for Steve. Can you talk about the sequential trends from 2Q to 2H? It looks like a big step up in EBITDA. Is that the China recovery or something else? And as part of that, maybe give us an update on the price cost spread on a quarterly basis? What are you expecting in 2Q and then in 2H when comparing to the neutral you did in Q1? And then is there anything else we're missing?\nLori Koch: Thanks, Ashley. Yes, the second half ramp from the first half is really just a reflection of our seasonal volume improvement in the back half within E&I. It's primarily driven by smartphones as we go into the Christmas season and within water, a lot in the construction space as we see a ramp there. So the -- the list on volume is dropping to the bottom line, which is translating to the EBIT improvement and the margin improvement in the second half as we drive leverage through the P&L.  On your question around net price, so we'll expect all year to remain neutral on net price cost that we raised, the midpoint of the guidance for the full year to reflect about another $100 million of raw material escalation on a full year basis. So we're now expecting somewhere in the range of $600 million that will fully offset with price. So that won't change coming out of the first quarter for the rest of the year.\nEd Breen: Ashley, I would just add to Lori's point, the first half to second half ramp, it is our typical seasonality. If you go back and look at last year, it's about a 7% sequential lift first half, second half, and that's typically what we do because of the items that Lori mentioned. So nothing unusual in the pattern there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research.\nScott Davis: Can we talk in terms of like backlog or book-to-bill? Did backlog actually grow in the quarter? I mean, or any metric, I guess, you can give us to give us a sense of top line pent-up demand?\nEd Breen: Yes, Scott. The backlog looks great. It's been staying at very elevated levels. We look at it weekly. There's really no end market that's not feeling good -- as you know, auto is down a little just because of auto production, but that's not a demand-driven thing. It's just chip shortages and supply chain issues. But all our end markets from an order pattern standpoint, feel good as of looking at it this week. So no issues there at all. And really, the only issues we're dealing with here, again, it's not demand driven. It's really more centered around supply chain and China and COVID lockdowns for the guide on the second quarter. But if we didn't have those issues, our sales would definitely be higher in the second quarter, but that's what we're dealing with there.\nScott Davis: Yes, it makes sense. And is price -- as we speak kind of now, is price still going up because inflation is still going up? Or are we at a point now where we've kind of hit some sort of plateau.\nEd Breen: It seems like we've plateaued, Scott. All the price increases are implemented when the war broke out, we did a whole another round of price increases, mainly because the natural gas lifting is significantly as it did. And by the way, other constraints in there, but that was the big one. So we did a round of increases again, which we had just finished doing. We did it again in every business. And as we said, we caught all the inflation in the quarter by on the roles on logistics and on energy. So we caught everything with $190 million of inflation that we saw. And as Lori just mentioned a minute ago, we think it's plateaued. If it hasn't, we'll do another round of price increases, I feel like we can get it if we have to, but it does appear to have plateaued. So we'll have an incremental $600 million of inflation if things hold where they're at for this year, and we'll have that all covered with price.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research.\nJeffSprague: And on share repurchase -- your language on share repurchase went from it being important last quarter to substantial incremental share repurchase. So I sense a bit of a pivot there in your posture, maybe you could just elaborate a little bit more? And do you need to wait for the M&M proceeds to actually do more? Or can you get a bit of a running start on maybe the incremental that you're talking about?\nEd Breen: Yes, so Jeff, you I think summarized it well. We're leaning much more towards a decent large, if you could call it, share repurchase with where our multiple's at. I don't think this is where DuPont's model will be sitting in the future. And obviously softness in everyone's stock price just because of recent external events out there.  So we're going to step on the $1 billion share repurchase a little bit quicker as we said in our prepared remarks, by a quarter or 4 months, something like that and get it done early. And I would expect conversations with the Board that we're going to look at a much larger share repurchase program. I don't think we need to wait until the proceeds are necessarily in, but I would like to make sure nothing else crazy is going on in the world.  We do have a $5.2 billion outstanding loan on the Rogers\u2019 piece that will get paid off, so our leverage will be north of 3 and with that -- but when we get the proceeds from M&M, you kind of know the math, we're sitting on lots of billions of dollars here. So -- so yes, you do hear a little bit of shift in tone because of where the multiple's at. The market is a little bit tough right now for everybody. And my gut is we're going to step on it in a bigger way.\nJeff Sprague: And then also, could you just -- maybe this is for Lori, just how significant on the top line was China? Kind of the lockdowns and supply chain and COVID issues? And how big a part of kind of the Q2 outlook is it?\nLori Koch: Yes. In total, there's 2 major pieces that are impacting the 2Q guidance, so -- and they're both related to China. So first is a shift of sales that we had expected to land in 2Q that landed in 1Q, and that was primarily with our customers pulling in on volume because of what was going on in China. We would size that at about $35 million of sales. And then as far as the shutdown that happened, it started to get progressively worse in mid-March, and we're anticipating a mid-May reopening. We estimate that we missed about $20 million worth of sales.  And there's also an impact on our margins with our plants not running at full capacity. So we have -- 2 sites in China that went into full lockdown mode in mid-March. We expect them to be fully reopened by mid-May. And then we had some key raw materials within our electronics business that we source from China that we weren't able to get full supply, so we ran some of our domestic plants at lower unit rates. And so that was impacting our margin profile in the second quarter as well.\nEd Breen: Yes. To give you a specific on what Lori said, in Circleville, Ohio we make our Kapton, which is a high-margin product. We're fully sold out. We get half of a monomer that we need out of China, and we had delayed shipments out of China. So we did have supply of the monomer. So instead of shutting -- running it full tilt and then shutting the facility down, we just eased off the run rate some. We know when we're now getting supply from China. So there's an example. It kind of hits your rates for 1 month, 1.5 months, like that. So it's just these one-offs because of the China lockdowns, which hopefully dissipates as we exit the quarter.\nLori Koch: And I think the other piece, Jeff, too, with our guidance for the second quarter, but it's beyond just China and then the production-related effects with Russia that we noted in our slides that we pulled Russia out. On a full year basis, it's about $35 million of EBIT, probably about $80 million of sales, that's impacting primarily 2Q and beyond.\nEd Breen: And then, Jeff, when you look at the full year guide, we beat by $90 million in EBIT in the first quarter kind of from consensus. We're down kind of $60 million in the second quarter off of -- I'll use you guys\u2019 consensus, all because of what Lori just described here. But then we have nothing in the second half that's unusual. It's our normal seasonal ramp. That's 7% that I mentioned. That's what we're counting on, including we'll get some better unit rates from the things we just described to you. So no real big change in order patterns for us that we would typically see.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Walsh from Credit Suisse.\nJohn Walsh: I guess just first, thinking about a couple of end markets that you touch, where there's some investor angst, I mean, residential, auto, consumer smartphones. Can you talk about what you're kind of expecting there from volume? And then what you're expecting from price either if you can break it out, what's inflation? And then that price component that you have because of the higher value you're adding to the customers\u2019 offering there?\nLori Koch: Yes, I would say as far as demand is concerned in the 3 end markets as you had noted. So we saw strength in residential construction. We expect that to continue to be a point of strength in the second quarter. We did note softness in consumer electronics, but that was primarily in China with respect to the lockdown and also a little bit of an impact of our own viewing of seasonality with respect to when we do our normal smartphone shipments. So we've telegraphed in the past that the first half will be weaker, the second half will be stronger because of a change in seasonal patterns as we sell into the smartphone market. But on a full year basis, we expect that end market to be up mid-single digits.  And then in auto, you've seen the revisions downward with respect to IHS auto builds. I think now it's sitting at 4% on a full year basis. So our estimates would probably be a little bit lighter than that with respect to what we think that the market will do. But the underlying demand remains strong. It's just really a matter of supply chain specifically around the chip constraints that are impacting that. But I think the highlight to you there is we do continue to see very strong growth within the EV space. And so for us, a large portion of that comes from our adhesives business. We saw a really nice growth in our EV-related sales in Q1, and we expect to about double those sales in Q2 in line with where the EV market is going in general. And we really look forward to the incoming business from Rogers to pair with our business to really take advantage of the opportunity there. On the price side, I wouldn't say it materially different across those end markets is what we're seeing with respect to inflation by segment. So within E&I, the inflation is not as material as what it is within W&P, and you see that in price. So we got about 1% in E&I and price and about 10% in W&P. So there is a difference there, but nothing more than just around the raw material inflation related items.\nJohn Walsh: And then maybe 1 quick follow-up to Jeff's question around capital allocation, maybe can you just update us on what the deal pipeline looks like and if you're seeing sellers expectations change given what's happened in the public markets?\nEd Breen: Yes. So my gut is as we sit right now, I don't see any deal that we would want to do until we're in this 2023. And I'm not saying I know something is available in 2023, but the way stock prices are moving around right now and all, it just makes it a tougher environment. So I don't see anything happening until we get into 2023. And quite frankly, we don't have anything -- we have things we're -- a couple of things we're interested in, as I said before, but I don't see an actionable anytime in the near future. So that could change, so don't hold me to that. But I can't see anything happening until we're nicely into 2023, if then depending on what's going on.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Parkinson from Mizuho.\nChrisParkinson: There are a lot of moving parts to the DuPont capital allocation thesis, just including the net proceeds from deals, base free cash flow generation, working capital and then obviously, your stated buyback goals. When it's all said and done, and I appreciate your remarks for the deal outlook for 2023, just absent anything new in 2022, what is the kind of the base range that you -- based on the current buyback that you believe you'll have cash on the balance sheet, just plus or minus?\nLori Koch: So are you talking after considering the proceeds from the M&M sales?\nChris Parkinson: Yes, if you look at the proceeds from the M&M sales, the cash flow generation in 2022 and 2023, as well as where our leverage targets are at 2.75x, probably where we would expect to be, you quickly get to the $10 billion to $11 billion range of cash to deploy after we pay down the Rogers debt. So as we have mentioned on the call, it's significant. And we'll look to take a balanced approach to driving significant share repurchase, as well as M&A opportunities.\nChris Parkinson: Got it. And the second question I have, just obviously, over the last couple of weeks, there's been a bit of noise across global electronics, some of your peers, which has been pertinent to semis, 5G, base consumer electronics demand. A lot of that driving from China. But just can you just give us a quick update overall about how your team is thinking about your relative subsegments within E&I, just given the current demand environment? And then also how you would project your relative performance versus some of your core U.S. peers.\nLori Koch: Yes, so we see very strong demand continuing in electronics. And so we had very strong results in Q1. On a full year basis, we expect to be up pushing double digits within electronics between price and volume, and we'll obviously add to that as we close the Rogers transaction later this year. So we see a lot of strength, we see a lot of opportunity. If you look at -- we do a lot of detailed analysis about our results versus peers and a couple of them have already been out before, and we back up very nicely when you compare like-to-like product lines.  And so we also stack up very nicely when you compare our results versus some of the key benchmarks out there. So for example, MSI is one of the key components of the semi business. People are expecting that to be up 7% to 8%. We've mentioned that we should outperform by 200 to 300 basis points. And if you look at our Q1 results in semi, we were in line with that expectation. So we are very excited about the portfolio. We'll look to continue to see where we can opportunistically broaden and strengthen that portfolio as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America.\nSteve Byrne: Are there any Water treating technologies that are really deficient in your platform? Would you consider acquiring or developing anything you don't have and maybe more broadly in water, would you consider moving downstream to essentially utilize your expertise in the breadth of water treating technologies you have to provide service to customers as a downstream expansion similar to Ecolab?\nEd Breen: Yes, I would say 2 things, Steve. Our portfolio, we feel very good about. And it's a fairly broad portfolio, so we touch most of the water filtration type markets out there, wastewater home, home applications, which are big for us in China, desalination, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks. So we feel good about the breadth of what we have in the technology we have behind it, and we continue to bring new products out to market. The one area that we would look at and by that, it doesn't mean it's an acquisition that could be organically done as we need to expand our manufacturing footprint and we need a bigger presence with the manufacturing in the Asia market, which is a very fast-growing market for us. So we've been studying very hard a project there to bring up a facility in the next couple of years in that area. So that's a high priority for us.  And then this kind of goes to the second part of your question there, the one opportunity we have or potentially have and our R&D team and application teams are looking at is digitizing the water business. So we know when replacement components are needed ahead of time, and it's kind of systematized, and that could be a real opportunity for us to kind of satisfy our customers by doing it that way. And that opportunity, we've been studying hard for the last year.\nSteve Byrne: Maybe any update from you on PFAS issues? Anything -- any trends that you're observing? Any changes to inbound inquiries that you can comment on?\nEd Breen: Yes. Nothing new has changed on the landscape except I'll just say we continue to be in conversations with the plaintiffs down in the MDL. I feel like we will make progress this year on that. By the way, the judge has continued to encourage us, the judge down there in charge of these MDL cases has actually encouraged us and the plaintiffs we talk in and coming up with a settlement. And so I'll just leave it at that for now, but nothing new besides that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.\nDavid Begleiter: [Multiple Speakers] Rogers\u2019 EBITDA tracking your earlier expectations given what you've seen in both Q1 and Q4, I believe the EBITDA view was $270 million for this year.\nLori Koch: Yes, so in the first quarter, they were under the impact of the same things that we were with respect to the China COVID situation. We're really looking forward to the second half when we will own them, and they have a pretty sizable expected ramp as those end markets really open up coming out of the China recovery, and they continue to see a nice growth opportunity within the EV space. And so I think if you look at the second half trajectory, that's being planned by Rogers, it would be more in line with where our expectations were on a full year basis for that portfolio.\nEd Breen: They have the backlog. A lot of it is in the EV space. We've looked at it. So it's just a matter of, A, getting over the lockdown issue in China and then actually accomplishing the ramp in their production rates. But we think second half of the year, they'll be right around the ZIP code of where we would expect it.\nDavid Begleiter: And Lori, can you comment on what was M&M EBITDA in the quarter?\nLori Koch: Yes, so that will come out Friday in the Q. So in the Q, we'll deconstruct the discontinued operation summary that we've reported today. I can give you a high level that they were impacted, obviously, by the China COVID situation as well and the auto end markets obviously being the largest factor, but they did continue to do a really nice job of getting priced.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov from KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nAleksey Yefremov: Can you update us on the process -- how the Delrin sale process is going?\nEd Breen: Yes. So Delrin, by the way, we've been putting the data room together and all that. We're just getting ready to launch on that, and we would expect that Delrin will take about a year, just like the other part of M&M to actually close the deal. So we'll get a deal done in a 4-, 5-month window and then regulatory approvals that will kind of take like a year. So data room is getting finished up. And obviously, we've had inbound phone calls about it, but we haven't really gone into deep engagement, yet. We're just getting ready to do that kind of in the next couple of weeks.\nAleksey Yefremov: And Ed, you provided initially some expectations for valuation during the sale of mobility business, would you care to do the same about Delrin maybe in broad terms? What are your expectations for the multiple?\nEd Breen: No, I am not going to do that. We sold 90% of that at 14.1x. So I think what we said more than happened. And I will say Delrin is a very good business. It's a very high EBITDA business, so we're looking forward to a nice sale there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Spector from UBS.\nJosh Spector: This is Josh Spector. So just a question on W&P and pricing and margins, particularly, I think in the past that segment, margins have been mid- to upper 20%. Now you're kind of more low to mid-20%. Very clear that you're getting pricing to offset inflation -- but do you have any visibility to get pricing more than inflation over the next 18 months, 2 years? Should we expect margins to expand in the outlook over time?\nLori Koch: Yes. So the underlying margin as we look at it, excluding pricing cost, so it\u2019s close to 26% in the quarter as we know it\u2019s on the cost. So starting to get back on the more normalized margin that we would expect for this segment in the upper 20s. So in a normal time to outsize the inflation we would expect to get 1% to 2% of price out of that portfolio that just dropped to the bottom line with respect to semi product innovations and favourable mix. And as we knew, into the more higher margin segment. So we\u2019ll continue to see headwinds on as reported margin as we go out the year just because of price costs and we\u2019ll continue to let you know what that adjustment looks like so you can get to know the underlying margin basis opportunity for the W&P segment. \nJosh Spector: But I guess we could take that to mean, if inflation stays where it is and you\u2019re pricing towards that, this becomes more of the new normal and then its normal incremental margins. You\u2019re not expecting accelerated pricing to persist to drive margins back up in this segment overtime. That\u2019s not your expectation. \nEd Breen: I think what would occur is hopefully commodity prices come down and we hold obviously some of the price, because of the products that we have. I would think that\u2019s the more rational way things could play out here. And you're not incorrect. This business can run at like 28% EBITDA margin. So we're certainly not pleased at 26%, but 26%, we don't feel bad about in this environment, but we would certainly strive to be more in that 28% range, and we have been there before. So as Lori said, part of it, you'll just get by.  If you just take all of this price cost out for a second because it's not normal times, we'll get a couple of points of pricing every year with our new product introductions. We don't get paid like you do in electronics and we truly can get incremental net pricing in the business, which will help. But our biggest opportunity as we highlighted in the past, is continue to get capacity released from these bigger assets like Tyvek and Nomex. We got a lot of programs around that. And that will drive the throughput through those facilities which really has an impact on the numbers. So we do think this business should run a couple of hundred basis points higher we can get there. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Vincent Andres from Morgan Stanley.\nVincent Andrews: If I can just ask, in Safety Solutions, where you are sort of on, I guess, what would be considered hard COVID comps with Tyvek into health care, and was that part of what was driving sort of the weaker product mix in the overall segment.\nLori Koch: Yeah, that was -- so it was a function of last year, we were producing full on Tyvek garments. And so we were limiting changeovers on the lines, just given that we weren't making other end markets like medical and other types of end market uses for Tyvek. And so as you now go into a more normalized environment, you have more changeovers. So therefore, your production is a little bit less, and that was -- what was driving the impact of the weaker mix within the W&P segment.\nVincent Andrews: Okay. And just as a follow-up, Lori, and maybe this will make more sense, it would be easier to follow once we have the Q, but just looking at sort of what corporate did on an EBITDA basis in the quarter versus if I look at Slide 14, and you got corporate expense of 135, stranded cost of 50, which would total up to the 185, and then you've got unquantified results of retained businesses in biomaterials. So can you give us a little bit of a help on sort of how this is going to progress over the year? Presumably you start making progress on those stranded costs, the corporate, we can kind of run rate, but what about that third piece of the retained businesses in biomaterials?\nLori Koch: Yes, so there are 3 buckets, as you had mentioned. And so the retained pieces, the margins, I would say, are in the midteens once you get on an upward trajectory as we get outside of the COVID lockdown. So the largest piece of the retained business is the adhesives business, and it did see an impact in the quarter with respect to the China situation. So that's the biggest season. And we will disclose the revenue of the retained businesses in the Q1 Friday when you get back. You'll be able to calculate kind of what the margin profile was for that space.  With respect to normal corporate expenses, those will be on the range of 135 on a full year basis as we have in our supplemental guidance. And so you would expect around 25, 26 million for the quarter. And then the third piece are the net stranded costs, and we continue to be in the range of about a net $50 million on a full year basis, and that's our target to get after as we look to eliminate those going forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Sison from Wells Fargo.\nMike Sison: Just, I guess, a quick follow-up on Rogers. I guess if they're being affected by China in 2Q, sequentially EBITDA probably doesn't improve a lot. And then if we get on the run rate that you noted for the second half, we're probably somewhere in the low 200 for EBITDA. And I know you don't own the business yet. But so just as a follow-up, why do you think things will improve in the second half? And then any updates on synergies that you can accelerate given -- it seems like '22 is going to come in a little bit short for Rogers this year.\nEd Breen: Yes. Rogers will not run around $200 million in the second half of the year. They have -- the demand is there. We know the book, by the way, again, muted pretty significantly by COVID China. And don't forget, it's auto related, a lot of the business. So that's not being as hot as it should even though end market demand is there. But they'll be running at a much more significant rate in the third quarter, assuming again, the COVID stuff is all cleaned up, lockdowns have ended, and we have line of sight where we're allowed to talk about synergy work on the cost side of 115 million. We're highly confident in it on a percentage basis, with the combo of that coming in with our life business, it's not a percent that's on the high end at all.  So like Laird with 60, we now have line of sight detail. I detail the 63 in this one. We have -- we're really racking and stacking where we have a lot of it identified. So we'll get at it really quick. And remember, one of the things that will happen immediately on the Rogers synergies is there's corporate expense of some significance because it's a public company. And that will be cleaned up very, very quickly, and then we'll start on the rest of the synergies. So -- but it will run at a very different rate in the second half of the year.\nMike Sison: Right. So for '23, we should really be thinking about 270 plus whatever growth that the industry should provide as kind of the base case for -- when we model in Rogers for '23\nEd Breen: Yes, I think that's fair. With synergies, then you got them kicking in, we'll hopefully move fast on that.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets.\nArun Viswanathan: I guess I just had a longer-term question, so several years ago, your electronics business faced a lot of pressure in China around innovation and with the Solamet Paste product. I know that's been disposed of, but do you see that kind of issues cropping up in any of your markets in the future? That would be my first question.\nEd Breen: No. I don't at all. There's nothing in the portfolio actually -- 95% of the portfolio is cutting-edge technology. If you haven't had the chance, we did all the [keychins] recently on the electronics business. I think we're in a very strong technology position, and we're constantly innovating. It's a fast-paced innovation in electronics, both we\u2019re innovating literally monthly coming out with new products in the marketplace. We're always on the cutting edge. So I don't see that. I think what you were mentioning was Solamet paste was just more of a commoditized business that was current -- but that's not where the portfolio is headed and certainly not in addition to the acquisitions with Laird and Rogers. They're very key positions we have in great technology plays.\nArun Viswanathan: Okay. And then if I could, is there any update you could provide on any of the PFAS dynamics? Do you expect any kind of settlement by year-end with the water districts or -- what are you working on, on that side?\nEd Breen: Yes. No, we've been, as we've mentioned before, we've been talking about settlement with the plaintiffs and mostly, obviously, around the water cases. And as I have mentioned a few minutes ago, the judge has even encouraged both parties to be talking to each other, I think that was made public, I don't know, a month or 6 weeks ago. So hopefully, good progress this year.\nOperator: And the last question for today comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.\nLaurence Alexander: I guess a question about your degree of visibility. In terms of how customers are sharing development schedules and order books and the shift in DuPont's portfolio, how many quarters out do you feel you have good visibility at this point?\nLori Koch: Yes. When we do look at that, its to see how our order patterns are. I would on average, we have about 60 days visibility orders that come in, in combination between E&I and W&P. It's a little bit longer in W&P than what it is in E&I, but as we had mentioned earlier in the call, we look at a 20-day order pattern every week, and it has not changed in any significance for the past several months. And so we continue to see very strong underlying demand. Some of our backlog within the water space and within the adhesive space has started to build with the dynamics that we're navigating within the China COVID situation, but overall demand remains very, very strong.\nEd Breen: I would just give you one other angle, obviously, we look at very hard. And you sort of, I think, just made this comment. We work very closely with our customers on design wins. By the way, as those Laird and Rogers, it's a very key component of the business. So we can see -- again, we can see the overall demand out 6 months, but we can see where trends are developing, where we're going to have nice lift in business.  So as Lori just mentioned, our adhesives business, we are bidding on and working with design in on a lot of applications in the battery and the auto -- next-generation auto market. And we know where we're getting wins or we're close to getting wins. So that's something we track very, very closely to look at those trends, same within semiconductor, same within the water business. So that's important to us to look at also.\nOperator: I will turn the call back over to Chris Mecray for closing remarks.\nChris Mecray: All right. Thanks, everybody, for joining the call. And just for your reference, a copy of the transcript will be posted on our IR website shortly. This concludes our call. Thanks again.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Lori Koch",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. As Ed mentioned, we saw continued strong demand during the quarter in key end markets. Global supply chain challenges and cost inflation have persisted and even intensified during the quarter due to the war in Ukraine. In response to inflation, we continued our strategic pricing actions and were able to fully offset higher costs during the quarter related to raw material, logistics and energy. These factors, along with our team's continued focus on execution, contributed to net sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS results well above expectations. Focusing on financial highlights on Slide 5 for the quarter. Net sales of $3.3 billion were up 9% on both an as-reported and organic basis versus the first quarter of 2021. The acquisition of Laird, partially offset by non-core divestitures, provided 2% net tailwind to net sales, while currency was a 2% headwind during the quarter. Organic sales growth included 6% pricing gains and 3% higher volume. Pricing gains reflect the actions taken to offset overall cost inflation, including the spike in energy cost that we are seeing at our site. Volume growth reflected continued strong customer demand with order patterns remaining solid, led by electronics, industrial technologies, water and construction end markets. These factors resulted in organic sales growth during the quarter of 10% and 9% for W&P and E&I, respectively. On a regional basis, organic sales growth was broad-based globally with W&P driving growth in North America and EMEA and E&I driving growth in Asia Pacific. From an earnings perspective, operating EBITDA of $818 million was up 2% versus the year ago period and adjusted EPS of $0.82 per share was up 19%. The increase in operating EBITDA was driven by pricing actions, volume gains and strong earnings from the Laird acquisitions, which more than offset higher inflationary cost pressures, as well as weaker product mix in W&P and the absence of a gain on asset divestiture in E&I last year. Operating EBITDA margin during the quarter was 25%, which was better than our expectations set earlier this quarter, about 160 basis points below the year ago period, which I'll explain further. Navigating cost inflation was a key focus during the quarter and our success in doing so was a significant driver in our results. While the majority of the raw material inflation that we have discussed in the past relates to the M&M businesses, which are now part of discontinued operations, our Remainco businesses also have inflation exposure, and we saw a spike in energy costs during the quarter, most notably in W&P. We fully offset about $190 million of cost inflation during the quarter, which kept our results hold on a dollars basis.  While these pricing actions enabled us to maintain a neutral earnings profile, price cost dynamics resulted in 150 basis point headwind to operating EBITDA margin during the quarter. Our underlying operating EBITDA margin adjusted to exclude price cost factors was 26.5% or essentially flat compared to the year ago period. Further, as you adjust margins in the prior period to exclude the onetime gain related to the asset sale in E&I, our underlying margin of 26.5% would have increased about 70 basis points from the last year. Another key metric that we track is incremental margins. On a reported basis, incremental margin for the quarter was 6% from the year ago period. However, I indicated previously the importance of evaluating the results on an underlying basis. If you remove the impact of price cost, incremental margin was over 20%, and if you also exclude the headwind from the onetime asset sales, on top of that, incremental margin was almost 60%. I mentioned these data points to illustrate the volume strength we are seeing within the portfolio. From a cash perspective, cash flow from operations during the quarter of $209 million and capital expenditures of $251 million resulted in a free cash outflow of $42 million. The cash outflow was the result of variable compensation payments to our employees, which were approximately $100 million more this year than our normal payout, and higher working capital trade includes set of actions taken to increase inventory in reaction to continued product supply constraints. We expect significant improvement in free cash flow as we move towards the second half of the year consistent with our typical seasonal pattern. Turning to Slide 6. Adjusted EPS of $0.82 per share was up 19% compared to $0.69 per share in the year ago period. Higher volumes and strong results from Laird collectively provided a benefit to adjusted EPS in the quarter of $0.11 per share. These gains more than offset other previously disclosed portfolio related actions, weaker product mix in W&P and additional tax Kapton bind start-up costs in E&I totaling $0.09 per share in the aggregate. A lower share count and reduced interest expense from deleveraging actions continue to benefit our EPS results. Our base tax rate for the quarter was 21.8% and we continue to expect our base tax rate for the full year 2022 to be in the range of 21% to 23%. Turning to segment results, beginning with E&I on Slide 7, E&I delivered net sales growth of 18%, including 9% organic growth and 11% portfolio benefit from Laird and a 2% headwind from currency. Organic growth for E&I includes an 8% increase in volume and a 1% increase in price. For line of business view, organic sales growth was led by semiconductor technologies, which increased mid-teens as robust demand continued, led by the ongoing transition to more advanced nodes, growth in high-performance computing and 5G communications as well as share gains.  Within Industrial Solutions, organic sales growth was up low double digits on a continuation of strong volume growth led by OLED materials for new phone and television launches, ongoing strength for Kalrez product offerings, most notably for semi CapEx and strong demand for health care applications such as biopharma and tubing. Interconnect Solutions sales decreased low single digits on an organic basis due to a slight volume decline. Volume gains for films and laminates in certain industrial end markets were more than offset by declines in consumer electronics, primarily related to China.,, as well as the anticipated return to more normal seasonal order patterns for smartphone. For the full year, we expect Interconnect Solutions to be up mid-single digits on an organic basis, led by strong demand in the second half and additional capacity coming online later this year from our Kapton expansion. From a regional perspective, E&I delivered sales growth in all regions with high single-digit organic growth in Asia Pacific, noting China was down slightly. Operating EBITDA for E&I of $476 million increased 9% as volume gains, strong earnings from Laird and pricing actions more than offset the absence of a prior year asset sale gain, higher raw material and logistics costs and a continuation of start-up costs associated with our Kapton capacity expansion. Operating EBITDA margin of 31% reflects sequential improvement from the fourth quarter of more than 200 basis points. On a year-over-year basis, the primary driver of the decline in operating EBITDA margin was the absence of a prior year gain. Adjusting margins in the prior year to exclude the onetime benefit, operating EBITDA margin was down 70 basis points year-over-year as a result of price cost and Kapton start-up costs more than offsetting volume gains. Turning to Slide 8, W&P delivered net sales growth of 8%, consisting of 10% organic growth and a 2% headwind from currency. Organic growth for W&P reflects broad-based pricing actions across the segment implemented to offset cost inflation. Volumes were flat as gains in shelter and water solutions were offset by declines in safety. From a line of business view, organic sales growth was led by Shelter Solutions, which was up high teens driven by pricing actions and continued robust demand in North American residential construction for products such as Tyvek house wrap, as well as ongoing improvement in commercial construction for quarry and surface products. Sales for Water Solutions were up high single digits on an organic basis on volume and pricing gains. Global demand remains strong for all water technologies and across all regions. Within Safety Solutions, sales were up mid-single digits on an organic basis as pricing actions were partially offset by lower volumes of Tyvek as we shifted production from garments to other end market applications. Volumes were up slightly for aramid fibers on continued improvement in industrial end markets. Operating EBITDA for W&P of $341 million declined 4% versus last year due to a weaker product mix. Operating EBITDA margin was better than our expectations set earlier in the quarter, but the impact of price cost was about a 210 basis point headwind to margin. Excluding the price cost impacts, operating EBITDA margin was about 26%, approaching more normalized levels for W&P. Before I turn it back over to Ed, I'll close with a few comments on our financial outlook on Slide 5. Despite the strong start to the year and solid demand, the macro environment remains volatile with several key uncertain factors. Based on our expectations and in consideration of these uncertainties, our full year guidance ranges for operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS remain unchanged at $3.25 billion to $3.45 billion and $3.20 to $3.50 per share, respectively. These ranges include a $35 million earnings headwind as a result of suspending operations in Russia. We are increasing our guidance range for net sales to be between $13.3 billion and $13.7 billion to reflect price increases needed to offset cost inflation, which we now anticipate at $600 million in year-over-year headwinds. Although underlying demand in key end markets such as electronics, industrial technologies and water remains strong, we are seeing further supply chain constraints, primarily from additional government-mandated lockdowns in China, which will likely impact volume growth in the second quarter. Based on these anticipated headwinds, as well as an element of previously projected Q2 sales realized in the first quarter, we expect second quarter 2022 sales to be between $3.2 billion and $3.3 billion or up about 5% year-over-year at the midpoint. Based on these same assumptions, we expect second quarter operating EBITDA between $750 million and $800 million, and adjusted EPS decrease $0.70 and $0.80 per share.  At the midpoint of our guidance, second quarter operation EBITDA margin is expected to decline just over 100 basis points sequentially as supply chain constraints are assumed to impact production rates. We expect operating EBITDA margin in the back half of 2022 to improve on typical seasonal volume strength and improved plant utilization as we clear COVID-related production challenges impacting the first half of the year. This outlook assumes moderating China lockdown impacts as we get into mid-May, given the positive trajectory in the Shanghai region and our limited exposure around Beijing. However, further outlook risks could be triggered as the lockdown spreads to Shenzhen and the Pearl River Delta region, given the concentration of manufacturing and shipping there for DuPont as well as our suppliers. With that, let me turn the call back to Ed. Thanks, Ashley. Yes, the second half ramp from the first half is really just a reflection of our seasonal volume improvement in the back half within E&I. It's primarily driven by smartphones as we go into the Christmas season and within water, a lot in the construction space as we see a ramp there. So the -- the list on volume is dropping to the bottom line, which is translating to the EBIT improvement and the margin improvement in the second half as we drive leverage through the P&L.  On your question around net price, so we'll expect all year to remain neutral on net price cost that we raised, the midpoint of the guidance for the full year to reflect about another $100 million of raw material escalation on a full year basis. So we're now expecting somewhere in the range of $600 million that will fully offset with price. So that won't change coming out of the first quarter for the rest of the year. Yes. In total, there's 2 major pieces that are impacting the 2Q guidance, so -- and they're both related to China. So first is a shift of sales that we had expected to land in 2Q that landed in 1Q, and that was primarily with our customers pulling in on volume because of what was going on in China. We would size that at about $35 million of sales. And then as far as the shutdown that happened, it started to get progressively worse in mid-March, and we're anticipating a mid-May reopening. We estimate that we missed about $20 million worth of sales.  And there's also an impact on our margins with our plants not running at full capacity. So we have -- 2 sites in China that went into full lockdown mode in mid-March. We expect them to be fully reopened by mid-May. And then we had some key raw materials within our electronics business that we source from China that we weren't able to get full supply, so we ran some of our domestic plants at lower unit rates. And so that was impacting our margin profile in the second quarter as well. And I think the other piece, Jeff, too, with our guidance for the second quarter, but it's beyond just China and then the production-related effects with Russia that we noted in our slides that we pulled Russia out. On a full year basis, it's about $35 million of EBIT, probably about $80 million of sales, that's impacting primarily 2Q and beyond. Yes, I would say as far as demand is concerned in the 3 end markets as you had noted. So we saw strength in residential construction. We expect that to continue to be a point of strength in the second quarter. We did note softness in consumer electronics, but that was primarily in China with respect to the lockdown and also a little bit of an impact of our own viewing of seasonality with respect to when we do our normal smartphone shipments. So we've telegraphed in the past that the first half will be weaker, the second half will be stronger because of a change in seasonal patterns as we sell into the smartphone market. But on a full year basis, we expect that end market to be up mid-single digits.  And then in auto, you've seen the revisions downward with respect to IHS auto builds. I think now it's sitting at 4% on a full year basis. So our estimates would probably be a little bit lighter than that with respect to what we think that the market will do. But the underlying demand remains strong. It's just really a matter of supply chain specifically around the chip constraints that are impacting that. But I think the highlight to you there is we do continue to see very strong growth within the EV space. And so for us, a large portion of that comes from our adhesives business. We saw a really nice growth in our EV-related sales in Q1, and we expect to about double those sales in Q2 in line with where the EV market is going in general. And we really look forward to the incoming business from Rogers to pair with our business to really take advantage of the opportunity there. On the price side, I wouldn't say it materially different across those end markets is what we're seeing with respect to inflation by segment. So within E&I, the inflation is not as material as what it is within W&P, and you see that in price. So we got about 1% in E&I and price and about 10% in W&P. So there is a difference there, but nothing more than just around the raw material inflation related items. So are you talking after considering the proceeds from the M&M sales? Yes, so we see very strong demand continuing in electronics. And so we had very strong results in Q1. On a full year basis, we expect to be up pushing double digits within electronics between price and volume, and we'll obviously add to that as we close the Rogers transaction later this year. So we see a lot of strength, we see a lot of opportunity. If you look at -- we do a lot of detailed analysis about our results versus peers and a couple of them have already been out before, and we back up very nicely when you compare like-to-like product lines.  And so we also stack up very nicely when you compare our results versus some of the key benchmarks out there. So for example, MSI is one of the key components of the semi business. People are expecting that to be up 7% to 8%. We've mentioned that we should outperform by 200 to 300 basis points. And if you look at our Q1 results in semi, we were in line with that expectation. So we are very excited about the portfolio. We'll look to continue to see where we can opportunistically broaden and strengthen that portfolio as well. Yes, so in the first quarter, they were under the impact of the same things that we were with respect to the China COVID situation. We're really looking forward to the second half when we will own them, and they have a pretty sizable expected ramp as those end markets really open up coming out of the China recovery, and they continue to see a nice growth opportunity within the EV space. And so I think if you look at the second half trajectory, that's being planned by Rogers, it would be more in line with where our expectations were on a full year basis for that portfolio. Yes, so that will come out Friday in the Q. So in the Q, we'll deconstruct the discontinued operation summary that we've reported today. I can give you a high level that they were impacted, obviously, by the China COVID situation as well and the auto end markets obviously being the largest factor, but they did continue to do a really nice job of getting priced. Yes. So the underlying margin as we look at it, excluding pricing cost, so it's close to 26% in the quarter as we know it's on the cost. So starting to get back on the more normalized margin that we would expect for this segment in the upper 20s. So in a normal time to outsize the inflation we would expect to get 1% to 2% of price out of that portfolio that just dropped to the bottom line with respect to semi product innovations and favourable mix. And as we knew, into the more higher margin segment. So we'll continue to see headwinds on as reported margin as we go out the year just because of price costs and we'll continue to let you know what that adjustment looks like so you can get to know the underlying margin basis opportunity for the W&P segment. Yeah, that was -- so it was a function of last year, we were producing full on Tyvek garments. And so we were limiting changeovers on the lines, just given that we weren't making other end markets like medical and other types of end market uses for Tyvek. And so as you now go into a more normalized environment, you have more changeovers. So therefore, your production is a little bit less, and that was -- what was driving the impact of the weaker mix within the W&P segment. Yes, so there are 3 buckets, as you had mentioned. And so the retained pieces, the margins, I would say, are in the midteens once you get on an upward trajectory as we get outside of the COVID lockdown. So the largest piece of the retained business is the adhesives business, and it did see an impact in the quarter with respect to the China situation. So that's the biggest season. And we will disclose the revenue of the retained businesses in the Q1 Friday when you get back. You'll be able to calculate kind of what the margin profile was for that space.  With respect to normal corporate expenses, those will be on the range of 135 on a full year basis as we have in our supplemental guidance. And so you would expect around 25, 26 million for the quarter. And then the third piece are the net stranded costs, and we continue to be in the range of about a net $50 million on a full year basis, and that's our target to get after as we look to eliminate those going forward. Yes. When we do look at that, its to see how our order patterns are. I would on average, we have about 60 days visibility orders that come in, in combination between E&I and W&P. It's a little bit longer in W&P than what it is in E&I, but as we had mentioned earlier in the call, we look at a 20-day order pattern every week, and it has not changed in any significance for the past several months. And so we continue to see very strong underlying demand. Some of our backlog within the water space and within the adhesive space has started to build with the dynamics that we're navigating within the China COVID situation, but overall demand remains very, very strong."

            "name": "Ed Breen",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining our first quarter financial review. We posted strong results this quarter, but before we discuss that, I would like to thank each of our employees for their continued dedication and strong commitment to our customers. Their perseverance in the face of many obstacles is what made our results possible. I'd especially like to express our appreciation for our China-based colleagues, many of whom have endured weeks of lockdowns, but have continued to operate and get necessary work done. Also, our hearts go out to those affected by the war in Ukraine, and we sincerely hope this conflict can be ended as soon as possible. Our first quarter results from continuing operations included a strong 9% organic sales increase from the prior year or 14% growth, including the Laird acquisition contribution. Organic volume increased 3%, led by an 8% increase in the E&I segment. Overall customer demand remains strong across the vast majority of end markets, led by low double-digit volume growth in both semiconductor and industrial technologies with the E&I segment and mid-single-digit volume growth in water and shelter solutions within the water and protection business.  Our top line growth included 6% average pricing increases that we took to offset the continued cost inflation that we are experiencing. We realized price increases in all businesses totaling about 190 million, and a fully offset raw material, logistics and energy cost deflation. I continue to be impressed by the job our teams are doing as we remain -- a target to remain price cost neutral for the full year 2022, including the incremental actions taken in March, largely in reaction to the conflict-driven spike in energy and related costs during the period. Turning to Slide 4, I'd like to update you on key focus areas for 2022 stakeholder value creation, including our portfolio transformation, our balanced approach to capital allocation and our continued focus on growth execution. First, we believe we are on track with what we noted previously regarding the timing associated with the M&M divestiture to Celanese. The M&M transaction is anticipated to be complete around the end of the year, and we are also continuing with the process to divest the Delrin business.  For the Rogers acquisition, progress is being made on the required regulatory reviews, while we remain optimistic by closing by the end of the second quarter, the process could extend into early third quarter. We continue to see no issue that would prevent a close of this transaction. I'd like to reiterate that DuPont's financial profile -- pro forma for these transactions will firmly position the company with top quartile revenue growth, operating EBITDA margins and low cyclicality relative to top tier multi-industrial companies. Greater focus on secular high-growth end markets in electronics, water, industrial technologies, protection and next-generation automotive will serve as a sound basis for our innovation-led organic growth execution. Regarding the Laird Performance Materials acquisition, we are also on track to achieve cost synergies of $63 million, somewhat ahead of initial expectations. The deal has been a success so far, including overall financial performance ahead of plan for both top and bottom line results, and early progress to achieve commercial synergies on top of the cost synergies noted. As one example, we are starting to see some nice synergies with Laird process and equipment technology, enabling more effective solutions for downstream customers, including auto OEMs, as well as consumer electronics applications. Regarding future capital allocation and namely the net cash we will receive from our planned divestitures, we will continue to pursue a balanced strategy that includes prioritizing the return of excess capital to shareholders as well as strategic M&A. This is consistent with our actions taken over the last year, during which we increased our share repurchase and dividend allocation, as well as completed the Laird acquisition. Once the Rogers and M&M transactions are completed, we'll be poised to continue to improve our portfolio and financial position as well as accelerate capital return options Given the magnitude of the anticipated deal proceeds, we expect that there will be room to execute substantial incremental share buybacks, while disciplined M&A will also remain a key deployment priority. Regarding our existing $1 billion share repurchase program authorized during Q1, we anticipate completing that authorization during 2022, ahead of the 1-year duration initially guided. Turning to core growth, we continue to focus on execution of our innovation-based organic growth opportunities. We are pleased with 3% volume growth in the quarter given production constraints due to lack of raw material availability and supply chain challenges. We are excited about visible growth drivers enabled by our technical innovation teams and application engineers who are squarely focused on helping customers solve their most complex challenges.  In E&I, continued top line growth momentum this year is being driven by growth in semiconductor, health care and displays end markets, by cyclical recovery in aerospace markets and by new share gains and innovation wins, muted somewhat in auto by supply chain constraints. Key examples of recent new product successes driving growth and strong margin performance include newly launched mechanical planarization pads for semiconductor manufacturing as well as new lithographic photoresist for the high-performance computing market. In W&P, we expect growth in 2022 coming from each of the lines of business. Safety has seen market growth across major segments, including aerospace, electrical infrastructure, oil and gas and health care, but muted by lower demand for protective garments. Shelter continues to experience growth opportunities from strong construction and remodeling trends. Water is experiencing strong mid- to high single-digit growth globally across all technologies.  Examples of new innovation drivers for this segment include several new membrane product families within water to drive growth in desalination and wastewater markets, as well as the launch of a new building insulation product offering increased sustainability solutions for customers. We also have a strong adhesive business that is positioned well to capture growth with its product offerings in next-generation auto and electric vehicles, especially through the commercial synergy opportunities that we expect through the Rogers acquisition. With that, let me turn it to Lori to discuss the details of the quarter, as well as our financial outlook. Before we take your questions, I'd like to highlight that we published our annual sustainability report this week, and I'm really proud of the progress we made on our 2030 goals. Our sustainability strategy is grounded in 3 pillars: innovation, protecting people and the planet and empowering employees and customers. I'll just note a few highlights. DuPont is leveraging our innovation focus to help customers meet their sustainability goals. A great example of that is the new formulations within our building installation products that helped increase energy efficiency, as well as new technologies from our Water Solutions business that reduce energy intensity. We're also focusing on renewable energy as part of our integrated climate and energy approach.  Last year, we signed a virtual power purchase agreement that will supply about 25% of DuPont's total electricity starting in 2023. Additionally, Apple just announced that DuPont was selected to join their Supplier Clean Energy Program. which is an example of DuPont working with industry partners to drive sustainability progress at scale. We continue to advance our commitments to DE&I. We are excited about the newest female nominee to our Board of Directors, Christina Johnson. Also the strong gender and ethnic representation of our leadership teams continues despite competitive labor markets. There are many great examples and stories in the report of how our teams are delivering on our purpose and driving sustainability. Overall, our teams have done a tremendous job. With that, we are pleased to take your questions. And let me turn it back to the operator to open the Q&A. Ashley, I would just add to Lori's point, the first half to second half ramp, it is our typical seasonality. If you go back and look at last year, it's about a 7% sequential lift first half, second half, and that's typically what we do because of the items that Lori mentioned. So nothing unusual in the pattern there. Yes, Scott. The backlog looks great. It's been staying at very elevated levels. We look at it weekly. There's really no end market that's not feeling good -- as you know, auto is down a little just because of auto production, but that's not a demand-driven thing. It's just chip shortages and supply chain issues. But all our end markets from an order pattern standpoint, feel good as of looking at it this week. So no issues there at all. And really, the only issues we're dealing with here, again, it's not demand driven. It's really more centered around supply chain and China and COVID lockdowns for the guide on the second quarter. But if we didn't have those issues, our sales would definitely be higher in the second quarter, but that's what we're dealing with there. It seems like we've plateaued, Scott. All the price increases are implemented when the war broke out, we did a whole another round of price increases, mainly because the natural gas lifting is significantly as it did. And by the way, other constraints in there, but that was the big one. So we did a round of increases again, which we had just finished doing. We did it again in every business. And as we said, we caught all the inflation in the quarter by on the roles on logistics and on energy. So we caught everything with $190 million of inflation that we saw. And as Lori just mentioned a minute ago, we think it's plateaued. If it hasn't, we'll do another round of price increases, I feel like we can get it if we have to, but it does appear to have plateaued. So we'll have an incremental $600 million of inflation if things hold where they're at for this year, and we'll have that all covered with price. Yes, so Jeff, you I think summarized it well. We're leaning much more towards a decent large, if you could call it, share repurchase with where our multiple's at. I don't think this is where DuPont's model will be sitting in the future. And obviously softness in everyone's stock price just because of recent external events out there.  So we're going to step on the $1 billion share repurchase a little bit quicker as we said in our prepared remarks, by a quarter or 4 months, something like that and get it done early. And I would expect conversations with the Board that we're going to look at a much larger share repurchase program. I don't think we need to wait until the proceeds are necessarily in, but I would like to make sure nothing else crazy is going on in the world.  We do have a $5.2 billion outstanding loan on the Rogers' piece that will get paid off, so our leverage will be north of 3 and with that -- but when we get the proceeds from M&M, you kind of know the math, we're sitting on lots of billions of dollars here. So -- so yes, you do hear a little bit of shift in tone because of where the multiple's at. The market is a little bit tough right now for everybody. And my gut is we're going to step on it in a bigger way. Yes. To give you a specific on what Lori said, in Circleville, Ohio we make our Kapton, which is a high-margin product. We're fully sold out. We get half of a monomer that we need out of China, and we had delayed shipments out of China. So we did have supply of the monomer. So instead of shutting -- running it full tilt and then shutting the facility down, we just eased off the run rate some. We know when we're now getting supply from China. So there's an example. It kind of hits your rates for 1 month, 1.5 months, like that. So it's just these one-offs because of the China lockdowns, which hopefully dissipates as we exit the quarter. And then, Jeff, when you look at the full year guide, we beat by $90 million in EBIT in the first quarter kind of from consensus. We're down kind of $60 million in the second quarter off of -- I'll use you guys' consensus, all because of what Lori just described here. But then we have nothing in the second half that's unusual. It's our normal seasonal ramp. That's 7% that I mentioned. That's what we're counting on, including we'll get some better unit rates from the things we just described to you. So no real big change in order patterns for us that we would typically see. Yes. So my gut is as we sit right now, I don't see any deal that we would want to do until we're in this 2023. And I'm not saying I know something is available in 2023, but the way stock prices are moving around right now and all, it just makes it a tougher environment. So I don't see anything happening until we get into 2023. And quite frankly, we don't have anything -- we have things we're -- a couple of things we're interested in, as I said before, but I don't see an actionable anytime in the near future. So that could change, so don't hold me to that. But I can't see anything happening until we're nicely into 2023, if then depending on what's going on. Yes, I would say 2 things, Steve. Our portfolio, we feel very good about. And it's a fairly broad portfolio, so we touch most of the water filtration type markets out there, wastewater home, home applications, which are big for us in China, desalination, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks. So we feel good about the breadth of what we have in the technology we have behind it, and we continue to bring new products out to market. The one area that we would look at and by that, it doesn't mean it's an acquisition that could be organically done as we need to expand our manufacturing footprint and we need a bigger presence with the manufacturing in the Asia market, which is a very fast-growing market for us. So we've been studying very hard a project there to bring up a facility in the next couple of years in that area. So that's a high priority for us.  And then this kind of goes to the second part of your question there, the one opportunity we have or potentially have and our R&D team and application teams are looking at is digitizing the water business. So we know when replacement components are needed ahead of time, and it's kind of systematized, and that could be a real opportunity for us to kind of satisfy our customers by doing it that way. And that opportunity, we've been studying hard for the last year. Yes. Nothing new has changed on the landscape except I'll just say we continue to be in conversations with the plaintiffs down in the MDL. I feel like we will make progress this year on that. By the way, the judge has continued to encourage us, the judge down there in charge of these MDL cases has actually encouraged us and the plaintiffs we talk in and coming up with a settlement. And so I'll just leave it at that for now, but nothing new besides that. They have the backlog. A lot of it is in the EV space. We've looked at it. So it's just a matter of, A, getting over the lockdown issue in China and then actually accomplishing the ramp in their production rates. But we think second half of the year, they'll be right around the ZIP code of where we would expect it. Yes. So Delrin, by the way, we've been putting the data room together and all that. We're just getting ready to launch on that, and we would expect that Delrin will take about a year, just like the other part of M&M to actually close the deal. So we'll get a deal done in a 4-, 5-month window and then regulatory approvals that will kind of take like a year. So data room is getting finished up. And obviously, we've had inbound phone calls about it, but we haven't really gone into deep engagement, yet. We're just getting ready to do that kind of in the next couple of weeks. No, I am not going to do that. We sold 90% of that at 14.1x. So I think what we said more than happened. And I will say Delrin is a very good business. It's a very high EBITDA business, so we're looking forward to a nice sale there. I think what would occur is hopefully commodity prices come down and we hold obviously some of the price, because of the products that we have. I would think that's the more rational way things could play out here. And you're not incorrect. This business can run at like 28% EBITDA margin. So we're certainly not pleased at 26%, but 26%, we don't feel bad about in this environment, but we would certainly strive to be more in that 28% range, and we have been there before. So as Lori said, part of it, you'll just get by.  If you just take all of this price cost out for a second because it's not normal times, we'll get a couple of points of pricing every year with our new product introductions. We don't get paid like you do in electronics and we truly can get incremental net pricing in the business, which will help. But our biggest opportunity as we highlighted in the past, is continue to get capacity released from these bigger assets like Tyvek and Nomex. We got a lot of programs around that. And that will drive the throughput through those facilities which really has an impact on the numbers. So we do think this business should run a couple of hundred basis points higher we can get there. Yes. Rogers will not run around $200 million in the second half of the year. They have -- the demand is there. We know the book, by the way, again, muted pretty significantly by COVID China. And don't forget, it's auto related, a lot of the business. So that's not being as hot as it should even though end market demand is there. But they'll be running at a much more significant rate in the third quarter, assuming again, the COVID stuff is all cleaned up, lockdowns have ended, and we have line of sight where we're allowed to talk about synergy work on the cost side of 115 million. We're highly confident in it on a percentage basis, with the combo of that coming in with our life business, it's not a percent that's on the high end at all.  So like Laird with 60, we now have line of sight detail. I detail the 63 in this one. We have -- we're really racking and stacking where we have a lot of it identified. So we'll get at it really quick. And remember, one of the things that will happen immediately on the Rogers synergies is there's corporate expense of some significance because it's a public company. And that will be cleaned up very, very quickly, and then we'll start on the rest of the synergies. So -- but it will run at a very different rate in the second half of the year. Yes, I think that's fair. With synergies, then you got them kicking in, we'll hopefully move fast on that. No. I don't at all. There's nothing in the portfolio actually -- 95% of the portfolio is cutting-edge technology. If you haven't had the chance, we did all the [keychins] recently on the electronics business. I think we're in a very strong technology position, and we're constantly innovating. It's a fast-paced innovation in electronics, both we're innovating literally monthly coming out with new products in the marketplace. We're always on the cutting edge. So I don't see that. I think what you were mentioning was Solamet paste was just more of a commoditized business that was current -- but that's not where the portfolio is headed and certainly not in addition to the acquisitions with Laird and Rogers. They're very key positions we have in great technology plays. Yes. No, we've been, as we've mentioned before, we've been talking about settlement with the plaintiffs and mostly, obviously, around the water cases. And as I have mentioned a few minutes ago, the judge has even encouraged both parties to be talking to each other, I think that was made public, I don't know, a month or 6 weeks ago. So hopefully, good progress this year. I would just give you one other angle, obviously, we look at very hard. And you sort of, I think, just made this comment. We work very closely with our customers on design wins. By the way, as those Laird and Rogers, it's a very key component of the business. So we can see -- again, we can see the overall demand out 6 months, but we can see where trends are developing, where we're going to have nice lift in business.  So as Lori just mentioned, our adhesives business, we are bidding on and working with design in on a lot of applications in the battery and the auto -- next-generation auto market. And we know where we're getting wins or we're close to getting wins. So that's something we track very, very closely to look at those trends, same within semiconductor, same within the water business. So that's important to us to look at also."

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Chris Mecray. You may begin your conference.\nChris Mecray: Good morning, and thank you for joining us for DuPont's fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results conference call. Joining me today are Ed Breen, Chief Executive Officer, and Lori Koch, Chief Financial Officer. We've prepared slides to supplement our remarks, which are posted on DuPont's website under the Investor Relations tab and through the webcast link. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the slides. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Our Form 10-K, as updated by our current and periodic reports, includes detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today are on a continuing operations basis and exclude significant items. We will also refer to other non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in our press release and presentation materials and have been posted to DuPont's Investor Relations website. I'll now turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Breen: Good morning, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial review. This morning's earnings release is consistent with the preliminary results announced on January 24th, and we have added our customary segment detail and end market color while also providing incremental detail on our 2024 financial forecast. Broadly, we continue to see encouraging stabilization within electronics markets. Our Semiconductor Technologies business reported sequential sales growth of 2% in the fourth quarter as expected as the first sign of getting past the bottom at chip production. In Interconnect Solutions, we saw a return to year-over-year volume growth with volumes up 2% versus the prior year after sales bottomed earlier in 2023. However, as we finished 2023, we did see additional channel inventory destocking within many of our industrial-based businesses as well as continued weak demand in China with incremental weakness in our China water business. This resulted in fourth quarter net sales, which declined 7% year-over-year, falling below our guidance expectations. We have already noted that we see a continuation of similar volume trends into the first quarter, and I will come back to this, but we are encouraged that we see signs of market stabilization, bottoming of customer inventories and a pickup in orders in the month of January that support a view of recovering sales and earnings through 2024. Fourth quarter operating EBITDA of $715 million was down 6% year-over-year, reflecting continued pressure across many of our largely short cycle businesses. We remain very focused on managing what we can control, including discretionary spending levers, and also executing the restructuring actions announced last November. This focus helped to contain margin impact in the period despite a 9% drop in volume. Looking into 2024, we continue to target annualized cost savings of $150 million, which we will begin to realize later in the first quarter and which should further bolster our go-forward margin profile. I am pleased we finished the year with strong cash generation as we continue to prioritize working capital improvement and discipline following the inventory build seen during the supply challenge 2022 period. For the full year, adjusted free cash flow was $1.6 billion with conversion at 100% versus our target of greater than 90%. This included fourth quarter adjusted free cash flow of $501 million, which represented 133% conversion. Adjusted EPS for the year of $3.48 per share increased over last year as benefits from our ongoing capital allocation and share repurchases more than offset substantial volume decrements. Turning to Slide 4, we continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities. First, this morning, we announced that we completed the $2 billion accelerated share repurchase transaction launched last September. At the conclusion of the ASR transaction, we retired an additional 6.7 million shares with the true-up, bringing its total to 27.9 million shares retired under the $2 billion ASR. Completion of this ASR wraps up the $5 billion program that we announced in November 2022, enabling the repurchase of approximately 15% of our outstanding shares over this time period. We also announced that our Board approved a new $1 billion share repurchase program, and we intend to launch a new $500 million ASR transaction imminently. We expect to complete the full $1 billion program by the end of this year. Finally, today we also announced an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.38 per share or a 6% increase. We will continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 35% to 45% over time and expect to increase our dividend annually in-line with earnings growth. We exited 2023 on a favorable balance sheet and liquidity position with an adjusted net leverage ratio of 2.1 times and with no long-term bond maturities due until November of 2025. We also repaid $300 million of debt due during the fourth quarter with cash on hand. Finally, we also continue to invest in innovation and our operational excellence program to support long-term organic growth. In 2024, we expect capital spending at about 5% of sales and target R&D spend at about 4% of sales for total DuPont. Regarding our innovation and growth pipeline, we were pleased during the fourth quarter with our electronics portfolio to be selected by a leading US OEM for our Microfill metallization product, which offers improved plating uniformity for advanced computing. In water, our team significantly advanced commercialization of the Oxymem membrane products for wastewater biological treatment. Within industrial, our Kalrez business opened a new facility in Delaware to support growth for its global semiconductor products. And finally, within adhesives, we launched a new structural epoxy adhesive specific for larger scale energy storage system. Before I turn it over to Lori, let's review our expected demand outlook by business based on active conversations that we have had with customers recently. For electronics, our ICS business serving printed circuit boards already bottomed in mid-2023 and continues to gradually recover alongside global electronics demand. We expect utilization for our customers in this area to increase this year into the 60s on a percentage basis from the mid-50s in the first quarter. For semiconductor, industry forecast for chip production, that were pushed out several times in 2023, are signaling a firmer 2024 recovery, and our outlook assumes chip fab utilization increasing through the year to exit at a run rate around the low 80s on a percentage basis from the low 70s in the first quarter. This inflection also includes stabilization for end market consumption in smartphone, PC and tablet markets, driven in part by replacement demand as well as improved data center demand bolstered by AI-driven growth. These trends bode well for DuPont's strength within electronics materials, and our customers are pointing to improve volume in both semi and ICS during 2024. Within our industrial-based businesses, while inventory destocking impacts have continued into the first quarter, customer feedback indicates a positive order inflection as the year progresses. Let's review specific end markets. First, shelter, which saw notable destock in 2023, now sits with inventory back to normal levels and we expect a slight positive volume compare in 2024 beginning in the first quarter. In safety, we believe our customers' inventory is also close to normal at this point for Tyvek medical packaging, and we expect sales to recover during the second and into the third quarter. Further, we expect reduced destock impact within safety solutions across the couple of industrial end markets in the second half. In water, we have communicated with our distributor customers in China and we expect a sequential pickup in sales towards the end of the second quarter. Distributor inventories have declined substantially from the peak last year. Finally, I would mention that we expect to see order improvement over the next several quarters in our Kalrez business with Industrial Solutions. Our Liveo biopharma business is anticipated to recover later in the second half. So, we have firm signals from a wide range of businesses within the DuPont portfolio that support a sales bottom in early 2024. This is reflected in stronger orders during the month of January after continued weakness in December. To wrap up, we remain confident that our key end markets are well positioned for long-term growth and our teams are extremely focused on operating discipline and site level execution, which positions us well to accelerate growth as inventories normalize. With that, I'll turn it over to Lori to cover the financial results and outlook in detail.\nLori Koch: Thanks, Ed, and good morning. Our financial results in 2023 were clearly impacted by significant destocking and demand pressure in China, but our focus has remained on sound operational execution across the business. I'm very pleased that our team's effort to drive productivity and operational excellence clearly minimize decremental margins and help drive substantial cash flow improvement. In 2024, our continued proactive approach to managing the business will yield impactful cost reduction beginning later in the first quarter and building from there from the restructuring actions announced last November. We anticipate yielding at least two-thirds of the total $150 million in restructuring benefits during 2024, with the balance realized next year. Like Ed, I'm also encouraged by the expected trajectory of demand and volume based on direct customer feedback and data supporting the bottoming of channel inventory in key end markets. Our current forecast assumes a bottom for total company sales and earnings in the first quarter, followed by steady recovery as the year progresses with the return to year-over-year growth in the second half. I'll come back to the outlook later, but first I'll cover our results. Regarding our fourth quarter financial highlights on Slide 5, net sales of $2.9 billion decreased 7% versus the year-ago period, as a 10% organic sales decline was partially offset by a 3% portfolio benefit due primarily to the Spectrum acquisition. The organic sales decline reflects a 9% decrease in volume and a 1% decrease in price. Lower volume included the impact of channel inventory destocking within W&P's safety solutions line of business, most notably for Tyvek medical packaging. We also saw accelerated volume decline within water solutions in China, driven primarily by distributor destocking and weaker demand. On a segment view, W&P and E&I organic sales declined 15% and 7%, respectively, while organic sales in Corporate declined 4%. From a regional perspective, DuPont sales decreased on an organic basis globally versus the year-ago period, with North America, Asia Pacific and Europe down 13%, 11% and 9%, respectively. China sales were down 14% versus the prior year. Fourth quarter operating EBITDA of $715 million decreased 6% versus the year-ago period as volume declines and the impact of reduced production rates to better align inventory with demand were partially offset by lower input costs, discrete items, which benefited earnings by about $40 million, and Spectrum earnings contribution. About $25 million of the discrete item benefits were reported within the W&P segment, reflecting a land sale and other credits, with the remainder reflected in Corporate. Operating EBITDA margin during the quarter of 24.7% increased 30 basis points versus the year-ago period. In the fourth quarter, driven by continued challenging construction market conditions, coupled with ongoing channel inventory destocking, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of about $800 million. The charge relates to our protection reporting unit which consists of the shelter and safety solutions lines of business within W&P and is excluded from our adjusted operating results. As a reminder, the carrying value of the legacy Dupont assets and liabilities were marked as fair value and significant goodwill and intangible balances were recorded in connection with the DowDuPont merger. Despite the write down, we maintained long-term confidence in the Protection brand offerings and our market-leading positions remained strong. We continue to invest in and expand our application development expertise in these markets and we have taken actions to improve our cost structure to enhance our competitiveness with destocking ends. Regarding cash flow, we are very pleased with our continued cash flow improvement as we worked hard in 2023 to optimize working capital performance and especially to right-size our inventory levels following the supply chain disruptions of 2022. On a continuing operations basis, cash flow from operations of $646 million, plus capital expenditures of $145 million, resulted in adjusted free cash flow of $501 million in the fourth quarter, a significant increase versus $188 million in the year-ago period. Adjusted free cash flow conversion during the quarter was 133%, significantly ahead of last year. Turning to Slide 6, adjusted EPS for the quarter of $0.87 per share decreased from $0.89 in the year-ago period. Lower segment earnings and certain below-the-line items, including a $0.05 headwind from foreign exchange losses led by devaluation of the Argentinian peso, more than offset an $0.08 benefit from a lower share count and a $0.03 benefit from a lower tax rate. Our tax rate for the quarter was 19.2%, down from 22.2% in the year-ago period and lower than our previously communicated modeling guidance driven by certain discrete tax benefits. Our full year tax rate for 2023 was 22.8%, and our 2024 outlook assumes a base tax rate of 23% to 24%. Turning to segment results beginning with E&I on Slide 7. E&I fourth quarter net sales of $1.4 billion increased 1%, as the Spectrum sales contribution of 8% was mostly offset by an organic sales decline of 7%. The organic sales decline reflects a 5% decrease in volume and a 2% decrease in price. At the line of business level, organic sales for Semiconductor Technologies were down high single-digit versus the year-ago period resulting from reduced semi fab utilization rates as customers work to reduce finished inventories. We did see sequential improvement within semi as sales increased 2% in the fourth quarter, signaling stabilization for the business. Our customer interactions and reduced channel inventory levels point to continued recovery expected in semi during 2024 with sequential sales up slightly in the first quarter and increased lift from the second quarter onwards. Within Interconnect Solutions, organic sales declined mid single-digit as low single-digit volume gains were more than offset by price decreases, driven by lower metal pricing. Demand continues to stabilize, and this is the first quarter since the downturn started where we saw year-over-year volume growth. Organic sales for Industrial Solutions were down mid single-digit due primarily to channel inventory destocking within our Liveo product lines for biopharma markets. And for products, such as Kalrez O-rings, which are primarily used in semiconductor equipment. These declines were partially offset by continued strong demand for OLED display materials. Operating EBITDA for E&I of $378 million was down versus the year-ago period due to volume declines and lower operating rates to better align inventory with demand, partially offset by Spectrum earnings contribution. Turning to Slide 8. W&P fourth quarter net sales of $1.3 billion declined 15% versus the year-ago period due to volume decline. Within safety solutions, organic sales were down 20% on lower volumes, driven mainly by channel inventory destocking, most notably for Tyvek medical packaging products. Within water, organic sales were down high-teens, driven by distributor inventory destocking and lower industrial demand in China. Shelter solutions sales were down mid single-digit on an organic basis. The year-over-year decline has continued to improve, and we believe channel inventory destocking for construction has been completed based on distributor inventory now being back at normal levels. Operating EBITDA for W&P during the quarter of $314 million decreased 13% due to lower volumes and reduced production rates, partially offset by lower input costs and certain discrete item benefits of about $25 million. Turning to Slide 9, I'll review our first quarter 2024 outlook and full year guidance expectations. For the first quarter of 2024, we expect net sales of about $2.8 billion and operating EBITDA of about $610 million. On a volume basis, we are seeing similar inventory destocking trends from fourth quarter continue into 2024, driven by water solutions in China and in several of our industrial-based businesses. Recovery timing is expected to vary by end market as the year progresses, but we expect first quarter at the bottom on a consolidated basis. The expected sequential decline in operating EBITDA includes the absence of discrete items, which benefited fourth quarter as outlined earlier. The first quarter outlook also includes certain costs that further impact period margins primarily within W&P related to new capacity and safety as well as the impact of lower volume. For the second quarter, we expect mid single-digit sequential sales improvement and an approximate 10% increase in operating EBITDA from first quarter. This assumes volume improvement driven by reduced inventory destocking impacts in water solutions and medical packaging, continued electronics recovery, and favorable seasonality in ICS and shelter. Sequential EBITDA should benefit from this volume growth and additional realization of restructuring cost savings. For the full year 2024, we expect net sales to be between $11.9 billion and $12.3 billion with operating EBITDA expected to be between $2.8 billion and $3 billion. Year-over-year sales growth in the second half is expected to be driven by ongoing electronics market recovery, including improvement in semiconductor fab utilization rate and continued utilization improvement for PCB manufacturing within ICS, along with further abatement of channel inventory destocking in our industrial businesses. For second half earnings, drivers include volume improvement, outlined above, alongside expected mix benefits, as well as ongoing realization of cost savings. Our current outlook also includes a neutral net impact from price cost for the year as slight price declines are expected to be offset by the carryover benefit of lower input costs. We expect full year adjusted EPS in the range of $3.25 to $3.65 per share, which assumes the benefit of a lower share count is mostly offset by lower interest income, higher depreciation and a higher tax rate as detailed on our outlook slide. With that, we are pleased to take your questions, and I'll turn it back over to the operator to open the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will open the line for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Davis: Hey, good morning, Ed, and Lori and Chris.\nEd Breen: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Davis: Good morning.\nLori Koch: Good morning.\nScott Davis: Good morning. Not a lot -- I mean, no huge surprises here, but some of the commentary around kind of price versus cost seemed a little bit incrementally cautious. Is that just a function of kind of weaker demand in general, just sloppy demand that's out there? Is it kind of a mix, just given how weak China is? Just level set, maybe I'm overreading this a little bit, so if we can just talk about kind of pricing power versus maybe what you're expecting overall in '24, that would be helpful.\nLori Koch: Yes. So, overall, full year, we have about a 1% price decline in total on the top-line, and we expect carryover benefit from further raw material, logistics and energy savings to offset that, to be neutral from a spread perspective for a year. So, I wouldn't say it's any material change. We had always been in that camp in the raw material side with the pricing, maybe we're being a little bit cautious just based on where the volumes fit in the first half. But overall, no material change. And I don't know that 1% total price is all that material to the total company.\nEd Breen: Scott, I'd also say, I think we said on the last earnings call, there's a couple of end markets we would probably have to give up a little price to maintain our market position. I don't want to get into the details what they are on the call. But generally speaking, we have been holding price across the platform and we continue to hold price across the platform. So, really no change there at all.\nScott Davis: Okay. That's helpful. And guys, I think one change at the margin just we've seen this quarter is just China continues to be really weak and perhaps maybe even outlook for 2024 degrading a bit as we speak. But can you give us a little bit more color on your confidence in your guide as it relates to just the degradation in China being kind of over and perhaps we're at a bottom here?\nEd Breen: Yeah. So, Scott, it was very interesting. I'll just kind of give you an overall DuPont comment on orders and then specifically the water business in China where we've seen a real significant destock. And by the way, overall, it was really interesting to watch. We were still declining, as we said, in the fourth quarter on our order rates. But through the month of January, we've had high single-digit growth pretty much across the platform except for Kalrez and biopharma, which we expect to come back later in the year before they pick up. I'll give you two other data points which are really interesting. And the water business declined in the fourth quarter, but through the first month of January, our orders were up 13%. And a chunk of that was the water business in China. And interestingly there, as you look at the order pattern of that increase, most of that starts May on, which is about what our distributors have been telling us when they bottom out on their inventory. And just another data point because it was one of the other ones we saw destock as we went through the back half of the fourth quarter was our safety orders, which include medical packaging, which was another one that had a significant destock. Those orders were up 10% in the month of January. And that, by the way, is a shorter cycle book than water. Water is the only one we kind of get booked out three months, four months because people are accustomed to having the book out that far, but most of our other businesses are very short cycle. So, the 10% up on the safety orders and medical packaging would bode well for the lift that we're expecting to see from first to second quarter on the top-line. So, it was really interesting, we were going still negative going into the end of the year and now pretty broadly positive for the month of January.\nLori Koch: Yeah. And I would say on volumes in China specifically, they did -- they are still down on a full year basis, but we did see less of a decline as the year went on and it varied by business. So obviously, E&I was kind of first into the China downturn, and they actually delivered 1% volume growth in China in the fourth quarter. And then, as the year went on, we saw primarily the water business in China decelerate per Ed's comment. So, it is still a tough market in China, but it looks like E&I is on the upswing, and we expect further improvement in the W&P business in water starting towards the tail line of the second quarter.\nScott Davis: Okay. Helpful. Thank you. I'll pass it on. Good luck this year. Bye, guys.\nEd Breen: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Leithead with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMike Leithead: Yeah, thanks. Good morning, guys. I just wanted to follow-up...\nEd Breen: Good morning, Mike.\nMike Leithead: Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on the inventory dynamics in W&P. I guess can you maybe help us better understand how the fourth quarter unfolded? Did your customers just stop buying at some point? Or just kind of what caught you so off guard with the declines there? And then, around the January improvement you just talked about Ed, I guess what do you make of it? Does it seem like those just delayed orders from your end? Or do you think end demand is truly getting better there?\nEd Breen: Well, I think, there was a couple of things. I think we got hit a little harder than we were expecting in the fourth quarter, simply because it was most people's fiscal year end, and they're aggressively trying to work down inventories. By the way, as DuPont did, we were aggressively doing it. We accelerated it, as you could see from our cash flow and our inventory position even more in the fourth quarter. So I think it was just trended a little more than we expected. I'd also say I would add to that, remember that in W&P, specifically, 50% of our business goes through distribution. So, they can easily tell you just shut it off for two months or three months and don't ship them yet. And that's what we saw a little bit more of than we were expecting. But very interesting, as I said, it is a month, it's not a quarter yet, but most of those and those distributor orders turned around in the month of January. And again, it was pretty broad-based across the portfolio, ex a couple of these end markets that I talked about. And specifically, by the way, in safety, the distribution orders sort of coming into January, shelter were very heavy through distribution. And we know we've bottomed that. We actually expect slight growth this quarter and that to build a little bit more as the year goes on. And then, I mentioned the water one already, that's 40% globally through distribution, and it was mostly our distributor customers that delayed orders, not our end customers. So that's kind of the dynamic, but very interesting to see this January thing now.\nMike Leithead: Great. That's super helpful. And then maybe a question...\nEd Breen: And just, Mike, just an overall comment, we're 90% of short cycle company. It can go down pretty quickly and it can go up pretty quickly. A lot of this is hangover from COVID excess inventory, people working it off. And so, you can see the bounce back also.\nMike Leithead: Well, it makes a lot of sense. And then second, maybe just a quick question for Lori. Can you talk about your expected cash flow conversion in 2024? You gave us CapEx, but should we expect any material cash needs for restructuring, pension or just some other key items there?\nLori Koch: Yes. So, the pension should be roundly $50 million to $60 million of a cash funding. So no material difference from where it was in 2023. We had noted the CapEx, which also isn't a material change from 2023. We would expect to be, again, around that target of 90% conversion for 2024. We'll see how the timing of the volume lift unfolds. That could create a receivables headwind as you get into the back half of the year as you see that nice volume lift year-over-year. So, I expect it to deliver strong cash flow. We made a lot of progress on one of the areas that we really focused on with respect to inventory in 2023, and we're not going to give back that benefit that we saw and we'll work to hold on to those gains.\nMike Leithead: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Josh Spector with UBS. Please go ahead.\nJosh Spector: Yeah, hi, good morning.\nEd Breen: Good morning.\nJosh Spector: Good morning. Just on the second half expectations, so obviously, visibility is pretty low. But I mean, at the high end of your guide, you're kind of projecting that you could see EBITDA up about 15% maybe in the second half. What needs to happen for that to play out? Kind of what's the expectation on the volume or restocking dynamic that would see you get to that end of the range?\nEd Breen: Yeah. So, by the way, just a few bullet points on kind of first half, second half ramp there, obviously, the increased semi fab and PC utilization rates, remember, semi is a very high-margin business for us. So, we see that coming back. And we've already started to see, as we just commented slightly, we're seeing an improvement. It was about 2% in the quarter. So, we clearly bottomed out there and we'll now lift. Destock will be mostly complete in the second half of the year. The only ones that might slip into the fourth quarter and we've taken that into account as biopharma and Kalrez, although many in biopharma think that's going to lift by the inflection point at the middle of the year, we're a little more cautious than it's -- maybe more of a fourth quarter, and then clearly improved factory absorption from the hits we've been taking there to keep inventory in line. And then we'll have more of the cost savings from the restructuring program. So, I'd say that's the big items that kind of build first half, second half. And obviously, just volume ramp in general because of destock ending.\nJosh Spector: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And just to maybe follow-up, just more on the first half, are there discrete items we should be thinking about first quarter to second quarter, so that 10% lift you potentially see. I guess, is there a headwind baked in there in the first quarter because you're taking additional inventory actions that's ex or something else that actually absent a material demand improvement improves earnings, or is this more destocking volume driven? Thanks.\nLori Koch: Yeah. So sequentially, a lot of it is volume driven. So, we see about $150 million of revenue ramp first quarter to second quarter. That's primarily volume. We also see a little bit of a build in the cost savings program. So, we had mentioned it will really kick in at the end of Q1. So you'll see some ramp as you head into Q2. Those are the biggest items. The largest improvement is going to be the volume increase, though, first quarter to second quarter.\nJosh Spector: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Roberts with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you. Just one for me. In shelter solutions, now that the channel is destocked, are you expecting a normal seasonal sequential improvement or below normal in that segment?\nLori Koch: We would expect normal. So normally, 2Q and 3Q are the best quarters for shelter within 1Q and 4Q being lower than those averages.\nJohn Roberts: Great. Thank you.\nEd Breen: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. Ed, you were very...\nEd Breen: Good morning, David.\nDavid Begleiter: Good morning. You were very valuable electronics business as not being valued by the market, what are the options in your mind to unlock or have that value being realized?\nEd Breen: Well, David, I think, look, we've got -- we're working our way through this destock. And I think the year is going to lift very nicely. I think we just have to be patient to see how it looks as we're kind of exiting 2024. And I think we haven't been in stability here with the destock going on in the short cycle nature. But to your point, David, it's a phenomenal franchise. We're in the sweet spot of it. We got a lot of upside coming with the AI opportunity. All these new facilities, fabs we have built are mostly advanced chips, which plays even more to our strength. So, when people can really see these numbers cranking again, as we're going through the second half of the year, we'll see how the company is valued.\nDavid Begleiter: Very good. And just on PFAS, Ed, what's your expectation for improvement on that issue this year?\nEd Breen: Well, I think we're within days or a couple of weeks of the judge finally getting the whole water district thing done at all. I think it was just -- they're probably waiting. I think what's going on is they're just waiting to get one announcement from all the companies out. And I think 3M just last Friday, had their kind of I'll call it a preliminary hearing. So, I think that's very, very close to being finalized here. And then, nothing will happen on the personal injury cases most likely this year. However, our kind of take is, we like to settle these things before there's any trial, but they are going through picking some of the -- who would be the initial ones that would go to trial. I think there's 28 of those on the list right now and the judge and all will narrow that down to a smaller group. But I don't think that's a 2024 issue on that.\nDavid Begleiter: Very good. Thank you.\nEd Breen: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJohn McNulty: Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.\nEd Breen: Good morning, John.\nJohn McNulty: So, Ed, we have a lot of new fabs coming on. I mean, just kind of looking at kind of high level, it looks like almost double digit coming on this year and then again in '25 and '26. I guess, can you help us or remind us when you get those wins, like when you see that? And how much of that cake is baked at this point? And then maybe any commentary on share wins or shifts that you might have seen on some of these fabs that are coming up?\nEd Breen: Yeah, sales process works. We do a lot of application engineering and development directly with the top -- really, it's about 10 major customers in the semi side. So, it's really the win we get there, where it's processed at a fab is somewhat irrelevant to us. Although we like the fact that these fabs are coming on because the world thinks there's a lot of demand coming over the next cycle here in the semi world, which there should be because everything needs to chip nowadays and more of its advanced chips. But our win rate is really at the design stage with these 10 large customers around the world. And again, where they make it doesn't really matter that much to us, but still a very good sign. And I'd say, overall, market share does not shift much in this business. There is a couple of key players, especially on the higher-end chips and market share is pretty steady across the board year in and year out.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. Fair enough. And then on the shelter solutions side of the business, can you help us to think about what the utilization rates are now that it looks like you've kind of bottomed out in that business? And then, how we should think about the incrementals on that as volume starts to really come back?\nLori Koch: Yes. So, we had mentioned we saw an improvement in volume as the year went on. The volumes in shelter were kind of down about 4% in the fourth quarter, and we expect them to be slightly up in the first quarter and then build from there to about 4% by the time we close out the year. So, the utilization rates will definitely improve. This is not a high fixed cost business. So when we talked about the absorption headwinds that we saw throughout 2023, that was primarily in the E&I side, and then it started to kick in a little bit on the safety side with the heavy assets in that portfolio. So there isn't a huge absorption headwind within shelter, but we will see some benefit from volume that would have a little bit of benefit absorption as the year goes on.\nJohn McNulty: Great. Thanks very much for the color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tusa: Hi, good morning.\nEd Breen: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Is there any reason over the course of this recovery, why your business should decouple from broad electronics trends? I mean, are you guys less exposed to what's going on in AI and data center? Have you guys -- do you think you've lost share anywhere because a different technology is required in those applications? I mean it just seems like electronics right now is kind of a multispeed world. And I think I would have expected a little more out of you guys so far, but maybe just some comments on how kind of coupled you're going to be to that recovery.\nEd Breen: I think we're very coupled to it because the big -- one of the big demand drivers next year is data center and that's a lot of advanced chip applications. I won't say the customer's name, but there's one that's been out there very steadily that is requiring a lot of advanced chips that is a key customer of ours. So, that whole drive towards AI data center and the need for advanced chips plays right to the sweet spot of our portfolio. So no, we won't decouple at all. There's no area that's going to grow faster in the semi side that we won't participate in. That truly is our sweet spot as we go forward here. Remember, in a typical times, we've consistently outgrown the market to 300 basis points because of that dynamic.\nSteve Tusa: Okay.\nLori Koch: Yeah. I think, Steve, too, so on semi, it's around a $2 billion business for us, about $700 million of that is data center. So it's a pretty large chunk. If you look at the results and the forecast that the OEMs are providing, it's oftentimes skewed by the price of the chip, which it has no impact on our volumes and our revenues. So that's one thing maybe just to clarify to make sure that if you're seeing lift in some of the OEMs, it's probably right now more coming from price, especially on the memory side. Our portfolio is about 30% memory, 70% logic foundry from a disposition perspective as well.\nSteve Tusa: Sorry. So you said $700 million of that as to what you can see clearly as being like data center related customers?\nEd Breen: Yes.\nLori Koch: Yes.\nSteve Tusa: And how fast did that grow in like the fourth quarter? Or did it grow in the fourth quarter?\nLori Koch: Yeah. So, overall, semi volumes in the fourth quarter were down in the high single-digits as some of the OEMs continue to destock. So that's one other piece, too, is they could still be producing and they're producing out of inventory versus buying new materials to add to their inventory. But if you compare our results that have been released year-to-date versus the peers that sell materials in those subsegments they are in line.\nSteve Tusa: Okay, great. All right. Thanks a lot for the color. Appreciate it.\nEd Breen: Thanks, Steve.\nLori Koch: You're welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nAleksey Yefremov: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to come back to water filtration in China. Do you have visibility into the underlying demand? Apparently, you do have destocking, but what data points are you tracking to understand how healthy the actual market is?\nEd Breen: Yes. So, Aleksey, it's a great question. I would say true demand is down 3% or 4% negative. If you look at our direct customers we sell to over there, they have a little bit of destocking going on at their end, but by and large, when you look at their demand, again, they're in the 3% to 4%, some of them are 5% down, somewhere right in that range. But if you go to our distributor customers, they were down over 30%. And that's where we started to see orders come back through January for deliveries kind of in the May, June, July timeframe. And as I mentioned earlier, the water orders in January were up 13%. And a big part of that was the China orders from the distributors. So, the market is definitely down a little bit. But if we could just get all the destocking to come back, that's a huge swing for us even if the market for a little bit stays down. So, the inventory in China on water will bottom in that kind of May, June timeframe. And that's why I think we're starting to, obviously, then see these orders, at least preliminarily in January, come in kind of for that time period.\nLori Koch: And just from a logistics perspective...\nAleksey Yefremov: Thanks, Ed. And...\nEd Breen: Yeah, go ahead, Lori.\nLori Koch: Yeah. Maybe just real quick, on the logistics perspective, so Ed had mentioned an expected bottoming of the distributor inventory levels in China in the May-June timeframe. We ship from the US to them primarily. So, there's about a 60-day lag between when they need the material at their facility versus when we ship it, and then we recognize the revenue when we ship it. So, there will be a bit of a favorable impact from our perspective on revenue versus when it arrives at their facilities for use in China.\nAleksey Yefremov: So, what is the sort of two to three year growth rate for the water business? Will it step down you think because China is slower, or this is temporary?\nLori Koch: Yeah, we think it should still be in the mid-single-digit range. So, we think that China is just resolving of some higher inventory levels. If you look back at the volumes before we started to see a downturn globally, I'm going to talk about global volumes, water was up 8% in full year 2022. And then, in the first half, it was up 4% in Q1 and 9% in Q2, and then we started to see the downturn in Q3. So, we think it's a temporary dislocation. There's still a lot of confidence and opportunity for outsized growth versus GDP in the water business.\nAleksey Yefremov: Thanks a lot.\nEd Breen: Thanks, Aleksey.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Cunningham: Hi, good morning. I'm just curious on your expectations for the retained businesses in the corporate segment into the year and given maybe we're starting to see a challenging auto and EV backdrop into the first half of the year.\nLori Koch: Yeah. So, 2023 was very favorable for the auto industry, kind of up in that high single-digit range, and we would outperform that in the EV space just by about 25% to 30% of our portfolio is now EV. On a full year basis, though, for 2024, we do see it about flat from a volume perspective, in-line with where auto builds are. So, obviously, China is going to slow down a bit in 2024 off of a really strong 2023, especially tail end of 2023. But longer term, we're still very confident in the EV expansion opportunity and the pace of the EV growth, and we have a really nice position to continue to benefit from that, not only in the corporate retained businesses primarily with adhesives, but also within the W&P portfolio, Nomex. We've got a really nice opportunity on the e-motor side of the house with using Nomex as an insulator.\nPatrick Cunningham: Got it. Very helpful. And then just on Spectrum, how is it performing relative to expectations? And has it been hit by any residual destocking or deterioration in primary demand?\nLori Koch: Yeah. It's in-line with our expectations. It's ramping nicely with the new customer win that we highlighted when we acquired the business, that's going very well. We've actually integrated the business within the company and combined it with our Liveo healthcare business to further take advantage of those commercial synergies that continues to be a nice opportunity for us.\nPatrick Cunningham: Okay. Thank you.\nEd Breen: Thanks, Patrick.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nVincent Andrews: Hi. First, can you just clarify on the full year remarks? When you talk about sales and profit growth in the back half, are you talking 3Q and 4Q? Or maybe not 3Q, but definitely 4Q?\nLori Koch: It starts in 3Q. It's greater in 4Q from a year-over-year perspective.\nVincent Andrews: Okay. And then, Ed, can I ask you the destocking is what it is and it's going to be what it's going to be. But thereafter, in managing these businesses and investing in them and presenting them to the investment community, how do you think about shipments versus demand and making sure that we don't get into another situation where the supply chain lines up with more products than we'll ultimately want? Or is that not something that you can really have the visibility on to control and that, too, will just be what it's going to be?\nEd Breen: Vincent, only twice in my like, I think, 26 years now doing this, has this happened. So, it's a very rare event. I mean it was obviously -- look, you know the semi stores, just they overshot so much on inventory. But a lot of this was COVID-driven, the craziness of the supply chain. It's just not something that would normally happen. It really is kind of one of those once in opportunities or dislocations let me say it that way. And by the way, interestingly, it goes down rapidly in a short cycle and can go up rapidly. It happened -- by the way, the little bit of '08, '09 was destocking. It was mostly a true recession where demand was down, but I'd say about a third of that then turned into destocking because of the situation. And so, it got worse quicker than people were expecting, but that recovered also fairly quick. So, I don't -- I just don't see something like this happening again. And we are almost, as I said, almost all the short-cycle business so we really saw it across a lot of the portfolio in normal times, you're just not going to overshoot.\nVincent Andrews: Okay. Thanks very much...\nEd Breen: I mean, semi will overshoot once in a while, but not to the extent of what we saw here the severity of it.\nVincent Andrews: Okay. Thank you again.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please go ahead.\nFrank Mitsch: Yes, hi. Good morning. Ed, you indicated that, obviously, you made a proactive decision to work down your inventories. And you've mentioned a couple of times the negative impact of factory absorption in 4Q and in '23. I was wondering if you could size that for us. And obviously, the expectation is that, that's not necessarily going to continue in '24, so that should be a nice tailwind for you?\nLori Koch: Yeah, Frank, we had a little north of $200 million of absorption headwinds in 2023. Most of that in E&I. It did kick in a little bit towards the tail end of the year in 2023 for W&P, and that will continue in Q1 as well. So, we do see absorption headwinds in Q1. Right now, given that our full year midpoint guide of $12.1 billion is about flat with this year. On a year-over-year basis, we don't really see material absorption tailwinds because volumes aren't materially improving. There will be improvement first half, second half, because the volume story is different first half, second half. But in the guide that we have provided, we didn't take in material benefits. Obviously, if that plays out, [indiscernible] that could be a change, a positive change, but initially, that's where we sit.\nFrank Mitsch: Okay. Got you. So, perhaps there's some conservatism built in there, which I kind of got the sense when you're talking about price cost for '24 being neutral, I would assume that you saw some benefits from price cost in the fourth quarter. Could you size that for us?\nLori Koch: Yeah. We did see benefit in the fourth quarter in the $50 million to $75 million range. We do see some further tailwinds year-over-year in Q1, just really from that carryover benefit of the raws that we were buying that were stuck in inventory and are now coming out. But right now, our view is that we would still see those benefits about $100 million on a full year basis in '24, but we expect about a 1% price get back with a lot of it being in the shelter business as we had kind of been flagging all along. That's where we got the most price to begin with in the 2022, 2023 timeframe.\nFrank Mitsch: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nEd Breen: Thanks, Frank.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nArun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Obviously, a lot of the questions have been answered. But just wanted to reconfirm, so I know that you made the statement that your volumes could snap back quickly. But is that -- are you a little at all concerned with that happening now with maybe China growing at a slightly lower structural growth rate going forward? Maybe you can just comment on what you're hearing out of China.\nLori Koch: Yeah. I mean even if China potentially is at a lower structural growth rate year-over-year, it's coming off a pretty [indiscernible]. So, full year volumes in China were down in the mid-teens. And so, it's not a high hurdle to jump off of as you head into 2024 to deliver growth. We still have a lot of confidence longer term in those markets that are highly rooted in China, especially on the electronics side, and on the water side, we expect improvement.\nEd Breen: Yeah. Arun, just turning to the electronics side, I don't think we're being overly aggressive. We've talked to our large customers when you look at the fab utilizations, we're basically going from the low 70%s we said to the low 80%s. In really good times, they run in the 90%s. So, we probably still have more upside that would kick in, in that part of the business even going into 2025. It's not all -- we're not assuming it all snaps back in 2024 to where it had been running.\nArun Viswanathan: Right. And then, given that we have experienced a fair amount of volatility here in cyclicality, one of the transformation kind of strategies was to reduce that peak to trough cyclicality. Do you feel still the same way about the current portfolio as far as lowering that cyclicality post transformation...\nEd Breen: I totally do...\nArun Viswanathan: ...or other businesses that would qualify for disposition at this point?\nEd Breen: No. I totally feel, in normal times, it will be more consistent portfolio. An unusual time here with the destock and the inventory build from COVID and all short cycle, but now these are good secular businesses. We've got good market position. So, we feel good about where we're at. Just got to get through this period and start lifting.\nArun Viswanathan: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nSteve Byrne: Yeah, thank you. Your businesses within W&P heavily relying on distributors. I'm curious how much visibility do you have, not just on your own products in inventory at these distributors, but competitor products. And the reason I ask is I'm just wondering whether or not you're seeing the potential for a shift to competitor products perhaps in water in China. Anything that you're seeing there that is a concern on the competitive front?\nEd Breen: No, Steve. And by the way, we're tracking -- because of [indiscernible], we're tracking way closer with our distributors. The good news is our distributors in China, there's a handful of really big ones. So, if we can get our arms around that -- we've asked the competitive issue, and we're very close to them. I don't see any issues there at all.\nSteve Byrne: Okay. And how would you look at your businesses and highlight any opportunities for a new technology or a new application of your products that could really drive growth? Anything that you would highlight? An example would be like water moving into lithium extraction. Do you see any meaningful...\nEd Breen: Yeah, I would give you two and you just said the one. The lithium opportunity could be substantial for us because that needs a ton of filtration as you guys know. And the other, I would just say big trend out there that we've already talked to, but has a real good opportunity for us because it's in our sweet spot is the whole AI thing. I would say they would be the two big ones.\nSteve Byrne: Thank you.\nEd Breen: All right. Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMike Sison: Hey, good morning. Ed, when you think about the earnings power of DuPont, when you look at the second half of '24, the run rate EBITDA is going to be much higher than the first half. So, when we think about growing into '25 and beyond, so we take that second half run rate and then -- where do you think the earnings power is longer term, '26, '27 in terms of EBITDA?\nLori Koch: Yeah. I mean we, obviously, exited a higher margin than where we started the year. So, our current expectations is we would exit butting up against 26% EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter. We've always said that we think the EBITDA margin profile for the total company should be in that 27%, 28% range, and we don't have a change to that with E&I being in the low 30%s and W&P in the kind of mid-20%s. So, we exit the year, as I had mentioned, butting up against 26% kind of in the low $800 million range. If you look back to our peak earnings in late 2022, they were more in that $850 million range, and they didn't have Spectrum in them. There's still a clearly opportunity for us to see to continue to expand beyond that run rate that we'll expect to see at the end of this year.\nEd Breen: And maybe just to add one for the longer term, and again, stabilized times, half this portfolio should outgrow GDP and the other half should grow with GDP, just to give you a feel, and that would be the magnitude. One of the things, as I mentioned a minute ago, still has to come back even more in 2025 is the semi industry and the utilization rates still decline from where we would exit '24.\nMike Sison: Got it. Thank you.\nEd Breen: Yeah, thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the call back to Chris Mecray for any closing remarks.\nChris Mecray: Well, thank you all for joining the call. For your reference, a copy of the transcript will be posted on our website as usual. This concludes our call. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Lori Koch",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed, and good morning. Our financial results in 2023 were clearly impacted by significant destocking and demand pressure in China, but our focus has remained on sound operational execution across the business. I'm very pleased that our team's effort to drive productivity and operational excellence clearly minimize decremental margins and help drive substantial cash flow improvement. In 2024, our continued proactive approach to managing the business will yield impactful cost reduction beginning later in the first quarter and building from there from the restructuring actions announced last November. We anticipate yielding at least two-thirds of the total $150 million in restructuring benefits during 2024, with the balance realized next year. Like Ed, I'm also encouraged by the expected trajectory of demand and volume based on direct customer feedback and data supporting the bottoming of channel inventory in key end markets. Our current forecast assumes a bottom for total company sales and earnings in the first quarter, followed by steady recovery as the year progresses with the return to year-over-year growth in the second half. I'll come back to the outlook later, but first I'll cover our results. Regarding our fourth quarter financial highlights on Slide 5, net sales of $2.9 billion decreased 7% versus the year-ago period, as a 10% organic sales decline was partially offset by a 3% portfolio benefit due primarily to the Spectrum acquisition. The organic sales decline reflects a 9% decrease in volume and a 1% decrease in price. Lower volume included the impact of channel inventory destocking within W&P's safety solutions line of business, most notably for Tyvek medical packaging. We also saw accelerated volume decline within water solutions in China, driven primarily by distributor destocking and weaker demand. On a segment view, W&P and E&I organic sales declined 15% and 7%, respectively, while organic sales in Corporate declined 4%. From a regional perspective, DuPont sales decreased on an organic basis globally versus the year-ago period, with North America, Asia Pacific and Europe down 13%, 11% and 9%, respectively. China sales were down 14% versus the prior year. Fourth quarter operating EBITDA of $715 million decreased 6% versus the year-ago period as volume declines and the impact of reduced production rates to better align inventory with demand were partially offset by lower input costs, discrete items, which benefited earnings by about $40 million, and Spectrum earnings contribution. About $25 million of the discrete item benefits were reported within the W&P segment, reflecting a land sale and other credits, with the remainder reflected in Corporate. Operating EBITDA margin during the quarter of 24.7% increased 30 basis points versus the year-ago period. In the fourth quarter, driven by continued challenging construction market conditions, coupled with ongoing channel inventory destocking, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of about $800 million. The charge relates to our protection reporting unit which consists of the shelter and safety solutions lines of business within W&P and is excluded from our adjusted operating results. As a reminder, the carrying value of the legacy Dupont assets and liabilities were marked as fair value and significant goodwill and intangible balances were recorded in connection with the DowDuPont merger. Despite the write down, we maintained long-term confidence in the Protection brand offerings and our market-leading positions remained strong. We continue to invest in and expand our application development expertise in these markets and we have taken actions to improve our cost structure to enhance our competitiveness with destocking ends. Regarding cash flow, we are very pleased with our continued cash flow improvement as we worked hard in 2023 to optimize working capital performance and especially to right-size our inventory levels following the supply chain disruptions of 2022. On a continuing operations basis, cash flow from operations of $646 million, plus capital expenditures of $145 million, resulted in adjusted free cash flow of $501 million in the fourth quarter, a significant increase versus $188 million in the year-ago period. Adjusted free cash flow conversion during the quarter was 133%, significantly ahead of last year. Turning to Slide 6, adjusted EPS for the quarter of $0.87 per share decreased from $0.89 in the year-ago period. Lower segment earnings and certain below-the-line items, including a $0.05 headwind from foreign exchange losses led by devaluation of the Argentinian peso, more than offset an $0.08 benefit from a lower share count and a $0.03 benefit from a lower tax rate. Our tax rate for the quarter was 19.2%, down from 22.2% in the year-ago period and lower than our previously communicated modeling guidance driven by certain discrete tax benefits. Our full year tax rate for 2023 was 22.8%, and our 2024 outlook assumes a base tax rate of 23% to 24%. Turning to segment results beginning with E&I on Slide 7. E&I fourth quarter net sales of $1.4 billion increased 1%, as the Spectrum sales contribution of 8% was mostly offset by an organic sales decline of 7%. The organic sales decline reflects a 5% decrease in volume and a 2% decrease in price. At the line of business level, organic sales for Semiconductor Technologies were down high single-digit versus the year-ago period resulting from reduced semi fab utilization rates as customers work to reduce finished inventories. We did see sequential improvement within semi as sales increased 2% in the fourth quarter, signaling stabilization for the business. Our customer interactions and reduced channel inventory levels point to continued recovery expected in semi during 2024 with sequential sales up slightly in the first quarter and increased lift from the second quarter onwards. Within Interconnect Solutions, organic sales declined mid single-digit as low single-digit volume gains were more than offset by price decreases, driven by lower metal pricing. Demand continues to stabilize, and this is the first quarter since the downturn started where we saw year-over-year volume growth. Organic sales for Industrial Solutions were down mid single-digit due primarily to channel inventory destocking within our Liveo product lines for biopharma markets. And for products, such as Kalrez O-rings, which are primarily used in semiconductor equipment. These declines were partially offset by continued strong demand for OLED display materials. Operating EBITDA for E&I of $378 million was down versus the year-ago period due to volume declines and lower operating rates to better align inventory with demand, partially offset by Spectrum earnings contribution. Turning to Slide 8. W&P fourth quarter net sales of $1.3 billion declined 15% versus the year-ago period due to volume decline. Within safety solutions, organic sales were down 20% on lower volumes, driven mainly by channel inventory destocking, most notably for Tyvek medical packaging products. Within water, organic sales were down high-teens, driven by distributor inventory destocking and lower industrial demand in China. Shelter solutions sales were down mid single-digit on an organic basis. The year-over-year decline has continued to improve, and we believe channel inventory destocking for construction has been completed based on distributor inventory now being back at normal levels. Operating EBITDA for W&P during the quarter of $314 million decreased 13% due to lower volumes and reduced production rates, partially offset by lower input costs and certain discrete item benefits of about $25 million. Turning to Slide 9, I'll review our first quarter 2024 outlook and full year guidance expectations. For the first quarter of 2024, we expect net sales of about $2.8 billion and operating EBITDA of about $610 million. On a volume basis, we are seeing similar inventory destocking trends from fourth quarter continue into 2024, driven by water solutions in China and in several of our industrial-based businesses. Recovery timing is expected to vary by end market as the year progresses, but we expect first quarter at the bottom on a consolidated basis. The expected sequential decline in operating EBITDA includes the absence of discrete items, which benefited fourth quarter as outlined earlier. The first quarter outlook also includes certain costs that further impact period margins primarily within W&P related to new capacity and safety as well as the impact of lower volume. For the second quarter, we expect mid single-digit sequential sales improvement and an approximate 10% increase in operating EBITDA from first quarter. This assumes volume improvement driven by reduced inventory destocking impacts in water solutions and medical packaging, continued electronics recovery, and favorable seasonality in ICS and shelter. Sequential EBITDA should benefit from this volume growth and additional realization of restructuring cost savings. For the full year 2024, we expect net sales to be between $11.9 billion and $12.3 billion with operating EBITDA expected to be between $2.8 billion and $3 billion. Year-over-year sales growth in the second half is expected to be driven by ongoing electronics market recovery, including improvement in semiconductor fab utilization rate and continued utilization improvement for PCB manufacturing within ICS, along with further abatement of channel inventory destocking in our industrial businesses. For second half earnings, drivers include volume improvement, outlined above, alongside expected mix benefits, as well as ongoing realization of cost savings. Our current outlook also includes a neutral net impact from price cost for the year as slight price declines are expected to be offset by the carryover benefit of lower input costs. We expect full year adjusted EPS in the range of $3.25 to $3.65 per share, which assumes the benefit of a lower share count is mostly offset by lower interest income, higher depreciation and a higher tax rate as detailed on our outlook slide. With that, we are pleased to take your questions, and I'll turn it back over to the operator to open the Q&A. Good morning. Yes. So, overall, full year, we have about a 1% price decline in total on the top-line, and we expect carryover benefit from further raw material, logistics and energy savings to offset that, to be neutral from a spread perspective for a year. So, I wouldn't say it's any material change. We had always been in that camp in the raw material side with the pricing, maybe we're being a little bit cautious just based on where the volumes fit in the first half. But overall, no material change. And I don't know that 1% total price is all that material to the total company. Yeah. And I would say on volumes in China specifically, they did -- they are still down on a full year basis, but we did see less of a decline as the year went on and it varied by business. So obviously, E&I was kind of first into the China downturn, and they actually delivered 1% volume growth in China in the fourth quarter. And then, as the year went on, we saw primarily the water business in China decelerate per Ed's comment. So, it is still a tough market in China, but it looks like E&I is on the upswing, and we expect further improvement in the W&P business in water starting towards the tail line of the second quarter. Yes. So, the pension should be roundly $50 million to $60 million of a cash funding. So no material difference from where it was in 2023. We had noted the CapEx, which also isn't a material change from 2023. We would expect to be, again, around that target of 90% conversion for 2024. We'll see how the timing of the volume lift unfolds. That could create a receivables headwind as you get into the back half of the year as you see that nice volume lift year-over-year. So, I expect it to deliver strong cash flow. We made a lot of progress on one of the areas that we really focused on with respect to inventory in 2023, and we're not going to give back that benefit that we saw and we'll work to hold on to those gains. Yeah. So sequentially, a lot of it is volume driven. So, we see about $150 million of revenue ramp first quarter to second quarter. That's primarily volume. We also see a little bit of a build in the cost savings program. So, we had mentioned it will really kick in at the end of Q1. So you'll see some ramp as you head into Q2. Those are the biggest items. The largest improvement is going to be the volume increase, though, first quarter to second quarter. We would expect normal. So normally, 2Q and 3Q are the best quarters for shelter within 1Q and 4Q being lower than those averages. Yes. So, we had mentioned we saw an improvement in volume as the year went on. The volumes in shelter were kind of down about 4% in the fourth quarter, and we expect them to be slightly up in the first quarter and then build from there to about 4% by the time we close out the year. So, the utilization rates will definitely improve. This is not a high fixed cost business. So when we talked about the absorption headwinds that we saw throughout 2023, that was primarily in the E&I side, and then it started to kick in a little bit on the safety side with the heavy assets in that portfolio. So there isn't a huge absorption headwind within shelter, but we will see some benefit from volume that would have a little bit of benefit absorption as the year goes on. Yeah. I think, Steve, too, so on semi, it's around a $2 billion business for us, about $700 million of that is data center. So it's a pretty large chunk. If you look at the results and the forecast that the OEMs are providing, it's oftentimes skewed by the price of the chip, which it has no impact on our volumes and our revenues. So that's one thing maybe just to clarify to make sure that if you're seeing lift in some of the OEMs, it's probably right now more coming from price, especially on the memory side. Our portfolio is about 30% memory, 70% logic foundry from a disposition perspective as well. Yes. Yeah. So, overall, semi volumes in the fourth quarter were down in the high single-digits as some of the OEMs continue to destock. So that's one other piece, too, is they could still be producing and they're producing out of inventory versus buying new materials to add to their inventory. But if you compare our results that have been released year-to-date versus the peers that sell materials in those subsegments they are in line. You're welcome. And just from a logistics perspective... Yeah. Maybe just real quick, on the logistics perspective, so Ed had mentioned an expected bottoming of the distributor inventory levels in China in the May-June timeframe. We ship from the US to them primarily. So, there's about a 60-day lag between when they need the material at their facility versus when we ship it, and then we recognize the revenue when we ship it. So, there will be a bit of a favorable impact from our perspective on revenue versus when it arrives at their facilities for use in China. Yeah, we think it should still be in the mid-single-digit range. So, we think that China is just resolving of some higher inventory levels. If you look back at the volumes before we started to see a downturn globally, I'm going to talk about global volumes, water was up 8% in full year 2022. And then, in the first half, it was up 4% in Q1 and 9% in Q2, and then we started to see the downturn in Q3. So, we think it's a temporary dislocation. There's still a lot of confidence and opportunity for outsized growth versus GDP in the water business. Yeah. So, 2023 was very favorable for the auto industry, kind of up in that high single-digit range, and we would outperform that in the EV space just by about 25% to 30% of our portfolio is now EV. On a full year basis, though, for 2024, we do see it about flat from a volume perspective, in-line with where auto builds are. So, obviously, China is going to slow down a bit in 2024 off of a really strong 2023, especially tail end of 2023. But longer term, we're still very confident in the EV expansion opportunity and the pace of the EV growth, and we have a really nice position to continue to benefit from that, not only in the corporate retained businesses primarily with adhesives, but also within the W&P portfolio, Nomex. We've got a really nice opportunity on the e-motor side of the house with using Nomex as an insulator. Yeah. It's in-line with our expectations. It's ramping nicely with the new customer win that we highlighted when we acquired the business, that's going very well. We've actually integrated the business within the company and combined it with our Liveo healthcare business to further take advantage of those commercial synergies that continues to be a nice opportunity for us. It starts in 3Q. It's greater in 4Q from a year-over-year perspective. Yeah, Frank, we had a little north of $200 million of absorption headwinds in 2023. Most of that in E&I. It did kick in a little bit towards the tail end of the year in 2023 for W&P, and that will continue in Q1 as well. So, we do see absorption headwinds in Q1. Right now, given that our full year midpoint guide of $12.1 billion is about flat with this year. On a year-over-year basis, we don't really see material absorption tailwinds because volumes aren't materially improving. There will be improvement first half, second half, because the volume story is different first half, second half. But in the guide that we have provided, we didn't take in material benefits. Obviously, if that plays out, [indiscernible] that could be a change, a positive change, but initially, that's where we sit. Yeah. We did see benefit in the fourth quarter in the $50 million to $75 million range. We do see some further tailwinds year-over-year in Q1, just really from that carryover benefit of the raws that we were buying that were stuck in inventory and are now coming out. But right now, our view is that we would still see those benefits about $100 million on a full year basis in '24, but we expect about a 1% price get back with a lot of it being in the shelter business as we had kind of been flagging all along. That's where we got the most price to begin with in the 2022, 2023 timeframe. Yeah. I mean even if China potentially is at a lower structural growth rate year-over-year, it's coming off a pretty [indiscernible]. So, full year volumes in China were down in the mid-teens. And so, it's not a high hurdle to jump off of as you head into 2024 to deliver growth. We still have a lot of confidence longer term in those markets that are highly rooted in China, especially on the electronics side, and on the water side, we expect improvement. Yeah. I mean we, obviously, exited a higher margin than where we started the year. So, our current expectations is we would exit butting up against 26% EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter. We've always said that we think the EBITDA margin profile for the total company should be in that 27%, 28% range, and we don't have a change to that with E&I being in the low 30%s and W&P in the kind of mid-20%s. So, we exit the year, as I had mentioned, butting up against 26% kind of in the low $800 million range. If you look back to our peak earnings in late 2022, they were more in that $850 million range, and they didn't have Spectrum in them. There's still a clearly opportunity for us to see to continue to expand beyond that run rate that we'll expect to see at the end of this year."

            "name": "Ed Breen",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial review. This morning's earnings release is consistent with the preliminary results announced on January 24th, and we have added our customary segment detail and end market color while also providing incremental detail on our 2024 financial forecast. Broadly, we continue to see encouraging stabilization within electronics markets. Our Semiconductor Technologies business reported sequential sales growth of 2% in the fourth quarter as expected as the first sign of getting past the bottom at chip production. In Interconnect Solutions, we saw a return to year-over-year volume growth with volumes up 2% versus the prior year after sales bottomed earlier in 2023. However, as we finished 2023, we did see additional channel inventory destocking within many of our industrial-based businesses as well as continued weak demand in China with incremental weakness in our China water business. This resulted in fourth quarter net sales, which declined 7% year-over-year, falling below our guidance expectations. We have already noted that we see a continuation of similar volume trends into the first quarter, and I will come back to this, but we are encouraged that we see signs of market stabilization, bottoming of customer inventories and a pickup in orders in the month of January that support a view of recovering sales and earnings through 2024. Fourth quarter operating EBITDA of $715 million was down 6% year-over-year, reflecting continued pressure across many of our largely short cycle businesses. We remain very focused on managing what we can control, including discretionary spending levers, and also executing the restructuring actions announced last November. This focus helped to contain margin impact in the period despite a 9% drop in volume. Looking into 2024, we continue to target annualized cost savings of $150 million, which we will begin to realize later in the first quarter and which should further bolster our go-forward margin profile. I am pleased we finished the year with strong cash generation as we continue to prioritize working capital improvement and discipline following the inventory build seen during the supply challenge 2022 period. For the full year, adjusted free cash flow was $1.6 billion with conversion at 100% versus our target of greater than 90%. This included fourth quarter adjusted free cash flow of $501 million, which represented 133% conversion. Adjusted EPS for the year of $3.48 per share increased over last year as benefits from our ongoing capital allocation and share repurchases more than offset substantial volume decrements. Turning to Slide 4, we continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities. First, this morning, we announced that we completed the $2 billion accelerated share repurchase transaction launched last September. At the conclusion of the ASR transaction, we retired an additional 6.7 million shares with the true-up, bringing its total to 27.9 million shares retired under the $2 billion ASR. Completion of this ASR wraps up the $5 billion program that we announced in November 2022, enabling the repurchase of approximately 15% of our outstanding shares over this time period. We also announced that our Board approved a new $1 billion share repurchase program, and we intend to launch a new $500 million ASR transaction imminently. We expect to complete the full $1 billion program by the end of this year. Finally, today we also announced an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.38 per share or a 6% increase. We will continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 35% to 45% over time and expect to increase our dividend annually in-line with earnings growth. We exited 2023 on a favorable balance sheet and liquidity position with an adjusted net leverage ratio of 2.1 times and with no long-term bond maturities due until November of 2025. We also repaid $300 million of debt due during the fourth quarter with cash on hand. Finally, we also continue to invest in innovation and our operational excellence program to support long-term organic growth. In 2024, we expect capital spending at about 5% of sales and target R&D spend at about 4% of sales for total DuPont. Regarding our innovation and growth pipeline, we were pleased during the fourth quarter with our electronics portfolio to be selected by a leading US OEM for our Microfill metallization product, which offers improved plating uniformity for advanced computing. In water, our team significantly advanced commercialization of the Oxymem membrane products for wastewater biological treatment. Within industrial, our Kalrez business opened a new facility in Delaware to support growth for its global semiconductor products. And finally, within adhesives, we launched a new structural epoxy adhesive specific for larger scale energy storage system. Before I turn it over to Lori, let's review our expected demand outlook by business based on active conversations that we have had with customers recently. For electronics, our ICS business serving printed circuit boards already bottomed in mid-2023 and continues to gradually recover alongside global electronics demand. We expect utilization for our customers in this area to increase this year into the 60s on a percentage basis from the mid-50s in the first quarter. For semiconductor, industry forecast for chip production, that were pushed out several times in 2023, are signaling a firmer 2024 recovery, and our outlook assumes chip fab utilization increasing through the year to exit at a run rate around the low 80s on a percentage basis from the low 70s in the first quarter. This inflection also includes stabilization for end market consumption in smartphone, PC and tablet markets, driven in part by replacement demand as well as improved data center demand bolstered by AI-driven growth. These trends bode well for DuPont's strength within electronics materials, and our customers are pointing to improve volume in both semi and ICS during 2024. Within our industrial-based businesses, while inventory destocking impacts have continued into the first quarter, customer feedback indicates a positive order inflection as the year progresses. Let's review specific end markets. First, shelter, which saw notable destock in 2023, now sits with inventory back to normal levels and we expect a slight positive volume compare in 2024 beginning in the first quarter. In safety, we believe our customers' inventory is also close to normal at this point for Tyvek medical packaging, and we expect sales to recover during the second and into the third quarter. Further, we expect reduced destock impact within safety solutions across the couple of industrial end markets in the second half. In water, we have communicated with our distributor customers in China and we expect a sequential pickup in sales towards the end of the second quarter. Distributor inventories have declined substantially from the peak last year. Finally, I would mention that we expect to see order improvement over the next several quarters in our Kalrez business with Industrial Solutions. Our Liveo biopharma business is anticipated to recover later in the second half. So, we have firm signals from a wide range of businesses within the DuPont portfolio that support a sales bottom in early 2024. This is reflected in stronger orders during the month of January after continued weakness in December. To wrap up, we remain confident that our key end markets are well positioned for long-term growth and our teams are extremely focused on operating discipline and site level execution, which positions us well to accelerate growth as inventories normalize. With that, I'll turn it over to Lori to cover the financial results and outlook in detail. Good morning, Scott. Scott, I'd also say, I think we said on the last earnings call, there's a couple of end markets we would probably have to give up a little price to maintain our market position. I don't want to get into the details what they are on the call. But generally speaking, we have been holding price across the platform and we continue to hold price across the platform. So, really no change there at all. Yeah. So, Scott, it was very interesting. I'll just kind of give you an overall DuPont comment on orders and then specifically the water business in China where we've seen a real significant destock. And by the way, overall, it was really interesting to watch. We were still declining, as we said, in the fourth quarter on our order rates. But through the month of January, we've had high single-digit growth pretty much across the platform except for Kalrez and biopharma, which we expect to come back later in the year before they pick up. I'll give you two other data points which are really interesting. And the water business declined in the fourth quarter, but through the first month of January, our orders were up 13%. And a chunk of that was the water business in China. And interestingly there, as you look at the order pattern of that increase, most of that starts May on, which is about what our distributors have been telling us when they bottom out on their inventory. And just another data point because it was one of the other ones we saw destock as we went through the back half of the fourth quarter was our safety orders, which include medical packaging, which was another one that had a significant destock. Those orders were up 10% in the month of January. And that, by the way, is a shorter cycle book than water. Water is the only one we kind of get booked out three months, four months because people are accustomed to having the book out that far, but most of our other businesses are very short cycle. So, the 10% up on the safety orders and medical packaging would bode well for the lift that we're expecting to see from first to second quarter on the top-line. So, it was really interesting, we were going still negative going into the end of the year and now pretty broadly positive for the month of January. Thanks, Scott. Good morning, Mike. Well, I think, there was a couple of things. I think we got hit a little harder than we were expecting in the fourth quarter, simply because it was most people's fiscal year end, and they're aggressively trying to work down inventories. By the way, as DuPont did, we were aggressively doing it. We accelerated it, as you could see from our cash flow and our inventory position even more in the fourth quarter. So I think it was just trended a little more than we expected. I'd also say I would add to that, remember that in W&P, specifically, 50% of our business goes through distribution. So, they can easily tell you just shut it off for two months or three months and don't ship them yet. And that's what we saw a little bit more of than we were expecting. But very interesting, as I said, it is a month, it's not a quarter yet, but most of those and those distributor orders turned around in the month of January. And again, it was pretty broad-based across the portfolio, ex a couple of these end markets that I talked about. And specifically, by the way, in safety, the distribution orders sort of coming into January, shelter were very heavy through distribution. And we know we've bottomed that. We actually expect slight growth this quarter and that to build a little bit more as the year goes on. And then, I mentioned the water one already, that's 40% globally through distribution, and it was mostly our distributor customers that delayed orders, not our end customers. So that's kind of the dynamic, but very interesting to see this January thing now. And just, Mike, just an overall comment, we're 90% of short cycle company. It can go down pretty quickly and it can go up pretty quickly. A lot of this is hangover from COVID excess inventory, people working it off. And so, you can see the bounce back also. Good morning. Yeah. So, by the way, just a few bullet points on kind of first half, second half ramp there, obviously, the increased semi fab and PC utilization rates, remember, semi is a very high-margin business for us. So, we see that coming back. And we've already started to see, as we just commented slightly, we're seeing an improvement. It was about 2% in the quarter. So, we clearly bottomed out there and we'll now lift. Destock will be mostly complete in the second half of the year. The only ones that might slip into the fourth quarter and we've taken that into account as biopharma and Kalrez, although many in biopharma think that's going to lift by the inflection point at the middle of the year, we're a little more cautious than it's -- maybe more of a fourth quarter, and then clearly improved factory absorption from the hits we've been taking there to keep inventory in line. And then we'll have more of the cost savings from the restructuring program. So, I'd say that's the big items that kind of build first half, second half. And obviously, just volume ramp in general because of destock ending. Thanks, John. Good morning, David. Well, David, I think, look, we've got -- we're working our way through this destock. And I think the year is going to lift very nicely. I think we just have to be patient to see how it looks as we're kind of exiting 2024. And I think we haven't been in stability here with the destock going on in the short cycle nature. But to your point, David, it's a phenomenal franchise. We're in the sweet spot of it. We got a lot of upside coming with the AI opportunity. All these new facilities, fabs we have built are mostly advanced chips, which plays even more to our strength. So, when people can really see these numbers cranking again, as we're going through the second half of the year, we'll see how the company is valued. Well, I think we're within days or a couple of weeks of the judge finally getting the whole water district thing done at all. I think it was just -- they're probably waiting. I think what's going on is they're just waiting to get one announcement from all the companies out. And I think 3M just last Friday, had their kind of I'll call it a preliminary hearing. So, I think that's very, very close to being finalized here. And then, nothing will happen on the personal injury cases most likely this year. However, our kind of take is, we like to settle these things before there's any trial, but they are going through picking some of the -- who would be the initial ones that would go to trial. I think there's 28 of those on the list right now and the judge and all will narrow that down to a smaller group. But I don't think that's a 2024 issue on that. Thanks. Good morning, John. Yeah, sales process works. We do a lot of application engineering and development directly with the top -- really, it's about 10 major customers in the semi side. So, it's really the win we get there, where it's processed at a fab is somewhat irrelevant to us. Although we like the fact that these fabs are coming on because the world thinks there's a lot of demand coming over the next cycle here in the semi world, which there should be because everything needs to chip nowadays and more of its advanced chips. But our win rate is really at the design stage with these 10 large customers around the world. And again, where they make it doesn't really matter that much to us, but still a very good sign. And I'd say, overall, market share does not shift much in this business. There is a couple of key players, especially on the higher-end chips and market share is pretty steady across the board year in and year out. Good morning, Steve. I think we're very coupled to it because the big -- one of the big demand drivers next year is data center and that's a lot of advanced chip applications. I won't say the customer's name, but there's one that's been out there very steadily that is requiring a lot of advanced chips that is a key customer of ours. So, that whole drive towards AI data center and the need for advanced chips plays right to the sweet spot of our portfolio. So no, we won't decouple at all. There's no area that's going to grow faster in the semi side that we won't participate in. That truly is our sweet spot as we go forward here. Remember, in a typical times, we've consistently outgrown the market to 300 basis points because of that dynamic. Yes. Thanks, Steve. Yes. So, Aleksey, it's a great question. I would say true demand is down 3% or 4% negative. If you look at our direct customers we sell to over there, they have a little bit of destocking going on at their end, but by and large, when you look at their demand, again, they're in the 3% to 4%, some of them are 5% down, somewhere right in that range. But if you go to our distributor customers, they were down over 30%. And that's where we started to see orders come back through January for deliveries kind of in the May, June, July timeframe. And as I mentioned earlier, the water orders in January were up 13%. And a big part of that was the China orders from the distributors. So, the market is definitely down a little bit. But if we could just get all the destocking to come back, that's a huge swing for us even if the market for a little bit stays down. So, the inventory in China on water will bottom in that kind of May, June timeframe. And that's why I think we're starting to, obviously, then see these orders, at least preliminarily in January, come in kind of for that time period. Yeah, go ahead, Lori. Thanks, Aleksey. Thanks, Patrick. Vincent, only twice in my like, I think, 26 years now doing this, has this happened. So, it's a very rare event. I mean it was obviously -- look, you know the semi stores, just they overshot so much on inventory. But a lot of this was COVID-driven, the craziness of the supply chain. It's just not something that would normally happen. It really is kind of one of those once in opportunities or dislocations let me say it that way. And by the way, interestingly, it goes down rapidly in a short cycle and can go up rapidly. It happened -- by the way, the little bit of '08, '09 was destocking. It was mostly a true recession where demand was down, but I'd say about a third of that then turned into destocking because of the situation. And so, it got worse quicker than people were expecting, but that recovered also fairly quick. So, I don't -- I just don't see something like this happening again. And we are almost, as I said, almost all the short-cycle business so we really saw it across a lot of the portfolio in normal times, you're just not going to overshoot. I mean, semi will overshoot once in a while, but not to the extent of what we saw here the severity of it. Thanks, Frank. Yeah. Arun, just turning to the electronics side, I don't think we're being overly aggressive. We've talked to our large customers when you look at the fab utilizations, we're basically going from the low 70%s we said to the low 80%s. In really good times, they run in the 90%s. So, we probably still have more upside that would kick in, in that part of the business even going into 2025. It's not all -- we're not assuming it all snaps back in 2024 to where it had been running. I totally do... No. I totally feel, in normal times, it will be more consistent portfolio. An unusual time here with the destock and the inventory build from COVID and all short cycle, but now these are good secular businesses. We've got good market position. So, we feel good about where we're at. Just got to get through this period and start lifting. No, Steve. And by the way, we're tracking -- because of [indiscernible], we're tracking way closer with our distributors. The good news is our distributors in China, there's a handful of really big ones. So, if we can get our arms around that -- we've asked the competitive issue, and we're very close to them. I don't see any issues there at all. Yeah, I would give you two and you just said the one. The lithium opportunity could be substantial for us because that needs a ton of filtration as you guys know. And the other, I would just say big trend out there that we've already talked to, but has a real good opportunity for us because it's in our sweet spot is the whole AI thing. I would say they would be the two big ones. All right. Thanks, Steve. And maybe just to add one for the longer term, and again, stabilized times, half this portfolio should outgrow GDP and the other half should grow with GDP, just to give you a feel, and that would be the magnitude. One of the things, as I mentioned a minute ago, still has to come back even more in 2025 is the semi industry and the utilization rates still decline from where we would exit '24. Yeah, thank you."

This morning, we announced third quarter results, and delivered solid earnings accomplished through strong operating execution by our teams despite ongoing volume headwinds, including channel inventory destocking and continued weak demand in China. We reported sequential operating EBITDA growth of 5% and margin improvement of 140 basis points in the third quarter. We also produced strong cash flow during the quarter, with adjusted free cash flow almost 50% higher than the year ago period, highlighting our efforts to prioritize working capital improvement in a challenging global business environment and normalizing after last year's global supply chain difficulties, compared to third quarter of 2022 organic revenue declined 10% due primarily to the impact of incremental channel inventory destocking, along with lower volumes from semiconductor and construction end markets. Within our electronics portfolio, our Interconnect Solutions business recorded a second straight quarter of sequential sales lift as underlying demand improvement and normal seasonality contributed to an 8% sales increase. We also saw signs of stabilization with the semiconductor markets and expect some sequential sales improvement from semiconductor technologies in the fourth quarter. Third quarter volume was lower than expected, primarily due to incremental channel inventory destocking, including with our distributor customers, which was evident in the Water Solutions and Safety Solutions lines of business. In this environment, we remain focused on controlling discretionary spending and are also planning additional restructuring actions to continue to ensure we can drive sound operational and financial performance, targeting at least $150 million in annualized run rate cost savings, which we expected we would see later in the first quarter of 2024. It's always difficult to precisely time market inflections, but current industry forecast within electronic submarkets going to recovery by 2024. This includes forecast for PC shipments to grow mid-single-digits, driven by replacement demand, smartphone shipment growth in the mid-single-digits, also driven by replacement demand, and new product launches, and for server demand to gradually improve next year. This growth is supported by the rapid surge in demand for AI servers as well as replacement for traditional servers. In general, demand for high-performance and high-density memory chips is accelerating, supported by AI growth, as well as overall growth for new mobile product launches. This directly correlates with DuPont's product strengths within the semiconductor and consumer electronics markets. Despite the near-term headwinds we are experiencing, we are confident that our key end markets are well-positioned for long-term growth, and we expect these structurally attractive markets will provide the foundation for DuPont's value creation looking ahead. Turning to Slide 4. We significantly advanced our strategic and capital allocation priorities during the quarter to drive shareholder value. First, we closed the acquisition of Spectrum on August 1, which fits nicely alongside our Liveo health care-related product line within our Industrial Solutions line of business with E&I. We are pleased with Spectrum's operating results to-date, which are aligned with our modeled estimates. We are excited to welcome the Spectrum team, which is currently focused on executing new revenue growth opportunities stemming from significant customer wins earlier in the year. Second, I am pleased to announce that we are in the process of closing today the previously announced sale of our roughly 80% ownership interest in the Delrin business, the remaining piece of the former M&M segment held for sale to the private equity firm, TJC, and a transaction value in the business at $1.8 billion. This deal was structured to maximize value for our shareholders. It provides significant upfront cash proceeds with minimal expected tax impact, which can then be deployed in line with our strategic priorities. It also provides an opportunity for us to participate in future upside returns upon the exit of our retained interest in Delrin. TJC has an excellent track record of creating value, and we look forward to leveraging their talent and focus to continue to grow the high-quality Delrin business. Regarding share repurchases, in September, we completed the $3.25 billion accelerated share repurchase transaction launched last November. We then launched a new $2 billion ASR, which we expect to complete during the first quarter of 2024. Combined these two ASR transactions, we have repurchased approximately 15% of our outstanding shares when complete, reflecting our continued commitment to returning capital to shareholders as part of our balanced financial policy. Including these ASRs and the proceeds from the Delrin sale, we anticipate finishing the year close to our target net leverage ratio of about 2.1 times. Further, we anticipate using a significant portion of excess cash during 2024 for incremental share repurchases once the ASR is complete. With that, I'll turn it over to Lori.\nLori Koch: Thanks, Ed, and good morning. Our teams continue to execute well in a softer volume backdrop driven by broad-based inventory destocking, demonstrating strong financial discipline and focus on operational excellence. I am most pleased with the sequential margin improvement registered by each of our segments in the third quarter as well as our strong cash performance in the period. Given volume headwinds, the delivery of stronger margins and better cash flow are attributed to execution around lowering our input costs, coordination with the operating teams to rightsize our inventory position, as well as overall progress with productivity via operational excellence initiatives. We are very focused on operating discipline and pleased that site level operating execution is positively positioning us for solid margin upside as volumes recover. We expect to see evidence of this in 2024 given expected recovery in key end markets, including electronics. Turning to our financial highlights on Slide 5. Third quarter net sales of $3.1 billion decreased 8% versus the year ago period, a 10% organic sales decline was slightly offset by a 2% portfolio benefit due primarily to revenue contribution from spectrum acquisition. The organic sales decline reflects a 10% decrease in volume, resulting primarily from semiconductor and construction end markets as well as the impact of channel inventory destocking. E&I and W&P organic sales declined 13% and 8%, respectively, while the retained businesses and corporate reported 1% organic sales growth, including mid-single-digit growth in the adhesives portfolio. From a regional perspective, consolidated DuPont sales decreased on an organic basis globally versus the year ago period with Asia Pacific, North America and Europe down 12%, 10% and 2%, respectively. China sales were down 16% on an organic basis versus the third quarter of 2022, though E&I sales in China increased sequentially in the quarter and saw smaller year-over-year declines in each of the last three quarters. Third quarter operating EBITDA of $775 million decreased 9% versus the year ago period, driven by lower volumes and the impact of reduced production rates primarily within E&I as we align inventory with demand, partially offset by lower endpoint costs related to raw materials, logistics and energy along with the portfolio benefits from Spectrum. Operating EBITDA margin during the quarter of 25.3% was down 50 basis points versus the year ago period driven by volume pressure in the high-margin semi business and reduced production rates, primarily within the E&I segment, offset partially by cost equation benefits, which increased somewhat from second quarter levels. On a sequential basis, operating EBITDA was up 5% and operating EBITDA margin improved 140 basis points. Decremental margins for the quarter was 31%, enabled by cost deflation and aggressive actions taken year-to-date to reduce spending. As I mentioned earlier, I am pleased with our cash flow improvement during the quarter. Optimizing working capital performance continues to be a top priority for us. On a continued operations basis, cash flow from operations of $740 million, less capital expenditures of $119 million, resulted in adjusted free cash flow of $621 million in the third quarter, a 47% increase versus the year ago period. Adjusted free cash flow conversion during the quarter was 151%, an increase versus last year, and much improved compared to the first half of this year. We currently expect to finish the year with conversion around our targeted level of 90%. Turning to Slide 6. Adjusted EPS for the quarter of $0.92 a share increased 12% compared to $0.82 in the year ago period. Below-the-line benefits, including a combined $0.16 benefit related to a lower share count and lower net interest expense more than offset lower segment earnings. Other below-the-line benefits, including a lower tax rate and lower foreign exchange losses, contributed $0.06 to adjusted EPS improvement versus the year ago period. Our tax rate for the quarter was 24.6%, down from 26.2% in the year ago period, driven by the impact of a rate true-up in the year ago period, and lower than our previously communicated modeling guidance as discrete tax headwinds were lower than expected. Our expectation of a full year 2023 base tax rate of 24% remains unchanged. Turning to segment results, beginning with E&I on Slide 7. The E&I third quarter net sales of $1.4 billion decreased 9% as organic sales declined 13%, offset partially by a portfolio benefit of 4% from the Spectrum acquisition. The organic sales decline reflected a 12% decrease in volume and a 1% decrease in price. At the line of business level, organic sales for semiconductor technologies were down high teens versus the year ago period, resulting from a continuation of inventory destocking across the channel and, to a lesser extent, ongoing weak end market demand and the impact of China trade restrictions. On a reported basis, semiconductor technology sales were flat sequentially in the third quarter. Within Interconnect Solutions, organic sales declined 11% year-over-year due to both volume and price declines, driven by the pass-through of lower metal pricing. Volume continued to be impacted by weak smartphone, PC and tablet demand, particularly in China, along with more moderate inventory destocking, which we believe is largely complete. On a sequential basis, the Interconnect business reported a second straight quarter of sales improvement, with sales up 8%, driven by seasonality as well as some underlying demand improvement within PCB markets. Organic sales for Industrial Solutions were down high single-digits versus the year ago period, due primarily to destocking within biopharma applications for our Liveo product line, and continued lower demand in electronics related end markets. These declines were partially offset by increased demand for OLED display materials. Operating EBITDA for E&I of $383 million was down versus the year ago period, primarily due to volume declines and lower operating rates to better align inventory with demand, slightly offset by a portfolio benefit related to Spectrum. Operating EBITDA margin increased 140 basis points sequentially during the third quarter. Turning to Slide 8. W&P third quarter net sales of $1.4 billion declined 8% versus last year as volume decline of 9% was slightly offset by a 1% increase in price due to the carryover impact of actions taken last year. Within Safety Solutions, organic sales were down high single-digits, due primarily to channel inventory destocking. Shelter Solutions sales were down high single digits on an organic basis, driven by continued demand softness in construction markets and ongoing channel inventory destocking. On a sequential basis from the second quarter, shelter sales increased slightly, and we expect narrow year-over-year declines in fourth quarter. Organic sales for Water Solutions were down mid-single digits versus the year ago period due primarily to inventory destocking, including key distributor customers and lower industrial project demand in China, mainly impacting reverse osmosis. We expect generally flat sequential volumes in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. Operating EBITDA for W&P during the third quarter of $362 million decreased versus the year ago period due to lower volume, partially offset by the impact of net pricing benefit. Operating EBITDA margin of 25.6% increased 70 basis points year-over-year and 100 basis points sequentially from the second quarter. Turning to Slide 9, I will close with a few comments on what we are seeing in the fourth quarter and how that translates to our full year 2023 guidance. Underlying consumer electronics demand in the fourth quarter is expected to be generally similar to the third quarter, with some sequential sales is expected in semiconductor technologies. As mentioned earlier, we saw additional channel inventory destocking and slower industrial demand in China, mainly impacting Water Solutions compared to prior expectations, and we assume these same trends to continue through the end of the year. As a result of this incremental volume softness, we are adjusting our net sales and operating EBITDA guidance and now expect full year net sales to be about $12.17 billion and operating EBITDA to be at about $2.97 billion, which is at the low end of our prior range. For the fourth quarter, we expect net sales of approximately $3 billion, with a sequential decline versus third quarter, driven predominantly by additional inventory destocking in the Safety Solutions line of business and, to a lesser extent, by the impact of seasonality and incremental currency headwinds. We expect full year 2023 adjusted EPS to be approximately $3.45 per share, which is the midpoint of our prior guidance range. With that, we are pleased to take your questions. And let me turn it back to the operator to open the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you, good morning, everyone.\nEdward Breen: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Good morning, Ed. A lot going on in these channels, obviously. Do you have any kind of sense or how do you measure kind of your sell-in versus sell-through trying to kind of understand kind of what that incremental headwind is from inventory versus just kind of general demand trends? And maybe just a little bit of color on how much more you might have to do on inventory or production to kind of get things where you need them to be balanced out?\nEd Breen: Yes, Jeff, so we did a pretty detailed analysis of it. And I think a good way to look at it is, what is our distributor customer's doing versus our direct end customers. So maybe just to give you a couple of numbers on the W&P side of our business, about 50% of our volume goes through distribution and the other 50% we sell direct to customers. And so we did a whole analysis, obviously, because the distributors, you can see quick what's going on with them and almost across the board, the distributor network is destocking pretty broadly. And it's, on a percentage basis, down significantly more than our direct customers. So just one because it hit us this quarter, our water business in China, which is mostly reverse osmosis, was down as 36% of it goes through distribution, the rest we sell direct to customers. But a third of our sales that go through distributors in China, it was down 36%, through distribution was down about 12% direct to the customer base. So, if you do that analysis in our safety business, you get very similar trends going on. So, clearly, the distributors are going through a destock. And I'm sure as we're approaching year-end, everyone is trying to get their inventories kind of where they want them. Now, by the way, having said that, my take is that the destock obviously goes into the first quarter if we just started to see it in some of these W&P businesses. But I would think the distributors work it down fairly quickly after we're kind of exiting the first quarter. But that same trend applies almost across the board when you do that analysis. It's the distributors are way down vis-\u00e0-vis the direct customer channel.\nLori Koch: And on the absorption question, we're still in the same general ballpark in the second half is where we were in the first half. There's a little bit of a mix and we'll be taking a little less absorption headwinds in E&I and a little more in W&P as we see the destock continue as we head into the fourth quarter, but in total, the number is about equal to the first half.\nJeff Sprague: Great. And I was wondering if you could give us a little color on restructuring also, Ed, I think you mentioned $150 million run rate. I wasn't sure if that was full year 2024. But maybe just give us a sense of how much restructuring tail you have in 2023, the incremental benefit you expect in 2024? And as volumes kind of hopefully improve into 2024, some of that just kind of discretionary temporary stuff that kind of comes back into the P&L?\nEd Breen: Yes. So, on an annual basis, Jeff, we'll be about $150 million of savings, kind of spread between plant fixed costs and functional costs or mostly G&A expense, not touching R&D at all. And by the way, just to back up on that. Lori and I have been looking at this kind of how we can do some restructuring for over a year. So, we're not doing it just in response to what's going on. I think I would have said on other earnings calls, we started looking at it actually a summer ago how could we streamline a little bit more. So, we're ready with that. We'll start seeing the benefits on the restructuring in the - towards the tail end of first quarter. We'll get going on it by the middle of December. So, by time it hits, we get things going, and you'll start to see the benefit then. So, you'll kind of get three quarters of the benefit for a big chunk of that in 2024. A little bit of that would potentially come back on the fixed costs - the plant fixed cost side as volumes pick up, but not all of it. So, you'll get a little bit of it coming back in as we see the volumes lift, but that's basically the program.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Thank you.\nEd Breen: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research. Your line is open.\nScott Davis: Hi, good morning everybody, Ed and Lori, Chris.\nEd Breen: Hi Scott.\nLori Koch: Good morning.\nScott Davis: Good morning. A couple of things. I mean, just to follow-up on Jeff's question because it just seems like it's so important and topical for you guys. I mean there's kind of two reasons why people destock inventory, right? I mean one is maybe the lead times come down, and they feel like they can get it fast. And two is they're really worried about their customers not wanting product. And I'm talking at the distribution level, not your direct. What do you think are the main drivers of this kind of incremental, because we've been talking about the inventory destock for several quarters now. And this quarter seem like it almost got a little bit worse, particularly in water and protection.\nEd Breen: Yes. Scott, I'd just give you a ballpark in my thinking. I think two-thirds of it, or 75%, something like that is really that the supply chain healed itself. It's pretty darn normal for everybody again. So everyone sat on excess inventory. I mean, look, we're doing the same thing. We had 151% cash conversion. We're lowering our inventory levels because we have built up more than what normally would during COVID, and every other CEO I talk to is doing the same thing. And by the way, I think as the pressure you're getting near the end of your year, you're really trying to get things in line for 2024. So I think a big part of it is that. But there's certainly as a percent of people just more worried is there a recession coming. You got an inverted yield curve for 18 months. People start getting nervous. There\u2019s always been a recession. So I can't say that's not - if that's in there. But I think the bigger part of it is we just all build excess inventory. We got what we can get during COVID. And probably I'll give you one example because we're seeing some destocking on the metal packaging side. A year ago, I had most of the CEOs of the medical device companies personally call me, pleading that we could ship more Tyvek material for packaging so they could shift their products out. And I remember telling them all, in fact, I sent a letter to the trade industry. I said our shipments to you are up 18% so far this year. I mean, I can't do much more. And that was everyone scrambling to get it and then they overshot. And now I probably shouldn't be surprised we're seeing some destocking on the medical packaging side. So I think that's just a great example. That has nothing to do with the recession, that's just everyone had too much.\nScott Davis: Yes. That's great color and makes a lot of sense. I want to ask about price. And I know the two segments are just way different. E&I, you manage price versus cost, and W&P maybe there's a little bit of a different price strategy. But when you think about like this new normal of higher inflation, wages, other costs, not explicitly material costs, but other costs, how do you think about price in a future construct, meaning maybe entering into 2024? It's probably more of a valid question for W&P, but maybe you can address for both segments and give us a little bit of sense of what you think happen there?\nEd Breen: Yes. Scott, I don't think 2024 will be what you'd consider a normal year. In a normal environment, a few years in a row just normal things, which we haven't had in four years for anybody, I would - we would always get like 1.5% to 2% price lift in the W&P business. Our goal in 2024 is to hold on to as much pricing as we can. And you, obviously, see us and others were getting benefit from price/cost spread that we saw in the third quarter, which helped us out. We'll obviously see it in the fourth quarter. So our goal is to really manage that well for 2024 because there's still quite a bit there. Now we're not going to get all the costs back by renegotiating contracts. Everyone's trying to hold price of our vendors are trying to hold it too. But we're still up to about $225 million that we've gotten back that we - so I mean, that's pretty significant for us. And so we're hoping to hold that for next year. My gut is we're going to give up some pricing in the shelter business, because we don't want to lose market share. But a lot of the other businesses will really be managing that tightly. But then if we ever get - we get back to normal time, hopefully, 2025, we would look at that 1.5% to 2% price increase. And then electronics, we just try to hold about flat. And usually, we're flat to down 1%, but you get nice volume lift.\nScott Davis: Good color. Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on. Appreciate it.\nEd Breen: Yes, Scott. Happy talking to you. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nSteve Tusa: Hi, good morning.\nEd Breen: Good morning.\nSteve Tusa: Can you just update us on what you actually expect for - what was the price/cost spread this quarter and what you expect now for the year?\nLori Koch: Yes. So our full year number, we ticked up to $225 million versus the last quarter, we had expected about $140 million. So we're seeing that deflation benefit come through in the back half. So in the third quarter, we saw net about $75 million benefit. We'll see that tick up to around $100 million in the fourth quarter.\nSteve Tusa: And so does some of that carry into next year?\nLori Koch: Yes.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. And then I guess\u2026\nLori Koch: We will continue into next year with the caveat that we don't place not as an earlier comment what the price is going to do. But we do expect the deflation benefit to continue because it took its time to get through inventory this year.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. And then just kind of a philosophical question on how you think about next year. I mean, your exit rate now on some of these businesses just from a revenue perspective, is more negative, you're taking revenue down. You talked about some of it being destock, which is effectively an easier comp next year in the second half of the year. I mean, do you think with this profile that you guys can still grow revenues next year?\nEd Breen: Yes, yes. I think the first quarter, Steve, to your comment, will be light, more similar to the fourth quarter because I don't think the destock will end, but back quick, but the distributors will move very fast. They stop ordering it for a while. They literally - we've talked directly to them and they're like, just don't ship me something for a few months, and then we'll be back on track. So yes, I think the first quarter will be on the light side, but I think after that, we'll see some nice lift. I would certainly by then, the electronics part of our business, which you know is highly profitable, I think will be back to a really nice lift. Just on the semi side, the fabs are running a little below 70% utilization. I think if you do the math on what the industry is thinking, they're going to kind of get up as the year goes more to 80% utilization the following year, more like the 90% where you would run at. So you'll start to see some - on a percentage basis, some pretty nice lift. And then we've had two quarters in a row of ICS lifting. So it's clearly off the bottom. That will, I think, continue to grow as we go through next year. So I think you're kind of through the electronics one, although we're kind of now doing a destock on the W&P side. And remember, we're mostly short cycle, so we'll see it first. And then, I think, by the second quarter, you'll see a lot of that destock over with, and you'll see the volume lift.\nSteve Tusa: One last one for you. I mean, you've been through a few cycles, DuPont having, I guess, high-single-digit to even double-digit organic volume declines. I mean, are we already in a recession here in your mind?\nEd Breen: I'm trying to - one foot in, yes. I've been there for a while, by the way. I track a lot of economic indicators, as I said earlier, when you see the yield curve where it's been and all, there's always been a recession. So, I like to manage, I guess, conservatively. So, I've been telling the team for a long time, just prepare for a softer environment. And if we're wrong, great, we'll have done all the right actions to position ourselves. But yes, I think there was this quarter just reading all the results from companies I saw, they were pretty mixed.\nSteve Tusa: Right. Great. Thanks a lot.\nEd Breen: And people are mostly missing on the volume not on their EBITDA.\nSteve Tusa: Right. Yes, thanks a lot.\nEd Breen: Okay Steve.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Leithead of Barclays. Your line is open.\nMike Leithead: Great. Thanks. Good morning guys.\nEd Breen: Good morning.\nMike Leithead: Ed just on the Delrin sale, can you maybe speak to why this monetization structure was sort of the best ultimate outcome? And then relatedly, maybe for Lori, when should we expect the note receivable to accrue? Or I guess, when do you get that $350 million in cash?\nEd Breen: Yes. So, we liked it. Look, we sold Delrin in a tougher environment than when we sold the rest of M&M. So, this optimized what we could get for the asset over a few year period. We're getting $1.2 some billion upfront. We're writing 20% equity in it. TJC has a phenomenal track record. So, my gut is we have some nice upside coming from the retained interest that we have in the business, that's to be proved out, but I'm highly confident in that. It is a good business. It should do well over the next few years. So, we think that optimizes our position. So, we sold it at $1.8 billion in value. My gut is we can end up nicely above that with the equity that we have. So, - and by the way, it just goes to our whole capital allocation strategy. It was not a business we wanted to be in long-term, even though it's a good business. We're taking the volatility out of the portfolio and we'll redeploy that cash. And as we said in our prepared remarks, we will actually do more share repurchase after the ASR ends next year because we're in a great balance sheet position and we'll have good free cash flow, and we plan on buying back more shares.\nLori Koch: Yes. And Michael, on the debt. So, we gave them a $350 million loan. It's an eight-year loan if the venture were to go that long. So, like normally, they would monetize quicker than that, then we would get the repayment of the loan. So if it went to the longest poll, it would be eight years, but it's most likely not the reality.\nMike Leithead: Great. That's super helpful. And then second, I was hoping maybe you could give us a bit more color on the moving pieces within the Corporate and Other segment. I assume the retained businesses are doing fairly well in the auto backdrop. So, can you speak to what's kind of the moving pieces there? And should we expect that business to continue to deliver some level of double-digit millions of EBITDA?\nLori Koch: Yes. So, the business is just for a refresher that are in corporate or primarily the auto adhesives business, and then we have Tedlar and multi-base, but the largest end market served is Automotive, and there's a large EV exposure there. So, we saw a nice mid-single-digit volume growth again. We expect for a full year from a volume growth perspective the auto adhesives to grow up in the high single-digits and we continue to expect really great things from that business with the EV penetration that we've seen. So, from an earnings perspective, they were up very nicely as well. We saw nice earnings growth and margin appreciation in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we have a little bit of a deceleration, just a lot of their exposure is in the U.S. with automotive. So, there's some headwind from the strike that fortunately is now over, but there will be a little bit of a headwind from the October impact. And then the U.S. car build right now from IHS are expected to be down. But overall, the trajectory of this business is really strong. They had a great 2023, and we expect a really strong 2024 again.\nMike Leithead: Great. Thank you.\nLori Koch: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John McNulty of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJohn McNulty: Yes, thanks for taking my question. So it looks like the electronics end markets seem like they're starting to stabilize a little bit. You expect semi technologies to be up quarter-over-quarter. Can you add some color on what you expect from the other two subsectors in the E&I division? Do you see normal 4Q seasonality? Is there maybe a little bit of destock in the Industrial Solutions side? I guess, can you help us to think about the trends there?\nEd Breen: Yes. So semi will lift a little bit. So I would still say bounce along the bottom, but getting through the destock. And when I say a little bit, a few percentage points sequentially up in the business. The ICS business will be down some, but that's all seasonality. If you look at it just the normal drop you see in seasonality, it's less. So the business continues maybe a few more points to improve after the last two quarters of improvement. So kind of less seasonality because the business is recovering. And then on the industrial part of E&I, we'll definitely see a little bit of destocking there. The biopharma destocking, which is in that business picked up some during the quarter. So I expect that to continue into the fourth quarter and hopefully be kind of done by them with that. And there's just a little bit of other destocking going along with some of our distributors in that business. So nothing significant, but I think that will see a little bit of softness.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. Okay. Thanks. And then maybe just as a follow-up. I think as we get to kind of mid-December, the opt-out period should be kind of done on the PFAS side. I guess, can you give us any update on the water district settlement? Is there anything that you can speak to at this point? It seems like that should put a lot of lot of kind of the pressures behind you, but I guess any update there would be helpful.\nEd Breen: Yes. So we - the date that's coming up here is the deadline for the opt-outs is December 4. And then we will see a list of who the opt-outs are on December 6. And then there's a final fairness hearing in South Carolina on December 14. So it's all kind of happening that first two weeks of December. And I really can't add any other color. I just don't have any other facts in front of me. We're feeling obviously very good about it, and highly confident that this will get signed off and get done. And I'd just add, obviously, people are talking to the key water districts around the country. So we're feeling good, and hopefully, we're close to getting that cemented.\nJohn McNulty: Great. Thanks very much for the color.\nEd Breen: Yes, thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning.\nEd Breen: Good morning.\nDavid Begleiter: Ed or Lori, just on the restructuring, do you have any more color you can provide some more concrete examples of where that $150 million is going to come from?\nLori Koch: Yes. So we had mentioned that it will primarily come from plant fixed costs and then the G&A or the functional cost to the overhead structure of the company. So the plant fixed cost is really a function of the destocking and what we can do from a volume perspective. So looking hard at contractors, looking part of the plant fixed costs spends, looking hard at making sure that we can temporarily adjust our cost structure to the line with the volume environment that we're seeing. And then on the kind of the SAR side or the functional costs, general and administrative, that's just continued cleaning out. So as Ed had mentioned, we're constantly looking to make sure that we're running to lead in an efficient organization as possible. So that's where the focus will be. We really won't be touching R&D and marketing and sales. So we believe this - this destocking period is temporary, and so we really need to be prepared when it comes back on the other side to be able to take advantage of the upside. So that really won't be the focus to be more on the plant costs and the functional spend.\nDavid Begleiter: Understood. And then just on interconnects and semis, did you gain any share this year? Or is there any new technology products in the pipeline that you think can grow share this year or next year?\nLori Koch: Yes. So there's examples in both. So within semi, really around the packaging side, we've seen some nice share gains. And also just in general, we've seen an uptick on the advanced new components. And so if you actually look at our performance in the quarter, we had nice growth with TSMC as they continue to expand their advanced nodes and take advantage of the AI revolution. So we saw nice growth on the semi side. And then within ICS, we had a new application with 1 of the large smartphone producers, which took advantage of a material that crossed over our metallization business to be able to have a key win there. So that was part of the sequential growth that we saw in the quarter will we continue to be. It's on every single model of the phone, but with a one producer, so it's a nice vendors.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nAleksey Yefremov: Thanks and good morning, everyone. This is Rob in for Aleksey. My first question comes around the Shelter Solutions business. Just in terms of where do you think we are in the destocking cycle there in demand? And then how good is your visibility into 2024 here?\nLori Koch: Yes. So we saw less of a year-over-year headwind in Shelter in the third quarter versus what we saw in the first half that we feel like things are starting to normalize a little bit and then our expectations for the fourth quarter are to see less volume declines, less we're seeing year-to-date. So it feels like things are normalizing a little bit. Obviously, there's a little bit of disparity from a market perspective between the resi and the commercial side. A lot of the growth that was on the commercial side is more in commercial applications where we don't have a big footprint like, for example, around the data centers. Our exposure in commercial is more around education and healthcare and government, where there hasn't been that step change growth, it's really been more on the data center side. But in general, it feels like we're nearing the end of the significant downturns. We expect the volumes in the fourth quarter to be more down in the mid-single digits versus the double-digits that we've seen all year. So it feels like it's starting to normalize, and we do believe that destock is now behind us. So now it's just a function of when the demand returned.\nAleksey Yefremov: Okay. Very helpful. Thank you. And then just a question for me on - you mentioned China trade restrictions and the impact it had on the semiconductor technologies business. Wondering if you might be able to quantify that impact there. And then just any updated view on the recently announced restrictions there? Thank you.\nLori Koch: Yes. So no change to our current view of about $60 million of a revenue headwind from the exposure. So a lot of our\u2026\nEd Breen: For the year.\nLori Koch: For the year, yes. So it's about $15 million of order. So a lot of the restrictions have more been in the advanced node spaces that we don't have a huge footprint with the Chinese players from that perspective. So it's only about $60 million for us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Spector of UBS. Your line is open.\nJosh Spector: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. So I just wanted to ask on fourth quarter. I mean it kind of seems like the puck is moving around in different areas in terms of destocking. But if I heard you right, your sales guidance is kind of flattish in the different segments sequentially. Semis is picking up, which has the highest drop-through, and you're expecting some higher raw material benefits. So what would drive EBITDA down sequentially $20 million, $25 million versus flat to up?\nLori Koch: Yes. So we see the underlying revenue down about $100 million once you - on an organic basis. So we will get another quarter of the Spectrum business first third quarter. But if you take that out, we see underlying organic revenue down about $100. So it's about split between seasonality and currency being about half of the headwind with the seasonality being within the - primarily the smartphone and consumer electronics business in ICS and Shelter as they strength throughout the summer months. And then currency, we do see as a bit of a headwind sequentially. And then the other half of it is from the medical packaging piece that Ed had mentioned earlier. So we do see some medical packaging pullback in the fourth quarter as those device makers destock from the overbuy that happened over the recent quarters. So it's really just and then the EBITDA, you have a net benefit from additional spreads. We have mentioned there's about $25 million of additional benefit from spread, but that $100 million impact from the volume decline kind of net you out to the surrounding the $50 million that we guided to for the fourth quarter versus the $775 million that we posted in the third quarter.\nJosh Spector: Okay. Thanks. I appreciate that. And I mean, just if you kind of come back to electronics and semis. I think Ed, you said utilization rates in the mid-70s. I think we've maybe troughed in the high 60s, but you guys haven't really felt as much of that pickup. I guess, as you look at things improving, how much is semi reconnecting your business year-on-year just from a reconnection to where the rate is now? I mean, is that mid-single digits or higher, just on where we\u2019re resonating now perhaps inventory or it would be a different math to get to a different level? Thanks.\nEd Breen: Well, the fabs have been - to your point, have been running kind of if you lump them all together. I think you would average out in the high 60s. And I think if you go through all the projections out there and also talking to our customers, that high 60s is going to ramp through 2024, up to - by the time you get maybe in the third quarter, beginning the fourth quarter up to maybe a little over 80%. So you still won't be back according to projections to kind of over 90% till you enter into 2025. But again, going from high 60s to 80% is a nice lift during the year. And then more of that production will be advanced nodes, which back to Lori's point a minute ago, plays to our strength that's usually why we outgrow 200- to 300-basis-point what the market is doing. But it's also - by the way, you also got to look customer by customer on the semi side because some are still - we're shipping out of inventory. But all the signs I saw from all their reporting publicly, they've seen their bottom, it looks like, pretty much across the board. But I don't think the lift will be dramatic in the - at the beginning of the year. But I think as the year sequences, we'll see nice lift occurring in that business.\nJosh Spector: Okay. Thank you.\nEd Breen: Yes, thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nVincent Andrews: Thank you. A couple of questions here. First on the distributor part of the supply chain, not just for you, but for pretty much everybody seems to have taken it more on the chain with the overstocking and then the destocking. Do you have a sense of whether that was just - they\u2019re little too over jealous with principle risk loading up and then on the way back down is the issue just that they don\u2019t have the same access to credit or just the higher rates. And I guess, what I'm getting at is, do you think, over time, your terms with distribution and maybe some of your other customers are going to need to change in a way that might require you to hold more working capital or to give them incentives to move it along? And I guess I'm just sort of asking what's going to ultimately break the log jam of the game of hot potato of nobody wanting to hold inventory?\nEd Breen: Yes. I don't think it's - I really think it's just - we all overbuild inventory. Direct vendors and distributors through the COVID period, I mean we all talked about it. And I go back to my example on the medical packaging side. The customers were just yelling for us to get more to them. And usually, when that happens, you see an overshoot happen, and some of them probably even double order. I've been through that before in my career, and then you get the snap back. So I think that's what we're going through is that they're adjusting their inventory back to appropriate levels. They don't have to worry about carrying excess inventory because supply chains are normalized again. And again, we're doing the same thing. We're feeling confident about being able to get supply of all our different components. And so we're working our inventory levels down from what were elevated levels because of the COVID stuff. So I don't think that you'll have to worry about different terms or anything with our distributors.\nVincent Andrews: Okay. Good to hear. Lori, can I just ask you what's updated thoughts on minimum cash levels that you want to keep just as we think about next year and your free cash flow generation versus what you might do from a share repurchase perspective?\nLori Koch: Yes. So we'll still target about $1.5 billion of minimum cash levels. As we had mentioned on the call, we'll look to return a significant portion of our cash flow to shareholders next year through share repurchases. So will be done with the existing ASR at some point later in the first quarter, and then that will give us the ability to get back into the market underneath the new program. As I had mentioned, we have the Delrin proceeds coming in at some point today. So we'll have that cash come in the door. And then when we're in an open window, again, we'll be able to do more share repurchase.\nVincent Andrews: Okay. Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch of Fermium Research. Your line is open.\nFrank Mitsch: Good morning. I wanted to - wanted to follow up on\u2026\nEd Breen: Good morning, Frank.\nFrank Mitsch: Hi, Ed. How are you doing?\nEd Breen: Good, good.\nFrank Mitsch: Wanted to follow-up on Spectrum. You indicated that financially, it was performing in line with your projections. So I was just curious, I think you indicated that you expected like something like $45 million of EBITDA for the balance of $23 million since you closed on August 1. And also I think you guys indicated you get about $20 million of synergies. So are those numbers still accurate? What's your take on Spectrum so far?\nLori Koch: Yes. So Spectrum is performing according to plan. They've got nice growth on a year-over-year basis, especially within the medical device side. The majority of the business is medical device. There is a piece that goes into industrial. And it's really based on some nice key wins that they've had with some of the large medical device producers. So we're pleased with the performance that we've seen as the numbers that you had cited earlier are still on track. And then the synergy delivery is $60 million in total, it's over a couple of year timeframe for us to realize the synergies, but that continues to remain on track as well. Obviously, the initial synergy delivery will come from some overhead consolidation that we get after the procurement-related synergies and maybe some of the site-related synergies over time.\nFrank Mitsch: Very helpful. Thank you, Lori. And if I could follow up on semiconductor technologies. You indicated that AI growth is going to help this business in the future. Can you give us an idea of the size that you anticipate AI to grow to over 2024, 2025 in terms of your semiconductor business?\nEd Breen: Well, I will go, Frank, more high level. I think a lot of the growth we'll get will allow the semiconductor business - again, once we get through the downturn here and all that, that this business can grow kind of mid- to high-single-digit, which, by the way, it was doing before all the destock hit. Again, if the market grows 5 to 6 to 7 points, we'll grow 200 to 300 basis points above that. And that 200 to 300 basis points is mostly because of that high-end ship, because of AI enablement and all that and that plays to our sweet spot. So that's how we get that outsized growth usually over the market and AI plays right into that.\nLori Koch: Maybe just to help to size it for you, too. So within our semi portfolio, we have about a $700 million business in data centers overall and about a little more than one-third of that is direct to AI. So that's the nice portion of growth that we continue to see above the overall MFI projections.\nFrank Mitsch: Very helpful. Thanks so much.\nEd Breen: Thanks, Frank.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. [Rob Hoffman] on for Steve Byrne. Just going back to the Spectrum business. Now that you've had the business for a couple of months, - do you see any opportunities for cross-selling to these medical device companies?\nLori Koch: Yes. That was one of the large theses for the revenue synergy upside was that they are very strong and have great relationships on the medical device side, and we're very strong and have great relationships on the biopharma side, and how can we bring those two pieces together to generate revenue synergies? So it's been a couple of months and that the theses as we've initially seen it continues to play out, and we'll - and we don't have the revenue synergies on the hand right now, but we see nice opportunities as we continue to integrate these two businesses together.\nUnidentified Analyst: I see. That's great. And then which of your businesses do you see the most potential for share gains and new product introduction versus volumes that are driven primarily by cyclical recoveries?\nLori Koch: Yes. I mean I think, if we see - if we take it by segment within E&I, we've mentioned that - we should see 200 to 300 basis points of outsized market growth within semi, and that's a combination of share gain and just where our exposure is in advanced nodes in the areas that are growing faster than others. We also see a step-change opportunity within the general consumer electronics space. We have seen some nice share gain on the metallization side. It will continue to show in the top line as the PCB providers start to ramp up their utilization rates to more normal levels, but we have seen we have seen our performance versus some of the peers in the metallization space, be better. And then within the W&P portfolio, we continue to expect nice growth within water. Obviously, we're in a destock right now, but we'll see nice growth more from a secular basis. So just that water industry is generally growing in mid-single digits, which is a nice market for us. And on the safety side, it's really going to be we've added capacity now, and we have to - we'll get step-change growth from utilizing that capacity. So we're nearing the completion of an additional line for Tyvek. We've constrained in the Tyvek market for years. And so we'll - we'll see some nice lift there as we fill up that asset, and we've recently expanded some capacity within the new technology in the Kevlar space. So it's a new opportunity for us to bring a lighter weight Kevlar to the market, and we look for good things from that business as well. I mean, and Shelter generally should be more along the GDP-type grower.\nUnidentified Analyst: Understood. Thank you.\nLori Koch: Thanks.\nOperator: And our final question today comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nArun Viswanathan: Thanks for taking my question. Hey, just wanted to take a quick try it at maybe kind of mid-cycle or longer-term earnings growth. If you think about volumes kind of maybe double-digits below normal in electronics and then some leverage on a recovery there, you're exiting the year at around $3 billion of annualized EBITDA. Would that imply something in the 3.3 to 3.6 kind of range as far as when you take a look at longer term or mid-cycle where you want to get to? Thanks.\nLori Koch: Yes. I mean longer term, you should get back into the - if we were running the E&I portfolio, I think, is where your focus was in the more of the 32% margin range, and we should see the volume kind of return there over time as the utilization rate at the large PCP guys and the semi guys return. But if we look more near-term as far as headwinds, tailwinds as we head into 2024, there's definitely tailwinds from volume growth from the electronics recovery and normalization of the destock. And there's obviously, incremental tailwinds from the deflation we had mentioned as we go forward, and then the benefit of the restructuring actions that we are now taking and we'll start to see the benefit of at some point later in the first quarter. And then just from an EPS perspective, we do continue to lower our share count. So we'll see lower fourth quarter share count versus the full year, which will carry us into 2024. And then we'll have the incremental benefit of the $2 billion program that we'll complete in the first and then advance shares new share takeout as well. So we see a nice EPS benefit that we've seen as we took shares out throughout 2023. The headwinds, though, are, I think we will continue to see the industrial destock impact the water and safety businesses primarily in the first quarter. So that will be a headwind to the first quarter. We will see most likely some price modernization or get back primarily in the shelter business as I had mentioned. So we'll try and maintain that as long as we can, but we will be cognizant of potential share loss and potentially has to be giving some back there. And then just we have taken some aggressive actions on the compensation side in 2023. So we are paying a below-target variable compensation payout this year, and so we would most likely see normalization of that as we head into 2024. And so those are the big puts and takes with the one extra exception from a below-the-line perspective around interest income. So we did see about $145 million of interest income this year just as we held the proceeds from the Celanese transaction in the first half before we could deploy them to Spectrum and then the full share repurchase program. So we would see a step down in 2024 from interest income from about $145 million this year to probably $20 million next year.\nArun Viswanathan: Thanks.\nOperator: I would like to hand the call back over to Chris Mecray for closing comments.\nChris Mecray: Okay.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Lori Koch",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed, and good morning. Our teams continue to execute well in a softer volume backdrop driven by broad-based inventory destocking, demonstrating strong financial discipline and focus on operational excellence. I am most pleased with the sequential margin improvement registered by each of our segments in the third quarter as well as our strong cash performance in the period. Given volume headwinds, the delivery of stronger margins and better cash flow are attributed to execution around lowering our input costs, coordination with the operating teams to rightsize our inventory position, as well as overall progress with productivity via operational excellence initiatives. We are very focused on operating discipline and pleased that site level operating execution is positively positioning us for solid margin upside as volumes recover. We expect to see evidence of this in 2024 given expected recovery in key end markets, including electronics. Turning to our financial highlights on Slide 5. Third quarter net sales of $3.1 billion decreased 8% versus the year ago period, a 10% organic sales decline was slightly offset by a 2% portfolio benefit due primarily to revenue contribution from spectrum acquisition. The organic sales decline reflects a 10% decrease in volume, resulting primarily from semiconductor and construction end markets as well as the impact of channel inventory destocking. E&I and W&P organic sales declined 13% and 8%, respectively, while the retained businesses and corporate reported 1% organic sales growth, including mid-single-digit growth in the adhesives portfolio. From a regional perspective, consolidated DuPont sales decreased on an organic basis globally versus the year ago period with Asia Pacific, North America and Europe down 12%, 10% and 2%, respectively. China sales were down 16% on an organic basis versus the third quarter of 2022, though E&I sales in China increased sequentially in the quarter and saw smaller year-over-year declines in each of the last three quarters. Third quarter operating EBITDA of $775 million decreased 9% versus the year ago period, driven by lower volumes and the impact of reduced production rates primarily within E&I as we align inventory with demand, partially offset by lower endpoint costs related to raw materials, logistics and energy along with the portfolio benefits from Spectrum. Operating EBITDA margin during the quarter of 25.3% was down 50 basis points versus the year ago period driven by volume pressure in the high-margin semi business and reduced production rates, primarily within the E&I segment, offset partially by cost equation benefits, which increased somewhat from second quarter levels. On a sequential basis, operating EBITDA was up 5% and operating EBITDA margin improved 140 basis points. Decremental margins for the quarter was 31%, enabled by cost deflation and aggressive actions taken year-to-date to reduce spending. As I mentioned earlier, I am pleased with our cash flow improvement during the quarter. Optimizing working capital performance continues to be a top priority for us. On a continued operations basis, cash flow from operations of $740 million, less capital expenditures of $119 million, resulted in adjusted free cash flow of $621 million in the third quarter, a 47% increase versus the year ago period. Adjusted free cash flow conversion during the quarter was 151%, an increase versus last year, and much improved compared to the first half of this year. We currently expect to finish the year with conversion around our targeted level of 90%. Turning to Slide 6. Adjusted EPS for the quarter of $0.92 a share increased 12% compared to $0.82 in the year ago period. Below-the-line benefits, including a combined $0.16 benefit related to a lower share count and lower net interest expense more than offset lower segment earnings. Other below-the-line benefits, including a lower tax rate and lower foreign exchange losses, contributed $0.06 to adjusted EPS improvement versus the year ago period. Our tax rate for the quarter was 24.6%, down from 26.2% in the year ago period, driven by the impact of a rate true-up in the year ago period, and lower than our previously communicated modeling guidance as discrete tax headwinds were lower than expected. Our expectation of a full year 2023 base tax rate of 24% remains unchanged. Turning to segment results, beginning with E&I on Slide 7. The E&I third quarter net sales of $1.4 billion decreased 9% as organic sales declined 13%, offset partially by a portfolio benefit of 4% from the Spectrum acquisition. The organic sales decline reflected a 12% decrease in volume and a 1% decrease in price. At the line of business level, organic sales for semiconductor technologies were down high teens versus the year ago period, resulting from a continuation of inventory destocking across the channel and, to a lesser extent, ongoing weak end market demand and the impact of China trade restrictions. On a reported basis, semiconductor technology sales were flat sequentially in the third quarter. Within Interconnect Solutions, organic sales declined 11% year-over-year due to both volume and price declines, driven by the pass-through of lower metal pricing. Volume continued to be impacted by weak smartphone, PC and tablet demand, particularly in China, along with more moderate inventory destocking, which we believe is largely complete. On a sequential basis, the Interconnect business reported a second straight quarter of sales improvement, with sales up 8%, driven by seasonality as well as some underlying demand improvement within PCB markets. Organic sales for Industrial Solutions were down high single-digits versus the year ago period, due primarily to destocking within biopharma applications for our Liveo product line, and continued lower demand in electronics related end markets. These declines were partially offset by increased demand for OLED display materials. Operating EBITDA for E&I of $383 million was down versus the year ago period, primarily due to volume declines and lower operating rates to better align inventory with demand, slightly offset by a portfolio benefit related to Spectrum. Operating EBITDA margin increased 140 basis points sequentially during the third quarter. Turning to Slide 8. W&P third quarter net sales of $1.4 billion declined 8% versus last year as volume decline of 9% was slightly offset by a 1% increase in price due to the carryover impact of actions taken last year. Within Safety Solutions, organic sales were down high single-digits, due primarily to channel inventory destocking. Shelter Solutions sales were down high single digits on an organic basis, driven by continued demand softness in construction markets and ongoing channel inventory destocking. On a sequential basis from the second quarter, shelter sales increased slightly, and we expect narrow year-over-year declines in fourth quarter. Organic sales for Water Solutions were down mid-single digits versus the year ago period due primarily to inventory destocking, including key distributor customers and lower industrial project demand in China, mainly impacting reverse osmosis. We expect generally flat sequential volumes in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. Operating EBITDA for W&P during the third quarter of $362 million decreased versus the year ago period due to lower volume, partially offset by the impact of net pricing benefit. Operating EBITDA margin of 25.6% increased 70 basis points year-over-year and 100 basis points sequentially from the second quarter. Turning to Slide 9, I will close with a few comments on what we are seeing in the fourth quarter and how that translates to our full year 2023 guidance. Underlying consumer electronics demand in the fourth quarter is expected to be generally similar to the third quarter, with some sequential sales is expected in semiconductor technologies. As mentioned earlier, we saw additional channel inventory destocking and slower industrial demand in China, mainly impacting Water Solutions compared to prior expectations, and we assume these same trends to continue through the end of the year. As a result of this incremental volume softness, we are adjusting our net sales and operating EBITDA guidance and now expect full year net sales to be about $12.17 billion and operating EBITDA to be at about $2.97 billion, which is at the low end of our prior range. For the fourth quarter, we expect net sales of approximately $3 billion, with a sequential decline versus third quarter, driven predominantly by additional inventory destocking in the Safety Solutions line of business and, to a lesser extent, by the impact of seasonality and incremental currency headwinds. We expect full year 2023 adjusted EPS to be approximately $3.45 per share, which is the midpoint of our prior guidance range. With that, we are pleased to take your questions. And let me turn it back to the operator to open the Q&A. And on the absorption question, we're still in the same general ballpark in the second half is where we were in the first half. There's a little bit of a mix and we'll be taking a little less absorption headwinds in E&I and a little more in W&P as we see the destock continue as we head into the fourth quarter, but in total, the number is about equal to the first half. Good morning. Yes. So our full year number, we ticked up to $225 million versus the last quarter, we had expected about $140 million. So we're seeing that deflation benefit come through in the back half. So in the third quarter, we saw net about $75 million benefit. We'll see that tick up to around $100 million in the fourth quarter. Yes. We will continue into next year with the caveat that we don't place not as an earlier comment what the price is going to do. But we do expect the deflation benefit to continue because it took its time to get through inventory this year. Yes. And Michael, on the debt. So, we gave them a $350 million loan. It's an eight-year loan if the venture were to go that long. So, like normally, they would monetize quicker than that, then we would get the repayment of the loan. So if it went to the longest poll, it would be eight years, but it's most likely not the reality. Yes. So, the business is just for a refresher that are in corporate or primarily the auto adhesives business, and then we have Tedlar and multi-base, but the largest end market served is Automotive, and there's a large EV exposure there. So, we saw a nice mid-single-digit volume growth again. We expect for a full year from a volume growth perspective the auto adhesives to grow up in the high single-digits and we continue to expect really great things from that business with the EV penetration that we've seen. So, from an earnings perspective, they were up very nicely as well. We saw nice earnings growth and margin appreciation in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we have a little bit of a deceleration, just a lot of their exposure is in the U.S. with automotive. So, there's some headwind from the strike that fortunately is now over, but there will be a little bit of a headwind from the October impact. And then the U.S. car build right now from IHS are expected to be down. But overall, the trajectory of this business is really strong. They had a great 2023, and we expect a really strong 2024 again. Thank you. Yes. So we had mentioned that it will primarily come from plant fixed costs and then the G&A or the functional cost to the overhead structure of the company. So the plant fixed cost is really a function of the destocking and what we can do from a volume perspective. So looking hard at contractors, looking part of the plant fixed costs spends, looking hard at making sure that we can temporarily adjust our cost structure to the line with the volume environment that we're seeing. And then on the kind of the SAR side or the functional costs, general and administrative, that's just continued cleaning out. So as Ed had mentioned, we're constantly looking to make sure that we're running to lead in an efficient organization as possible. So that's where the focus will be. We really won't be touching R&D and marketing and sales. So we believe this - this destocking period is temporary, and so we really need to be prepared when it comes back on the other side to be able to take advantage of the upside. So that really won't be the focus to be more on the plant costs and the functional spend. Yes. So there's examples in both. So within semi, really around the packaging side, we've seen some nice share gains. And also just in general, we've seen an uptick on the advanced new components. And so if you actually look at our performance in the quarter, we had nice growth with TSMC as they continue to expand their advanced nodes and take advantage of the AI revolution. So we saw nice growth on the semi side. And then within ICS, we had a new application with 1 of the large smartphone producers, which took advantage of a material that crossed over our metallization business to be able to have a key win there. So that was part of the sequential growth that we saw in the quarter will we continue to be. It's on every single model of the phone, but with a one producer, so it's a nice vendors. Yes. So we saw less of a year-over-year headwind in Shelter in the third quarter versus what we saw in the first half that we feel like things are starting to normalize a little bit and then our expectations for the fourth quarter are to see less volume declines, less we're seeing year-to-date. So it feels like things are normalizing a little bit. Obviously, there's a little bit of disparity from a market perspective between the resi and the commercial side. A lot of the growth that was on the commercial side is more in commercial applications where we don't have a big footprint like, for example, around the data centers. Our exposure in commercial is more around education and healthcare and government, where there hasn't been that step change growth, it's really been more on the data center side. But in general, it feels like we're nearing the end of the significant downturns. We expect the volumes in the fourth quarter to be more down in the mid-single digits versus the double-digits that we've seen all year. So it feels like it's starting to normalize, and we do believe that destock is now behind us. So now it's just a function of when the demand returned. Yes. So no change to our current view of about $60 million of a revenue headwind from the exposure. So a lot of our... For the year, yes. So it's about $15 million of order. So a lot of the restrictions have more been in the advanced node spaces that we don't have a huge footprint with the Chinese players from that perspective. So it's only about $60 million for us. Yes. So we see the underlying revenue down about $100 million once you - on an organic basis. So we will get another quarter of the Spectrum business first third quarter. But if you take that out, we see underlying organic revenue down about $100. So it's about split between seasonality and currency being about half of the headwind with the seasonality being within the - primarily the smartphone and consumer electronics business in ICS and Shelter as they strength throughout the summer months. And then currency, we do see as a bit of a headwind sequentially. And then the other half of it is from the medical packaging piece that Ed had mentioned earlier. So we do see some medical packaging pullback in the fourth quarter as those device makers destock from the overbuy that happened over the recent quarters. So it's really just and then the EBITDA, you have a net benefit from additional spreads. We have mentioned there's about $25 million of additional benefit from spread, but that $100 million impact from the volume decline kind of net you out to the surrounding the $50 million that we guided to for the fourth quarter versus the $775 million that we posted in the third quarter. Yes. So we'll still target about $1.5 billion of minimum cash levels. As we had mentioned on the call, we'll look to return a significant portion of our cash flow to shareholders next year through share repurchases. So will be done with the existing ASR at some point later in the first quarter, and then that will give us the ability to get back into the market underneath the new program. As I had mentioned, we have the Delrin proceeds coming in at some point today. So we'll have that cash come in the door. And then when we're in an open window, again, we'll be able to do more share repurchase. Yes. So Spectrum is performing according to plan. They've got nice growth on a year-over-year basis, especially within the medical device side. The majority of the business is medical device. There is a piece that goes into industrial. And it's really based on some nice key wins that they've had with some of the large medical device producers. So we're pleased with the performance that we've seen as the numbers that you had cited earlier are still on track. And then the synergy delivery is $60 million in total, it's over a couple of year timeframe for us to realize the synergies, but that continues to remain on track as well. Obviously, the initial synergy delivery will come from some overhead consolidation that we get after the procurement-related synergies and maybe some of the site-related synergies over time. Maybe just to help to size it for you, too. So within our semi portfolio, we have about a $700 million business in data centers overall and about a little more than one-third of that is direct to AI. So that's the nice portion of growth that we continue to see above the overall MFI projections. Yes. That was one of the large theses for the revenue synergy upside was that they are very strong and have great relationships on the medical device side, and we're very strong and have great relationships on the biopharma side, and how can we bring those two pieces together to generate revenue synergies? So it's been a couple of months and that the theses as we've initially seen it continues to play out, and we'll - and we don't have the revenue synergies on the hand right now, but we see nice opportunities as we continue to integrate these two businesses together. Yes. I mean I think, if we see - if we take it by segment within E&I, we've mentioned that - we should see 200 to 300 basis points of outsized market growth within semi, and that's a combination of share gain and just where our exposure is in advanced nodes in the areas that are growing faster than others. We also see a step-change opportunity within the general consumer electronics space. We have seen some nice share gain on the metallization side. It will continue to show in the top line as the PCB providers start to ramp up their utilization rates to more normal levels, but we have seen we have seen our performance versus some of the peers in the metallization space, be better. And then within the W&P portfolio, we continue to expect nice growth within water. Obviously, we're in a destock right now, but we'll see nice growth more from a secular basis. So just that water industry is generally growing in mid-single digits, which is a nice market for us. And on the safety side, it's really going to be we've added capacity now, and we have to - we'll get step-change growth from utilizing that capacity. So we're nearing the completion of an additional line for Tyvek. We've constrained in the Tyvek market for years. And so we'll - we'll see some nice lift there as we fill up that asset, and we've recently expanded some capacity within the new technology in the Kevlar space. So it's a new opportunity for us to bring a lighter weight Kevlar to the market, and we look for good things from that business as well. I mean, and Shelter generally should be more along the GDP-type grower. Thanks. Yes. I mean longer term, you should get back into the - if we were running the E&I portfolio, I think, is where your focus was in the more of the 32% margin range, and we should see the volume kind of return there over time as the utilization rate at the large PCP guys and the semi guys return. But if we look more near-term as far as headwinds, tailwinds as we head into 2024, there's definitely tailwinds from volume growth from the electronics recovery and normalization of the destock. And there's obviously, incremental tailwinds from the deflation we had mentioned as we go forward, and then the benefit of the restructuring actions that we are now taking and we'll start to see the benefit of at some point later in the first quarter. And then just from an EPS perspective, we do continue to lower our share count. So we'll see lower fourth quarter share count versus the full year, which will carry us into 2024. And then we'll have the incremental benefit of the $2 billion program that we'll complete in the first and then advance shares new share takeout as well. So we see a nice EPS benefit that we've seen as we took shares out throughout 2023. The headwinds, though, are, I think we will continue to see the industrial destock impact the water and safety businesses primarily in the first quarter. So that will be a headwind to the first quarter. We will see most likely some price modernization or get back primarily in the shelter business as I had mentioned. So we'll try and maintain that as long as we can, but we will be cognizant of potential share loss and potentially has to be giving some back there. And then just we have taken some aggressive actions on the compensation side in 2023. So we are paying a below-target variable compensation payout this year, and so we would most likely see normalization of that as we head into 2024. And so those are the big puts and takes with the one extra exception from a below-the-line perspective around interest income. So we did see about $145 million of interest income this year just as we held the proceeds from the Celanese transaction in the first half before we could deploy them to Spectrum and then the full share repurchase program. So we would see a step down in 2024 from interest income from about $145 million this year to probably $20 million next year."

            "name": "Ed Breen",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2023 financial review. This morning, we announced third quarter results, and delivered solid earnings accomplished through strong operating execution by our teams despite ongoing volume headwinds, including channel inventory destocking and continued weak demand in China. We reported sequential operating EBITDA growth of 5% and margin improvement of 140 basis points in the third quarter. We also produced strong cash flow during the quarter, with adjusted free cash flow almost 50% higher than the year ago period, highlighting our efforts to prioritize working capital improvement in a challenging global business environment and normalizing after last year's global supply chain difficulties, compared to third quarter of 2022 organic revenue declined 10% due primarily to the impact of incremental channel inventory destocking, along with lower volumes from semiconductor and construction end markets. Within our electronics portfolio, our Interconnect Solutions business recorded a second straight quarter of sequential sales lift as underlying demand improvement and normal seasonality contributed to an 8% sales increase. We also saw signs of stabilization with the semiconductor markets and expect some sequential sales improvement from semiconductor technologies in the fourth quarter. Third quarter volume was lower than expected, primarily due to incremental channel inventory destocking, including with our distributor customers, which was evident in the Water Solutions and Safety Solutions lines of business. In this environment, we remain focused on controlling discretionary spending and are also planning additional restructuring actions to continue to ensure we can drive sound operational and financial performance, targeting at least $150 million in annualized run rate cost savings, which we expected we would see later in the first quarter of 2024. It's always difficult to precisely time market inflections, but current industry forecast within electronic submarkets going to recovery by 2024. This includes forecast for PC shipments to grow mid-single-digits, driven by replacement demand, smartphone shipment growth in the mid-single-digits, also driven by replacement demand, and new product launches, and for server demand to gradually improve next year. This growth is supported by the rapid surge in demand for AI servers as well as replacement for traditional servers. In general, demand for high-performance and high-density memory chips is accelerating, supported by AI growth, as well as overall growth for new mobile product launches. This directly correlates with DuPont's product strengths within the semiconductor and consumer electronics markets. Despite the near-term headwinds we are experiencing, we are confident that our key end markets are well-positioned for long-term growth, and we expect these structurally attractive markets will provide the foundation for DuPont's value creation looking ahead. Turning to Slide 4. We significantly advanced our strategic and capital allocation priorities during the quarter to drive shareholder value. First, we closed the acquisition of Spectrum on August 1, which fits nicely alongside our Liveo health care-related product line within our Industrial Solutions line of business with E&I. We are pleased with Spectrum's operating results to-date, which are aligned with our modeled estimates. We are excited to welcome the Spectrum team, which is currently focused on executing new revenue growth opportunities stemming from significant customer wins earlier in the year. Second, I am pleased to announce that we are in the process of closing today the previously announced sale of our roughly 80% ownership interest in the Delrin business, the remaining piece of the former M&M segment held for sale to the private equity firm, TJC, and a transaction value in the business at $1.8 billion. This deal was structured to maximize value for our shareholders. It provides significant upfront cash proceeds with minimal expected tax impact, which can then be deployed in line with our strategic priorities. It also provides an opportunity for us to participate in future upside returns upon the exit of our retained interest in Delrin. TJC has an excellent track record of creating value, and we look forward to leveraging their talent and focus to continue to grow the high-quality Delrin business. Regarding share repurchases, in September, we completed the $3.25 billion accelerated share repurchase transaction launched last November. We then launched a new $2 billion ASR, which we expect to complete during the first quarter of 2024. Combined these two ASR transactions, we have repurchased approximately 15% of our outstanding shares when complete, reflecting our continued commitment to returning capital to shareholders as part of our balanced financial policy. Including these ASRs and the proceeds from the Delrin sale, we anticipate finishing the year close to our target net leverage ratio of about 2.1 times. Further, we anticipate using a significant portion of excess cash during 2024 for incremental share repurchases once the ASR is complete. With that, I'll turn it over to Lori. Yes, Jeff, so we did a pretty detailed analysis of it. And I think a good way to look at it is, what is our distributor customer's doing versus our direct end customers. So maybe just to give you a couple of numbers on the W&P side of our business, about 50% of our volume goes through distribution and the other 50% we sell direct to customers. And so we did a whole analysis, obviously, because the distributors, you can see quick what's going on with them and almost across the board, the distributor network is destocking pretty broadly. And it's, on a percentage basis, down significantly more than our direct customers. So just one because it hit us this quarter, our water business in China, which is mostly reverse osmosis, was down as 36% of it goes through distribution, the rest we sell direct to customers. But a third of our sales that go through distributors in China, it was down 36%, through distribution was down about 12% direct to the customer base. So, if you do that analysis in our safety business, you get very similar trends going on. So, clearly, the distributors are going through a destock. And I'm sure as we're approaching year-end, everyone is trying to get their inventories kind of where they want them. Now, by the way, having said that, my take is that the destock obviously goes into the first quarter if we just started to see it in some of these W&P businesses. But I would think the distributors work it down fairly quickly after we're kind of exiting the first quarter. But that same trend applies almost across the board when you do that analysis. It's the distributors are way down vis-a\u0300-vis the direct customer channel. Yes. So, on an annual basis, Jeff, we'll be about $150 million of savings, kind of spread between plant fixed costs and functional costs or mostly G&A expense, not touching R&D at all. And by the way, just to back up on that. Lori and I have been looking at this kind of how we can do some restructuring for over a year. So, we're not doing it just in response to what's going on. I think I would have said on other earnings calls, we started looking at it actually a summer ago how could we streamline a little bit more. So, we're ready with that. We'll start seeing the benefits on the restructuring in the - towards the tail end of first quarter. We'll get going on it by the middle of December. So, by time it hits, we get things going, and you'll start to see the benefit then. So, you'll kind of get three quarters of the benefit for a big chunk of that in 2024. A little bit of that would potentially come back on the fixed costs - the plant fixed cost side as volumes pick up, but not all of it. So, you'll get a little bit of it coming back in as we see the volumes lift, but that's basically the program. Thanks. Hi Scott. Yes. Scott, I'd just give you a ballpark in my thinking. I think two-thirds of it, or 75%, something like that is really that the supply chain healed itself. It's pretty darn normal for everybody again. So everyone sat on excess inventory. I mean, look, we're doing the same thing. We had 151% cash conversion. We're lowering our inventory levels because we have built up more than what normally would during COVID, and every other CEO I talk to is doing the same thing. And by the way, I think as the pressure you're getting near the end of your year, you're really trying to get things in line for 2024. So I think a big part of it is that. But there's certainly as a percent of people just more worried is there a recession coming. You got an inverted yield curve for 18 months. People start getting nervous. There's always been a recession. So I can't say that's not - if that's in there. But I think the bigger part of it is we just all build excess inventory. We got what we can get during COVID. And probably I'll give you one example because we're seeing some destocking on the metal packaging side. A year ago, I had most of the CEOs of the medical device companies personally call me, pleading that we could ship more Tyvek material for packaging so they could shift their products out. And I remember telling them all, in fact, I sent a letter to the trade industry. I said our shipments to you are up 18% so far this year. I mean, I can't do much more. And that was everyone scrambling to get it and then they overshot. And now I probably shouldn't be surprised we're seeing some destocking on the medical packaging side. So I think that's just a great example. That has nothing to do with the recession, that's just everyone had too much. Yes. Scott, I don't think 2024 will be what you'd consider a normal year. In a normal environment, a few years in a row just normal things, which we haven't had in four years for anybody, I would - we would always get like 1.5% to 2% price lift in the W&P business. Our goal in 2024 is to hold on to as much pricing as we can. And you, obviously, see us and others were getting benefit from price/cost spread that we saw in the third quarter, which helped us out. We'll obviously see it in the fourth quarter. So our goal is to really manage that well for 2024 because there's still quite a bit there. Now we're not going to get all the costs back by renegotiating contracts. Everyone's trying to hold price of our vendors are trying to hold it too. But we're still up to about $225 million that we've gotten back that we - so I mean, that's pretty significant for us. And so we're hoping to hold that for next year. My gut is we're going to give up some pricing in the shelter business, because we don't want to lose market share. But a lot of the other businesses will really be managing that tightly. But then if we ever get - we get back to normal time, hopefully, 2025, we would look at that 1.5% to 2% price increase. And then electronics, we just try to hold about flat. And usually, we're flat to down 1%, but you get nice volume lift. Yes, Scott. Happy talking to you. Thank you. Good morning. Yes, yes. I think the first quarter, Steve, to your comment, will be light, more similar to the fourth quarter because I don't think the destock will end, but back quick, but the distributors will move very fast. They stop ordering it for a while. They literally - we've talked directly to them and they're like, just don't ship me something for a few months, and then we'll be back on track. So yes, I think the first quarter will be on the light side, but I think after that, we'll see some nice lift. I would certainly by then, the electronics part of our business, which you know is highly profitable, I think will be back to a really nice lift. Just on the semi side, the fabs are running a little below 70% utilization. I think if you do the math on what the industry is thinking, they're going to kind of get up as the year goes more to 80% utilization the following year, more like the 90% where you would run at. So you'll start to see some - on a percentage basis, some pretty nice lift. And then we've had two quarters in a row of ICS lifting. So it's clearly off the bottom. That will, I think, continue to grow as we go through next year. So I think you're kind of through the electronics one, although we're kind of now doing a destock on the W&P side. And remember, we're mostly short cycle, so we'll see it first. And then, I think, by the second quarter, you'll see a lot of that destock over with, and you'll see the volume lift. I'm trying to - one foot in, yes. I've been there for a while, by the way. I track a lot of economic indicators, as I said earlier, when you see the yield curve where it's been and all, there's always been a recession. So, I like to manage, I guess, conservatively. So, I've been telling the team for a long time, just prepare for a softer environment. And if we're wrong, great, we'll have done all the right actions to position ourselves. But yes, I think there was this quarter just reading all the results from companies I saw, they were pretty mixed. And people are mostly missing on the volume not on their EBITDA. Okay Steve. Good morning. Yes. So, we liked it. Look, we sold Delrin in a tougher environment than when we sold the rest of M&M. So, this optimized what we could get for the asset over a few year period. We're getting $1.2 some billion upfront. We're writing 20% equity in it. TJC has a phenomenal track record. So, my gut is we have some nice upside coming from the retained interest that we have in the business, that's to be proved out, but I'm highly confident in that. It is a good business. It should do well over the next few years. So, we think that optimizes our position. So, we sold it at $1.8 billion in value. My gut is we can end up nicely above that with the equity that we have. So, - and by the way, it just goes to our whole capital allocation strategy. It was not a business we wanted to be in long-term, even though it's a good business. We're taking the volatility out of the portfolio and we'll redeploy that cash. And as we said in our prepared remarks, we will actually do more share repurchase after the ASR ends next year because we're in a great balance sheet position and we'll have good free cash flow, and we plan on buying back more shares. Yes. So semi will lift a little bit. So I would still say bounce along the bottom, but getting through the destock. And when I say a little bit, a few percentage points sequentially up in the business. The ICS business will be down some, but that's all seasonality. If you look at it just the normal drop you see in seasonality, it's less. So the business continues maybe a few more points to improve after the last two quarters of improvement. So kind of less seasonality because the business is recovering. And then on the industrial part of E&I, we'll definitely see a little bit of destocking there. The biopharma destocking, which is in that business picked up some during the quarter. So I expect that to continue into the fourth quarter and hopefully be kind of done by them with that. And there's just a little bit of other destocking going along with some of our distributors in that business. So nothing significant, but I think that will see a little bit of softness. Yes. So we - the date that's coming up here is the deadline for the opt-outs is December 4. And then we will see a list of who the opt-outs are on December 6. And then there's a final fairness hearing in South Carolina on December 14. So it's all kind of happening that first two weeks of December. And I really can't add any other color. I just don't have any other facts in front of me. We're feeling obviously very good about it, and highly confident that this will get signed off and get done. And I'd just add, obviously, people are talking to the key water districts around the country. So we're feeling good, and hopefully, we're close to getting that cemented. Yes, thanks. Good morning. For the year. Well, the fabs have been - to your point, have been running kind of if you lump them all together. I think you would average out in the high 60s. And I think if you go through all the projections out there and also talking to our customers, that high 60s is going to ramp through 2024, up to - by the time you get maybe in the third quarter, beginning the fourth quarter up to maybe a little over 80%. So you still won't be back according to projections to kind of over 90% till you enter into 2025. But again, going from high 60s to 80% is a nice lift during the year. And then more of that production will be advanced nodes, which back to Lori's point a minute ago, plays to our strength that's usually why we outgrow 200- to 300-basis-point what the market is doing. But it's also - by the way, you also got to look customer by customer on the semi side because some are still - we're shipping out of inventory. But all the signs I saw from all their reporting publicly, they've seen their bottom, it looks like, pretty much across the board. But I don't think the lift will be dramatic in the - at the beginning of the year. But I think as the year sequences, we'll see nice lift occurring in that business. Yes, thanks. Yes. I don't think it's - I really think it's just - we all overbuild inventory. Direct vendors and distributors through the COVID period, I mean we all talked about it. And I go back to my example on the medical packaging side. The customers were just yelling for us to get more to them. And usually, when that happens, you see an overshoot happen, and some of them probably even double order. I've been through that before in my career, and then you get the snap back. So I think that's what we're going through is that they're adjusting their inventory back to appropriate levels. They don't have to worry about carrying excess inventory because supply chains are normalized again. And again, we're doing the same thing. We're feeling confident about being able to get supply of all our different components. And so we're working our inventory levels down from what were elevated levels because of the COVID stuff. So I don't think that you'll have to worry about different terms or anything with our distributors. Good morning, Frank. Good, good. Well, I will go, Frank, more high level. I think a lot of the growth we'll get will allow the semiconductor business - again, once we get through the downturn here and all that, that this business can grow kind of mid- to high-single-digit, which, by the way, it was doing before all the destock hit. Again, if the market grows 5 to 6 to 7 points, we'll grow 200 to 300 basis points above that. And that 200 to 300 basis points is mostly because of that high-end ship, because of AI enablement and all that and that plays to our sweet spot. So that's how we get that outsized growth usually over the market and AI plays right into that. Thanks, Frank."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DuPont Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Chris Mecray, you may now begin your conference.\nChris Mecray: Good morning. And thank you for joining us for DuPont's second quarter 2023 financial results conference call. Joining me today are Ed Breen, Chief Executive Officer; and Lori Koch, Chief Financial Officer. We have prepared slides to supplement our remarks, which are posted on DuPont's website under the Investor Relations tab and through the webcast link. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the slides. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements.

A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in our press release and presentation materials that have been posted to DuPont's Investor Relations website. I'll now turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Breen: Good morning. And thank you for joining our second quarter 2023 financial review. This morning, we announced quarterly results with revenue and operating EBITDA better than our previously communicated guidance. This performance reflects our team's ongoing strong execution, while facing continued volume pressure and consumer-driven end markets, mainly electronics. In the second quarter, organic revenue declined 4% versus the year ago period despite mid-teens organic declines from the Interconnect Solutions and Semiconductor lines of business within E&I. We continue to see broad demand strength in industrial end markets, including water, automotive, aerospace, as well as healthcare, along with continued carryover benefit of pricing actions taken last year to offset inflationary pressure. Notably, operating EBITDA, operating EBITDA margin and adjusted EPS were all up sequentially from first quarter. After nearly a year long downturn, we also saw a sequential sales lift in Interconnect Solutions of 7%. We also continue to be proactive in taking additional actions within our control to minimize the impact of volume declines given near-term slowdown in select end markets, while also focusing on optimizing cash generation. Turning to Slide 4. We continue to advance a number of strategic priorities for accretive and value-added capital deployment. Yesterday, we announced completion of the Spectrum acquisition, a leader in critical specialty devices for healthcare end markets. This acquisition fully aligns with our strategic objectives of increasing topline growth through customer-driven innovation and expanding our Industrial Technologies growth pillar, while adding to our current offerings in the high-growth healthcare market. Spectrum is being integrated into our Industrial Solutions line of business where it fits nicely with our existing Liveo franchise with annual sales of about $500 million, Spectrum together with Liveo and our Tyvek Healthcare Packaging business increases our total revenue in healthcare markets to about 10% of our portfolio with expected growth rates above the company average. Spectrum's year-to-date performance has been solid, and we are pleased that operating results are in line with our deal model estimates, which include an estimated operating EBITDA margin of approximately 22%. We are excited by Spectrum's complementary fit and specifically our ability to leverage incremental growth opportunities, including synergies from cross-selling and the complementary accounts new and faster product development and deeper design and co-development partnerships with OEMs. Further on M&A, we continue to make progress with our Delrin business divestiture and our expectation of closing this planned transaction around year-end 2023 remains unchanged. There has been good interest in the asset to date. Regarding share repurchases, we expect we will complete the $3.25 billion accelerated share repurchase transaction launched last November within a month. We also intend to complete our remaining authorization through a new $2 billion ASR to be executed shortly thereafter. Regarding the water district settlement that was announced in June jointly with Chemours and Corteva, this settlement comprehensively covers PFAS-related claims of public water systems starting the vast majority of the US population. Our portion of the settlement is about $400 million, and we expect final approval about six months following preliminary approval, which we expect to receive shortly. Regarding broader capital allocation goals, yesterday's closing of the Spectrum deal and the new $2 billion ASR essentially completes the deployment of excess cash remaining from the M&M divestiture last November. Our current capitalization remains very sound. And as a reminder, we have no significant debt maturities until November 2025. We are comfortable with a net leverage point around 2x as an equilibrium target going forward. Before I turn it over to Lori to review our financial performance, let me add that we remain excited about the visible growth drivers enabled by our technical innovation teams and application engineers who are squarely focused on helping customers solve their most complex challenges. To name just a few, strong growth is expected in the semiconductor industry with the ongoing global investment in new fabs. Overall growth of the semiconductor industry is anticipated to be high single-digits over the coming five-year period. We have the leading materials that enable the next generation of advanced chip manufacturing and packaging, which includes significant technology and support from the emerging generative AI revolution. Within water, we continue to drive growth in desalination and which order markets and then helping customers achieve their sustainability goals. Finally, our auto adhesives business is well positioned to continue to capture growth with its product offerings and electric vehicles. With that, I'll turn it over to Lori.\nLori Koch: Thanks, Ed, and good morning. Our focus remains on operational excellence and strong execution, and we are pleased to have delivered financial results ahead of expectations despite volume pressure in some of our most profitable lines of business in electronics. Turning to our financial highlights on Slide 5. Second quarter net sales of $3.1 billion decreased 7% as reported and 4% on an organic basis versus the year ago period. Currency results in a 1% headwind from dollar strength against key currencies most notably the won and yen, and we also saw a 2% headwind related to portfolio changes. Breaking down the 4% organic sales decline, a 6% volume decline was partially offset by a 2% pricing gain reflecting continued carryover benefit of actions taken last year to offset broad-based inflation. Volume decline primarily reflects continued demand weakness in consumer electronics coupled with inventory destocking across the channel and some softness, including destocking in North American construction related markets. Lower volume in these consumer turbine end markets was partially mitigated by continued strength in water, automotive, aerospace and healthcare markets. Volume within electronics and construction end markets during the quarter was down 15 the year ago period, while our remaining industrial-based businesses were up about 4%. From a regional perspective, Europe sales in the quarter were up 4% on an organic basis, while North America and Asia Pacific were down 3% and 8%, respectively versus the year ago period. China sales were down 14% on an organic basis, driven mainly by the electronics demand weakness, but increased sequentially versus the first quarter. Second quarter operating EBITDA of $738 million decreased 11% versus the year ago period, driven by lower volumes and the impact of reduced production rates in electronics as we align inventory with demand. Operating EBITDA margin during the quarter of 23.9% was down 110 basis points versus the year ago period, driven by volume pressure, reduced production rates and mix headwinds in the high margin steady business. On a sequential basis, operating EBITDA and operating EBITDA margins were up from the first quarter. Decremental margins for the quarter was 40%, excluding the impact of absorption headwinds related to reduced production rates within electronics, decremental margin was below 20%, enabled by aggressive actions taken year-to-date to reduce discretionary spend. Adjusted EPS in the quarter of $0.85 per share was down 3% versus last year, which I will detail shortly. Looking at cash performance. I would first like to highlight that we have made a reporting change effective with today's second quarter results and are now providing cash flow disclosure separated between continuing and discontinued operations. This change is being made to improve visibility into cash flow generation and cash flow conversion of the ongoing businesses. On a continuing operations basis, cash flow from operations during the quarter of $400 million less CapEx of $123 million resulted in adjusted free cash flow of $277 million and associated conversion of 73%. This reflects significant improvement versus last year on a comparable basis, driven by lower inventory. Adjusted free cash flow included a benefit of about $80 million in reduced inventory and a headwind of about $200 million related to interest payments. Optimizing cash flow continues to be a top priority for us. On adjusted free cash flow and conversion improved sequentially, we still have work to do to get to our target levels and expect further improvement in working capital metrics by year-end. Turning to Slide 6. Adjusted EPS for the quarter of $0.85 decreased 3% compared to $0.88 in the in the year ago period. Lower segment results more than offset below the line benefits, including a $0.19 benefit related to lower net interest expense and a lower share count. A higher tax rate and exchange loss during the quarter resulted in adjusted EPS headwind of $0.08 per share. Our tax rate for the quarter was 23.7%, up from 22.6% in the year-ago period, driven primarily by geographic mix of earnings. Turning to segment results, beginning with E&I on Slide 7. E&I second quarter net sales of $1.3 billion decreased 14% and organic sales declined 12% due to lower volume, along with currency headwinds and an unfavorable portfolio impact of 1% each. At the line of business level, volume for Semiconductor Technologies decreased 19%, while Interconnect Solutions volume decreased 15% versus the year ago period. The decline in Semi Tech resulted from a continuation of lower semiconductor fab utilization rate due to weak end market demand as well as inventory de-stocking across the channel. Chip fab utilization rates in the second quarter averaged in the low 70s on a percentage basis. The decline in Interconnect was driven by continued weak smartphones, PC and tablet demand along with channel inventory destocking. Our PCB customers in China offerings in the second quarter with utilization rates slightly improved from the mid-40s during the first quarter, which was a cycle low. The PCB market has been in a slowdown for a year now and we are beginning to see signs of improvement within our Interconnect business, illustrated by first and second quarter sequential growth of about 7% and with further expected sequential growth in the third quarter. Sales for Industrial Solutions were flat on an organic basis as pricing and ongoing strength in broad-based industrial markets were offset by lower demand in largely consumer-driven areas, such as advanced screening applications and those tied to electronics markets, including OLED display. Operating EBITDA for E&I of $349 million was down versus the year ago period primarily due to volume declines and lower operating rates to better align inventory with demand, partially offset by reduced discretionary spend. Turning to Slide 8. W&P's second quarter net sales of $1.5 billion were flat versus last year as organic sales growth of 1% was offset by a 1% currency headwinds. Organic growth of 1% reflects a 5% increase in price resulting from the carryover impact of pricing actions taken last year, mostly offset by a 4% decrease in segment volumes due to declines in shelf care solutions. At the line of business level, organic sales growth was led by Water Solutions, which was up mid-teens on continued demand growth for water filtration led by reverse osmosis and ion exchange resins, along with benefits from carryover pricing. IT Solutions sales were up mid-single digits on an organic basis driven by carryover pricing and volume strength in Kevlar and Nomex with an aerospace and automotive market, especially for EVs, coupled with Tyvek strength in health care. Shelter Solutions were down 12% on an organic basis, driven by demand softness in construction markets as well as de-stocking, although we do expect a reduced impact from de-stocking in the second half. Operating EBITDA for W&P during the quarter were $368 million, up 6% or operating EBITDA margin of 24.6%, increased 140 basis points versus the year ago period. The improvement resulted primarily from net pricing gains and disciplined cost control, which more than offset volume declines. Turning to Slide 9, I will close with a few comments on our outlook and guidance for the third quarter and full year 2023. Regarding the demand environment, we continue to expect fairly steady demand in most of our industrial end-markets within E&I and W&P although, we expect sales moderation in our Water business due to slower demand in China. Within Electronics, we saw stabilization and some early lift in our Interconnect Solutions business. The 7% sequential improvement in sales during the second quarter, and we expect mid-single-digit sequential growth to follow, in the third quarter. We believe, challenging markets likely bottom during the second quarter, and we assume net-net sales in the second half will improve slightly on a sequential basis. Given ongoing consumer electronics demand headwinds, notably in China, we have tempered the rate of second half growth to prior assumptions. We are adjusting our full year 2023 guidance to account for the slower cadence of recovery in electronics, including our actions to continue to reduce production to align inventory with demand. In addition, our third quarter and full year guidance now includes the estimated contribution from Spectrum beginning August 1. For the full year, we now expect net sales to be between $12.45 billion and $12.55 billion, operating EBITDA to be between $2.975 billion and $3.025 billion and adjusted EPS to be between $3.40 and $3.50 per share. For the third quarter 2023, we expect revenue of approximately $3.15 billion, operating EBITDA of approximately $755 million and adjusted EPS of approximately $0.84 per share. With that, we are pleased to take your questions, and let me turn it back to the operator to open the\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nBhavesh Lodaya: Hi. Good morning. This is Bhavesh Lodaya for John. Maybe on the Water business, the Water business tends to be a bit less cyclical compared to your other businesses. Can you add some color on what is driving the softness in China? What changed there since maybe last quarter? And what kind of recovery do you expect maybe over the next couple of quarters?\nEd Breen: Yeah. We think the next couple of quarters or just a little bit later will be closed in China, and it's really slowness in the industrial economy in China right now, which obviously should rebound here at some point, but we're expecting that to be a little softer in the second half of the year that, by the way, that's growth that we've had in that business is double-digit growth. So we're just saying it's going to moderate some still growth, but just slower growth in the second half of the year. But as that business has done quarter in, quarter out. It grows at a pretty nice clip, and I expect this China to improve some. That growth rate will pick up also. Remember, 70% of that business is a renewable business that's steady. So I think a couple of quarters maybe a little later in China, is what we're seeing.\nBhavesh Lodaya: Got it. And then in Electronics great to see the inflection coming in Interconnect Solutions, we have also seen some positive MSI data points. What are you hearing in semis technologies? Like, when do you expect an inflection there? And maybe any color on your order books for electronics that you're seeing this quarter so far?\nEd Breen: Yeah. So just probably just back to the ICS one, that started to decline and destocking started about the middle of 2022. So it's almost been kind of 10 months that in a downturn in the first quarter, it was really one at the bottomed. And then we did see 7% sequential pickup, and we're expecting mid-single-digit pickup by the forecast we had for the third quarter. So obviously, that's starting to come nicely off the bottom. The semi 1 is the one we tempered a little more in the second half. We look like we hit the bottom in the second quarter. We're not gauging much upturn in the third quarter. Instead, we're assuming we have another quarter kind of near the bottom are just very slightly up from that. And then we think somewhere the inflection point is more in the fourth quarter, but it's hard to tell what month you actually see it. So we did pick it up a little bit in the forecast in the fourth quarter, but not significantly. So that's the thing we kind of tapped down when we gave you the guidance here today. But I think we've seen the bottom in semi, and we're seeing the lift begin in ICS now. Remember, ICS is still negative. As a way to come back still, but it was down over 20%, and we're starting to write it back. Those will still be negative in the third and fourth quarter on a year-over-year compare.\nBhavesh Lodaya: Appreciate the time. Thank you.\nEd Breen: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Christopher Parkinson from Mizuho Securities.\nChristopher Parkinson: Great. Thank you, so much. If we could circle back very quickly to the ICS side, there's been a bit of a difference between how China handset sales have been trending of late versus the rest of the Western world in terms of how to think about that I'd love some comments on how to think about that into the second half of the year, as well as you do have a few customers with some potential new launches in the second half. So just in terms of the normalization process, it would be very helpful to get some commentary on how to think about that as it turns more into the second half, but probably more importantly, even based on kind of the renewed, I'd say, much lower bar than we've seen in the past, let's say, 1.5 years or so? Thank you.\nEd Breen: Yeah. Let me comment, and I'll turn it to Lori by just - I don't want to say customer names, but we're in good shape this year on the new models being introduced by a couple of the large cell phone players. So from a market share standpoint, we know which phones we're in, and we're in a better position than we were last year, not that we were in a bad position at all last year. But we feel like we're in a good position with the launch of the new models coming in. We know what we're in, in those phones. And by way, clearly, one of the things I think you all know we're in is the Kapton technology for the 5G antenna is a key component for us, along with some other components, but that's a key one. Lori, do you want to just talk about the timing?\nLori Koch: Yeah. On the smartphone and broadly, the consumer electronics recovery. That was part of the revision that we had in the second half. So our original expectations on a full year basis for smartphones would be down about 1% and PCs down about 7%. We revised expectations on each of those end markets along with the industry forecast for smartphone sound to be more in the 5% range in PC is supposed to be low double digit. So - but that does embed year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. So it sounds like one more quarter of year-over-year down in the third quarter and then recovery that's worth into the more normal market and most likely setting up for a strong 2024, those markets are in maybe through the destock and returning to more of a normal demand in growth.\nChristopher Parkinson: That's very helpful. And just as a very quick follow-up, just on the W&P side. You've seen some very, very solid growth out of Water Solutions, but you did have some comments as it pertains to the kind of the second half based on some fairly difficult comps to my understanding. Can you sit on kind of what's the outlook for this business? Just - is that just - is your commentary solely a function of just the difficult comps and you'd expect kind of a reacceleration in 2024? But if you could just hit on that kind of cadence and how we should be continuously thinking about that business in the long term? That would be very helpful. Thank you.\nEd Breen: Yes. I think the way to look at that, that business is consistent, it is choppy, some quarters. We have a big installation we're doing and all that. So it's not going to be every single quarter. But generally, that business grows kind of mid to high single digits pretty consistently. And this past quarter, we had even a better quarter the not on the growth rate. But again, it can be lumpy. But when you kind of smooth out the whole year, I think that's the way to look at it kind of in that 6% to 8% growth range when you smooth out the year. And look, I expect China activity will pick up. It's hard to tell if there's a little bit of excess inventory also that is part of it, but we're again expecting a couple of just lighter quarters. But I think quarters with growth in the third quarter, but just lighter than we had in the second quarter. And I think, again, it's a consistent business. And it has been since we've had it. So I don't expect it to continue to grow in that range.\nLori Koch: And to Ed's comment on the lumpiness, if you put a 2 year stack on the volume, we're up high single digits every quarter. So there is lumpiness of it comments around sometimes the projects work going on. But in general, it's really strong growth for us. And there's no change in our go-forward forecast, especially with the requirements that are going on around sustainability and the access to those are the key growth drivers for us.\nEd Breen: And then the key here is there's a replacement business that's 70% of the business. So that adds to the consistency of it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Roberts from Credit Suisse.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you. Ed, is it fair to say that Delrin will be a private equity transaction? It would seem to be hard for a strategic to do a closing by year-end at this point?\nEd Breen: Yes. We're pretty confident we'll close it by year-end. I would just say private equity has been interested along with strategic, but I don't want to get into any more than that at this point in time. But I think we're highly confident we'll have a deal. There's been nice interest in it.\nJohn Roberts: And then secondly, there is been some challenges to the 3M PFAS settlement. Are you anticipating having to go through a similar process with your settlement?\nEd Breen: Yes. John, what happened here was very typical of these bigger type of settlements that have to these class actions. If you go back and look at any of the other big ones, you always get that, I think, what you're referring to is the challenge from state AGs and all that. I don't think by what we're hearing that there's going to be a problem here we're thinking in the very near future, we get preliminary approval from the judge, and as we said in our prepared remarks, it will be about six months after that preliminary approval from the judge where we would then be finished with that and make the payment.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.\nSteve Tusa: Hi, good morning.\nEd Breen: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Can you just give us a bit of an update on the -- I know these businesses aren't the most raw material centric anymore, but maybe just a bit of an update on the raw material outlook for this year. I'm not sure if you called it out in the beginning of the call, the $100 million you were talking about before?\nLori Koch: Yeah. So that was a net headwind between price and raws. So we did increase that to about $140 million from our view of $100 million. So we have seen a step up and we expect to benefit from deflation. To remind you, it was around $800 million last year of a headwind that we saw and we've got obviously a fair bit of room to go to get all of that money back, but we're making really nice progress. Initially, a lot of the deflation is coming from the energy and logistics side. You can see what the natural gas prices have gone from the peaks that we bought in the third quarter of last year and the stabilization in the supply chain. We're seeing nice improvement in logistics. So the one piece that we're working through is just the timing of when that falls through the P&L. So we actually in the first quarter, predominantly, a little bit in the second quarter, we actually saw some headwinds from the carryover from the escalation 2022 from a P&L perspective. And as we head into the back half of the year, we'll start to see those benefits that we've been getting from a procurement perspective drop into the P&L.\nEd Breen: Yes, Steve, it kind of takes four to five months on the raws to work its way through in our system and we build a customer. So some of this, we're obviously going to see now in 2024 but the procurement team has been working very aggressively and Lori and I meet with a very consistent basis because it's a big part of seeing up on 2024 for us. And by the way, Steve, just as a side note, the margins on the E&I, remember, not much of the walls were in E&I, we only raised prices 2% there. The predominant part of it is going to become in W&P. And the thing that affected the margins in E&I is really the absorption charge that we've taken. We we're going to take it again in the third quarter, we're probably going to take it in the fourth quarter, just to make sure everything is teed up for 2024, and that's affected our - or like in the third - in the second quarter that affected our margins in E&I by about 400 basis points. So without the absorption, we know we're running that business north of 30, even in a reduced volume environment. So I feel very confident you all watched us run that in a 32%, 33% EBITDA range. I'm very comfortable when I look at our math that we're in good shape there as we rebound.\nSteve Tusa: And is there any risk around anything you're seeing in pricing in W&P that when you look out to the second half or into next year, any aggression on pricing in those businesses?\nEd Breen: So very small. The one area we're going to give up some price that we forecasted in the second half of the year is in the construction-related markets. We also had to raise very significantly in those markets because of what the raws did last year. So, we've made an assumption in this forecast that we'll give up some of the pricing there. Otherwise, we're feeling pretty solid across the rest of the portfolio.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.\nEd Breen: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you. Ed and Lori, how much did Spectrum add to Q3 and 2023 guidance?\nLori Koch: Yeah. So in total, it will give you about a little north of $200 million in sales at a 22% margin. It's pretty consistent across the months, so you'll take two months of it in the third quarter and then the full three months in the fourth quarter. From an EPS perspective, it's really only about $0.01 on a full year basis once you factor in the loss of the interest income from the cash that we paid for the deal. There's more of an EBITDA function versus an EPS.\nDavid Begleiter: Got it. And then, just on destocking in Shelter, where do you think we are? I know you said you were closely end here or it's moderating? How much further do you think we have to go Shelter Solutions destocking?\nEd Breen: I think it's mostly done destocking by the end of this third quarter. And that's talking to a couple of our key distributors and customers. One of the big box guys, by the way, was doing a rebalancing of all, their inventory by moving it around to different stores and regions. That's how we were doing it. And they're pretty much through that process. So I think the end of third quarter, we're kind of there.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you.\nEd Breen: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Leithead from Barclays.\nMike Leithead: Great, thanks. Good morning, guys. First question, your Corporate and Retained business came in a bit better than historically has. Can you just help us unpack what happened this quarter there? And just how that should trend going forward?\nLori Koch: Yes. So we had a really strong growth within Corporate M&M. It was driven by the EV piece, which is the largest segment of it. And it's really from the EV growth in the overall Auto build growth. So Auto build were up about 16% in the second quarter, we would have posted a similar number. And we see really nice performance in the EV piece. So that's what drove the improvement year-over-year primarily.\nMike Leithead: Great. And then second, just on E&I, you talked about reducing production rates to help manage inventory. Do you expect that to still be some degree of drag in the second half to earnings? And then just relatedly, how should we expect working capital to finish out this year?\nEd Breen: Yes. No, we're definitely going to take the absorption this quarter. We're in the third quarter, about $40 million and the same in the fourth quarter as our plan. So we're really getting inventory aligned up very well with demand. So we just feel it's the prudent thing to do right now. So that's what's baked into the plan that we've given here today.\nLori Koch: Yeah, we saw a nice improvement in inventory in the second quarter, about $80 million of a reduction. We'll look to continue to drive that down as we get into the end of the year. We had an improvement sequentially in both cash generation and cash conversion. We'll look to continue to improve that as we get into the back half of the year. Our third quarter is typically our strongest quarter for cash generation, because we don't have an interest payment which we have in the second and the fourth quarter, which we pay our annual bonus in the first quarter. So the third quarter is the clean end from that perspective. And just the notes, that I had mentioned on the script just to make sure that you caught it, we will move to a continuing ops basis presentation in cash flow. So we'll take out all the noise from the discontinued ops components, which are primarily in this year, the funding of the escrow account, which will take place at some point in the second half and then the funding of the other end-of-use items. So, we will pull that out and just kind of, focus on continuing makes fast generation.\nMike Leithead: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Josh Spector from UBS.\nJosh Spector: Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, first, I wanted to ask on the 3Q guidance. So if we look at organic sales and EBITDA, you're kind of guiding flat sequentially but you're talking about ICS up mid-single digits. It sounds like raw materials could be a little bit better with health. Typically with ICS up, you get a mix benefit there. So what drives that flat EBITDA? What are some of the offsetting items that would keep EBITDA flat versus having it up sequentially on an organic basis?\nLori Koch: Yeah. So the three biggest items that we had mentioned, first being the water deceleration. So we see some moderation in water as we get into the back half of the year, coming off of a really strong quarter in the second quarter. We had also mentioned that we expect to have to get back some price primarily in the Shelter business within water. And then the third, probably smallest piece but something we're raising was we do see some small destocking within biopharma. So it's been pretty well telegraphed across some of the other players, and we are starting to see that a little bit within our video business and the Industrial Solution business in Shanghai.\nJosh Spector: Okay. That's helpful. And I guess when I think about ICS, a look into 2024, so I haven't done the full math, but maybe organic, you're down something like 10% this year. I guess when we look at smartphone growth, PC growth, there's not a massive inflection next year. There's better growth forecasted, maybe low-single-digits. I guess, how do you think about that ICS business performing relative to that? Do we overbuild some inventory so we don't get the full bounce back? Or do you expect it stronger? If you could frame that, that would be helpful. Thanks.\nLori Koch: Yeah. I mean it's kind of hard to say at this point how the restocking potentially could happen in those two spaces. We would expect it to perform nicely alongside the market. The one tailwind that will happen for us in a year-over-year perspective on EBITDA, we won't have those absorption headwinds that we had in 2022. So the predominance of those absorption happens for reasons within both ICS and semis those create a tailwind for us as we head into 2023.\nJosh Spector: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.\nVincent Andrews: Thank you and good morning, Wondering if you can speak just a little bit about the cost work you've been doing kind of past president in the future? Just looking at the income statement, I've got SG&A down about $76 million year-to-date, R&D down 32, and then sundry expense down 40. And maybe you can kind of contextualize those decreases and how they play out over the balance of the year and which segments, presumably we're seeing the most and the ones that are having the most macro concerns? And maybe just also remind us what sundry expense actually is?\nLori Koch: Yeah. So the predominance of sundry is really not even in operating EBITDA it's where our interest income comes in. It's also where some gains on asset sales that don't get reported in operating EBITDA or adjusted EPS come in. So it's not really primarily related to our operating investment. There's detail in the queue when that comes out tomorrow about what all of the other specifics are. But that's not really a reflection at all of any of our efforts to control discretionary spend. From that perspective, though, we have been very aggressive on control and the discretionary spend to minimize the decrementals that we've been policing. And I think we've done a nice job doing that. So in the first half, our decrementals as reported were 40%. But if you take out the headwinds from the absorption that we've been driving to reduce inventory were more down in the mid-20s. And so that's really a reflection of the aggressive actions we've taken from both. We did a small restructuring to be able to reduce some headcount primarily in the G&A space. So we're really trying to keep R&D and marketing and sales pretty clean. And then we have been taking some reductions to our annual discretionary consultations or bonus. And so that's what you're seeing more so coming in through the R&D line that would be a use of that. And then on the SG&A line would be the small license that we took to reduce headcount as well as the discretionary spend.\nEd Breen: Yeah. By the way, we're are - we've been tensioning real good is our travel and entertainment budgets. We're trying to keep them. The salespeople are traveling the application engineers, but we're really being sure of holding people, holding management meetings all over the world and all that. So we're just being -- we've really put the word out to our team, hey, while we're in a tougher environment here will come out of it nice, but just watch anything on the discretionary side.\nVincent Andrews: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, Ed, nothing happening presumably on the bolt-on M&A side of the table for the rest of the year or any thoughts there?\nEd Breen: No. No, I don't think you'll see anything obviously, the rest of this year and at least well into next year. I think, I said on the last call, a good year pause. We love where we've got the balance sheet at, as I think Lori mentioned on the call I did -- we're going to have leverage action in here somewhere around 2x. That's where we want to be. And we're in a great spot. And I don't feel like we need to do anything. So we are -- we got to where we need to be.\nVincent Andrews: Great. Excellent. Thanks very much.\nEd Breen: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research.\nFrank Mitsch: Hey. Good morning. Ed, I had the RiverHouse Benedict that Odette's on Sunday. It was very nice. So, congrats on that.\nEd Breen: Thank you. I haven't had it yet.\nFrank Mitsch: You haven't had it yet, I highly recommend it. Hey, following up on the M&A question, Auto Adhesives is still in your corporate line item. When might we expect that to be folded back into the -- into one of the businesses? And/or is that a candidate for divestiture?\nEd Breen: No, it's not a candidate for divestiture. It's very core to us. We like the position we have, especially with the EV opportunity we have. And we're obviously seeing a lot of wins there, and the growth rate has been phenomenal. So we like that business. And by the way, we - I don't think we're going to make any new short-term on pulling it out of there of where we're reporting it at this point in time. We just -- we've got everything run in the way we want. So you won't see anything in the next couple of quarters.\nFrank Mitsch: Okay. Thank you. And then, if I look geographically, I mean Europe has been up year-over-year based on price. What are your thoughts in terms of volume growth in that region?\nLori Koch: Yeah. So volume growth in general in Europe is about flat. I would expect a similar performance as we get into the half of the year. And it's really different and it's been the toughest for us has been Asia Pacific, which we've been highlighting this obvious dominance of it is China The price piece though it will start to wane as we get into the back half of the year. So we saw it kind of cut in half, as we went from Q1 to Q2, and then as we get into - Q3 and Q4 we really - it would be flat to slightly negative, given some of the price that we would have to give back primarily in the Shelter space that we have mentioned.\nFrank Mitsch: Great. Thank you.\nEd Breen: Thanks, Frank.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America.\nSteve Byrne: Yeah. Thank you. The EPA has estimated several thousand water districts that would need to comply with the proposed MCLs. My question for you is Ed you mentioned you think you could get final approval on the settlement in six months or so. Do you need a certain fraction of those water districts to opt in? And can you comment on how that is going? And do you have a view on how they will comply. Do you expect they will mostly use carbon? Or do you think some of them might employee RO or iron exchange your technologies?\nEd Breen: Yeah. So look, we -- there's a percent that have, I'll call it, opt in or we can walk away from the settlement. So by the way, that's a very high percentage, and we think just to get up that, that will not be a problem. Remember, a lot of these water districts have been being talked to by the plaintiff side of this. This hasn't been done in a vacuum. So, it's - they've been talked to along the way here to get to this, what I'll call it preliminary settlement. So I think shortly, as I said, we will get it approved by the judge on a preliminary basis and then you work all the opt-ins to make sure you get that done and then you have final approval once you hit that threshold. So it's really up to each of the difficulty for water districts, how they're going to handle that to clean up any PFAS that's in there. So I don't want to comment on that.\nSteve Byrne: And then you mentioned that 70% of your water business is renewables. I was just curious, what fraction of that are you selling directly to the customer versus going through an intermediary service provider? And do you have an interest in changing that fraction by getting more aggressive in your own sales force?\nLori Koch: I don't see any change in our go-to-market strategy for the province of its direct as we go to the customers the projects in place and we're just replacing the filter, which is where the recurring revenue rate comes from. So this is a -- as we had mentioned earlier on the call, kind of mid to high single-digit grower for us, a lot of opportunities as we go forward around the sustainability and the access to clean water.\nSteve Byrne: Thank you.\nEd Breen: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets.\nArun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about the electronics market here. Could you just elaborate on the destocking, the volume trajectory, I guess, from here. I think previously, you had expected this year to be the main volume negative hit. You'll be facing easier comps next year. Do you think you should grow in kind of, say, the mid-single-digit level for next year? Or where do you expect electronics volumes to be next year? Thanks.\nLori Koch: Yeah. So we as we had mentioned, we believe within ICS that we'll continue to see sequential improvement as we head into Q3. And then I mean a little bit of tentative improvement as we head into Q4. In the semi, we don't see a material bump in sequential sales until we get into the fourth quarter. But definitely, the year-over-year volume headwind. We'll start to ease and we see full year overall E&I organic growth of about 10%. And that's primarily a volume reflecting within that segment. So it's probably a little early to call what 2024 looks like. I think there's a pretty good sense that it would be positive just given that you won't have the destock going on, but even if the demand is flat, which would be hard to see. You don't have that headwind from the destock year-over-year. So we're really encouraged as we head into 2024 from the tailwind that we'll see from out only market recovery and electronics but also the lapping of the absorption headwinds that we've taken this year to control investor. And then, the further benefit from deflation as it fully run through our P&L, are kind of the key components that register.\nArun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks. And just real quickly on the share buyback plans. So you'll be completing the 3.25 very soon. Could you just describe how we should think about the other $2 billion, that you commenced shortly thereafter. Would that be done ratably or how should we think about that? How it flows in? Thanks.\nLori Koch: Yeah. So it will be a similar structure to the first 3.25. I guess we'll complete that within a month, and then shortly thereafter, we'll execute a $2 billion ASR. So you'll get 80% of the shares upfront, and then you'll get the 20% cleanup in the back, and it probably will take us about six months to complete that full program. It's usually about a quarter for every $1 billion of shares that you're taking now.\nArun Viswanathan: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Sison from Wells Fargo.\nMike Sison: Hey. Good morning. In terms of Semi Technologies and Interconnect Solutions, I think historically after a destocking event, you do see some restocking. But given it's taking so long for the destocking to end, how do you think that plays out this time around or is there any differences between the regions on that?\nLori Koch: Yeah. I mean, it's hard to say what everyone is going to do with respect to the restock after coming through such a significant destocking. So we might change their normal pattern just to get every year likewise. So probably a little too early to say what's going to happen from a restocking perspective. I'll think you probably announce year and everyone [Technical Difficulty] stabilization that's happening in the supply chain generally, everybody in that.\nMike Sison: Got it. And then just quick follow-up E&I historically been above 30% for EBITDA margins and sort of get back there? Is it just simply getting all the volume back?\nEd Breen: Yes. It's really two things. getting the volume back, but remember a point I think I made earlier when Steve was on, the EBITDA margins ex the absorption in the second quarter were already over 30%. So the absorption is what pulling down the charge we took there to expanded to 26.6-ish number. So we know we can -- even in a softer volume environment, we're running it a little north of 30%. And as you said and I said earlier, we run this business 32%, 33% EBITDA margins. And we'll get price throughput, as the volumes continue to come back.\nMike Sison: Got it. Thank you.\nEd Breen: Thanks.\nOperator: Your final question comes from Patrick Cunningham from Citibank.\nPatrick Cunningham: Hi. Good morning. Is there any update to your expectations for $20 million in synergy capture from Spectrum? And what should we expect for the cadence there?\nLori Koch: Yeah, no update to that. We still expect $20 million. It probably will take the better part of 12 to 18 months to get $20 million out. I mean, obviously, for us, it is more of a revenue synergy opportunity as we bring the two portfolios together in verge our expertise biopharma with their expertise in medical device comes from a revenue synergy perspective.\nPatrick Cunningham: Got it. That's helpful. And how do you expect the healthcare business to trend throughout the year, both on the Legacy and the Spectrum side? There's been some commentary pointing to pockets of destocking as companies deplete safety stocks. Have you seen any of that from any of your businesses?\nEd Breen: Yeah. So our Liveo business were -- I think Lori mentioned this a little while ago in the biopharma side. We're seeing some destocking there. And I think I heard, I think, six other companies I heard in the last week would make the results that they were seeing some destocking in biopharma. In my gut is that last a couple of quarters. Just to correct that a little bit. And it was another one of those markets just like semi. I remember I was getting calls from CEOs in the healthcare business, but we need more. And I think just like semi everyone overshot, there's a little bit of a correction going on there, but I'd say that's probably the third and fourth quarter a little correction there. As Lori mentioned earlier, the spectrum numbers are kind of right on where we thought they would be. So they look like they're keyed up for the year, we thought they were going to happen in the second half of the year here. And I would expect, again, that the growth in our healthcare businesses will be above company average and certainly above GDP.\nPatrick Cunningham: Great. Thank you.\nEd Breen: Thank you.\nOperator: I now turn the call over to Chris Mecray for concluding remarks.\nChris Mecray: Okay. Thanks, everybody, for joining our call. Just to be a reference, a copy of the transcript will be posted on our website once available. This concludes our call. Thank you.",

            "name": "Lori Koch",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed, and good morning. Our focus remains on operational excellence and strong execution, and we are pleased to have delivered financial results ahead of expectations despite volume pressure in some of our most profitable lines of business in electronics. Turning to our financial highlights on Slide 5. Second quarter net sales of $3.1 billion decreased 7% as reported and 4% on an organic basis versus the year ago period. Currency results in a 1% headwind from dollar strength against key currencies most notably the won and yen, and we also saw a 2% headwind related to portfolio changes. Breaking down the 4% organic sales decline, a 6% volume decline was partially offset by a 2% pricing gain reflecting continued carryover benefit of actions taken last year to offset broad-based inflation. Volume decline primarily reflects continued demand weakness in consumer electronics coupled with inventory destocking across the channel and some softness, including destocking in North American construction related markets. Lower volume in these consumer turbine end markets was partially mitigated by continued strength in water, automotive, aerospace and healthcare markets. Volume within electronics and construction end markets during the quarter was down 15 the year ago period, while our remaining industrial-based businesses were up about 4%. From a regional perspective, Europe sales in the quarter were up 4% on an organic basis, while North America and Asia Pacific were down 3% and 8%, respectively versus the year ago period. China sales were down 14% on an organic basis, driven mainly by the electronics demand weakness, but increased sequentially versus the first quarter. Second quarter operating EBITDA of $738 million decreased 11% versus the year ago period, driven by lower volumes and the impact of reduced production rates in electronics as we align inventory with demand. Operating EBITDA margin during the quarter of 23.9% was down 110 basis points versus the year ago period, driven by volume pressure, reduced production rates and mix headwinds in the high margin steady business. On a sequential basis, operating EBITDA and operating EBITDA margins were up from the first quarter. Decremental margins for the quarter was 40%, excluding the impact of absorption headwinds related to reduced production rates within electronics, decremental margin was below 20%, enabled by aggressive actions taken year-to-date to reduce discretionary spend. Adjusted EPS in the quarter of $0.85 per share was down 3% versus last year, which I will detail shortly. Looking at cash performance. I would first like to highlight that we have made a reporting change effective with today's second quarter results and are now providing cash flow disclosure separated between continuing and discontinued operations. This change is being made to improve visibility into cash flow generation and cash flow conversion of the ongoing businesses. On a continuing operations basis, cash flow from operations during the quarter of $400 million less CapEx of $123 million resulted in adjusted free cash flow of $277 million and associated conversion of 73%. This reflects significant improvement versus last year on a comparable basis, driven by lower inventory. Adjusted free cash flow included a benefit of about $80 million in reduced inventory and a headwind of about $200 million related to interest payments. Optimizing cash flow continues to be a top priority for us. On adjusted free cash flow and conversion improved sequentially, we still have work to do to get to our target levels and expect further improvement in working capital metrics by year-end. Turning to Slide 6. Adjusted EPS for the quarter of $0.85 decreased 3% compared to $0.88 in the in the year ago period. Lower segment results more than offset below the line benefits, including a $0.19 benefit related to lower net interest expense and a lower share count. A higher tax rate and exchange loss during the quarter resulted in adjusted EPS headwind of $0.08 per share. Our tax rate for the quarter was 23.7%, up from 22.6% in the year-ago period, driven primarily by geographic mix of earnings. Turning to segment results, beginning with E&I on Slide 7. E&I second quarter net sales of $1.3 billion decreased 14% and organic sales declined 12% due to lower volume, along with currency headwinds and an unfavorable portfolio impact of 1% each. At the line of business level, volume for Semiconductor Technologies decreased 19%, while Interconnect Solutions volume decreased 15% versus the year ago period. The decline in Semi Tech resulted from a continuation of lower semiconductor fab utilization rate due to weak end market demand as well as inventory de-stocking across the channel. Chip fab utilization rates in the second quarter averaged in the low 70s on a percentage basis. The decline in Interconnect was driven by continued weak smartphones, PC and tablet demand along with channel inventory destocking. Our PCB customers in China offerings in the second quarter with utilization rates slightly improved from the mid-40s during the first quarter, which was a cycle low. The PCB market has been in a slowdown for a year now and we are beginning to see signs of improvement within our Interconnect business, illustrated by first and second quarter sequential growth of about 7% and with further expected sequential growth in the third quarter. Sales for Industrial Solutions were flat on an organic basis as pricing and ongoing strength in broad-based industrial markets were offset by lower demand in largely consumer-driven areas, such as advanced screening applications and those tied to electronics markets, including OLED display. Operating EBITDA for E&I of $349 million was down versus the year ago period primarily due to volume declines and lower operating rates to better align inventory with demand, partially offset by reduced discretionary spend. Turning to Slide 8. W&P's second quarter net sales of $1.5 billion were flat versus last year as organic sales growth of 1% was offset by a 1% currency headwinds. Organic growth of 1% reflects a 5% increase in price resulting from the carryover impact of pricing actions taken last year, mostly offset by a 4% decrease in segment volumes due to declines in shelf care solutions. At the line of business level, organic sales growth was led by Water Solutions, which was up mid-teens on continued demand growth for water filtration led by reverse osmosis and ion exchange resins, along with benefits from carryover pricing. IT Solutions sales were up mid-single digits on an organic basis driven by carryover pricing and volume strength in Kevlar and Nomex with an aerospace and automotive market, especially for EVs, coupled with Tyvek strength in health care. Shelter Solutions were down 12% on an organic basis, driven by demand softness in construction markets as well as de-stocking, although we do expect a reduced impact from de-stocking in the second half. Operating EBITDA for W&P during the quarter were $368 million, up 6% or operating EBITDA margin of 24.6%, increased 140 basis points versus the year ago period. The improvement resulted primarily from net pricing gains and disciplined cost control, which more than offset volume declines. Turning to Slide 9, I will close with a few comments on our outlook and guidance for the third quarter and full year 2023. Regarding the demand environment, we continue to expect fairly steady demand in most of our industrial end-markets within E&I and W&P although, we expect sales moderation in our Water business due to slower demand in China. Within Electronics, we saw stabilization and some early lift in our Interconnect Solutions business. The 7% sequential improvement in sales during the second quarter, and we expect mid-single-digit sequential growth to follow, in the third quarter. We believe, challenging markets likely bottom during the second quarter, and we assume net-net sales in the second half will improve slightly on a sequential basis. Given ongoing consumer electronics demand headwinds, notably in China, we have tempered the rate of second half growth to prior assumptions. We are adjusting our full year 2023 guidance to account for the slower cadence of recovery in electronics, including our actions to continue to reduce production to align inventory with demand. In addition, our third quarter and full year guidance now includes the estimated contribution from Spectrum beginning August 1. For the full year, we now expect net sales to be between $12.45 billion and $12.55 billion, operating EBITDA to be between $2.975 billion and $3.025 billion and adjusted EPS to be between $3.40 and $3.50 per share. For the third quarter 2023, we expect revenue of approximately $3.15 billion, operating EBITDA of approximately $755 million and adjusted EPS of approximately $0.84 per share. With that, we are pleased to take your questions, and let me turn it back to the operator to open the Yeah. On the smartphone and broadly, the consumer electronics recovery. That was part of the revision that we had in the second half. So our original expectations on a full year basis for smartphones would be down about 1% and PCs down about 7%. We revised expectations on each of those end markets along with the industry forecast for smartphone sound to be more in the 5% range in PC is supposed to be low double digit. So - but that does embed year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. So it sounds like one more quarter of year-over-year down in the third quarter and then recovery that's worth into the more normal market and most likely setting up for a strong 2024, those markets are in maybe through the destock and returning to more of a normal demand in growth. And to Ed's comment on the lumpiness, if you put a 2 year stack on the volume, we're up high single digits every quarter. So there is lumpiness of it comments around sometimes the projects work going on. But in general, it's really strong growth for us. And there's no change in our go-forward forecast, especially with the requirements that are going on around sustainability and the access to those are the key growth drivers for us. Yeah. So that was a net headwind between price and raws. So we did increase that to about $140 million from our view of $100 million. So we have seen a step up and we expect to benefit from deflation. To remind you, it was around $800 million last year of a headwind that we saw and we've got obviously a fair bit of room to go to get all of that money back, but we're making really nice progress. Initially, a lot of the deflation is coming from the energy and logistics side. You can see what the natural gas prices have gone from the peaks that we bought in the third quarter of last year and the stabilization in the supply chain. We're seeing nice improvement in logistics. So the one piece that we're working through is just the timing of when that falls through the P&L. So we actually in the first quarter, predominantly, a little bit in the second quarter, we actually saw some headwinds from the carryover from the escalation 2022 from a P&L perspective. And as we head into the back half of the year, we'll start to see those benefits that we've been getting from a procurement perspective drop into the P&L. Yeah. So in total, it will give you about a little north of $200 million in sales at a 22% margin. It's pretty consistent across the months, so you'll take two months of it in the third quarter and then the full three months in the fourth quarter. From an EPS perspective, it's really only about $0.01 on a full year basis once you factor in the loss of the interest income from the cash that we paid for the deal. There's more of an EBITDA function versus an EPS. Yes. So we had a really strong growth within Corporate M&M. It was driven by the EV piece, which is the largest segment of it. And it's really from the EV growth in the overall Auto build growth. So Auto build were up about 16% in the second quarter, we would have posted a similar number. And we see really nice performance in the EV piece. So that's what drove the improvement year-over-year primarily. Yeah, we saw a nice improvement in inventory in the second quarter, about $80 million of a reduction. We'll look to continue to drive that down as we get into the end of the year. We had an improvement sequentially in both cash generation and cash conversion. We'll look to continue to improve that as we get into the back half of the year. Our third quarter is typically our strongest quarter for cash generation, because we don't have an interest payment which we have in the second and the fourth quarter, which we pay our annual bonus in the first quarter. So the third quarter is the clean end from that perspective. And just the notes, that I had mentioned on the script just to make sure that you caught it, we will move to a continuing ops basis presentation in cash flow. So we'll take out all the noise from the discontinued ops components, which are primarily in this year, the funding of the escrow account, which will take place at some point in the second half and then the funding of the other end-of-use items. So, we will pull that out and just kind of, focus on continuing makes fast generation. Yeah. So the three biggest items that we had mentioned, first being the water deceleration. So we see some moderation in water as we get into the back half of the year, coming off of a really strong quarter in the second quarter. We had also mentioned that we expect to have to get back some price primarily in the Shelter business within water. And then the third, probably smallest piece but something we're raising was we do see some small destocking within biopharma. So it's been pretty well telegraphed across some of the other players, and we are starting to see that a little bit within our video business and the Industrial Solution business in Shanghai. Yeah. I mean it's kind of hard to say at this point how the restocking potentially could happen in those two spaces. We would expect it to perform nicely alongside the market. The one tailwind that will happen for us in a year-over-year perspective on EBITDA, we won't have those absorption headwinds that we had in 2022. So the predominance of those absorption happens for reasons within both ICS and semis those create a tailwind for us as we head into 2023. Yeah. So the predominance of sundry is really not even in operating EBITDA it's where our interest income comes in. It's also where some gains on asset sales that don't get reported in operating EBITDA or adjusted EPS come in. So it's not really primarily related to our operating investment. There's detail in the queue when that comes out tomorrow about what all of the other specifics are. But that's not really a reflection at all of any of our efforts to control discretionary spend. From that perspective, though, we have been very aggressive on control and the discretionary spend to minimize the decrementals that we've been policing. And I think we've done a nice job doing that. So in the first half, our decrementals as reported were 40%. But if you take out the headwinds from the absorption that we've been driving to reduce inventory were more down in the mid-20s. And so that's really a reflection of the aggressive actions we've taken from both. We did a small restructuring to be able to reduce some headcount primarily in the G&A space. So we're really trying to keep R&D and marketing and sales pretty clean. And then we have been taking some reductions to our annual discretionary consultations or bonus. And so that's what you're seeing more so coming in through the R&D line that would be a use of that. And then on the SG&A line would be the small license that we took to reduce headcount as well as the discretionary spend. Yeah. So volume growth in general in Europe is about flat. I would expect a similar performance as we get into the half of the year. And it's really different and it's been the toughest for us has been Asia Pacific, which we've been highlighting this obvious dominance of it is China The price piece though it will start to wane as we get into the back half of the year. So we saw it kind of cut in half, as we went from Q1 to Q2, and then as we get into - Q3 and Q4 we really - it would be flat to slightly negative, given some of the price that we would have to give back primarily in the Shelter space that we have mentioned. I don't see any change in our go-to-market strategy for the province of its direct as we go to the customers the projects in place and we're just replacing the filter, which is where the recurring revenue rate comes from. So this is a -- as we had mentioned earlier on the call, kind of mid to high single-digit grower for us, a lot of opportunities as we go forward around the sustainability and the access to clean water. Yeah. So we as we had mentioned, we believe within ICS that we'll continue to see sequential improvement as we head into Q3. And then I mean a little bit of tentative improvement as we head into Q4. In the semi, we don't see a material bump in sequential sales until we get into the fourth quarter. But definitely, the year-over-year volume headwind. We'll start to ease and we see full year overall E&I organic growth of about 10%. And that's primarily a volume reflecting within that segment. So it's probably a little early to call what 2024 looks like. I think there's a pretty good sense that it would be positive just given that you won't have the destock going on, but even if the demand is flat, which would be hard to see. You don't have that headwind from the destock year-over-year. So we're really encouraged as we head into 2024 from the tailwind that we'll see from out only market recovery and electronics but also the lapping of the absorption headwinds that we've taken this year to control investor. And then, the further benefit from deflation as it fully run through our P&L, are kind of the key components that register. Yeah. So it will be a similar structure to the first 3.25. I guess we'll complete that within a month, and then shortly thereafter, we'll execute a $2 billion ASR. So you'll get 80% of the shares upfront, and then you'll get the 20% cleanup in the back, and it probably will take us about six months to complete that full program. It's usually about a quarter for every $1 billion of shares that you're taking now. Yeah. I mean, it's hard to say what everyone is going to do with respect to the restock after coming through such a significant destocking. So we might change their normal pattern just to get every year likewise. So probably a little too early to say what's going to happen from a restocking perspective. I'll think you probably announce year and everyone [Technical Difficulty] stabilization that's happening in the supply chain generally, everybody in that. Yeah, no update to that. We still expect $20 million. It probably will take the better part of 12 to 18 months to get $20 million out. I mean, obviously, for us, it is more of a revenue synergy opportunity as we bring the two portfolios together in verge our expertise biopharma with their expertise in medical device comes from a revenue synergy perspective."

            "name": "Ed Breen",
            "content": "Good morning. And thank you for joining our second quarter 2023 financial review. This morning, we announced quarterly results with revenue and operating EBITDA better than our previously communicated guidance. This performance reflects our team's ongoing strong execution, while facing continued volume pressure and consumer-driven end markets, mainly electronics. In the second quarter, organic revenue declined 4% versus the year ago period despite mid-teens organic declines from the Interconnect Solutions and Semiconductor lines of business within E&I. We continue to see broad demand strength in industrial end markets, including water, automotive, aerospace, as well as healthcare, along with continued carryover benefit of pricing actions taken last year to offset inflationary pressure. Notably, operating EBITDA, operating EBITDA margin and adjusted EPS were all up sequentially from first quarter. After nearly a year long downturn, we also saw a sequential sales lift in Interconnect Solutions of 7%. We also continue to be proactive in taking additional actions within our control to minimize the impact of volume declines given near-term slowdown in select end markets, while also focusing on optimizing cash generation. Turning to Slide 4. We continue to advance a number of strategic priorities for accretive and value-added capital deployment. Yesterday, we announced completion of the Spectrum acquisition, a leader in critical specialty devices for healthcare end markets. This acquisition fully aligns with our strategic objectives of increasing topline growth through customer-driven innovation and expanding our Industrial Technologies growth pillar, while adding to our current offerings in the high-growth healthcare market. Spectrum is being integrated into our Industrial Solutions line of business where it fits nicely with our existing Liveo franchise with annual sales of about $500 million, Spectrum together with Liveo and our Tyvek Healthcare Packaging business increases our total revenue in healthcare markets to about 10% of our portfolio with expected growth rates above the company average. Spectrum's year-to-date performance has been solid, and we are pleased that operating results are in line with our deal model estimates, which include an estimated operating EBITDA margin of approximately 22%. We are excited by Spectrum's complementary fit and specifically our ability to leverage incremental growth opportunities, including synergies from cross-selling and the complementary accounts new and faster product development and deeper design and co-development partnerships with OEMs. Further on M&A, we continue to make progress with our Delrin business divestiture and our expectation of closing this planned transaction around year-end 2023 remains unchanged. There has been good interest in the asset to date. Regarding share repurchases, we expect we will complete the $3.25 billion accelerated share repurchase transaction launched last November within a month. We also intend to complete our remaining authorization through a new $2 billion ASR to be executed shortly thereafter. Regarding the water district settlement that was announced in June jointly with Chemours and Corteva, this settlement comprehensively covers PFAS-related claims of public water systems starting the vast majority of the US population. Our portion of the settlement is about $400 million, and we expect final approval about six months following preliminary approval, which we expect to receive shortly. Regarding broader capital allocation goals, yesterday's closing of the Spectrum deal and the new $2 billion ASR essentially completes the deployment of excess cash remaining from the M&M divestiture last November. Our current capitalization remains very sound. And as a reminder, we have no significant debt maturities until November 2025. We are comfortable with a net leverage point around 2x as an equilibrium target going forward. Before I turn it over to Lori to review our financial performance, let me add that we remain excited about the visible growth drivers enabled by our technical innovation teams and application engineers who are squarely focused on helping customers solve their most complex challenges. To name just a few, strong growth is expected in the semiconductor industry with the ongoing global investment in new fabs. Overall growth of the semiconductor industry is anticipated to be high single-digits over the coming five-year period. We have the leading materials that enable the next generation of advanced chip manufacturing and packaging, which includes significant technology and support from the emerging generative AI revolution. Within water, we continue to drive growth in desalination and which order markets and then helping customers achieve their sustainability goals. Finally, our auto adhesives business is well positioned to continue to capture growth with its product offerings and electric vehicles. With that, I'll turn it over to Lori. Yeah. We think the next couple of quarters or just a little bit later will be closed in China, and it's really slowness in the industrial economy in China right now, which obviously should rebound here at some point, but we're expecting that to be a little softer in the second half of the year that, by the way, that's growth that we've had in that business is double-digit growth. So we're just saying it's going to moderate some still growth, but just slower growth in the second half of the year. But as that business has done quarter in, quarter out. It grows at a pretty nice clip, and I expect this China to improve some. That growth rate will pick up also. Remember, 70% of that business is a renewable business that's steady. So I think a couple of quarters maybe a little later in China, is what we're seeing. Yeah. So just probably just back to the ICS one, that started to decline and destocking started about the middle of 2022. So it's almost been kind of 10 months that in a downturn in the first quarter, it was really one at the bottomed. And then we did see 7% sequential pickup, and we're expecting mid-single-digit pickup by the forecast we had for the third quarter. So obviously, that's starting to come nicely off the bottom. The semi 1 is the one we tempered a little more in the second half. We look like we hit the bottom in the second quarter. We're not gauging much upturn in the third quarter. Instead, we're assuming we have another quarter kind of near the bottom are just very slightly up from that. And then we think somewhere the inflection point is more in the fourth quarter, but it's hard to tell what month you actually see it. So we did pick it up a little bit in the forecast in the fourth quarter, but not significantly. So that's the thing we kind of tapped down when we gave you the guidance here today. But I think we've seen the bottom in semi, and we're seeing the lift begin in ICS now. Remember, ICS is still negative. As a way to come back still, but it was down over 20%, and we're starting to write it back. Those will still be negative in the third and fourth quarter on a year-over-year compare. Thank you. Yeah. Let me comment, and I'll turn it to Lori by just - I don't want to say customer names, but we're in good shape this year on the new models being introduced by a couple of the large cell phone players. So from a market share standpoint, we know which phones we're in, and we're in a better position than we were last year, not that we were in a bad position at all last year. But we feel like we're in a good position with the launch of the new models coming in. We know what we're in, in those phones. And by way, clearly, one of the things I think you all know we're in is the Kapton technology for the 5G antenna is a key component for us, along with some other components, but that's a key one. Lori, do you want to just talk about the timing? Yes. I think the way to look at that, that business is consistent, it is choppy, some quarters. We have a big installation we're doing and all that. So it's not going to be every single quarter. But generally, that business grows kind of mid to high single digits pretty consistently. And this past quarter, we had even a better quarter the not on the growth rate. But again, it can be lumpy. But when you kind of smooth out the whole year, I think that's the way to look at it kind of in that 6% to 8% growth range when you smooth out the year. And look, I expect China activity will pick up. It's hard to tell if there's a little bit of excess inventory also that is part of it, but we're again expecting a couple of just lighter quarters. But I think quarters with growth in the third quarter, but just lighter than we had in the second quarter. And I think, again, it's a consistent business. And it has been since we've had it. So I don't expect it to continue to grow in that range. And then the key here is there's a replacement business that's 70% of the business. So that adds to the consistency of it. Yes. We're pretty confident we'll close it by year-end. I would just say private equity has been interested along with strategic, but I don't want to get into any more than that at this point in time. But I think we're highly confident we'll have a deal. There's been nice interest in it. Yes. John, what happened here was very typical of these bigger type of settlements that have to these class actions. If you go back and look at any of the other big ones, you always get that, I think, what you're referring to is the challenge from state AGs and all that. I don't think by what we're hearing that there's going to be a problem here we're thinking in the very near future, we get preliminary approval from the judge, and as we said in our prepared remarks, it will be about six months after that preliminary approval from the judge where we would then be finished with that and make the payment. Good morning, Steve. Yes, Steve, it kind of takes four to five months on the raws to work its way through in our system and we build a customer. So some of this, we're obviously going to see now in 2024 but the procurement team has been working very aggressively and Lori and I meet with a very consistent basis because it's a big part of seeing up on 2024 for us. And by the way, Steve, just as a side note, the margins on the E&I, remember, not much of the walls were in E&I, we only raised prices 2% there. The predominant part of it is going to become in W&P. And the thing that affected the margins in E&I is really the absorption charge that we've taken. We we're going to take it again in the third quarter, we're probably going to take it in the fourth quarter, just to make sure everything is teed up for 2024, and that's affected our - or like in the third - in the second quarter that affected our margins in E&I by about 400 basis points. So without the absorption, we know we're running that business north of 30, even in a reduced volume environment. So I feel very confident you all watched us run that in a 32%, 33% EBITDA range. I'm very comfortable when I look at our math that we're in good shape there as we rebound. So very small. The one area we're going to give up some price that we forecasted in the second half of the year is in the construction-related markets. We also had to raise very significantly in those markets because of what the raws did last year. So, we've made an assumption in this forecast that we'll give up some of the pricing there. Otherwise, we're feeling pretty solid across the rest of the portfolio. Thanks, Steve. I think it's mostly done destocking by the end of this third quarter. And that's talking to a couple of our key distributors and customers. One of the big box guys, by the way, was doing a rebalancing of all, their inventory by moving it around to different stores and regions. That's how we were doing it. And they're pretty much through that process. So I think the end of third quarter, we're kind of there. Thanks. Yes. No, we're definitely going to take the absorption this quarter. We're in the third quarter, about $40 million and the same in the fourth quarter as our plan. So we're really getting inventory aligned up very well with demand. So we just feel it's the prudent thing to do right now. So that's what's baked into the plan that we've given here today. Yeah. By the way, we're are - we've been tensioning real good is our travel and entertainment budgets. We're trying to keep them. The salespeople are traveling the application engineers, but we're really being sure of holding people, holding management meetings all over the world and all that. So we're just being -- we've really put the word out to our team, hey, while we're in a tougher environment here will come out of it nice, but just watch anything on the discretionary side. No. No, I don't think you'll see anything obviously, the rest of this year and at least well into next year. I think, I said on the last call, a good year pause. We love where we've got the balance sheet at, as I think Lori mentioned on the call I did -- we're going to have leverage action in here somewhere around 2x. That's where we want to be. And we're in a great spot. And I don't feel like we need to do anything. So we are -- we got to where we need to be. Thanks. Thank you. I haven't had it yet. No, it's not a candidate for divestiture. It's very core to us. We like the position we have, especially with the EV opportunity we have. And we're obviously seeing a lot of wins there, and the growth rate has been phenomenal. So we like that business. And by the way, we - I don't think we're going to make any new short-term on pulling it out of there of where we're reporting it at this point in time. We just -- we've got everything run in the way we want. So you won't see anything in the next couple of quarters. Thanks, Frank. Yeah. So look, we -- there's a percent that have, I'll call it, opt in or we can walk away from the settlement. So by the way, that's a very high percentage, and we think just to get up that, that will not be a problem. Remember, a lot of these water districts have been being talked to by the plaintiff side of this. This hasn't been done in a vacuum. So, it's - they've been talked to along the way here to get to this, what I'll call it preliminary settlement. So I think shortly, as I said, we will get it approved by the judge on a preliminary basis and then you work all the opt-ins to make sure you get that done and then you have final approval once you hit that threshold. So it's really up to each of the difficulty for water districts, how they're going to handle that to clean up any PFAS that's in there. So I don't want to comment on that. Thanks, Steve. Yes. It's really two things. getting the volume back, but remember a point I think I made earlier when Steve was on, the EBITDA margins ex the absorption in the second quarter were already over 30%. So the absorption is what pulling down the charge we took there to expanded to 26.6-ish number. So we know we can -- even in a softer volume environment, we're running it a little north of 30%. And as you said and I said earlier, we run this business 32%, 33% EBITDA margins. And we'll get price throughput, as the volumes continue to come back. Thanks. Yeah. So our Liveo business were -- I think Lori mentioned this a little while ago in the biopharma side. We're seeing some destocking there. And I think I heard, I think, six other companies I heard in the last week would make the results that they were seeing some destocking in biopharma. In my gut is that last a couple of quarters. Just to correct that a little bit. And it was another one of those markets just like semi. I remember I was getting calls from CEOs in the healthcare business, but we need more. And I think just like semi everyone overshot, there's a little bit of a correction going on there, but I'd say that's probably the third and fourth quarter a little correction there. As Lori mentioned earlier, the spectrum numbers are kind of right on where we thought they would be. So they look like they're keyed up for the year, we thought they were going to happen in the second half of the year here. And I would expect, again, that the growth in our healthcare businesses will be above company average and certainly above GDP. Thank you."

I would now like to turn the call over to Chris Mecray, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nChris Mecray: Good morning, and thank you for joining us for DuPont's first quarter 2023 financial results conference call. Joining me today are Ed Breen, Chief Executive Officer; and Lori Koch, Chief Financial Officer. We've prepared slides to supplement our remarks, which are posted on DuPont's website under the Investor Relations tab and through the webcast link. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the slides. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Our Form 10-K is updated by our current and periodic reports includes detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties, which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today exclude significant items. We will also refer to other non-GAAP measures, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in our press release and presentation materials and have been posted to DuPont's Investor Relations website. I'll now turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Breen: Good morning and thank you for joining our first quarter 2023 financial review. This morning, we announced quarterly results with operating EBITDA in line and revenue and adjusted EPS slightly better than our previously communicated guidance. This performance reflects our team's continued strong execution, while facing short term volume pressure and select consumer driven short cycle end markets, including electronics and construction. First quarter organic revenue declined 3% versus the year ago period, despite double digit declines from our electronics lines of business of Interconnect Solutions and Semiconductor Technologies. Mitigating the weakness in electronics and construction markets was ongoing broad demand strength in areas including water, automotive, aerospace and healthcare, along with the carryover benefit of pricing actions taken last year to offset inflationary pressure. Adjusted EPS was up 2% as we continue to realize benefits from our ongoing capital allocation strategy. As expected, operating EBITDA declined versus the year ago period, driven by lower volumes. Given the near term slowdown in short cycle end markets, we continue to be proactive in taking actions within our control to minimize volume pressure, while also focusing on optimizing cash flow generation. As a result, we expect to continue to show the resiliency of the new DuPont portfolio and expect that our financial results will generate returns commensurate with top tier multi industrial assets. In addition to our commitment to generating value through delivery of consistent operating performance, we also continue to focus on accretive and value added capital deployment. This morning, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Spectrum a leading manufacturer of critical components and devices for medical end markets for $1.75 billion or $1.72 billion after certain tax attributes. This deal fits with our strategy to focus on the industrial technology's growth pillar, expanding our offerings into the fast growing healthcare market. Turning to Slide 4, we have had our eye on Spectrum, which is a current DuPont customer for a long time and our team is extremely excited for this opportunity. Spectrum is a recognized leader in advanced manufacturing of specialty medical devices and components serving 22 of the top 26 medical device OEMs with relationships that date back decades and a strategic focus on fast growing therapeutic devices and components. Their business is predominantly North American focused and has demonstrated consistent growth over many years. We expect them to generate revenues of about $500 million in 2023. As you can see on Slide 5, DuPont's existing healthcare portfolio is quite strong today. As a reminder, our current healthcare portfolio is comprised of Liveo, medical device and biopharma consumables business, which is a key part of the industrial solutions line of business and our Tyvek healthcare packaging business reported through Safety Solutions. Together, these businesses represent $800 million of total revenue and grow at rates exceeding the company average and well above GDP at solid rates of profitability. The Spectrum business fits nicely with our existing Liveo franchise and will complement our established position in biopharma consumables, bringing world class manufacturing capabilities and deep OEM customer relationships. On Slide 6, you can see the addition of Spectrum to our portfolio is impactful and the combined presence in healthcare will now represent approximately 10% of DuPont's total sales. The transaction adds higher growth while further reducing cyclicality in the portfolio. Also worth noting the transaction significantly increases the total addressable market we serve within healthcare devices. These businesses are expected to grow at high single digit rates over time and even faster in 2023 due to specific business wins in place. This transaction has compelling strategic rationale as you can see on Slide 7. The Spectrum business expands DuPont's growth strategy of customer centered innovation and strengthen our existing stable position in fast growing healthcare end markets. We are excited by the complementary fit and specifically our ability to leverage the strengths from each side to generate incremental growth opportunities on top of already growing core markets. As an example of this on the biopharma side, DuPont Liveo has extensive direct relationships with leading OEMs in the biopharma space and has approved proven design and build co development model. The added advanced manufacturing capabilities enabled by Spectrum will expand its product and capability set to meet stringent customer specifications, essentially adding a new pipeline for the Spectrum side by adding new customer relationships. On the medical device side, as an example, Spectrum has extensive direct relationships with leading OEMs, including with 22 of the top 26 players. Adding Liveo's silicone offerings and DuPont's material science technology will enhance Spectrum's depth cooperation with customers and expand its product offerings. Spectrum is expected to accelerate top line growth for industrial solutions and DuPont as a whole. Regarding deal terms, the net purchase price of $1.72 billion after certain tax adjustments represents a 15.6 EBITDA multiple based on 2023 estimates or 13.2 times after moderate expected cost synergies of $20 million. In line with our return hurdles for capital deployment, the acquisition is expected to deliver high single digit ROIC by year five, excluding revenue synergies that we described. We believe the combined growth opportunities I just mentioned can add incremental value to the business combination. We expect this transaction will close by the end of the third quarter this year, and we do not anticipate significant regulatory hurdles. We plan to finance the transaction with cash on hand. Given a lot of moving parts on our capital allocation over the last six months, let's briefly review our status on Slide 8. From closing of the M&M sale in November through today, we have deployment actions and plans in place to account for the full $11 billion of gross cash received from the sale through a disciplined capital allocation process. In the fourth quarter of last year, we announced a $5 billion share repurchase authorization and took actions to deleverage our balance sheet by paying down $2.5 billion in senior notes and reducing commercial paper from $1.3 billion to zero at year end and remaining undrawn through the first quarter. Regarding share repurchases, we still expect the complete $3.25 billion accelerated share repurchase program launched last November in the third quarter of this year. And remain committed to completing the remaining $2 billion of authorization as an ASR shortly thereafter. Today's announcement to acquire Spectrum with cash on hand essentially completes the deployment of any remaining excess cash from the M&M transaction. In terms of additional cash sources, I will note that we are progressing with our plans to sell the Delrin business and continue to expect that planned transaction to close by year end 2023. Our current capitalization remains very sound with no significant debt maturities until November 2025. Looking through all currently communicated deployment actions inclusive of the Delrin sale, we expect net leverage to finish the year around 2 times. We are comfortable with that leverage point which is more in line with our multi industrial peers and we expect to remain at that level as an equilibrium target going forward. With that, let me turn it over to Lori to review our financial performance and outlook.\nLori Koch: Thanks, Ed, and good morning. Our first quarter financial results reflect our team's ongoing strong focus on execution and operational excellence as we began 2023. In a pressured volume environment within consumer electronics and construction, we are focused on the operational levers within our control to drive solid operating EBITDA and minimize margin impact despite volume decrements in some of our most profitable lines of business. Turning to our financial highlights on Slide 5. First quarter net sales of $3 billion decreased 8% as reported and 3% on an organic basis versus the year ago period. Currency resulted in a 3% headwind from dollar strength against key currencies, most notably the yen, yuan and euro, and we also saw a 2% headwind related to portfolio changes. Breaking down the 3% organic sales decline, 4% pricing gains were more than offset by a 7% volume decline. Pricing reflects the carryover impact of actions taken during 2022 to offset broad based inflation related to raw materials, logistics and energy. Volume decline reflects weakness in consumer electronics resulting from decreased consumer spending, channel inventory destock and softness in construction. Lower volume in these consumer driven short cycle end markets was partially mitigated by ongoing strength in water, automotive, aerospace and healthcare markets. Taken in combination, volume within electronics and construction end markets during the quarter was down high teens in aggregate versus the year ago period, while our remaining businesses were up low single digits. From a regional perspective, Europe and North America sales in the quarter were up 5% and 1%, respectively, on an organic basis, while Asia Pacific was down 10% versus the year ago period. China sales were down nearly 20%, driven principally by the electronics weakness. First quarter operating EBITDA of $714 million decreased 13% versus the year ago period, driven by lower volumes and the impacts of reduced production rates in electronics as we scale that production to better align with demand. Currency was also a headwind. Operating EBITDA margin during the quarter of 23.7% was down 130 basis points, driven by volume pressure and inclusive of mixed headwinds related to lower volumes within the high margin semi business. Decremental margin the quarter was 41%. Given the high teen volume declines in our electronics portfolio, our overall decrementals were disproportionately impacted as these businesses are some of the most profitable within the DuPont portfolio. Adjusted EPS in the quarter of $0.84 per share increased 2% versus last year, which I will detail shortly. Looking at cash performance, cash flow from operations during the quarter of $343 million, less cash paid for CapEx of $241 million resulted in adjusted free cash flow of $102 million. Included within free cash flow, our transaction cost headwinds of about $75 million related to both cash payments associated with the M&M deal closing and ongoing Delrin divestiture costs. Turning to Slide 10, adjusted EPS for the quarter of $0.84 per share increased 2% compared to $0.82 in the year ago period. Headwinds related to overall volume declines were more than offset by the below the line benefits including an $0.11 benefit related to lower net interest expense and a $0.09 benefit due to share repurchases. Including the upfront benefit of our ongoing ASR program initiated last November. Our tax rate for the quarter 23.4% up from 21.8% in the year ago period, resulting in a two set headwind to adjusted EPS driven primarily by geographic mix of earnings. Turning to segment results beginning with E&I on Slide 11. E&I first quarter net sales of $1.3 billion decreased 16% as organic sales declined 13% along with currency headwinds of 2% and unfavorable portfolio impact of 1%. The organic sales declines reflect a 15% decrease in volume, partially offset by a 2% increase in price. The organic sales decrease for E&I was driven by Interconnect Solutions which was down 21% and Semiconductor Technologies, which was down mid-teens. The decline in Interconnect was driven by weak smartphone, PC and tablet demand, along with channel inventory destocking. Our PCB customers in China operate in the first quarter with utilization rates in the mid-40s, which is an expected cycle low. The decline in semi tech results from reduced semiconductor fab utilization rates due to weekend market demand as well as downstream destocking of finished chip inventory. Semi chip fab utilization rates in the first quarter averaged around 80%, which we expect to dip somewhat in the second quarter as these customers work down inventories. We expect recovery and fab rates to begin during the third quarter. Sales for Industrial Solutions were up low single digits on an organic basis as pricing and ongoing strength in Vespel Aerospace products and in healthcare for specifications such as biopharma consumables were partially offset by lower demand in largely consumer driven areas such as advanced printing and lighting applications. Operating EBITDA for E&I of $362 million was down versus the year ago period, primarily due to the drop through impact of volume declines, which corresponds to the lower customer utilization rates just referenced and our lower operating rates, as also mentioned. Turning to Slide 12, W&P first quarter net sales of $1.45 billion increased 1% as organic sales growth of 4% was mostly offset by a 3% currency headwind. Organic growth reflects a 6% increase in price resulting from the carryover impact of pricing actions taken last year, partially offset by a 2% decrease in segment volumes. Organic sales growth was led by Water Solutions, which was up low double digits on strong pricing and continued demand growth for water filtration led by reverse osmosis product lines. Safety solution sales were up mid-single digits on an organic basis on pricing and volume gains. Volume growth was driven by Kapton and Nomex demand in aerospace and automotive markets, especially for EVs, coupled with Tyvek strength in healthcare. Shelter Solutions was down mid-single digits on an organic basis on greater than 10% volume declines due to softness in construction markets, partially offset by pricing. Operating EBITDA for W&P of $344 million increased 1% as pricing and disciplined cost control were largely offset by inflationary cost pressure, primarily related to higher raw material and energy costs, currency headwinds and lower volume. Before I turn it back to Ed, I'll close with a few comments on our financial outlook and guidance for second quarter and full year 2023 on Slide 13. As we look at the current demand environment, we continue to expect ongoing strength throughout the year in areas such as water, automotive, aerospace and healthcare. Within electronics markets, we continue to see weakness in channel inventory destocking in the near term. Based on recent customer feedback, echoed by their public commentary and third party market forecast, we expect customer utilization rates to bottom relatively near term and to improve during the third quarter, which is about a quarter later than previously expected. To highlight these assumptions, we've included current market forecast for both semiconductor and smartphone markets on Slide 14. For semiconductors, third party research now suggests MSI will be down 13% for the full year 2023 compared to estimates last quarter indicating down mid-single digits, with fab utilization expected to ramp back up above 80% beginning in the fourth quarter. For both of these end markets, you can see the expected improvement beginning during the third quarter, which reflects a later and somewhat more gradual pace than the assumptions last quarter. Due to the delay in the near term recovery, we are adjusting the high end of our full year guidance range for net sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS. We now expect full year net sales to be between $12.3 billion and $12.5 billion, operating EBITDA to be between $3 billion and $3.1 billion and adjusted EPS to be between $3.55 and $3.70 per share. For the second quarter 2023, we expect similar results for the first quarter as overall market conditions are anticipated to be generally consistent. On a longer term view, historical data suggests downturns in these markets are short, lasting about three to four quarters, which gives us confidence in the longer term growth for electronics as we get through this year. With that, turn it back to Ed.\nEd Breen: Thanks, Lori. Before we take your questions, I'd like to highlight that we published our annual sustainability report yesterday, highlighting the ongoing work of our employees across the globe to meet our commitments across all aspects of ESG. As a reminder, our sustainability strategy is grounded in three pillars, innovation, protecting people and the planet and empowering employees and customers. I continue to be proud of the progress we are making on our 2030 goals and remain impressed of the speed in which we are advancing. On climate change, we exceeded our 2030 acting on climate goal to reduce Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 30%, well ahead of schedule. And we have set a new goal which has been validated by SBTi to reach a 50% reduction in emissions by 2030. Regarding innovation, 80% of our top innovation programs deliver sustainability value for customers. Within water, we've helped to enable seawater to be used as a source of potable drinking water with our reverse osmosis technology. We're also helping reduce carbon emissions through building materials innovation and protection. In auto markets, we're making electric vehicle battery safer with our materials for thermal management. And within electronics, we've directly enabled increased performance requirements in semiconductor manufacturing. In our community, we engaged over 500 community projects with over 300 nonprofit partners across 30 countries focused on STEM education. From a DE&I standpoint, many aspects are of inclusive culture continue to be recognized. 2022 marked our second year on Forbes Magazine's world's top female friendly company's list as one example. There are many great examples and stories in the report of how our teams are delivering on our purpose and driving sustainability. Overall, our teams have done a tremendous job. With that, we are pleased to take your questions and let me turn it back to the operator to open the Q&A.\nOperator: The floor is now open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Tusa from JP Morgan. Please proceed.\nSteve Tusa: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nEd Breen: Good morning, Steve.\nLori Koch: Good morning.\nSteve Tusa: Could you just help level set us on where you stand as far as the amount left -- you have left to buy back for the rest of the year and the pace on that? And then when Delrin closes, just remind us of the proceeds you're expecting there and what you'd expect to do with that cash?\nSteve Tusa: Yes, I'll take the share repurchase. So we still have $2 billion left to complete, which we will do on the back the completion of the current ASR, which is expected sometime in the August-September timeframe. We'll get started on the second program and be able to take 80% of the shares out upfront, and then it usually will take us about six months to complete the full $2 billion authorization. Turn it to Ed for the Delrin comment?\nEd Breen: Yes. So Delrin, we're expecting to close by the end of the year. And we've been doing all the carve out work. So we're very far along on accomplishing all that. I'm not going to talk about what we sell it for, but the EBIT is about $180 million on the business. So you kind of figure out the zip code on that as we move forward. Again, that cash should be somewhere kind of in the year beginning of next year.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. And then just lastly on price cost. What's your outlook for pricing for the non-electronics businesses in the second half? And any update on the spread for the year, if there's any positive benefit there, I think it was $100 million or something in prior guide.\nEd Breen: Yes, we have not changed that, Steve. Maybe we're being conservative, obviously, as we've said before, we've worked very hard with our teams on how we're going to handle this. As we move forward, the timing is -- we're seeing a little bit of it by the way because of logistics and shipping rates being down. But the big bulk of it will be on the raws. It will be more on the W&P side. And remember, by the time we renegotiate contracts and then you've got like a four month window to get it through our supply chain into a finished good that's sold to kind of figure out timing of it, but we have not changed the assumption which is very little of the $800 million that we raised pricing. And we'll just update everybody as we get to next quarter on that and we'll have a clearer picture of what that potentially is.\nLori Koch: Yes. And on the pricing side. So we saw 4% total in Q1. It was 6% in W&P. We see that decelerating as we lap the 2022 benefits. And so in the second quarter, we expect an overall about 1% price lift, really 2% in W&P and flat B&I.\nSteve Tusa: Great. Thanks a lot.\nEd Breen: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nEd Breen: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Good morning. Ed, maybe a little color on how active you are on the buy side of M&A. What the pipeline looks like. I don't think you responded to the potential use of Delrin proceeds when that happens, should we expect kind of more M&A like this or some combination of even additional repo plus M&A?\nEd Breen: Yes, Jeff. Our leaning right now is nothing else on the radar screen over the next year on the M&A side. We want to get the spectrum deal done, focus on that. By the way, the Laird acquisition we did the other year is going extremely well. So I think there's nothing that we're excited about that we see out there. This one, by the way, we've had our eyes on for quite a period of time. As I think we said in our comments, they're actually a customer of ours. So this is really where we've been focused for the last kind of year, year and a half with our thinking. If I had to say right now with any extra proceeds, I think we would lean towards additional share repurchase. But remember to Lori's comments, it's still going to be about over the next year that we're still taking shares out of the market, existing ASR as we said. And then we'll -- as soon as we finish this one, we'll launch the new ASR for $2 billion, and that will take us till about the end of the first quarter of 2024. So any excess cash we\u2019ll deal with at that point in time, but it depends on the environment, obviously, but if the environment were like it is now where the multiple is for the company. My good is, we lean towards share repurchase.\nJeff Sprague: And could you -- Thanks for that. Could you speak to, I guess, for lack of a better term kind of contingency planning. On the electronic stuff, as you said, I think you tried to triangulate between your own [intel] (ph) and third parties and what your customers are telling you, but it does look and feel like some of these customers are chasing a ball down the hill here on some of this stuff. So there's things you can't control, but the question is, some things you can control kind of cost action that you might be taking or considering. And I wonder if also part of that answer you could kind of speak to maybe the opportunity to unlock some additional cash from working capital as we work through this kind of cycling down in the electronics markets.\nEd Breen: Just as an overall comment though, Jeff, it's interesting. The semi -- you go back and study all the other downturn. Remember semi is a great industry, by the way, it's going to go up the next couple of decades, but you always do hit these pockets of some destock and some softness. So -- but this actually for us when you look at our sales rates, semi started coming down at the beginning of the four quarter. So we're two full quarters into the downturn. Now we think the quarter right we are in now is the bottom, just slightly down more from the first quarter. When you look at them, they're usually three to maximum four quarters of a destock. Remember, a lot of this is destock on top of some consumer softness obviously. So we're pretty deep into it. It would appear having said that to your direct question though, we've got a couple other layers of actions we would take on the cost side to protect ourselves. And then back to the conversation we just had with Steve Tusa, obviously, we're going to work this price cost thing real hard and haven't baked a ton in at this point in time. So that would be where the two levers would be.\nLori Koch: Yes. I think on the on the inventory piece too. So we did take action in the first quarter that was a headwind to E&I margins of about $40 million to $45 million to be able to better align inventory and production rates. And so we saw a headwind there. We'll continue to see that headwind in the second order as well as we try to get inventory more in line with where the demand signal is. But to Ed\u2019s point, to just reiterate on the discretionary side, we are doing a fair amount of actions you can see on the face of our P&L that we took about 10% out of our total [SAR] (ph). That was really a function of the restructuring that we did in the tail end of 2022 as well as really tensioning back sales and travel and expense and we'll continue in that mode as we go into 2Q as we said in 2Q as well.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Thank you.\nEd Breen: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please proceed.\nScott Davis: Thank you, operator. Good morning, ED, Lori and Chris.\nEd Breen: Good morning, Scott.\nLori Koch: Good morning.\nScott Davis: Can you guys talk -- I know it's not giant, but it can move the needle if you do it right on Spectrum. What -- can you make it better -- you commented just that it's more North American based. Is there an opportunity to take it globally? Is there anything that you can do. Synergies look fairly modest to maybe just being conservative. But is there anything you can do with that asset to perhaps drive those returns up a little higher than the deal model?\nEd Breen: Yes. Well, Scott, we didn't take into account any revenue synergies. So let me just talk the cost piece a second. We only put in $20 million of cost synergies, which by the way is only 3% to 4% of revenue, which is, obviously, a low compared to what deals normally are on the synergy side. So I think our net 13.2 times is pretty conservative based on just that $20 million. The real opportunity here is going to be on the growth side. Remember, our relationships at DuPont are mainly and by the way they're very deep relationships are with the biopharma OEMs. Spectrums are more with the medical device OEMs, but a lot of our technology actually goes through companies like Spectrum into that industry. So when we look at the ability for DuPont to move its technologies and material science into the medical device market with Spectrum and [indiscernible] the opposite of that Spectrum moving into the biopharma space. And when we look at the joint opportunities we could have together, we could drive some nice incremental growth there. And by the way, we've been talking to them and looking at this opportunity that I'm talking to for a very long time. So I think that's the big benefit. Can we get some more cost synergies? Probably can, but we haven't counted on it yet. But it will be the growth. This business has been growing. You can see in our charts kind of right around 10% over the last four years, it's going to actually grow faster this year. They've got a couple of big new wins from OEM customers. And then, we can broaden it out a little bit more globally because of our footprint on the Liveo side. But remember, a lot of the medical device players are U.S. based companies that sell globally. The other opportunity, Scott, the other big one we have is, we have a path to get the margins of Spectrum up about 300 basis points. They very recently, I say in the last year, put in a fair amount of new production capacity that's getting filled up because just the growth rate, they've been on. When you think about four years a row of 10%. So they have a fair amount that they're just completing on the factory expansion side. And as we fill those assets and get them utilized, we'll drive the margins up another 300 basis points. So that would -- that to me would even be a bigger lever than the cost one. It'd be more of that margin expansion and then the revenue opportunity.\nScott Davis: Okay. Interesting. And then just as a quick follow-up. The price comments you just made, Lori, the sequential kind of drop down. Is that -- mathematically, is that more just that we're getting to the tougher comps on when you jack prices up a year ago or is there \u2013 okay. So there's no sequential weakness.\nLori Koch: There's no sequential price declines of any magnitude baked in. It's more just lapping. Last year, the bulk of the raise was in, like, February-March time frame.\nScott Davis: That's what I figured. Okay, great. Best of luck. Thanks. Appreciate it.\nEd Breen: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson from Mizuho. Please proceed.\nChristopher Parkinson: Great. Thank you so much. Your performance in W&P, specifically on the water and the safety side has been pretty solid. Depending on, obviously, where the macro takes us, which is natural out of your control. Can you just speak to the potential resiliency of those two businesses in terms of your expectations for the second half embedded in guidance? Thank you.\nLori Koch: Yeah. So we still expect continued strength in water. So we had a nice organic growth in the first quarter. On both the price and volume basis and we expect that to continue as we head into the rest of the year. There's a lot of secular trends favoring our water portfolio right now. And on the safety side, we're seeing strength as well in most areas, especially what we highlighted with respect to the Spectrum acquisition on our healthcare portfolio. So we've got about a $500 million medical packaging business in Tyvek that's performing very nicely. So we see those secular trends continuing throughout the rest of 2023. One other area too that we can highlight of growth within the safety portfolio is the EV piece. So there's a nice application for Nomex paper within the e-motor that we're seeing nice growth in the first quarter and we'll look for that to continue as well.\nChristopher Parkinson: That's very helpful. And just given the results on the margin front, Lori, for the first quarter. Can you just give us a real quick update on your expectation for the intermediate to long term outlook to near 27%, 28%. Is that still roughly in line with your expectations in terms of your progression back to those levels? Thank you.\nLori Koch: Yes. I mean that's still our expectation with three big tailwinds between now and then. One is obviously the volume recover in E&I and getting those margins back into the low 30s. So we dipped in Q1. That was really a reflection of the volume and the actions we took to align production with demand. So that $40 million to $45 million created a headwind in the first quarter. So that is not permanent, that will resolve itself. Another tailwind is the price cost piece. So as we can see a potential future benefit there that will be margin accretive for us. And so, those are the two biggest levers. And then obviously, the final piece is the mix component. So as you get E&I back on its growth trajectory, obviously, it\u2019s the highest margin piece of our portfolio. So there's a favorable mix lift there as that market starts to recover.\nChristopher Parkinson: Helpful as always. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead from Barclays. Please proceed.\nMike Leithead: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys.\nEd Breen: Good morning.\nMike Leithead: First question, just on Spectrum. Apologies if I missed this in the materials, but is it possible to provide the 2022 revenue and EBITDA for the business?\nLori Koch: Yes. So 2022 revenue was about $450 million and EBITDA was about $95 million.\nMike Leithead: Great. Thank you. And then secondly, can you just talk about the lower leverage target now about kind of 2.0 instead of 2.75. Is this just more conservatism in the current rate environment? Or just kind of help frame the pivot there?\nEd Breen: Yes, it's exactly what you said. It's more higher interest rate environment we are in. And I think it's just prudent to set there. By way, not the number one reason, but another reason is, the premier multi industrial companies are all, if you look at it, kind of centered around 2 times leverage. We were kind of targeted up at that 2.75. So we think that this environment interest rate environment, it's just a prudent place to be. And so that's where we'll end the year about there, maybe actually a little slightly below 2 times depending on the Delrin proceeds that we get. And then, we always have -- we preserve our strategic flexibility there, but that's kind of where we'd like to target ourselves moving forward. But really the interest rate environment is the key reason.\nMike Leithead: Great. Thank you.\nEd Breen: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov from KeyBanc. Please proceed.\nAleksey Yefremov: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Ed, I wanted to follow-up on your 300 basis point margin expansion opportunity for Spectrum to clarify. Is this opportunity in your high single digit ROIC number or it could push the number higher?\nEd Breen: No, it's in there. We have a pay -- I mean, just the growth rate they're on right now, if you look at it, they're going to be -- I won't get into specific numbers. They'll be north of 10% growth this year. So just adding that leverage into the system really moves the needle for us, especially when they built new capacity in place and you're sitting there with it, you're hiring people on, you're just kind of going through that digestion period as you're ramping up. So as we said, their revenues this year, Lori, just mentioned 2022, the revenues this year will be like $500 million. So nice growth trajectory and you just play those numbers through the system, that's where you get to.\nLori Koch: And even if you back into the numbers that I have mentioned for 2022, that's about a 21% EBITDA margin. 2023 is expected to be 22%, so already 100 basis points of improvement. And they had a really nice first quarter ahead of their management plan actually. So they're on a very nice trajectory to achieve that average $110 million of EBITDA in 2023.\nAleksey Yefremov: Thanks. And as a follow-up, in semis and interconnect, clearly, it's a challenging market. Can you discuss your outgrowth? Are you continuing to gain content in these markets this year?\nLori Koch: Yeah. We would expect to see that. And we actually are seeing some share gains in the [indiscernible] in the packaging space still underneath the numbers that we're reporting. So what is clouding our performance versus the MSI is the destock piece. So the destock is pretty significant, that's going on in the first half that would be another headwind on top of the MSI numbers that we had presented in the deck. And so, that's what's crowding the story a little bit, but we still expect that content and exposure to advances [indiscernible] to be able to give us that performance in total.\nAleksey Yefremov: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Anders from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nVincent Andrews: Thank you and good morning everyone. Ed, point taken on the sort of historical electronic cycle, the three to four quarter downturn. Just curious if there's any sensitivity to that? And what I mean by that is, you're looking for the recovery in the third quarter. If for some reason it doesn't come in the third quarter, can it still come in the fourth quarter or is there some seasonal reason why it might get kicked into the first quarter if that would play out?\nEd Breen: No, there's no seasonal reason, Vincent. It's hard to tell exactly what month it is in there. But we've modeled all the other downturns. Remember, this downturn is pretty significant now, 13% down is correct. You're hitting it pretty quick on the destocking. And then, by the way, there's one other factor here that kind of pushed it out a little bit. One of the very large semiconductor players kept running hard on their fab utilization through the first quarter and that's public knowledge. I'm not going to mention the name, but one of the big players. So that is creating also the fact that they got to take their utilization down pretty rapidly here. And I think they just talked publicly about that a week or so ago. So that was one of the other reasons that gets kind of pushed it out a little and they got to go through destock also.\nVincent Andrews: And can I just ask on Spectrum, I don't know if you mentioned this before, I didn't see it. But what polymers and materials are critical to their products? And are there any particular folks that they tend to compete against?\nLori Koch: Yes. So they compete against [TE, Nordson and Integer] (ph) are some of their larger competitors. As far as on the input side, they are -- they use their specialty polymers and design expertise to manufacture very high complexity materials for the large med device players. And so that's -- as I had mentioned earlier, where we see a really nice sweet spot of being able to leverage the two portfolios. They've got really nice positions with the medical device guys and we've got really nice positions with the biopharma guys. So being able to bring our two portfolios, leverage our expertise and material science across the broader portfolio is where we see the opportunity for us ahead.\nVincent Andrews: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector from UBS. Please proceed.\nJosh Spector: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just when I look at your E&I guidance for 2Q. I mean, you're basically flat to slightly up sequentially in the sales line. I mean, pretty clear how you're guiding towards semis and utilization rates come down, some interconnect is kind of a push as well. So is industrials doing better sequentially? And is there anything you note there that's maybe different than what you expected?\nLori Koch: No. You had walked through the pieces. So industrial, we still expect continued strength overall within industrial. There's a little bit of split between interconnect and semi sequentially. So you'll start to see a little bit of the seasonal build that happens normally in interconnect, primarily within this smartphone space. And then we actually see a little bit of sequential deceleration in semi from Q1 to Q2 really a function of what Ed had mentioned earlier on one of the larger customers overbuilding in Q1 and then pulling back in Q2. But net-net, there's not a material change in revenue for the total company or E&I from Q1 to Q2.\nJosh Spector: Okay. Thanks. No. Appreciate that. And I guess, kind of following up on a prior question, if this all -- this recovery in semis pushes out again another quarter, you had $200 million sales cut, $100 million EBITDA cut, you talked about some production kind of realignment. If this were to push forward again or push out again, would there be any difference in the decrement that we should expect, either due to price cost or anything else that would maybe be an additional lever you consider.\nLori Koch: Yes. I mean, we would -- so right now, we expect that, that headwind that we'll see in the first half of roundly $90 million from pulling back production in E&I not being there in Q3 and Q4 in the second half. And so if this recovery extends into the fourth quarter, then you would expect that $45 million to recur again in the third quarter. The one caveat that we will make that we don't have baked into the guide to that could offset any decremental weakness if the recovery is pushed out is that, price cost piece. So we don't have anything material baked in that could become a tailwind to the second half based on what we see right now versus what we see right now.\nJosh Spector: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts from Credit Suisse. Please proceed.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you. Healthcare alone now is going to be almost the same size as Shelter solutions? So do you create a reportable Healthcare segment and move the rest of safety into industrial or do you put Spectrum into a larger safety segment where healthcare will be about 40% of the safety segment?\nEd Breen: Yes, John, it's something we've been looking at how to report it. It's interesting. Yes, healthcare will be 10% of the portfolio now. The water business by the way is developed into 10% of the portfolio. I think both really nice good secular end markets for us over coming years at higher growth rates, obviously, both of those. So we'll take a look at that. We don't -- we'll probably look at it as we enter 2024 to see if we do anything, but no decision on that yet.\nJohn Roberts: Okay. And then on the delay in electronics. Do you have any long lead time orders that actually show an inflection in demand yet?\nEd Breen: No, because it's a short cycle business, so you can't really -- we'll have a little bit of lift as Lori said in the ICS business. And that\u2019s typical for us as she said, you're going into the holiday season later in the year. So we start our shipments and you can see one of our charts, just the smartphone piece alone picks in third, fourth quarter there. So we begin shipments there. But past that, it's short cycle business and we'll see it and we'll ship it pretty quick.\nJohn Roberts: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne from BOA. Please proceed.\nSteve Byrne: Yes. I wanted to ask about your water treatment growth, would you say that it's being driven more by the treatment of water for consumption or for wastewater discharge? And are you seeing any increased demand for both of those buckets due to fluorinated compounds, either from EPA's drinking water standards that are underway or EPA scrutiny on any company that's using a fluorinated material?\nLori Koch: No. I mean, so the growth we have seen would be more on the industrial side, the business is about 70% favor towards industrial wastewater treatment. So that's what's driving the growth. There's nothing material that we're seeing with respect to any groundwater remediation is coming out from the EPA.\nEd Breen: And remember, Steve, 70% of that business is recurring. We're replacing membranes and all at these industrial sites. And it's just a secular trend that should continue because including DuPont, we're all working on that for our ESG targets. And it's besides greenhouse gas emissions, it's the other big one.\nSteve Byrne: And then one on shelter. Clearly, it's going through a cyclical downturn, but just curious about your longer term view on Shelter solutions? Is it likely to remain a core business for you?\nEd Breen: No, it's a core business for us. I remember a very key component of that is our Tyvek franchise, which is a very nice margin business for us against all of the end markets that we service with Tyvek, including the construction market. Obviously, Lori mentioned a really nice market for that is medical packaging. So it's definitely part of the portfolio.\nSteve Byrne: Okay. Thank you.\nEd Breen: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty from BMO Capital. Please proceed.\nJohn McNulty: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So on the topic of raw materials, I know what you said is in the guide. I guess I'm curious, in terms of the raw material basket that you're buying today, acknowledging it takes some time to work through the P&L, can you help us to understand how much that might be down from the peak and how we should be thinking about that?\nLori Koch: Yeah. So we saw around the $800 million of escalation last year. It was about 60% raws and the rest roughly split between logistics and energy. We are seeing deceleration on in the logistics and energy side. So obviously, you can look at European and U.S. natural gas and see there's been a sizable pullback there and the ocean freight rates we're seeing tailwinds as well. And so that's where we're seeing most of the deceleration. I wouldn't say we've seen a material amount thus far on the raw material side. Either on both the bulk buy or on the tail spend. So that's the upside as we head into the rest of the year is when we start to see an inflection in the raw material volume.\nJohn McNulty: Okay. So you haven't -- actually, you're not buying them lower now. So that's to come and then it still has to work through the P&L. Is that right?\nLori Koch: Yes. Correct.\nEd Breen: I think John, it's important to note that there are individual raw materials where we would be buying at lower prices, but there are others that have maintained an inflation curve. And there are a lot of things that we buy that are very supply driven in terms of the dynamic and it could take quite a while to kind of unlock any kind of relief there. Even if you take a really basic benchmark price and suggest that that could be down already today. So there are puts and takes within the portfolio, but I think yes, the punch line here is that there's well less than $100 million of net benefit in the model that we have today and that's inclusive some of the savings that Lori referenced from logistics and energy, but netting out as we go through the year later some potential give back that could be necessary. So there really isn't that much in there. And yes, I suppose that could present an opportunity as we look forward, but we haven't seen a lot of benefit come through today.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. Okay. Fair enough. And then just one question on the acquisition. So the growth rate from 2019 to 2023 of 12% is a pretty chunky number. But at the same time, if memory recalls, like during the COVID period, medical device demand was actually pretty soft. You didn't have a whole lot of access to surgical suite. So is that 12% understated in your mind or is that kind of a fair run rate and it's just based on the specific products they make maybe it didn't have that pressure that maybe some others in medical devices did. How should we be thinking about that?\nLori Koch: Yes, I mean it wouldn't have had the same magnitude of pressure some of the other providers into the elective surgery. So it's selling into the non-elective type, so kind of more the essential surgery. So wouldn't have seen that as significant of a COVID headwind. So I would say the 12% CAGR that we saw from 2019 to 2023 would be too materially awesome where we see it going forward. We kept see it a little bit decelerating to the high single digit range, but still a really nice growth for us and then obviously really nice growth in 2023 on the back of already underlying strong volume as well as they had some sizable new customer wins that are in the process of ramping and really get to a nice clip as we head into the back half of 2023 as well.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. Thanks very much for the color. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you. Ed, do you have an update on PFAS and the MDL ahead of the upcoming trial in Florida?\nEd Breen: Yes. So the trial comes up in about a month out now, David. And I'll just say we've been talking pretty regularly with the plaintiffs. As I've mentioned last quarter, the judge did a point of mediator who, by the way, is very actively involved with these regular conversations we're having. So we're feeling positive, but I'll leave it at that right now.\nDavid Begleiter: Got it. And can you provide a little more color on the weakness you're seeing in North American construction, resi versus non-resi and any destocking that's still ongoing in that space? Thank you.\nLori Koch: We saw pretty similar volume declines across all three end markets. So do it yourself, residential and commercial markets. And reminder just on the exposure in commercial, it's more so on like the healthcare and education side versus large commercial construction in downtown cities. And so we saw a similar performance from a volume deceleration in all three. We don't have a material pickup in 2023 plans for those markets. So we'll see how they continue to perform, but we don't see an inflection like we do in electronic and construction in general.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nArun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Hope you're doing well. So just looking at the full year guidance of $3.05 billion of EBITDA at the midpoint and your Q2 of $715 million, that would imply that your second half is around $1.62 billion and your first half is around $143 million. So that $190 million uplift or $200 million almost uplift when you look at first half to second half, is that mainly the comps getting easier on the volume side for E&I? Are there any other special items we should kind of consider when we think about that cadence?\nLori Koch: Yes, I mean, it's mostly within E&I that lift and it's going to be more favored to Q4 versus Q3. As you look at slides that we presented on both the smartphones and the semi MSI side. So most of it is that anticipated second half recovery. There is a little bit of seasonality that would play into a first half versus second half comp. But most of it is that is that electronics recovery. And as I had mentioned a little bit more favor to Q4 versus Q3.\nArun Viswanathan: Okay. Thanks. And just one quick one on M&A. So you guys have now reentered the market with the Spectrum acquisition. Would you say that the portfolio transformation is now kind of complete and/or are you still considering other opportunities within the five markets that you've been looking at?\nEd Breen: You're never, I guess, complete, but I would summarize it, yes, we feel like we're complete for a period of time here. We like where we're at. This was the last piece we were looking at. And so, I don't see anything over the next like year just against state of time period. I think we like where the portfolio is at. We just want to operationally run it well.\nArun Viswanathan: Perfect. Thanks.\nEd Breen: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Mike Sison from Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nMike Sison: Hey. Good morning. In terms of Spectrum, is there a pretty big runway in terms of other acquisitions there? You sort of exited plastics, you're back into plastics. And I get it. Healthcare is a much better end market. But is this an opportunity to build a pretty big plastics healthcare unit over time?\nEd Breen: There's definitely more you could add to it. And again, we like it secularly. So that's why we've kind of doubled down in this area. But remember, we have a lot of opportunity between what we already had and they had. So we really like it because of that. So yes, there's other opportunities down the road, but it's just like the layer, we want to get this in, we want to get it synergize, we want to get it really humming with our business. So over the next year, that's what we'll be focused on.\nMike Sison: Then just a quick follow-up when I take a look at Slide 14. Does inventory destocking end in 2Q and even if the third quarter isn't that much of an improvement sequentially, E&I results could improve if the destocking is sort of done.\nLori Koch: Yeah. We do see the desocking moderating in Q2. Yes. So it peaked kind of in the 1Q, 2Q timeframe and then we see it pulling off a bit in Q3, Q4.\nMike Sison: Thank you.\nEd Breen: Thanks.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the call over to Chris Mecray for closing remarks.\nChris Mecray: Yes, thank you everyone for joining our call. And for your reference, a copy of our transcript will be posted on our website. And this concludes the call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Lori Koch",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed, and good morning. Our first quarter financial results reflect our team's ongoing strong focus on execution and operational excellence as we began 2023. In a pressured volume environment within consumer electronics and construction, we are focused on the operational levers within our control to drive solid operating EBITDA and minimize margin impact despite volume decrements in some of our most profitable lines of business. Turning to our financial highlights on Slide 5. First quarter net sales of $3 billion decreased 8% as reported and 3% on an organic basis versus the year ago period. Currency resulted in a 3% headwind from dollar strength against key currencies, most notably the yen, yuan and euro, and we also saw a 2% headwind related to portfolio changes. Breaking down the 3% organic sales decline, 4% pricing gains were more than offset by a 7% volume decline. Pricing reflects the carryover impact of actions taken during 2022 to offset broad based inflation related to raw materials, logistics and energy. Volume decline reflects weakness in consumer electronics resulting from decreased consumer spending, channel inventory destock and softness in construction. Lower volume in these consumer driven short cycle end markets was partially mitigated by ongoing strength in water, automotive, aerospace and healthcare markets. Taken in combination, volume within electronics and construction end markets during the quarter was down high teens in aggregate versus the year ago period, while our remaining businesses were up low single digits. From a regional perspective, Europe and North America sales in the quarter were up 5% and 1%, respectively, on an organic basis, while Asia Pacific was down 10% versus the year ago period. China sales were down nearly 20%, driven principally by the electronics weakness. First quarter operating EBITDA of $714 million decreased 13% versus the year ago period, driven by lower volumes and the impacts of reduced production rates in electronics as we scale that production to better align with demand. Currency was also a headwind. Operating EBITDA margin during the quarter of 23.7% was down 130 basis points, driven by volume pressure and inclusive of mixed headwinds related to lower volumes within the high margin semi business. Decremental margin the quarter was 41%. Given the high teen volume declines in our electronics portfolio, our overall decrementals were disproportionately impacted as these businesses are some of the most profitable within the DuPont portfolio. Adjusted EPS in the quarter of $0.84 per share increased 2% versus last year, which I will detail shortly. Looking at cash performance, cash flow from operations during the quarter of $343 million, less cash paid for CapEx of $241 million resulted in adjusted free cash flow of $102 million. Included within free cash flow, our transaction cost headwinds of about $75 million related to both cash payments associated with the M&M deal closing and ongoing Delrin divestiture costs. Turning to Slide 10, adjusted EPS for the quarter of $0.84 per share increased 2% compared to $0.82 in the year ago period. Headwinds related to overall volume declines were more than offset by the below the line benefits including an $0.11 benefit related to lower net interest expense and a $0.09 benefit due to share repurchases. Including the upfront benefit of our ongoing ASR program initiated last November. Our tax rate for the quarter 23.4% up from 21.8% in the year ago period, resulting in a two set headwind to adjusted EPS driven primarily by geographic mix of earnings. Turning to segment results beginning with E&I on Slide 11. E&I first quarter net sales of $1.3 billion decreased 16% as organic sales declined 13% along with currency headwinds of 2% and unfavorable portfolio impact of 1%. The organic sales declines reflect a 15% decrease in volume, partially offset by a 2% increase in price. The organic sales decrease for E&I was driven by Interconnect Solutions which was down 21% and Semiconductor Technologies, which was down mid-teens. The decline in Interconnect was driven by weak smartphone, PC and tablet demand, along with channel inventory destocking. Our PCB customers in China operate in the first quarter with utilization rates in the mid-40s, which is an expected cycle low. The decline in semi tech results from reduced semiconductor fab utilization rates due to weekend market demand as well as downstream destocking of finished chip inventory. Semi chip fab utilization rates in the first quarter averaged around 80%, which we expect to dip somewhat in the second quarter as these customers work down inventories. We expect recovery and fab rates to begin during the third quarter. Sales for Industrial Solutions were up low single digits on an organic basis as pricing and ongoing strength in Vespel Aerospace products and in healthcare for specifications such as biopharma consumables were partially offset by lower demand in largely consumer driven areas such as advanced printing and lighting applications. Operating EBITDA for E&I of $362 million was down versus the year ago period, primarily due to the drop through impact of volume declines, which corresponds to the lower customer utilization rates just referenced and our lower operating rates, as also mentioned. Turning to Slide 12, W&P first quarter net sales of $1.45 billion increased 1% as organic sales growth of 4% was mostly offset by a 3% currency headwind. Organic growth reflects a 6% increase in price resulting from the carryover impact of pricing actions taken last year, partially offset by a 2% decrease in segment volumes. Organic sales growth was led by Water Solutions, which was up low double digits on strong pricing and continued demand growth for water filtration led by reverse osmosis product lines. Safety solution sales were up mid-single digits on an organic basis on pricing and volume gains. Volume growth was driven by Kapton and Nomex demand in aerospace and automotive markets, especially for EVs, coupled with Tyvek strength in healthcare. Shelter Solutions was down mid-single digits on an organic basis on greater than 10% volume declines due to softness in construction markets, partially offset by pricing. Operating EBITDA for W&P of $344 million increased 1% as pricing and disciplined cost control were largely offset by inflationary cost pressure, primarily related to higher raw material and energy costs, currency headwinds and lower volume. Before I turn it back to Ed, I'll close with a few comments on our financial outlook and guidance for second quarter and full year 2023 on Slide 13. As we look at the current demand environment, we continue to expect ongoing strength throughout the year in areas such as water, automotive, aerospace and healthcare. Within electronics markets, we continue to see weakness in channel inventory destocking in the near term. Based on recent customer feedback, echoed by their public commentary and third party market forecast, we expect customer utilization rates to bottom relatively near term and to improve during the third quarter, which is about a quarter later than previously expected. To highlight these assumptions, we've included current market forecast for both semiconductor and smartphone markets on Slide 14. For semiconductors, third party research now suggests MSI will be down 13% for the full year 2023 compared to estimates last quarter indicating down mid-single digits, with fab utilization expected to ramp back up above 80% beginning in the fourth quarter. For both of these end markets, you can see the expected improvement beginning during the third quarter, which reflects a later and somewhat more gradual pace than the assumptions last quarter. Due to the delay in the near term recovery, we are adjusting the high end of our full year guidance range for net sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS. We now expect full year net sales to be between $12.3 billion and $12.5 billion, operating EBITDA to be between $3 billion and $3.1 billion and adjusted EPS to be between $3.55 and $3.70 per share. For the second quarter 2023, we expect similar results for the first quarter as overall market conditions are anticipated to be generally consistent. On a longer term view, historical data suggests downturns in these markets are short, lasting about three to four quarters, which gives us confidence in the longer term growth for electronics as we get through this year. With that, turn it back to Ed. Good morning. Yes. And on the pricing side. So we saw 4% total in Q1. It was 6% in W&P. We see that decelerating as we lap the 2022 benefits. And so in the second quarter, we expect an overall about 1% price lift, really 2% in W&P and flat B&I. Yes. I think on the on the inventory piece too. So we did take action in the first quarter that was a headwind to E&I margins of about $40 million to $45 million to be able to better align inventory and production rates. And so we saw a headwind there. We'll continue to see that headwind in the second order as well as we try to get inventory more in line with where the demand signal is. But to Ed's point, to just reiterate on the discretionary side, we are doing a fair amount of actions you can see on the face of our P&L that we took about 10% out of our total [SAR] (ph). That was really a function of the restructuring that we did in the tail end of 2022 as well as really tensioning back sales and travel and expense and we'll continue in that mode as we go into 2Q as we said in 2Q as well. Good morning. There's no sequential price declines of any magnitude baked in. It's more just lapping. Last year, the bulk of the raise was in, like, February-March time frame. Yeah. So we still expect continued strength in water. So we had a nice organic growth in the first quarter. On both the price and volume basis and we expect that to continue as we head into the rest of the year. There's a lot of secular trends favoring our water portfolio right now. And on the safety side, we're seeing strength as well in most areas, especially what we highlighted with respect to the Spectrum acquisition on our healthcare portfolio. So we've got about a $500 million medical packaging business in Tyvek that's performing very nicely. So we see those secular trends continuing throughout the rest of 2023. One other area too that we can highlight of growth within the safety portfolio is the EV piece. So there's a nice application for Nomex paper within the e-motor that we're seeing nice growth in the first quarter and we'll look for that to continue as well. Yes. I mean that's still our expectation with three big tailwinds between now and then. One is obviously the volume recover in E&I and getting those margins back into the low 30s. So we dipped in Q1. That was really a reflection of the volume and the actions we took to align production with demand. So that $40 million to $45 million created a headwind in the first quarter. So that is not permanent, that will resolve itself. Another tailwind is the price cost piece. So as we can see a potential future benefit there that will be margin accretive for us. And so, those are the two biggest levers. And then obviously, the final piece is the mix component. So as you get E&I back on its growth trajectory, obviously, it's the highest margin piece of our portfolio. So there's a favorable mix lift there as that market starts to recover. Yes. So 2022 revenue was about $450 million and EBITDA was about $95 million. And even if you back into the numbers that I have mentioned for 2022, that's about a 21% EBITDA margin. 2023 is expected to be 22%, so already 100 basis points of improvement. And they had a really nice first quarter ahead of their management plan actually. So they're on a very nice trajectory to achieve that average $110 million of EBITDA in 2023. Yeah. We would expect to see that. And we actually are seeing some share gains in the [indiscernible] in the packaging space still underneath the numbers that we're reporting. So what is clouding our performance versus the MSI is the destock piece. So the destock is pretty significant, that's going on in the first half that would be another headwind on top of the MSI numbers that we had presented in the deck. And so, that's what's crowding the story a little bit, but we still expect that content and exposure to advances [indiscernible] to be able to give us that performance in total. Yes. So they compete against [TE, Nordson and Integer] (ph) are some of their larger competitors. As far as on the input side, they are -- they use their specialty polymers and design expertise to manufacture very high complexity materials for the large med device players. And so that's -- as I had mentioned earlier, where we see a really nice sweet spot of being able to leverage the two portfolios. They've got really nice positions with the medical device guys and we've got really nice positions with the biopharma guys. So being able to bring our two portfolios, leverage our expertise and material science across the broader portfolio is where we see the opportunity for us ahead. No. You had walked through the pieces. So industrial, we still expect continued strength overall within industrial. There's a little bit of split between interconnect and semi sequentially. So you'll start to see a little bit of the seasonal build that happens normally in interconnect, primarily within this smartphone space. And then we actually see a little bit of sequential deceleration in semi from Q1 to Q2 really a function of what Ed had mentioned earlier on one of the larger customers overbuilding in Q1 and then pulling back in Q2. But net-net, there's not a material change in revenue for the total company or E&I from Q1 to Q2. Yes. I mean, we would -- so right now, we expect that, that headwind that we'll see in the first half of roundly $90 million from pulling back production in E&I not being there in Q3 and Q4 in the second half. And so if this recovery extends into the fourth quarter, then you would expect that $45 million to recur again in the third quarter. The one caveat that we will make that we don't have baked into the guide to that could offset any decremental weakness if the recovery is pushed out is that, price cost piece. So we don't have anything material baked in that could become a tailwind to the second half based on what we see right now versus what we see right now. No. I mean, so the growth we have seen would be more on the industrial side, the business is about 70% favor towards industrial wastewater treatment. So that's what's driving the growth. There's nothing material that we're seeing with respect to any groundwater remediation is coming out from the EPA. Yeah. So we saw around the $800 million of escalation last year. It was about 60% raws and the rest roughly split between logistics and energy. We are seeing deceleration on in the logistics and energy side. So obviously, you can look at European and U.S. natural gas and see there's been a sizable pullback there and the ocean freight rates we're seeing tailwinds as well. And so that's where we're seeing most of the deceleration. I wouldn't say we've seen a material amount thus far on the raw material side. Either on both the bulk buy or on the tail spend. So that's the upside as we head into the rest of the year is when we start to see an inflection in the raw material volume. Yes. Correct. Yes, I mean it wouldn't have had the same magnitude of pressure some of the other providers into the elective surgery. So it's selling into the non-elective type, so kind of more the essential surgery. So wouldn't have seen that as significant of a COVID headwind. So I would say the 12% CAGR that we saw from 2019 to 2023 would be too materially awesome where we see it going forward. We kept see it a little bit decelerating to the high single digit range, but still a really nice growth for us and then obviously really nice growth in 2023 on the back of already underlying strong volume as well as they had some sizable new customer wins that are in the process of ramping and really get to a nice clip as we head into the back half of 2023 as well. We saw pretty similar volume declines across all three end markets. So do it yourself, residential and commercial markets. And reminder just on the exposure in commercial, it's more so on like the healthcare and education side versus large commercial construction in downtown cities. And so we saw a similar performance from a volume deceleration in all three. We don't have a material pickup in 2023 plans for those markets. So we'll see how they continue to perform, but we don't see an inflection like we do in electronic and construction in general. Yes, I mean, it's mostly within E&I that lift and it's going to be more favored to Q4 versus Q3. As you look at slides that we presented on both the smartphones and the semi MSI side. So most of it is that anticipated second half recovery. There is a little bit of seasonality that would play into a first half versus second half comp. But most of it is that is that electronics recovery. And as I had mentioned a little bit more favor to Q4 versus Q3. Yeah. We do see the desocking moderating in Q2. Yes. So it peaked kind of in the 1Q, 2Q timeframe and then we see it pulling off a bit in Q3, Q4."

            "name": "Ed Breen",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you for joining our first quarter 2023 financial review. This morning, we announced quarterly results with operating EBITDA in line and revenue and adjusted EPS slightly better than our previously communicated guidance. This performance reflects our team's continued strong execution, while facing short term volume pressure and select consumer driven short cycle end markets, including electronics and construction. First quarter organic revenue declined 3% versus the year ago period, despite double digit declines from our electronics lines of business of Interconnect Solutions and Semiconductor Technologies. Mitigating the weakness in electronics and construction markets was ongoing broad demand strength in areas including water, automotive, aerospace and healthcare, along with the carryover benefit of pricing actions taken last year to offset inflationary pressure. Adjusted EPS was up 2% as we continue to realize benefits from our ongoing capital allocation strategy. As expected, operating EBITDA declined versus the year ago period, driven by lower volumes. Given the near term slowdown in short cycle end markets, we continue to be proactive in taking actions within our control to minimize volume pressure, while also focusing on optimizing cash flow generation. As a result, we expect to continue to show the resiliency of the new DuPont portfolio and expect that our financial results will generate returns commensurate with top tier multi industrial assets. In addition to our commitment to generating value through delivery of consistent operating performance, we also continue to focus on accretive and value added capital deployment. This morning, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Spectrum a leading manufacturer of critical components and devices for medical end markets for $1.75 billion or $1.72 billion after certain tax attributes. This deal fits with our strategy to focus on the industrial technology's growth pillar, expanding our offerings into the fast growing healthcare market. Turning to Slide 4, we have had our eye on Spectrum, which is a current DuPont customer for a long time and our team is extremely excited for this opportunity. Spectrum is a recognized leader in advanced manufacturing of specialty medical devices and components serving 22 of the top 26 medical device OEMs with relationships that date back decades and a strategic focus on fast growing therapeutic devices and components. Their business is predominantly North American focused and has demonstrated consistent growth over many years. We expect them to generate revenues of about $500 million in 2023. As you can see on Slide 5, DuPont's existing healthcare portfolio is quite strong today. As a reminder, our current healthcare portfolio is comprised of Liveo, medical device and biopharma consumables business, which is a key part of the industrial solutions line of business and our Tyvek healthcare packaging business reported through Safety Solutions. Together, these businesses represent $800 million of total revenue and grow at rates exceeding the company average and well above GDP at solid rates of profitability. The Spectrum business fits nicely with our existing Liveo franchise and will complement our established position in biopharma consumables, bringing world class manufacturing capabilities and deep OEM customer relationships. On Slide 6, you can see the addition of Spectrum to our portfolio is impactful and the combined presence in healthcare will now represent approximately 10% of DuPont's total sales. The transaction adds higher growth while further reducing cyclicality in the portfolio. Also worth noting the transaction significantly increases the total addressable market we serve within healthcare devices. These businesses are expected to grow at high single digit rates over time and even faster in 2023 due to specific business wins in place. This transaction has compelling strategic rationale as you can see on Slide 7. The Spectrum business expands DuPont's growth strategy of customer centered innovation and strengthen our existing stable position in fast growing healthcare end markets. We are excited by the complementary fit and specifically our ability to leverage the strengths from each side to generate incremental growth opportunities on top of already growing core markets. As an example of this on the biopharma side, DuPont Liveo has extensive direct relationships with leading OEMs in the biopharma space and has approved proven design and build co development model. The added advanced manufacturing capabilities enabled by Spectrum will expand its product and capability set to meet stringent customer specifications, essentially adding a new pipeline for the Spectrum side by adding new customer relationships. On the medical device side, as an example, Spectrum has extensive direct relationships with leading OEMs, including with 22 of the top 26 players. Adding Liveo's silicone offerings and DuPont's material science technology will enhance Spectrum's depth cooperation with customers and expand its product offerings. Spectrum is expected to accelerate top line growth for industrial solutions and DuPont as a whole. Regarding deal terms, the net purchase price of $1.72 billion after certain tax adjustments represents a 15.6 EBITDA multiple based on 2023 estimates or 13.2 times after moderate expected cost synergies of $20 million. In line with our return hurdles for capital deployment, the acquisition is expected to deliver high single digit ROIC by year five, excluding revenue synergies that we described. We believe the combined growth opportunities I just mentioned can add incremental value to the business combination. We expect this transaction will close by the end of the third quarter this year, and we do not anticipate significant regulatory hurdles. We plan to finance the transaction with cash on hand. Given a lot of moving parts on our capital allocation over the last six months, let's briefly review our status on Slide 8. From closing of the M&M sale in November through today, we have deployment actions and plans in place to account for the full $11 billion of gross cash received from the sale through a disciplined capital allocation process. In the fourth quarter of last year, we announced a $5 billion share repurchase authorization and took actions to deleverage our balance sheet by paying down $2.5 billion in senior notes and reducing commercial paper from $1.3 billion to zero at year end and remaining undrawn through the first quarter. Regarding share repurchases, we still expect the complete $3.25 billion accelerated share repurchase program launched last November in the third quarter of this year. And remain committed to completing the remaining $2 billion of authorization as an ASR shortly thereafter. Today's announcement to acquire Spectrum with cash on hand essentially completes the deployment of any remaining excess cash from the M&M transaction. In terms of additional cash sources, I will note that we are progressing with our plans to sell the Delrin business and continue to expect that planned transaction to close by year end 2023. Our current capitalization remains very sound with no significant debt maturities until November 2025. Looking through all currently communicated deployment actions inclusive of the Delrin sale, we expect net leverage to finish the year around 2 times. We are comfortable with that leverage point which is more in line with our multi industrial peers and we expect to remain at that level as an equilibrium target going forward. With that, let me turn it over to Lori to review our financial performance and outlook. Thanks, Lori. Before we take your questions, I'd like to highlight that we published our annual sustainability report yesterday, highlighting the ongoing work of our employees across the globe to meet our commitments across all aspects of ESG. As a reminder, our sustainability strategy is grounded in three pillars, innovation, protecting people and the planet and empowering employees and customers. I continue to be proud of the progress we are making on our 2030 goals and remain impressed of the speed in which we are advancing. On climate change, we exceeded our 2030 acting on climate goal to reduce Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 30%, well ahead of schedule. And we have set a new goal which has been validated by SBTi to reach a 50% reduction in emissions by 2030. Regarding innovation, 80% of our top innovation programs deliver sustainability value for customers. Within water, we've helped to enable seawater to be used as a source of potable drinking water with our reverse osmosis technology. We're also helping reduce carbon emissions through building materials innovation and protection. In auto markets, we're making electric vehicle battery safer with our materials for thermal management. And within electronics, we've directly enabled increased performance requirements in semiconductor manufacturing. In our community, we engaged over 500 community projects with over 300 nonprofit partners across 30 countries focused on STEM education. From a DE&I standpoint, many aspects are of inclusive culture continue to be recognized. 2022 marked our second year on Forbes Magazine's world's top female friendly company's list as one example. There are many great examples and stories in the report of how our teams are delivering on our purpose and driving sustainability. Overall, our teams have done a tremendous job. With that, we are pleased to take your questions and let me turn it back to the operator to open the Q&A. Good morning, Steve. Yes. So Delrin, we're expecting to close by the end of the year. And we've been doing all the carve out work. So we're very far along on accomplishing all that. I'm not going to talk about what we sell it for, but the EBIT is about $180 million on the business. So you kind of figure out the zip code on that as we move forward. Again, that cash should be somewhere kind of in the year beginning of next year. Yes, we have not changed that, Steve. Maybe we're being conservative, obviously, as we've said before, we've worked very hard with our teams on how we're going to handle this. As we move forward, the timing is -- we're seeing a little bit of it by the way because of logistics and shipping rates being down. But the big bulk of it will be on the raws. It will be more on the W&P side. And remember, by the time we renegotiate contracts and then you've got like a four month window to get it through our supply chain into a finished good that's sold to kind of figure out timing of it, but we have not changed the assumption which is very little of the $800 million that we raised pricing. And we'll just update everybody as we get to next quarter on that and we'll have a clearer picture of what that potentially is. Thanks, Steve. Good morning, Jeff. Yes, Jeff. Our leaning right now is nothing else on the radar screen over the next year on the M&A side. We want to get the spectrum deal done, focus on that. By the way, the Laird acquisition we did the other year is going extremely well. So I think there's nothing that we're excited about that we see out there. This one, by the way, we've had our eyes on for quite a period of time. As I think we said in our comments, they're actually a customer of ours. So this is really where we've been focused for the last kind of year, year and a half with our thinking. If I had to say right now with any extra proceeds, I think we would lean towards additional share repurchase. But remember to Lori's comments, it's still going to be about over the next year that we're still taking shares out of the market, existing ASR as we said. And then we'll -- as soon as we finish this one, we'll launch the new ASR for $2 billion, and that will take us till about the end of the first quarter of 2024. So any excess cash we'll deal with at that point in time, but it depends on the environment, obviously, but if the environment were like it is now where the multiple is for the company. My good is, we lean towards share repurchase. Just as an overall comment though, Jeff, it's interesting. The semi -- you go back and study all the other downturn. Remember semi is a great industry, by the way, it's going to go up the next couple of decades, but you always do hit these pockets of some destock and some softness. So -- but this actually for us when you look at our sales rates, semi started coming down at the beginning of the four quarter. So we're two full quarters into the downturn. Now we think the quarter right we are in now is the bottom, just slightly down more from the first quarter. When you look at them, they're usually three to maximum four quarters of a destock. Remember, a lot of this is destock on top of some consumer softness obviously. So we're pretty deep into it. It would appear having said that to your direct question though, we've got a couple other layers of actions we would take on the cost side to protect ourselves. And then back to the conversation we just had with Steve Tusa, obviously, we're going to work this price cost thing real hard and haven't baked a ton in at this point in time. So that would be where the two levers would be. Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, Scott. Yes. Well, Scott, we didn't take into account any revenue synergies. So let me just talk the cost piece a second. We only put in $20 million of cost synergies, which by the way is only 3% to 4% of revenue, which is, obviously, a low compared to what deals normally are on the synergy side. So I think our net 13.2 times is pretty conservative based on just that $20 million. The real opportunity here is going to be on the growth side. Remember, our relationships at DuPont are mainly and by the way they're very deep relationships are with the biopharma OEMs. Spectrums are more with the medical device OEMs, but a lot of our technology actually goes through companies like Spectrum into that industry. So when we look at the ability for DuPont to move its technologies and material science into the medical device market with Spectrum and [indiscernible] the opposite of that Spectrum moving into the biopharma space. And when we look at the joint opportunities we could have together, we could drive some nice incremental growth there. And by the way, we've been talking to them and looking at this opportunity that I'm talking to for a very long time. So I think that's the big benefit. Can we get some more cost synergies? Probably can, but we haven't counted on it yet. But it will be the growth. This business has been growing. You can see in our charts kind of right around 10% over the last four years, it's going to actually grow faster this year. They've got a couple of big new wins from OEM customers. And then, we can broaden it out a little bit more globally because of our footprint on the Liveo side. But remember, a lot of the medical device players are U.S. based companies that sell globally. The other opportunity, Scott, the other big one we have is, we have a path to get the margins of Spectrum up about 300 basis points. They very recently, I say in the last year, put in a fair amount of new production capacity that's getting filled up because just the growth rate, they've been on. When you think about four years a row of 10%. So they have a fair amount that they're just completing on the factory expansion side. And as we fill those assets and get them utilized, we'll drive the margins up another 300 basis points. So that would -- that to me would even be a bigger lever than the cost one. It'd be more of that margin expansion and then the revenue opportunity. Thanks, Scott. Good morning. Yes, it's exactly what you said. It's more higher interest rate environment we are in. And I think it's just prudent to set there. By way, not the number one reason, but another reason is, the premier multi industrial companies are all, if you look at it, kind of centered around 2 times leverage. We were kind of targeted up at that 2.75. So we think that this environment interest rate environment, it's just a prudent place to be. And so that's where we'll end the year about there, maybe actually a little slightly below 2 times depending on the Delrin proceeds that we get. And then, we always have -- we preserve our strategic flexibility there, but that's kind of where we'd like to target ourselves moving forward. But really the interest rate environment is the key reason. Thanks, Mike. No, it's in there. We have a pay -- I mean, just the growth rate they're on right now, if you look at it, they're going to be -- I won't get into specific numbers. They'll be north of 10% growth this year. So just adding that leverage into the system really moves the needle for us, especially when they built new capacity in place and you're sitting there with it, you're hiring people on, you're just kind of going through that digestion period as you're ramping up. So as we said, their revenues this year, Lori, just mentioned 2022, the revenues this year will be like $500 million. So nice growth trajectory and you just play those numbers through the system, that's where you get to. No, there's no seasonal reason, Vincent. It's hard to tell exactly what month it is in there. But we've modeled all the other downturns. Remember, this downturn is pretty significant now, 13% down is correct. You're hitting it pretty quick on the destocking. And then, by the way, there's one other factor here that kind of pushed it out a little bit. One of the very large semiconductor players kept running hard on their fab utilization through the first quarter and that's public knowledge. I'm not going to mention the name, but one of the big players. So that is creating also the fact that they got to take their utilization down pretty rapidly here. And I think they just talked publicly about that a week or so ago. So that was one of the other reasons that gets kind of pushed it out a little and they got to go through destock also. Yes, John, it's something we've been looking at how to report it. It's interesting. Yes, healthcare will be 10% of the portfolio now. The water business by the way is developed into 10% of the portfolio. I think both really nice good secular end markets for us over coming years at higher growth rates, obviously, both of those. So we'll take a look at that. We don't -- we'll probably look at it as we enter 2024 to see if we do anything, but no decision on that yet. No, because it's a short cycle business, so you can't really -- we'll have a little bit of lift as Lori said in the ICS business. And that's typical for us as she said, you're going into the holiday season later in the year. So we start our shipments and you can see one of our charts, just the smartphone piece alone picks in third, fourth quarter there. So we begin shipments there. But past that, it's short cycle business and we'll see it and we'll ship it pretty quick. And remember, Steve, 70% of that business is recurring. We're replacing membranes and all at these industrial sites. And it's just a secular trend that should continue because including DuPont, we're all working on that for our ESG targets. And it's besides greenhouse gas emissions, it's the other big one. No, it's a core business for us. I remember a very key component of that is our Tyvek franchise, which is a very nice margin business for us against all of the end markets that we service with Tyvek, including the construction market. Obviously, Lori mentioned a really nice market for that is medical packaging. So it's definitely part of the portfolio. Thanks. I think John, it's important to note that there are individual raw materials where we would be buying at lower prices, but there are others that have maintained an inflation curve. And there are a lot of things that we buy that are very supply driven in terms of the dynamic and it could take quite a while to kind of unlock any kind of relief there. Even if you take a really basic benchmark price and suggest that that could be down already today. So there are puts and takes within the portfolio, but I think yes, the punch line here is that there's well less than $100 million of net benefit in the model that we have today and that's inclusive some of the savings that Lori referenced from logistics and energy, but netting out as we go through the year later some potential give back that could be necessary. So there really isn't that much in there. And yes, I suppose that could present an opportunity as we look forward, but we haven't seen a lot of benefit come through today. Yes. So the trial comes up in about a month out now, David. And I'll just say we've been talking pretty regularly with the plaintiffs. As I've mentioned last quarter, the judge did a point of mediator who, by the way, is very actively involved with these regular conversations we're having. So we're feeling positive, but I'll leave it at that right now. You're never, I guess, complete, but I would summarize it, yes, we feel like we're complete for a period of time here. We like where we're at. This was the last piece we were looking at. And so, I don't see anything over the next like year just against state of time period. I think we like where the portfolio is at. We just want to operationally run it well. Great. Thanks. There's definitely more you could add to it. And again, we like it secularly. So that's why we've kind of doubled down in this area. But remember, we have a lot of opportunity between what we already had and they had. So we really like it because of that. So yes, there's other opportunities down the road, but it's just like the layer, we want to get this in, we want to get it synergize, we want to get it really humming with our business. So over the next year, that's what we'll be focused on. Thanks."

We have prepared slides to supplement our remarks, which are posted on DuPont's website under the Investor Relations tab and through the webcast link. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the slides. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Our Form 10-K as updated by our current and periodic reports, includes detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties, which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today are on a continuing operations basis and exclude significant items. We will also refer to other non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in our press release and presentation materials and have been posted in DuPont's Investor Relations website. I'll now turn the call over to Lori, who will begin.\nLori Koch: Good morning, and thanks, everyone, for joining our third quarter call. Earlier today, we reported another strong quarter of financial performance with continued sequential improvement across all key financial metrics. We posted a solid quarter highlighted by year-over-year growth for consolidated net sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Third quarter sales of $3.2 billion included a return to organic sales growth which increased 3% versus the year ago period. Operating EBITDA of $857 million increased 11%, with operating EBITDA margin increasing 150 basis points to 26.8%. Third quarter adjusted EPS of $1.18 increased 28% year-over-year. We also delivered another strong quarter of cash generation with transaction-adjusted free cash flow conversion of 130%, highlighting our disciplined working capital management. For the full year 2024, we are raising our guidance for operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS, which Antonella will detail shortly. From an end market view, the Electronics and Industrial segment saw another quarter of double-digit sales growth in both the semi and Interconnect Solutions lines of business, which continued to benefit from strong demand for advanced node chips and AI enabling technologies. In the Water & Protection segment, we saw better-than-expected sequential improvement in water, including continued stabilization in China volumes. We also saw further sequential sales lift in medical packaging end markets, which are returning to more normalized buying patterns. Overall, I'm encouraged by our continued positive results. Volume recovery has been a key driver of our financial performance, coupled with our team's continued strong operational execution and helped by savings from the restructuring actions taken earlier this year. I am pleased to say we have made real progress with our operational excellence initiatives with benefits seen in improved margins and working capital and enhanced customer reliability metrics. By fostering our culture of continuous improvement and equipping our teams with the right tools and training, we are well positioned to unlock long-term value across each business line. Specific to the trading aspect we have been actively investing in our people and have completed around 30,000 hours of training year-to-date. We count on operational excellence to drive productivity every year as a key offset to inflation. Through focus on process optimization, we have successfully reduced costs across critical operations with benefits from increased uptime, leading to incremental capacity release and lower fixed and variable costs. All in, we are pleased to report a strong third quarter and are well positioned for a solid finish to the year. I'll now turn the call over to Ed, who can provide a few comments around our progress on the planned separations on Slide 4.\nEdward Breen: Thanks, Lori, and good morning, everyone. We clearly remain focused on driving results and demonstrating the performance potential of our portfolio while also advancing our plans to unlock value through the previously announced separations of our electronics and water businesses. We remain excited about this value creation opportunity and believe our investors broadly appreciate the potential that we expect these 3 industry-leading companies to realize by leveraging tailored growth strategies. Our teams remain highly motivated and have the experience to ensure that the new companies are prepared to operate and execute from day 1. We continue to make progress on our separation related work streams. We are also working diligently to accelerate our timing to potentially complete the separations closer to the earlier end of the 18- to 24-month time line set at our May announcement, and we'll update you as we progress. In addition, we are making progress in establishing the new boards, which have been a major focus of mine, and we expect to be able to announce Board members of each company, along with key executive leadership appointments for Electronics and Water by the end of the first quarter of 2025. With that, I'll turn it over to Antonella, who will cover our financial results and outlook.\nAntonella Franzen: Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased that our third quarter results reflect sequential improvement across all key financial metrics and a return to organic sales growth at the consolidated level. Both earnings and cash flow benefited from volume recovery and improved production rates at key operating sites and our team has executed well on productivity and cost actions announced last year. Turning to Slide 5, I will cover our third quarter financial highlights in further detail. Net sales of $3.2 billion increased 4% versus the year ago period on organic sales growth of 3% and favorable portfolio impact of 2%, reflecting contributions from both the Spectrum and Donatelle acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by a 1% currency headwind. The organic sales growth of 3% reflects a 5% increase in volume, partially offset by a 2% decrease in price. Higher volume was driven by continued broad-based growth in electronics end markets with semi and Interconnect Solutions volumes both up double digits, coupled with the return to year-over-year volume growth in Water Solutions. On a segment view, E&I organic sales grew 10%, and  W&P's quarterly organic sales decline moderated further to 2% on its way to an anticipated return to positive growth in the fourth quarter. Organic sales in corporate declined 6% versus the year ago period driven by continued weakness in China solar markets, which led us to exit a photovoltaic film product line during the third quarter. This product line represents less than 1% of consolidated net sales. From a regional perspective, Asia Pacific delivered 9% organic sales growth versus the year ago period, led by another strong quarter in China, where organic sales were up low double digits, driven by electronics end markets. In other regions, organic sales in Europe grew 1%, while North America was down 2%. Second quarter operating EBITDA of $857 million increased 11% versus the year ago period as volume gains along with improved plant utilization and savings from restructuring actions were partially offset by higher variable compensation and select growth investments. Operating EBITDA margin during the quarter increased to 26.8%, up 150 basis points versus the year ago period and up 160 basis points on a sequential basis. Third quarter reflected another period of strong cash generation and conversion, reflecting both improved volumes as well as strong working capital discipline across each business line. On a continuing operations basis, cash flow from operations of $737 million, less capital expenditures of $109 million and $12 million of separation-related transaction cost payments resulted in transaction-adjusted free cash flow of $640 million and related conversion of 130%. Turning to Slide 6. Adjusted EPS for the quarter of $1.18 per share increased 28% from $0.92 in the year ago period. Higher segment earnings of $0.14 as well as the benefit of a lower share count of $0.09 and lower tax rate of $0.6 were partially offset by higher depreciation of $0.03. Our base tax rate for the quarter was 19.8%, down from 24.6% a year ago, driven by certain discrete tax benefits recorded in the current period. We now estimate our full year 2024 base tax rate to be approximately 23.5%. Turning to segment results, beginning with E&I on Slide 7. E&I third quarter sales of $1.6 billion increased 13% versus the year ago period, had organic sales growth of 10% and the Spectrum and Donatelle sales contribution of 4% were slightly offset by a 1% currency headwind. Organic sales growth of 10% reflects an 11% increase in volume, slightly offset by a 1% decrease in price. As the line of business level, organic sales per study were up more than 20% for the second consecutive quarter, reflecting continued overall semi demand recovery driven by AI technology ramps and share gains in certain products. Semi demand was notably strong in China including continued customer prebuying, similar to what we saw last quarter. As we move forward, we expect China demand to normalize but still remain strong. Overall, Semi-fab utilization continues to improve, averaging 76% during the quarter, though notably stronger for advanced node chips due in part to AI-related demand acceleration. Interconnect Solutions delivered another strong quarter as well, with organic sales up low double digits, reflecting continued broad-based electronic recovery, including a demand benefit from AI-driven technology ramps. We saw content and share gains within high-value electronics applications and the volume recovery within the overall printed circuit board space. The year-over-year sales decline in Industrial Solutions continued to moderate as organic sales were down slightly during the quarter. and strength in printing and packaging applications was offset by ongoing volume headwinds for Kalrez. Also within Industrial Solutions, we completed the acquisition of Donatelle, a medical device manufacturer at the end of August. We are very pleased with the integration of Donatelle into Spectrum and are seeing the potential benefit to leverage Donatelle technology and capabilities to other businesses as well as cross-selling opportunities within our health care platform. Operating EBITDA for E&I of $467 million was up 22% versus the year ago period driven by volume growth, the impact of higher production rates, savings from restructuring actions as well as the earnings contribution from Spectrum and Donatelle. These gains offset by higher variable compensation and select growth investments related primarily to the ongoing transition to advanced nodes and new and ramping AI applications across to semi and Interconnect solutions. Operating EBITDA margin during the quarter was 30.1% up 210 basis points versus the year ago period. Turning to Slide 8. W&P third quarter net balance of $1.4 billion declined 2% versus the year ago period primarily due to price headwinds as overall segment volumes were flat. Within Safety Solutions, Organic sales were down mid-single digits, largely on price declines, although with lower volume driven mainly by private medical packaging. We did see a second consecutive quarter of sequential sales growth in medical packaging with sales up 10% in Q3. Shelter Solutions sales were down slightly on an organic basis with headwinds in North American residential construction market, mostly offset by growth in commercial construction. The third quarter is it a return to year-over-year sales growth for Water Solutions where organic sales were up low single digits. Higher volumes were driven by strength in ultrafiltration technologies along with continued volume recovery in China. On a sequential basis, Water Solutions sales also increased for our second consecutive quarter with sales up 3%, which was better than our expectations coming into the quarter. Operating EBITDA for W&P during the quarter of $364 million was up 1% versus the year ago period as productivity and savings from restructuring actions more than offset the organic revenue decline and higher variable compensation. Operating EBITDA margin during the quarter was 26.3%, up 70 basis points from the year ago period. As alluded to the fourth quarter, we expect strong volume growth on a year-over-year basis. Moving to our outlook on Slide 9. For the fourth quarter, we expect net sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS of about $3.07 billion, $790 million and $0.98 per share, respectively. On a year-over-year basis, our fourth quarter guidance assumes sales and earnings growth from both E&I and W&P, translating to total company growth in net sales of about 6%. Operating EBITDA of 10% and adjusted EPS of 13%. Sequentially, we assume normal seasonal declines in our electronics and construction markets. Additionally, as I mentioned earlier, we expect to see a moderation of growth in China as prebuying and semi plays out as well as the impact of exiting the PV film product line. Partially offsetting these sequential declines is the continued recovery in water and medical packaging end markets. For the full year 2024, we are raising our earnings guidance above the high end of our prior range and now expect operating EBITDA of about $3.125 billion and adjusted EPS of $3.90 per share, which reflects 12% EPS growth year-over-year. With that, we are pleased to take your questions, and let me turn it back to the operator to open the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.\nChristopher Mecray: Thanks Pam. We can come back to him.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Melius Research.\nScott Davis: Congrats on the quarter. And I wanted to come back to your comments on the -- it looks like the bid ask on the 18 to 24 months has narrowed down a bit. But what are the work -- you put the work streams on Slide 4, 6 of them. But like what are the gating factors? Kind of why do you feel a little bit more comfortable today perhaps than 3 months ago in that time frame getting shorter.\nEdward Breen: Yes. Yes, we've made great progress. Two of the longer poles in the tent of the legal entity work and the IT work to separate everything, and the teams have made tremendous progress on that. So our confidence level is definitely up, and that's why we made the comment that we might be more on the 18-month time line somewhere and maybe in that ZIP code, which if we could get it all the way to that would be December 2025. So we'll keep you posted on that. we're pretty positive. We're going to move it in. The issue is can we move it in all that way.\nScott Davis: Okay. Fair enough. And guys, the electronics business, the prebuy that you've talked about that the last 2 quarters. What -- why is there -- I guess maybe I can get to back up a little bit, why is there a prebuy? Are they concerned about not having enough or are you not being able to supply enough product on time. Why do they want to build inventory, I guess?\nLori Koch: Yes. So a lot of it ties around the. Yes. So a lot of it, Scott, is around the new fabs that are being put in place in China. So last quarter, we had mentioned $30 million in total, $20 million of which was in semi. This quarter is another $20 million for a total of $40 million over the second half. And it's really the new fabs coming online. So about half of the global fabs that are being constructed are in China, there's about 7 of them for 4 in the logic space and 3 in the memory space. And as they bring their new fabs online, they prebuy to get through qualifications in the ramp. So it's really a function of that from the prebuy perspective that we had quoted.\nScott Davis: That's what happens when you're not a tech analyst. I had no idea. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.\nC. Stephen Tusa: Just a lot going on today, I guess. Can you just talk about the trends you saw in exiting September and October, just for broadly the various businesses in the portfolio? Anything move around materially?\nLori Koch: No, minus the normal seasonality that you see in the quarter with the last month being the strongest primarily in the water space, there wasn't a lot of variability as we exited the quarter. I mean as we go into the fourth quarter, we have the usual seasonal sweetness that we see primarily within the Electronics space and the Shelter space. . And as you recall, we had done on the last earnings call, we had mentioned that the recovery kind of came early and the seasonality that you normally would see from 2Q to 3Q was a little muted. And therefore, do you see the seasonality as you head into the fourth quarter, you have to compare the fourth quarter to the second quarter, and that's where you see that about $100 million that we typically see between the Electronics and the Shelter space.\nC. Stephen Tusa: Okay. And then in the W&P margins, anything unusual there, really strong margins in the quarter? And anything going on there? Any raw material relief or maybe price/cost, something like that?\nLori Koch: Yes. We were really pleased with the margins that we saw. It's a lot of operational execution that we've been driving across the whole company. So we took a lot of restructuring actions earlier this year. We're seeing the benefit of those. We're driving productivity and operational excellence. We shuttered a couple of lines -- older lines in the U.S. in the safety business that are nicely impacting our margin profile. So we're encouraged by the 26% plus that we posted in Q3.\nC. Stephen Tusa: So that should be able to leverage nicely as volumes come back, I would assume.\nLori Koch: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Parkinson from Wolfe Research.\nChristopher Parkinson: Just want to dig in a little bit more into the semi tech side of it. I mean, clearly, you have some benefits from some of the Chinese fabs. But can you just dig in a little bit more by product substrate in terms of the pad slurries? It just seems like there's a bit of a bifurcation between some of the product categories versus others based on what evolving in the marketplace. So any color there would be particularly helpful.\nLori Koch: Yes. I mean we saw strength across all the key semi technologies. So within the CMP space with pads and slurries within the listed space, we saw really nice results in the clean space. So it's a combination of one, the market recovery from the destock that happened last year. Two, the strength that we have in China. So we are a larger footprint in China than some of our peers, and that's where a lot of the new fab construction is going on a lot outsized recovery is happening. And then our exposure to advanced nodes versus the legacy nodes and DRAM versus memory is driving our results. So we had been up 50% plus in China. So that was a key driver of the overall sentiment results being up in the low 20% range.\nChristopher Parkinson: That's helpful. And just as a follow-up on the W&P side, you've got some things going pretty well, but it still seems like the macro is overall a little bit sluggish. Just digging to the water side of it, can you hit on kind of the drivers of the ultrafiltration strength? It seems like China is kind of beginning to turn the corner. Just how we should ultimately be thinking about that? Is this now back to normalization as we kind of get into 2025? Or are there any other considerations we should be looking at?\nAntonella Franzen: Yes. We should start to see activity more normalized now. I think we're clearly past the worse of it. We've seen sequential improvement from the first quarter to the second quarter. We saw it again going into Q3. And and we would expect we continue to see some sequential improvement as we move into Q4. So overall, the business has definitely gotten back to where -- getting close back to where we used to be. I would tell you, the activity in China has improved, the ultrafiltration activity, in particular, just in any one region to call it out, but we're definitely seeing much better activity overall in water and have kind of passed the destock.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.\nVincent Andrews: Maybe just one more item of something that needs to turn the corner a little bit is the Kalrez destocking. Are you sort of at the bottom of that? And should we start to see that inflect?\nLori Koch: Yes, we're definitely at the bottom. We actually saw a sequential improvement. We're still seeing year-over-year headwinds. So we expect the business to continue to stabilize and see recovery as we head into 2025. So just a reminder of the Kalrez end markets, it is largely semi-CapEx exposed. So the long-term profile and expectations for topline growth in that business are very sound as there continues to be an expectation of mid-single-digit capacity expansions within the semi space.\nVincent Andrews: And then I'd be curious to get your thoughts on interest rates. I think we've all been sort of poised and waiting for these cuts and they're kind of starting to happen, but the curve is not sort of behaving the way I think we all thought it would and that the back end has kind of stayed high and the front end has come down. So maybe you could just talk about if rates do get cut, which parts of your businesses will benefit the most from the front end coming down versus which parts really need the back end to come down?\nLori Koch: Yes. I mean, on the front end, it would be the construction market, primarily the North America residential space. And so we had mentioned in our 4Q expectations that they're a little needed in the Shelter space because the rate cuts didn't happen quickly. And as we'll see what happens here at the next meeting the expectations is that they'll cut again. But I would say that front end that's our largest exposure with respect to positive movement rates continue to slide down, more broadly, obviously, the lower rate versus broader economic activity that we see for all of our businesses.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Josh Spector of UBS.\nJoshua Spector: I wanted to ask on not necessarily the spin time line per se, but really, are there alternatives still being explored for any of the businesses, Water or Electronic outside of the spins be it the sale or RMT? And just if you are, how do you think about maybe achieving something there versus the spin time line? What would be more important to you?\nEdward Breen: Yes. No, it's a little simpler than that, Josh. Our plan is to do the separation of both Water and Electronics, and we're moving very rapidly down that road. As we mentioned on the prepared remarks, we're talking to potential Board members already, and we'll be making Board announcements for the companies and management announcements for those companies during the first quarter of next year.\nJoshua Spector: Okay. Clear enough. And on the core business, I wanted to ask about -- you had some comments about increased investments, increased variable comp. Obviously, some of that makes sense given the better operating performance. But I was wondering if we think about the level of investment taking place now, is that fully back to normal in that if we look at growth, the incrementals become higher as we look forward? Or are you still investing at a lower level given demand remains tepid.\nLori Koch: Yes. I mean we're not going gangbusters, right? So we had some growth investments primarily within the Electronics space as we look to continue to take advantage of the AI recovery. And we had mentioned the variable compensation headwinds and you can see in our proxy results from last year, our variable compensation within an average of 50% payoff, so that would be as been as we head into 2024. We continue to keep button down until we're really confident that we've got recovery across the board. We continue to make CapEx levels at the same level as where they were last year. And we'll continue to expect to revise this down as best we can below the 5% level comp. And I wouldn't expect any outsized investments. We continue to be really smart. One of the key areas, I think, that's driving the margin profile that we're seeing and we did take a lot of actions, especially on the plant fixed cost front as we saw the volumes decline last year, and we've done a really nice job keeping those out even those volumes have recovered. So that's also driving a piece of our margin recovery.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Roberts of Mizuho.\nJohn Ezekiel Roberts: Is China about 50% of the electronic sales and how much of that would be made in China for China as opposed to imported into China and might have some risk from some trade retaliation by China.\nLori Koch: Yes. So China is about 30% of electronic sales. So about half of that is China for China and the other half does any come back out for global consumption.\nJohn Ezekiel Roberts: Okay.  And then how is advanced mobility looking with the slowdown in both EVs and ICE vehicles outside of China?\nLori Koch: Yes. So we continue to see nice performance within the BEV side. We just got a really nice long term being with one of the large European OEMs within the battery adhesive space. So it is muted to growth expectations just as everybody else is with respect to IHS revising down their expectations for total sales across the space, but we continue to be encouraged more broad based and longer-term BEV transition.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov of KeyBanc.\nAleksey Yefremov: In Interconnect, could you discuss 2 things, The share gains that you cite  and then the AI-driven ramps, what products are you seeing ramping in AI? What kind of applications.\nLori Koch: Yes. On the AI side, in the packaging space within the Interconnect business. So we're seeing nice improvement there. And on the share gain side, it's also -- it's a function of being greater share of wallet with some of our key customers as we expand beyond just the phones and some of the other devices that our key customers are producing. So pleased with the results there. We had mentioned, I think, on the last call about a lot of the ICS being driven by thermal management and packaging opportunities, and that continues to play out.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.\nDavid Begleiter: Lori, E&I margins were above 30% in the quarter. Is that level sustainable for the entirety of 2025?\nLori Koch: Yes. We've seen nice margin growth in both segments, both E&I and W&P. It's a little early to talk about specifics of 2025 at this point, but we are encouraged. There's not one-timers is driving that number, I'll say from that perspective. So as long as you can maintain the top line numbers that we're posting and the productivity initiatives should stay in place that we're driving, and we should be in a nice position to get back to that more normalized margin profile for E&I.\nDavid Begleiter: Very good. And just in Safety Solutions, what's driving the decrease in pricing?\nAntonella Franzen: So I think it's important to keep in mind that when you look over the last couple of years, particularly in some select businesses, we did have price increases that were in the mid-teens, which more than covered our cost increase. And so it wouldn't be too surprising that we would give back a couple of points in order to maintain share as we go forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Frank Mitsch of Fermium Research.\nFrank Mitsch: Nice results. I want to say on the price -- I want to stay on the pricing area. And E&I, price was down 1%. Volumes were very impressive, but price was down a percent. You have to go back to the second quarter of last year when you saw price flat since then it's been ticking down. Can you expand upon what's driving the lower price and what your outlook is there?\nAntonella Franzen: You look specifically at E&I,to your point, typically, there is about a point of price giveback. A lot of it relates to new products kind of coming into the market. and volumes going up. So there's typically about one point in price historically what we see in E&I. And we would expect that trend to continue as we go forward.\nFrank Mitsch: Got you. So as you're pricing new products, you're giving discounts to the customers?\nEdward Breen: No. You're getting price on the new product introduction, Frank, but you get paid a little bit of price gain on older products which are -- that's very typical of the Electronics business like that. Forget the last couple of years have been crazy times with COVID and destocking and all that, but that's typically been the model. It's a higher growth business more up in the mid- to high teens, but you give up about 10% of price.\nFrank Mitsch: All right. Understood. And just on the restructuring benefits, I believe the last time you mentioned it was going to be about $115 million benefit in 2024. Is that still a good number? And any initial thoughts on 2025?\nAntonella Franzen: Yes. Actually, that benefit number is a bit higher. We got to our quarterly run rate of benefits in the third quarter. So we are getting a nice impact to this year. There will be a little bit of carry forward as we go into 2025.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Sison of Wells Fargo.\nMichael Sison: Nice quarter and outlook. Ed, a lot of the chemical companies thus far have kind of painted an exciting picture for the first half of '25 and maybe '25 in total. As you've noted, your end markets are different. So I know it's a little bit early to get specific outlook for 2025, but could you sort of give us your thoughts on how maybe Semiconductors, Electronics and some of the Water and Industrial businesses shape up for next year?\nEdward Breen: Yes. I'll let Lori walk you through some detail just I don't mean this flippantly, but to make a comment, we really worked the portfolio very differently than we were 5, 6, 7 years ago away from chemical company into a multi-industrial. And I think you see that a lot of our end markets that we're in right now. But I'll let Lori, maybe walk you through some puts and takes.\nLori Koch: Yes. No, there's no significant changes from the commentary we had provided on the last call about some initial 2025 expectations. So from an Electronics perspective, we continue to expect semi to growth to accelerate, really driven by the AI and the new fabs coming online. And just a reminder that the memory market and some of the more mature technology markets haven't recovered yet. So that recovery is on the come as we head into 2025. There's also on the Interconnect side, continued utilization the PCB space, especially as you look for a refresh cycle within the AI space and consumer devices. Within W&P, we expect Tyvek Healthcare to continue to recover. As we had mentioned, we saw a sequential lift from Q2 to Q3 of 10%. We expect a further sequential lift into Q4 and then normalized buying patterns as we head into 2025.  And we expect a more normalized demand environment within Interconnect and Water, we'll expect to continue to recover as well. So no changes from what we said last year or last quarter with respect to 2025.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Patrick Cunningham of Citi.\nPatrick Cunningham: Are you still anticipating price givebacks in Shelter in 4Q and maybe into 2025? And what was the dynamic between positive growth in commercial construction versus resi? And any sort of early view on a broad-based resi recovery into next year?\nAntonella Franzen: Yes. Given what we saw in pricing this year and as we're exiting the year, you would expect that you would have some price give back carryforward going into 2025. But I think the one thing that you got to keep in mind is we still have to take a deep look at where our costs next year relative to raws, logistics and utilities and that will determine if there's any pluses or minuses associated with them. So I would expect that as we go forward. In terms of the resi as a construction market, they are -- we are seeing a little bit less activity than what we originally anticipated. As Lori mentioned earlier, when you look at kind of rates and where they are, there were a few rate cuts that were expected in 2024. I mean we had one, so we had a little too late in the building cycle to really have an impact. So as we go in the next year, I would say, in terms of the construction markets, we would expect low single-digit activity, and I think that, that's kind of predicated on some additional rate cuts coming. But we'll see what happens.\nEdward Breen: Our current midpoint of guidance in the fourth quarter seemed slightly less price impact than we saw during the third quarter.\nPatrick Cunningham: Understood. Very helpful. And then just on consolidated W&P, I mean it seems you have easier comps on water, medical packaging. Does most of that sequential EBITDA decline come from more typical seasonality on Shelter and Safety. And if you could remind us what was the $25 million discrete impact from last year, and that won't repeat this year just for clarification.\nAntonella Franzen: Yes. So the Q3 to Q4 in W&P would be your typical seasonality. Q3 tends to be the highest quarter and comes down a bit. In Q4, a big piece of that would be related to the Shelter business as we kind of go into the winter months. For W&P explicitly, we did call out about $25 million of onetime items last year that were related to a land sale and some supply agreements that we had certainly benefits from, I would say. Keep in mind that in totality, in Q4 of last year, we actually called out $40 million of onetime items. The remaining $15 million wasn't in corporate.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John McNulty of BMO Capital Markets.\nBhavesh Lodaya: This is Bhavesh Lodaya for John. Can you talk about some of the competitive dynamics around your Electronic peers in China. China is bringing in a lot of new fabs, as you mentioned, but they also invest in kind of like a homegrown domestic supply chain. You mentioned gaining some market share, I'm not sure if that was in China as well. But overall, how do you see this landscape developing over the next few years?\nLori Koch: Yes, we can continue to have a nice position within China. I think our exposure in China within the semi space is outsized versus some of the peers. So we're about 30% in China, where some of the peers I think are less than that. So you're seeing that, that disparity play out nicely in our numbers as a lot of the builds are more concentrated there with respect to the global outlet. We have a nice position with the local players. As we have mentioned, we able to have nice positions with the global OEMs that are in China that are favoring our China results as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets.\nArun Viswanathan: Just wanted to go back to maybe some initial thoughts on '25. So this year, you showed -- it looks like you're showing pretty good mid-teens EBITDA growth in E&I, although you have been -- that's been offset slightly by some of that Water destocking and headwinds. As you look into next year, maybe if you adjust for the prebuy that you saw in E&I, would that kind of decrease maybe to like a high single-digit rate and then -- but maybe you could see some recovery in W&P. And so overall, you still expect maybe mid- to high single-digit EBITDA growth for next year?\nAntonella Franzen: So that's where I provided some color on the top line. That's where our expectations are. I would say it's a bit too early to start commenting on EBITDA growth for next year. We'll give more detailed guidance as we get on to the next quarter call. But clearly, volume will be a driver as we noted this year, you would expect to have the continued benefits of our restructuring actions that we took this year to continue to benefit us as we move forward.\nArun Viswanathan: Okay. I understand. And just on that note then, assuming that you do see some continued margin growth, how should we think about free cash flow and maybe how you deploy that. Are there any significant extra CapEx projects in the pipeline? Or will you likely be using most of your cash for standing up the businesses? And -- or could you potentially deploy more and return more to shareholders?\nAntonella Franzen: Yes. So I've been talking about free cash flow conversion. As I mentioned for this quarter, we did have a really strong free cash flow conversion. It was about 130%. We're at 109% for the year, and we did know -- we do expect to be well above our target for this year. As we go into next year, I would expect that we continue to have good free cash flow conversion. The teams have done a great job relative to managing working capital even while sales are increasing and we're now having a use of working capital. As you think about our cash deployment for next year, given it is the year of the separation, the majority of cash will be used for our separation costs. We did note last quarter on the call, we do not expect to do any additional share repurchases this year. I would say that applies to next year as well and no significant outsized CapEx that you should be expecting next year relative to this year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Leithead of Barclays.\nMichael Leithead: I think DuPont filed an ITC complaint last month around a legal Tyvek imports, I guess, first, is the issue you're seeing somebody else claiming and naming something to be Tyvek and it's not -- or did it name something else and the issue is they're using DuPont's proprietary technology? And then just more broadly, how is the Tyvek business performing today?\nLori Koch: Yes. So the ITC filing speak for itself. We'll continue to defend our patents and our trade secrets. So that's really all we want to say on that point. The Tyvek business from an end market performance continues to recover nicely. A lot of the headwinds that we had saw throughout 2024 was related to medical packaging, and we've highlighted a few times about a nice recovery that we're seeing there, up 10% sequentially and up even further sequentially as we head into Q4. So we're really encouraged by the rebound that we're seeing there.\nOperator: And your last question comes from Steve Byrne of Bank of America.\nSteve Byrne: Yes. I'd like to ask another one about that ITC complaint. When did you start to see these competing versions of Tyvek coming into the states? And is this across your broad platform? Is this Tyvek house rep? Is this packaging? Is this PPE? Is it all of them? And you're seeing this competing version? When did this happen? And just curious on the timing of this.\nLori Koch: Yes. So I mean we had mentioned that the filing speak for itself as the public filing that can be red. So we started seeing it in recent months, the release of our name in addition to some trade infringement that we were seeing, which is what led us to the filing.\nSteve Byrne: And then maybe just one more across new DuPont any new products in development that you could be enrolling that could drive growth in new DuPont other than just the recovery in end markets.\nLori Koch: Yes. So I have mentioned earlier that the really nice win that we saw in the battery adhesives space was one of the largest European OEMs. So that was a nice win for us that can to solidify our position in the EV space. We have a really nice growing position within health care. So we closed the Donatelle acquisition in August. We were actually out there as leadership team and with the Board visiting the site and we're even more encouraged by what we saw with respect to cross-selling with some of the larger medical device layers as well as leveraging the really high-end machining capabilities that Donatelle has, not only our medical packaging businesses but our other parts businesses within the new DuPont portfolio. So really encouraged that, that space will continue to be a nice growth driver for us.\nOperator: There are no more questions. I will now turn the conference back over to Chris Mecray for closing remarks.\nChristopher Mecray: Thank you, everyone, for joining the call. And for your reference, a copy of the transcript will be posted on our website. This concludes the call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Antonella Franzen",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased that our third quarter results reflect sequential improvement across all key financial metrics and a return to organic sales growth at the consolidated level. Both earnings and cash flow benefited from volume recovery and improved production rates at key operating sites and our team has executed well on productivity and cost actions announced last year. Turning to Slide 5, I will cover our third quarter financial highlights in further detail. Net sales of $3.2 billion increased 4% versus the year ago period on organic sales growth of 3% and favorable portfolio impact of 2%, reflecting contributions from both the Spectrum and Donatelle acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by a 1% currency headwind. The organic sales growth of 3% reflects a 5% increase in volume, partially offset by a 2% decrease in price. Higher volume was driven by continued broad-based growth in electronics end markets with semi and Interconnect Solutions volumes both up double digits, coupled with the return to year-over-year volume growth in Water Solutions. On a segment view, E&I organic sales grew 10%, and  W&P's quarterly organic sales decline moderated further to 2% on its way to an anticipated return to positive growth in the fourth quarter. Organic sales in corporate declined 6% versus the year ago period driven by continued weakness in China solar markets, which led us to exit a photovoltaic film product line during the third quarter. This product line represents less than 1% of consolidated net sales. From a regional perspective, Asia Pacific delivered 9% organic sales growth versus the year ago period, led by another strong quarter in China, where organic sales were up low double digits, driven by electronics end markets. In other regions, organic sales in Europe grew 1%, while North America was down 2%. Second quarter operating EBITDA of $857 million increased 11% versus the year ago period as volume gains along with improved plant utilization and savings from restructuring actions were partially offset by higher variable compensation and select growth investments. Operating EBITDA margin during the quarter increased to 26.8%, up 150 basis points versus the year ago period and up 160 basis points on a sequential basis. Third quarter reflected another period of strong cash generation and conversion, reflecting both improved volumes as well as strong working capital discipline across each business line. On a continuing operations basis, cash flow from operations of $737 million, less capital expenditures of $109 million and $12 million of separation-related transaction cost payments resulted in transaction-adjusted free cash flow of $640 million and related conversion of 130%. Turning to Slide 6. Adjusted EPS for the quarter of $1.18 per share increased 28% from $0.92 in the year ago period. Higher segment earnings of $0.14 as well as the benefit of a lower share count of $0.09 and lower tax rate of $0.6 were partially offset by higher depreciation of $0.03. Our base tax rate for the quarter was 19.8%, down from 24.6% a year ago, driven by certain discrete tax benefits recorded in the current period. We now estimate our full year 2024 base tax rate to be approximately 23.5%. Turning to segment results, beginning with E&I on Slide 7. E&I third quarter sales of $1.6 billion increased 13% versus the year ago period, had organic sales growth of 10% and the Spectrum and Donatelle sales contribution of 4% were slightly offset by a 1% currency headwind. Organic sales growth of 10% reflects an 11% increase in volume, slightly offset by a 1% decrease in price. As the line of business level, organic sales per study were up more than 20% for the second consecutive quarter, reflecting continued overall semi demand recovery driven by AI technology ramps and share gains in certain products. Semi demand was notably strong in China including continued customer prebuying, similar to what we saw last quarter. As we move forward, we expect China demand to normalize but still remain strong. Overall, Semi-fab utilization continues to improve, averaging 76% during the quarter, though notably stronger for advanced node chips due in part to AI-related demand acceleration. Interconnect Solutions delivered another strong quarter as well, with organic sales up low double digits, reflecting continued broad-based electronic recovery, including a demand benefit from AI-driven technology ramps. We saw content and share gains within high-value electronics applications and the volume recovery within the overall printed circuit board space. The year-over-year sales decline in Industrial Solutions continued to moderate as organic sales were down slightly during the quarter. and strength in printing and packaging applications was offset by ongoing volume headwinds for Kalrez. Also within Industrial Solutions, we completed the acquisition of Donatelle, a medical device manufacturer at the end of August. We are very pleased with the integration of Donatelle into Spectrum and are seeing the potential benefit to leverage Donatelle technology and capabilities to other businesses as well as cross-selling opportunities within our health care platform. Operating EBITDA for E&I of $467 million was up 22% versus the year ago period driven by volume growth, the impact of higher production rates, savings from restructuring actions as well as the earnings contribution from Spectrum and Donatelle. These gains offset by higher variable compensation and select growth investments related primarily to the ongoing transition to advanced nodes and new and ramping AI applications across to semi and Interconnect solutions. Operating EBITDA margin during the quarter was 30.1% up 210 basis points versus the year ago period. Turning to Slide 8. W&P third quarter net balance of $1.4 billion declined 2% versus the year ago period primarily due to price headwinds as overall segment volumes were flat. Within Safety Solutions, Organic sales were down mid-single digits, largely on price declines, although with lower volume driven mainly by private medical packaging. We did see a second consecutive quarter of sequential sales growth in medical packaging with sales up 10% in Q3. Shelter Solutions sales were down slightly on an organic basis with headwinds in North American residential construction market, mostly offset by growth in commercial construction. The third quarter is it a return to year-over-year sales growth for Water Solutions where organic sales were up low single digits. Higher volumes were driven by strength in ultrafiltration technologies along with continued volume recovery in China. On a sequential basis, Water Solutions sales also increased for our second consecutive quarter with sales up 3%, which was better than our expectations coming into the quarter. Operating EBITDA for W&P during the quarter of $364 million was up 1% versus the year ago period as productivity and savings from restructuring actions more than offset the organic revenue decline and higher variable compensation. Operating EBITDA margin during the quarter was 26.3%, up 70 basis points from the year ago period. As alluded to the fourth quarter, we expect strong volume growth on a year-over-year basis. Moving to our outlook on Slide 9. For the fourth quarter, we expect net sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS of about $3.07 billion, $790 million and $0.98 per share, respectively. On a year-over-year basis, our fourth quarter guidance assumes sales and earnings growth from both E&I and W&P, translating to total company growth in net sales of about 6%. Operating EBITDA of 10% and adjusted EPS of 13%. Sequentially, we assume normal seasonal declines in our electronics and construction markets. Additionally, as I mentioned earlier, we expect to see a moderation of growth in China as prebuying and semi plays out as well as the impact of exiting the PV film product line. Partially offsetting these sequential declines is the continued recovery in water and medical packaging end markets. For the full year 2024, we are raising our earnings guidance above the high end of our prior range and now expect operating EBITDA of about $3.125 billion and adjusted EPS of $3.90 per share, which reflects 12% EPS growth year-over-year. With that, we are pleased to take your questions, and let me turn it back to the operator to open the Q&A. Yes. We should start to see activity more normalized now. I think we're clearly past the worse of it. We've seen sequential improvement from the first quarter to the second quarter. We saw it again going into Q3. And and we would expect we continue to see some sequential improvement as we move into Q4. So overall, the business has definitely gotten back to where -- getting close back to where we used to be. I would tell you, the activity in China has improved, the ultrafiltration activity, in particular, just in any one region to call it out, but we're definitely seeing much better activity overall in water and have kind of passed the destock. So I think it's important to keep in mind that when you look over the last couple of years, particularly in some select businesses, we did have price increases that were in the mid-teens, which more than covered our cost increase. And so it wouldn't be too surprising that we would give back a couple of points in order to maintain share as we go forward. You look specifically at E&I,to your point, typically, there is about a point of price giveback. A lot of it relates to new products kind of coming into the market. and volumes going up. So there's typically about one point in price historically what we see in E&I. And we would expect that trend to continue as we go forward. Yes. Actually, that benefit number is a bit higher. We got to our quarterly run rate of benefits in the third quarter. So we are getting a nice impact to this year. There will be a little bit of carry forward as we go into 2025. Yes. Given what we saw in pricing this year and as we're exiting the year, you would expect that you would have some price give back carryforward going into 2025. But I think the one thing that you got to keep in mind is we still have to take a deep look at where our costs next year relative to raws, logistics and utilities and that will determine if there's any pluses or minuses associated with them. So I would expect that as we go forward. In terms of the resi as a construction market, they are -- we are seeing a little bit less activity than what we originally anticipated. As Lori mentioned earlier, when you look at kind of rates and where they are, there were a few rate cuts that were expected in 2024. I mean we had one, so we had a little too late in the building cycle to really have an impact. So as we go in the next year, I would say, in terms of the construction markets, we would expect low single-digit activity, and I think that, that's kind of predicated on some additional rate cuts coming. But we'll see what happens. Yes. So the Q3 to Q4 in W&P would be your typical seasonality. Q3 tends to be the highest quarter and comes down a bit. In Q4, a big piece of that would be related to the Shelter business as we kind of go into the winter months. For W&P explicitly, we did call out about $25 million of onetime items last year that were related to a land sale and some supply agreements that we had certainly benefits from, I would say. Keep in mind that in totality, in Q4 of last year, we actually called out $40 million of onetime items. The remaining $15 million wasn't in corporate. So that's where I provided some color on the top line. That's where our expectations are. I would say it's a bit too early to start commenting on EBITDA growth for next year. We'll give more detailed guidance as we get on to the next quarter call. But clearly, volume will be a driver as we noted this year, you would expect to have the continued benefits of our restructuring actions that we took this year to continue to benefit us as we move forward. Yes. So I've been talking about free cash flow conversion. As I mentioned for this quarter, we did have a really strong free cash flow conversion. It was about 130%. We're at 109% for the year, and we did know -- we do expect to be well above our target for this year. As we go into next year, I would expect that we continue to have good free cash flow conversion. The teams have done a great job relative to managing working capital even while sales are increasing and we're now having a use of working capital. As you think about our cash deployment for next year, given it is the year of the separation, the majority of cash will be used for our separation costs. We did note last quarter on the call, we do not expect to do any additional share repurchases this year. I would say that applies to next year as well and no significant outsized CapEx that you should be expecting next year relative to this year."

            "name": "Lori Koch",
            "content": "Good morning, and thanks, everyone, for joining our third quarter call. Earlier today, we reported another strong quarter of financial performance with continued sequential improvement across all key financial metrics. We posted a solid quarter highlighted by year-over-year growth for consolidated net sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Third quarter sales of $3.2 billion included a return to organic sales growth which increased 3% versus the year ago period. Operating EBITDA of $857 million increased 11%, with operating EBITDA margin increasing 150 basis points to 26.8%. Third quarter adjusted EPS of $1.18 increased 28% year-over-year. We also delivered another strong quarter of cash generation with transaction-adjusted free cash flow conversion of 130%, highlighting our disciplined working capital management. For the full year 2024, we are raising our guidance for operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS, which Antonella will detail shortly. From an end market view, the Electronics and Industrial segment saw another quarter of double-digit sales growth in both the semi and Interconnect Solutions lines of business, which continued to benefit from strong demand for advanced node chips and AI enabling technologies. In the Water & Protection segment, we saw better-than-expected sequential improvement in water, including continued stabilization in China volumes. We also saw further sequential sales lift in medical packaging end markets, which are returning to more normalized buying patterns. Overall, I'm encouraged by our continued positive results. Volume recovery has been a key driver of our financial performance, coupled with our team's continued strong operational execution and helped by savings from the restructuring actions taken earlier this year. I am pleased to say we have made real progress with our operational excellence initiatives with benefits seen in improved margins and working capital and enhanced customer reliability metrics. By fostering our culture of continuous improvement and equipping our teams with the right tools and training, we are well positioned to unlock long-term value across each business line. Specific to the trading aspect we have been actively investing in our people and have completed around 30,000 hours of training year-to-date. We count on operational excellence to drive productivity every year as a key offset to inflation. Through focus on process optimization, we have successfully reduced costs across critical operations with benefits from increased uptime, leading to incremental capacity release and lower fixed and variable costs. All in, we are pleased to report a strong third quarter and are well positioned for a solid finish to the year. I'll now turn the call over to Ed, who can provide a few comments around our progress on the planned separations on Slide 4. Yes. So a lot of it ties around the. Yes. So a lot of it, Scott, is around the new fabs that are being put in place in China. So last quarter, we had mentioned $30 million in total, $20 million of which was in semi. This quarter is another $20 million for a total of $40 million over the second half. And it's really the new fabs coming online. So about half of the global fabs that are being constructed are in China, there's about 7 of them for 4 in the logic space and 3 in the memory space. And as they bring their new fabs online, they prebuy to get through qualifications in the ramp. So it's really a function of that from the prebuy perspective that we had quoted. No, minus the normal seasonality that you see in the quarter with the last month being the strongest primarily in the water space, there wasn't a lot of variability as we exited the quarter. I mean as we go into the fourth quarter, we have the usual seasonal sweetness that we see primarily within the Electronics space and the Shelter space. . And as you recall, we had done on the last earnings call, we had mentioned that the recovery kind of came early and the seasonality that you normally would see from 2Q to 3Q was a little muted. And therefore, do you see the seasonality as you head into the fourth quarter, you have to compare the fourth quarter to the second quarter, and that's where you see that about $100 million that we typically see between the Electronics and the Shelter space. Yes. We were really pleased with the margins that we saw. It's a lot of operational execution that we've been driving across the whole company. So we took a lot of restructuring actions earlier this year. We're seeing the benefit of those. We're driving productivity and operational excellence. We shuttered a couple of lines -- older lines in the U.S. in the safety business that are nicely impacting our margin profile. So we're encouraged by the 26% plus that we posted in Q3. Yes. Yes. I mean we saw strength across all the key semi technologies. So within the CMP space with pads and slurries within the listed space, we saw really nice results in the clean space. So it's a combination of one, the market recovery from the destock that happened last year. Two, the strength that we have in China. So we are a larger footprint in China than some of our peers, and that's where a lot of the new fab construction is going on a lot outsized recovery is happening. And then our exposure to advanced nodes versus the legacy nodes and DRAM versus memory is driving our results. So we had been up 50% plus in China. So that was a key driver of the overall sentiment results being up in the low 20% range. Yes, we're definitely at the bottom. We actually saw a sequential improvement. We're still seeing year-over-year headwinds. So we expect the business to continue to stabilize and see recovery as we head into 2025. So just a reminder of the Kalrez end markets, it is largely semi-CapEx exposed. So the long-term profile and expectations for topline growth in that business are very sound as there continues to be an expectation of mid-single-digit capacity expansions within the semi space. Yes. I mean, on the front end, it would be the construction market, primarily the North America residential space. And so we had mentioned in our 4Q expectations that they're a little needed in the Shelter space because the rate cuts didn't happen quickly. And as we'll see what happens here at the next meeting the expectations is that they'll cut again. But I would say that front end that's our largest exposure with respect to positive movement rates continue to slide down, more broadly, obviously, the lower rate versus broader economic activity that we see for all of our businesses. Yes. I mean we're not going gangbusters, right? So we had some growth investments primarily within the Electronics space as we look to continue to take advantage of the AI recovery. And we had mentioned the variable compensation headwinds and you can see in our proxy results from last year, our variable compensation within an average of 50% payoff, so that would be as been as we head into 2024. We continue to keep button down until we're really confident that we've got recovery across the board. We continue to make CapEx levels at the same level as where they were last year. And we'll continue to expect to revise this down as best we can below the 5% level comp. And I wouldn't expect any outsized investments. We continue to be really smart. One of the key areas, I think, that's driving the margin profile that we're seeing and we did take a lot of actions, especially on the plant fixed cost front as we saw the volumes decline last year, and we've done a really nice job keeping those out even those volumes have recovered. So that's also driving a piece of our margin recovery. Yes. So China is about 30% of electronic sales. So about half of that is China for China and the other half does any come back out for global consumption. Yes. So we continue to see nice performance within the BEV side. We just got a really nice long term being with one of the large European OEMs within the battery adhesive space. So it is muted to growth expectations just as everybody else is with respect to IHS revising down their expectations for total sales across the space, but we continue to be encouraged more broad based and longer-term BEV transition. Yes. On the AI side, in the packaging space within the Interconnect business. So we're seeing nice improvement there. And on the share gain side, it's also -- it's a function of being greater share of wallet with some of our key customers as we expand beyond just the phones and some of the other devices that our key customers are producing. So pleased with the results there. We had mentioned, I think, on the last call about a lot of the ICS being driven by thermal management and packaging opportunities, and that continues to play out. Yes. We've seen nice margin growth in both segments, both E&I and W&P. It's a little early to talk about specifics of 2025 at this point, but we are encouraged. There's not one-timers is driving that number, I'll say from that perspective. So as long as you can maintain the top line numbers that we're posting and the productivity initiatives should stay in place that we're driving, and we should be in a nice position to get back to that more normalized margin profile for E&I. Yes. No, there's no significant changes from the commentary we had provided on the last call about some initial 2025 expectations. So from an Electronics perspective, we continue to expect semi to growth to accelerate, really driven by the AI and the new fabs coming online. And just a reminder that the memory market and some of the more mature technology markets haven't recovered yet. So that recovery is on the come as we head into 2025. There's also on the Interconnect side, continued utilization the PCB space, especially as you look for a refresh cycle within the AI space and consumer devices. Within W&P, we expect Tyvek Healthcare to continue to recover. As we had mentioned, we saw a sequential lift from Q2 to Q3 of 10%. We expect a further sequential lift into Q4 and then normalized buying patterns as we head into 2025.  And we expect a more normalized demand environment within Interconnect and Water, we'll expect to continue to recover as well. So no changes from what we said last year or last quarter with respect to 2025. Yes, we can continue to have a nice position within China. I think our exposure in China within the semi space is outsized versus some of the peers. So we're about 30% in China, where some of the peers I think are less than that. So you're seeing that, that disparity play out nicely in our numbers as a lot of the builds are more concentrated there with respect to the global outlet. We have a nice position with the local players. As we have mentioned, we able to have nice positions with the global OEMs that are in China that are favoring our China results as well. Yes. So the ITC filing speak for itself. We'll continue to defend our patents and our trade secrets. So that's really all we want to say on that point. The Tyvek business from an end market performance continues to recover nicely. A lot of the headwinds that we had saw throughout 2024 was related to medical packaging, and we've highlighted a few times about a nice recovery that we're seeing there, up 10% sequentially and up even further sequentially as we head into Q4. So we're really encouraged by the rebound that we're seeing there. Yes. So I mean we had mentioned that the filing speak for itself as the public filing that can be red. So we started seeing it in recent months, the release of our name in addition to some trade infringement that we were seeing, which is what led us to the filing. Yes. So I have mentioned earlier that the really nice win that we saw in the battery adhesives space was one of the largest European OEMs. So that was a nice win for us that can to solidify our position in the EV space. We have a really nice growing position within health care. So we closed the Donatelle acquisition in August. We were actually out there as leadership team and with the Board visiting the site and we're even more encouraged by what we saw with respect to cross-selling with some of the larger medical device layers as well as leveraging the really high-end machining capabilities that Donatelle has, not only our medical packaging businesses but our other parts businesses within the new DuPont portfolio. So really encouraged that, that space will continue to be a nice growth driver for us."

            "content": "Thanks, Lori, and good morning, everyone. We clearly remain focused on driving results and demonstrating the performance potential of our portfolio while also advancing our plans to unlock value through the previously announced separations of our electronics and water businesses. We remain excited about this value creation opportunity and believe our investors broadly appreciate the potential that we expect these 3 industry-leading companies to realize by leveraging tailored growth strategies. Our teams remain highly motivated and have the experience to ensure that the new companies are prepared to operate and execute from day 1. We continue to make progress on our separation related work streams. We are also working diligently to accelerate our timing to potentially complete the separations closer to the earlier end of the 18- to 24-month time line set at our May announcement, and we'll update you as we progress. In addition, we are making progress in establishing the new boards, which have been a major focus of mine, and we expect to be able to announce Board members of each company, along with key executive leadership appointments for Electronics and Water by the end of the first quarter of 2025. With that, I'll turn it over to Antonella, who will cover our financial results and outlook. Yes. Yes, we've made great progress. Two of the longer poles in the tent of the legal entity work and the IT work to separate everything, and the teams have made tremendous progress on that. So our confidence level is definitely up, and that's why we made the comment that we might be more on the 18-month time line somewhere and maybe in that ZIP code, which if we could get it all the way to that would be December 2025. So we'll keep you posted on that. we're pretty positive. We're going to move it in. The issue is can we move it in all that way. Yes. No, it's a little simpler than that, Josh. Our plan is to do the separation of both Water and Electronics, and we're moving very rapidly down that road. As we mentioned on the prepared remarks, we're talking to potential Board members already, and we'll be making Board announcements for the companies and management announcements for those companies during the first quarter of next year. No. You're getting price on the new product introduction, Frank, but you get paid a little bit of price gain on older products which are -- that's very typical of the Electronics business like that. Forget the last couple of years have been crazy times with COVID and destocking and all that, but that's typically been the model. It's a higher growth business more up in the mid- to high teens, but you give up about 10% of price. Yes. I'll let Lori walk you through some detail just I don't mean this flippantly, but to make a comment, we really worked the portfolio very differently than we were 5, 6, 7 years ago away from chemical company into a multi-industrial. And I think you see that a lot of our end markets that we're in right now. But I'll let Lori, maybe walk you through some puts and takes. Our current midpoint of guidance in the fourth quarter seemed slightly less price impact than we saw during the third quarter."

You may begin.\nChris Mecray: Good morning and thank you for joining us for DuPont's second quarter 2024 financial results conference call. Joining me today are Ed Breen, Executive Chairman; Lori Koch, Chief Executive Officer; and Antonella Franzen, Chief Financial Officer. We've prepared slides to supplement our remarks which are posted on DuPont's website under the Investor Relations tab and through the webcast link. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the slides. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance or results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Our Form 10-K, as updated by our current periodic reports, includes detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today are on a continuing operations basis and exclude significant items. We will also refer to other non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in our press release and presentation materials that have been posted on DuPont's Investor Relations website. I'll now turn the call over to Lori.\nLori Koch: Good morning and thank you for joining. I'm excited to be here today for my first quarterly call as CEO and to be joined by Antonella, our newly appointed CFO. We both look forward to partnering with Ed and our global teams to continue to drive value creation for all stakeholders. We remain focused on driving results and demonstrating the performance potential of our combined portfolio while furthering the plans to unlock value through our previously announced separation. This morning, we reported second quarter financial results ahead of our previous guidance, reflecting continued positive momentum led by broad-based electronics recovery as well as sequential improvement from all W&P lines of business. We were very pleased with this outcome and by the continued focus and strong execution of our global team. On a consolidated basis for the quarter, we saw improvement across all key financial metrics. Net sales and operating EBITDA were both up year-over-year and sequentially, including a 17% pickup in operating EBITDA versus the first quarter. We saw strength in the semi business driven by growth in advanced technology applications, including AI. We also realized continued recovery and new wins within consumer electronics market to drive both year-over-year and sequential growth for interconnect solutions. We did see some favorable timing benefits within each of these businesses during second quarter relative to our expectations. In the W&P segment, we were pleased to see a better-than-anticipated sequential step-up in our water business in China as well as improvement in Tyvek medical packaging within Safety Solutions which was in line with our expectations. Our year-over-year growth in operating EBITDA reflects solid margin expansion with operating EBITDA margin improvement of 130 basis points, driven by favorable business mix, stronger production rates in our electronics businesses and realization of restructuring-related cost savings, partially offset by higher variable compensation expense. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 14% year-over-year. Strong cash generation and related conversion of over 100% was another bright spot for the quarter, highlighting disciplined working capital management and made a sequential sales ramp. For the full year 2024, we are raising our guidance for net sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS which Antonella will detail shortly. I also wanted to highlight that earlier this week; we closed our acquisition of Donatelle, a manufacturer of sophisticated medical devices. We are delighted to welcome the Donatelle team to DuPont and are excited about this transaction which will deepen and complement our expertise in medical device market alongside Spectrum which we acquired last year. Donatelle will be managed within our E&I Industrial Solutions line of business alongside the Spectrum team. Together, these offerings are expected to enhance our position as a partner of choice for customers in the high-growth medical device field. I'll now turn the call over to Ed, who will provide a progress update on our planned separation.\nEdward Breen: Thanks and good morning, everyone. As seen in our second quarter results, we are well into the recovery phase from last year's inventory corrections in most key end markets and electronics may be setting up for a prolonged positive cycle. Turning to the separations; we've received very encouraging feedback since our May announcement of our intent to separate the electronics and water businesses and the formation of 3 independent companies. We believe our investors broadly appreciate the value creation opportunity of having 3 industry-leading global companies with compelling growth opportunities and distinct investment propositions. As we shift gears to ramp up our separation activities, we have also worked to ensure our teams internally are highly motivated to remain focused on serving customers and driving business performance. That remains the top priority and I'm confident our operating teams will continue to execute. As you can see on Slide 4, we have already begun working on the rigorous project management processes necessary to ensure the separation work is executed smoothly. Our teams have plenty of experience to rely on to ensure we stay within the 18- to 24-month time line from our May announcement with all 3 companies well positioned for day 1. One key short-term milestone that has already been completed is the establishment of key work stream leaders as part of our integrated project management team under Lori and Antonella's leadership, along with myself. Key separation work streams underway include legal entity standup, IT separation and stand, our financials and talent selection. A current priority, along with our Board, is to complete executive leadership appointments for electronics and water along with corporate governance aspects including board appointments. We currently anticipate announcements in early 2025. We are also making progress towards the future capital structures of the 3 intended companies. Specifically, during June, we redeemed $650 million of our 2038 bonds and entered into new interest rate swaps that hedged the rate risk on our longer-dated maturities. To the extent that it becomes necessary to repay these bonds, the new swaps hedge the risk of higher debt repayment costs that would occur in a lower interest rate environment. So while it is still early in the process, you can see that the separation work is progressing along and we look forward to updating you as we move forward. Before I turn it over to Antonella, I'd like to mention 1 of the updates detailed in our 10-Q which will be filed later today, specifically around the South Carolina MDL. Now that the water district settlement has become final, the court has indicated a focus on the personal injury cases. Earlier this year, the court ordered cases not involving 1 of the 8 medical patients to be dismissed by August 22 unless certain evidence is presented. About half of the 6,000 cases depending on June 30 are expected to be dismissed on that basis. They can be refiled over the next 4 years if those evidence requirements are later met. We do not, however, expect any trials in 2024 in the South Carolina MDL. With that, let me turn it over to Antonella, who will provide additional details on our financial results and outlook.\nAntonella Franzen: Thanks, Ed and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to be here today and honored to serve as CFO of DuPont. Turning to Slide 5; I will cover our second quarter financial highlights in further detail. Our second quarter results were clearly encouraging. Volume recovery is a key driver of our improved Q2 financial performance. Additionally, our ongoing commitment to drive productivity and operational excellence as well as continued savings from restructuring actions announced last November are also contributing to top line growth, margin expansion and cash flow improvement. Net sales of $3.2 billion increased 2% versus the year ago period, as a favorable portfolio benefit of 4%, reflecting the Spectrum acquisition was partially offset by a 2% currency headwind. Organic sales were flat as a 2% increase in volume was offset by a 2% decrease in price. Higher volume was driven by broad-based growth in electronics markets within semi and interconnect solutions with year-over-year reported volumes up more than 20% and mid-teens, respectively. These gains were partially offset by year-over-year declines in China within Water Solutions as well as Tyvek Medical packaging. However, we did see sequential improvement in these areas, as Lori mentioned. On a segment view, E&I organic sales inflected to grow 8% while W&P organic sales decline moderated to 6%. Organic sales in corporate decreased 5% versus the year ago period. From a regional perspective, Asia Pacific delivered 3% organic sales growth versus the year ago period with growth driven by China, where organic sales were up 8%, led by strong growth in E&I. In other regions, the North America was down 2% and Europe was down 7%. Second quarter operating EBITDA of $798 million increased 8% versus the year ago period as volume gains, lower product costs, Savings from restructuring actions and the earnings contribution from Spectrum were partially offset by higher variable compensation. Operating EBITDA margin during the quarter was 25.2%, up 130 basis points versus the year ago period and up 190 basis points sequentially from first quarter. Additionally, I am very pleased with our cash flow performance as we reported another quarter of strong cash generation and conversion. On a continuing operations basis, cash from operations of $527 million, less capital expenditures of $102 million, resulted in adjusted free cash flow of $425 million. Adjusted free cash flow conversion during the quarter was 104%. Turning to Slide 6; adjusted EPS for the quarter of $0.97 per share increased 14% from $0.85 in the year-ago period. Higher segment earnings of $0.10 and the benefit of a lower share count of $0.09 were partially offset by lower interest income of $0.05, resulting from a reduction in cash on hand versus the prior year. Other below-the-line items totaled a net $0.02 headwind as a higher tax rate and depreciation were partially offset by lower exchange losses versus the year ago period. Our base tax rate for the quarter was 26.4%, up from 23.7% in the year ago period, driven by certain discrete tax expenses as well as geographic mix and earnings. Our full year 2024 base tax rate is now estimated to be at the high end of our prior range or approximately 24%. Turning to segment results, beginning with E&I on Slide 7. E&I second quarter net sales of $1.5 billion increased 15% versus the year ago period, as the Spectrum sales contribution of 9% and organic sales growth of 8% were partially offset by a currency headwind of 2%. Organic sales growth of 8% reflects a 10% increase in volume, partially offset by a 2% decrease in price. At the line of business level, organic sales for semi were up more than 20%, driven by continued semi demand recovery, including AI-driven technology ramps as well as higher volumes for OLED materials led by new product launches. A resurgence of demand for leading-edge materials requiring higher content and accelerated buying in support of new fab capacity, primarily in China, also contributed to the volume increase in the second quarter. Overall, semi fab utilization improved from the first quarter, with average utilization in the mid-70s. Within Interconnect Solutions, organic sales were up low teens, driven by mid-teens volume gains, reflecting continued broad-based consumer electronics recovery, incremental share gains and a demand benefit from AI-driven technology ramps. We also saw earlier-than-expected timing of orders within certain consumer electronics markets that helped volumes in the second quarter. As expected, organic sales for Industrial Solutions were down low double digits, due primarily to ongoing destocking for Kalrez and biopharma markets. On a sequential basis, sales for Industrial Solutions increased 9% during the second quarter, including an improvement in Kalrez and biopharma. Operating EBITDA for E&I of $419 million was up 20% versus the year ago period, driven by volume growth and the impact of increased production rates in both semi and interconnect solutions, savings from restructuring actions and the earnings contribution from Spectrum. These gains were partially offset by lower volume in Industrial Solutions and higher variable compensation. Operating EBITDA margin of 27.8% increased 120 basis points versus the year ago period. Turning to Slide 8; W&P second quarter net sales of $1.4 billion, declined 7% versus the year ago period due to a 6% organic sales decline, of which 4% related to volume and 2% related to price, as well as a 1% currency headwind. Within Safety Solutions, organic sales were down high single digits versus the year ago period on lower volumes, driven mainly by channel inventory destocking for Tyvek Medical Packaging. However, we did see a sequential increase of more than 20% in this end market, confirming a recovery is in process. Within Water Solutions, organic sales were down high single digits versus the year ago period, driven primarily by lower volumes resulting from distributor inventory destocking. Market conditions in Water Solutions also improved during the second quarter with net sales up 12% sequentially which was ahead of our expectations and driven primarily by an initial recovery in China. Shelter Solutions sales increased low single digits on an organic basis due to demand improvement in construction markets compared to the prior year period. Operating EBITDA for W&P during the quarter of $344 million was down 7% due to lower volumes and higher variable compensation, partially offset by the impact of lower product costs and savings from restructuring actions. W&P saw a nice step-up sequentially from the first quarter in both the top and bottom line with nearly 50% incremental margin. Moving to our outlook on Slide 9; for the third quarter, we expect net sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS to increase sequentially to approximately $3.2 billion, $815 million and $1.03 per share, respectively. For the full year 2024, we are raising our guidance for net sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS. At the midpoint of the revised ranges provided, we now expect full year net sales of about $12.45 billion, operating EBITDA of about $3.085 billion and adjusted EPS of $3.75 per share. Our full year net sales guide reflects about $50 million of incremental foreign currency headwinds in the second half of the year versus prior guidance assumptions which are expected to be partly offset by a sales contribution from the Donatelle acquisition which closed earlier this week. With that, we are pleased to take your questions and let me turn it back to the operator to open the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners.\nJeff Sprague: Congrats. Whoever would like to take it. I'd just love to drill a little bit more into electronics. A couple of things you said were quite interesting. First, maybe, is there any kind of inventory rebuild that's going on in that market? Or is this growth you think clearly indicative of what end demand is. And I wonder if you could just elaborate a little bit for us what in the context of DuPont AI-driven demand really means how significant it might be content per chip or anything that you could give to provide some perspective on that question.\nLori Koch: Yes. Jeff, maybe to your first question. So yes, the majority of the growth that we saw within the semi and ICS business was just market recovery but there was probably about $30 million of pre-buy, especially within Asia Pacific, as some of the new fabs come online. So that drove the Q2 performance up a little bit and then it will mute a little bit the ramp into Q3 and the back half of the year. But overall, still really nice recovery in the electronic space. As we have noted, a lot of it is coming from the AI acceleration that's felt in both the semi and the ICS business. In total, AI is about $250 million of sales for us today; so a lot of improvement to be able to drive growth there. Like I had mentioned, it's felt across the board in semi as well as ICS on the packaging and the thermal management side.\nJeff Sprague: And also on the consumer side of electronics, I think there was a comment about orders being stronger. Is there just some timing issues there. There's certainly some hope that there's a stronger iPhone cycle here into the holidays? Is that what you're starting to see? Any other color there would be helpful.\nLori Koch: Yes. So the $30 million of pre-buy was probably about $20 million in semi and about $10 million of Interconnect. So on the Interconnect side, it would be a little bit of a timing shift for some of the premium smartphone deliveries.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research.\nScott Davis: Lori and Antonella, it's good to have you guys leading the call here. I wanted just to dig in a little bit on price. I was expecting price to be down in E&I but maybe not necessarily in W&P. Is it mostly kind of a pass-through in like tieback? What are the -- I'm trying to picture why price would come down in Water, I guess but perhaps it's just kind of the comps and how you had to raise price into that big inflation pickup at the beginning last year? Maybe just some color there would be helpful.\nAntonella Franzen: Sure, Scott. It's Antonella. So just a couple of quick things that I would mention. I think it's important to keep in mind, particularly in W&P, we had some really strong pricing over the last couple of years. And I would say, particularly, there's a few businesses where our pricing over the last 2 years was about in the mid-teens that more than compensated for any of the cost increases that we saw. So it's not unlikely that we would see a couple of points that we would kind of give back really more just so to maintain share. So to your point, it's really the timing of the price increases that we had.\nScott Davis: Okay. That's what I thought. And just going back to Jeff's question and this is just -- I'm not an expert in electronic chemicals at all. But is it the same product mix going into AI applications? I assume it's higher volumes per purchase, et cetera but is it the same product? Or are there variations of that?\nLori Koch: Yes. It's the same product. It's just more content into the space because of the advanced nodes. And so the advanced nodes have more stacks and/or thermal management requirements that require more of our material. So 1 rule of thumb that we point out is in the semi space. MSI is a typical indicator of market growth and we would be 200 to 300 basis points above market growth because of the advanced node exposure that we have. So they need more material to be able to produce the higher-end chips.\nScott Davis: Okay, that makes sense. That's what I thought. So thank you. Best of luck.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.\nSteve Tusa: Congrats everyone in the room there. Just on the guidance, what is kind of normal seasonality now for EBITDA? It looks like it should be up mid-single digits quarter-to-quarter, at least that's kind of what it did last year but you're more in recovery mode, it feels like. So unclear to me why it would only be up a couple of percent like you haven't guided.\nLori Koch: Yes. I think to your point, we haven't -- yes, so I think you have to go back a couple of years to kind of see the more normal seasonality pattern that would exist. And so if you go back, it's probably more about $50 million to $100 million lift from Q2 to Q3 and then normally about a $100 million decline from Q3 to Q4. So this year's recovery is muting that. And also the pre-buy in Q2 is muting that a bit from Q2 to Q3, so rising about $30 million. But our decline Q3 to Q4 is muted down to about $50 million in the guide, because that's the continued recovery that we see across the board. So seasonality is a bit challenging, to your point, whenever you're having market inflections but that's what's into our number. Like if you take away the pre-buy, then you would see more the normal seasonality.\nSteve Tusa: Okay, that makes sense. And then, Ed, you mentioned the change in the PFAS item there. Where do we stand on like State AG as well as just remind us what the other major moving items around PFAS actually are and how significant this South Carolina News is in the context of what's remaining here.\nEdward Breen: Yes. Steve, there's really 2 buckets left. Obviously, we sell the big 1 on the water district cases. The 2 buckets left in the state AG cases and the personal injury cases. And I think the comment we made this morning on the PI basis, I think, is fairly significant because it reduces the cases from about 6,000 down to about 3,000. And remember, this is not like some of the other settlements we did where we had a location and we settled because we used PFAS. In this case, this is because of firefighting phone again. So only 3,000 cases and this goes back to what the plaintiffs also said in our settlement that we are probably responsible for 3% to 7% as a consortium group and we're only 1/3 of the 3% to 7%. So I think you can wrap your head around a number that's pretty reasonable here.\nSteve Tusa: And I guess for PFAS more broadly though, does that -- I mean for the other guys that are involved, the ones with the larger exposures, I mean, is there any -- I would assume that it's kind of a similar impact to those guys as well. Now -- is there any reason why judging how injured somebody actually is, is different from company to company when it just comes to the basic injury [ph], if you will?\nEdward Breen: No. I think the difference is just to distinguish that we didn't make firefight [ph]. So, if you made it, you're in a different little bit of a category but we did not make it. So -- which is I think why our percent is just 3% to 7% and we're 1/3 of that.\nSteve Tusa: And then any update on [indiscernible]?\nEdward Breen: Pretty nice news.\nSteve Tusa: Any update?\nEdward Breen: I don't expect Steve any settlement this year but we are working hard to settle as much to the rest of the PFAS as we can by the time of the spin to get them out clean. So we're working hard at it.\nSteve Tusa: Yes. You're always working hard. So we appreciate that. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Spector of UBS. Please go ahead.\nJosh Spector: I wanted to ask on W&P. Just within the guidance in the context the year-on-year comps get easier, so you're clearly expecting some growth there in the second half. But it kind of seems like you're guiding things somewhat flattish from a sales and EBITDA perspective. So I'd be curious, are you seeing continued improvement from destocking? Are you not? And what are your assumptions around that?\nAntonella Franzen: Yes. So this is Antonella. Just a couple of comments there. So as we mentioned, we did see a nice lift off of Q1 in both medical packaging in Tyvek as well as in our Water business, where we saw the biggest impact of destocking. A we move forward, we do continue to expect that we will see a little bit more lift in medical package as we go through the year. For water, as we mentioned, we actually saw a bigger lift headed into Q2 than we were originally expecting. So that will be pretty consistent. As we head into the third quarter, we'll see a little bit more of a lift in the fourth quarter as well. So overall, revenue is relatively flattish as we go into the second half of the year for W&P. And I would just keep in mind, there's probably a little bit of muted seasonality that we built in, in the shelter business, just given the soft resi market and just we're keeping a close eye on the macros out there. And so that's a little bit of a cautious view, I would say that we have built into our guidance currently.\nJosh Spector: And I guess what about margins? Kind of the same line of thought there. I mean that was a bright spot in the quarter here, getting back to kind of a year ago margins and volumes still down. Is there something incremental negative on the margin sequentially? It seems like you're assuming that's a little bit lower versus what you did in 2Q.\nAntonella Franzen: No. Actually the margins in W&P are expected to be flattish to up a little bit actually as we head into the third quarter and expect it to continue to improve as we head into the fourth quarter as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John McNulty of BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn McNulty: This 1 regarding the split. So you've had the big announcement this past quarter. I guess can you speak to interest that you may be seeing in some of those assets, sometimes there's not a lot of interest until announcements get made and then all of a sudden, people start lining up. So maybe you can help us to think about that, especially around maybe the water business? And if not, I guess I'd also ask, it does look like the M&A markets are heating up in a couple of areas, especially in water. Would you consider bolting on businesses ahead of the split to any of the other assets? Or is that just too much to deal with for the organization at this point? How should we be thinking about that?\nEdward Breen: Yes. Yes. So your last point, no, we wouldn't do anything where we bolt something on the asset. I don't want to get out in front of ourselves on any speculation of what's going on. But as I said on the last earnings call, John, if there is interest in the water business, we obviously will look at it and study it hard if there's a better path to creating value for our shareholders, we would clearly do that. And I'll just leave it at that for now.\nJohn McNulty: Okay. Fair enough. And then I guess just a question on the PFAS issue. So look, you guys have been doing a pretty good job of cleaning up the liability so far. Earlier this quarter, we had the Chevron decision kind of get overruled by the Supreme Court. I guess I'm wondering, what does that do in terms of how you think about the liability and the ability to put that to rest. Does it change kind of the strategy or how you're thinking about that, what that liability might mean going forward?\nEdward Breen: Yes. So it kind of goes back to the whole superfund circle issue. And to make it very clear, manufacturers of products are not responsible under circle. There's kind of 4 key categories, if you don't mind me telling you these for a minute just to clarify this issue. The responsible parties are current owners and operators of facilities where substances are located, [indiscernible] owners of facilities where hazardous substances were disposed, aggregators and generators, persons who arrange for disposal has a substance at a site and transporters who transported it to those sites. So by the way, there's a Supreme Court case on this, just to clarify it more. An entity will not be held liable as an arranger merely for selling a new and useful product if the purchaser of that product later and unbent to the seller dispose of the product in a way that led to contaminate it. So I think it's pretty darn clear, as we've said all along that we don't have responsibility under this\nJohn McNulty: Great. Thanks very much for the clarity.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Roberts of Mizuho.\nJohn Roberts: On the spin-off, will we have to wait until the SEC filings for the income statements and debt allocations to the spin co -- or do you think DuPont will begin reporting more like a holding company and give us electronics and water, at least summary income statement, summary balance sheets before the SEC filings.\nLori Koch: Yes. We intend to report in the new structure prior to the Form 10 detailed filings would go out. So we're targeting sometime early next year to have leadership appointments and then ultimately report on the new segments would be the future spin.\nJohn Roberts: Okay. And then will new DuPont pen report medical or health as a separate segment? Or is it going to continue to be split across industrial and safety? I think it's going to be over 25% of new DuPont but it's a little hard to see in the current reporting.\nLori Koch: Yes. So we will most likely have three reportable segments for Remainco, one of which is health care which would be the combination of Tyvek, Spectrum, the Liveo Biopharma business and now Donatelle given that acquisition closed. And the other two reportable segments would be a next-gen mobility which would help all of our EV automotive exposure. And then the remaining would be generally the safety business and the shelter business and the rest of the printing businesses and industrial businesses, industrial solutions that aren't semi related.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson of Wolfe Research.\nChris Parkinson: Just two quick questions on E&I. The first is, do you mind just kind -- as we enter into the second half, can you just offer a little bit more color on Semi tech just given some of your commentary around the broader strokes. But if we dig in to pad slurries, you mentioned older materials in your PR as well as the PowerPoint. Can you just help us conceptualize how we are trending into '25, '26 and perhaps into a larger upcycle?\nLori Koch: Yes. So we expect nice high single-digit growth in the current construct of E&I as we head into 2025, a lot of that coming from the growth acceleration from AI as well as overall continued pickup within the consumer electronics space. So we think we'll be from a utilization perspective on the semi front more in the high 70s as we exit 2024 overall. It's more like in the low 80s in the advanced nodes in DRAM and then lower than that in the legacy nodes and some of the more legacy memory applications.\nChris Parkinson: Got it. And Lori, I have to bring it back a couple of years, because the follow-up is on ICS and specifically, Laird. When you originally did that transaction, you kind of mentioned AI as an optionality. And obviously, you're kind of -- at the time talking about the shielding the thermal management portfolio there. Can you just kind of help us think about the ICS business as it stands today versus kind of the legacy way of thinking around handsets. It seems like there's perhaps a lot more going on under the hood there in terms of how we should be thinking about sustainable growth rates?\nLori Koch: Yes. So ICS, I kind of think about it in 2 big buckets as far as market opportunity is concerned. One is like a powerhouse with respect to interconnect solutions and 1 is a powerhouse with respect to thermal management and you see opportunity on the 3 lines of business underneath across both of those segments. And so the Laird acquisition has continued to play out nicely for us to drive opportunity across the ICS portfolio. It's been really timely with the AI boost and the ADAS boost that's coming to have that thermal management business within our portfolio.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. All right. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead of Barclays.\nMike Leithead: One on E&I, just strong results mostly across the board with the exception of maybe industrial and you called out the 1 headwind around kind of ongoing Kalrez destocking. I just wanted to dig into that. So your volumes in your sense really consistent with end market trends for the product? Or is there any competitive dynamics impacting Kalrez specifically there?\nLori Koch: No. No, there's no competitive dynamics. It's really just the destock from the 2023 high volumes that went on. So there's nothing competitively. We did see sequential improvement in Kalrez as we had expected. We actually do forecast of return to volume growth in Industrial Solutions in total in the back half. So it was really just getting through the destock in Kalrez and also in the biopharma which are both in Industrial Solutions.\nMike Leithead: Okay, great. And then just as a quick follow-up, maybe a question for Antonella on the cash flow statement this quarter. It looks like cash flow from operations for discontinued operations was a $400 million use of cash in the quarter. Can you just help us understand that?\nAntonella Franzen: Yes. So keep in mind, as Ed mentioned earlier, we did have the settlements. So really, that's predominantly all the cash out of about $408 million related to the MOU settlement.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch of Fermium Research.\nFrank Mitsch: Nice result. If I could stay on the cash flow side of things, Laurie, when you were wearing your prior hat, as CFO. There was an expectation that the second quarter cash flow conversion might be lower than the first quarter in part with interest payments. And obviously, it came in materially above or nicely above, I should say. So can you speak to the factors behind that as well as what the outlook is in terms of cash flow generation?\nLori Koch: Yes, so good memory. I had signaled that usually, Q2 is a little muted because of the interest payment which we did pay. It was really a reflection of better working capital performance for the most part. So we had sequential revenue but we're really able to keep the working capital headwind. So we've done a really nice job primarily on the inventory front around driving productivity across our businesses to get better at cash. So we're still in that 90% target range for the year, we're at about 96% quarter-to-date. So we're in good shape to be able to deliver against the targets that we have out there.\nFrank Mitsch: All right. Terrific. And then maybe just a second or two in terms of the corporate line. Sales were relatively flat sequentially, yet EBITDA picked up materially. Can you talk about the factors there and what your outlook is?\nLori Koch: Yes, really, that was driven by a bit of our corporate expenses. So there's always a little bit of timing from quarter-to-quarter. So I would say when you take a look at kind of corporate expenses, we're probably a little heavy in Q1, a little light in Q2 and on average, kind of expected where we would typically be. As you kind of look into the second half of the year, as you look at corporate as a segment, we did point out in the materials that we do expect overall less income coming from corporate in the second half of the year than we had in the first half of the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is David Hwang [ph] here for Dave. I guess, first, on Industrial Solutions, when do you expect volumes to recover and turn positive here?\nLori Koch: Yes. We expect volumes to be up low single digits in the third quarter year-over-year for Industrial Solutions and then more in the low double-digit range for the fourth quarter. So we saw a nice inflection sequentially and then we'll see a return to year-over-year volume growth in the second half.\nUnidentified Analyst: And I guess just on the potential water sale. I guess there is some interested parties there. And it sounds like PFAS continue to progress positively. As when you talk to potential interested parties, what's the initial thoughts from them taking over some of the PFAS liabilities? And I guess is there a threshold there willing to accept? Or is it, in general, still a big hurdle for them? And you think if that scenario were to play out, it will not involve any PFAS liability allocation at all?\nLori Koch: Yes. So we haven't had any conversations on selling the water business. So our intent is still to spend. Each of the 3 spins will pick up their pro rata share of the of the PFAS liability per the trailing 12-month EBITDA underneath the sharing agreement with Corteva.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies.\nLaurence Alexander: Can you give a little bit more detail on the sequential momentum in Water & Safety Solutions sort of into Q3 and how much visibility here is the visibility improving in those 2 businesses or lead times improving?\nLori Koch: For the water business, as we mentioned from Q2 to Q3, we do expect it to be relatively flat as we get into the fourth quarter we do expect a sequential increase in terms of the top line. And some of that is just driven by some project-related activity that we have there. In terms of safety, we did talk about that's where our medical packaging business is within Tyvek, we do expect to see some sequential improvement there as well. I think there, the growth will be a little less muted as we go through the course of the year because there's just a couple of little other puts and takes within that business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison of Wells Fargo.\nMike Sison: Nice quarter outlook. Ed, just 1 question. How do you expect the agencies to assign sort of industry codes for each of the entities of the spin maybe that would help investors assign the right multiple or comps longer term? And I assume you don't expect the entities to get assigned materials or chemicals. But any color on how you think you can help them sort of make that right decision.\nEdward Breen: I'll just say it this way. We are going to work at for. The electronics is very clear where that should be and we will work that issue. I mean there are pure-play comps in those industries that there's only a couple of key competitors against some that have their marking in the water business is the same way; so that will be worked.\nLori Koch: Yes. And we'll work to get the Remainco SIC code changed as well. So we've been trying for since we spun out of to get a change more to the multi-industrial diversified SIC code. And so I think we continue to make our case that we should not have the chemicals SIC code anymore. And so we'll work with that one as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets.\nArun Viswanathan: I guess just kind of curious on the guidance. So you're raising it by looks like around $110 million or so on the EBITDA line for the full year. The Q2 beat was around $80-something million, so $88 million. So that remaining kind of $22 million, it seems like there could be a little bit of seasonal drop off and maybe some moderation in growth. I know you mentioned the pre-buy $30 million but anything else you'd call out there as to why you're not raising guidance maybe by a little bit more?\nAntonella Franzen: Actually, I would say, our ways in our guidance, when we kind of take a look at it is not only adding in the Q2 beat but actually a bit more than that as well. So kind of the way to look at it is if you look where our previous guidance was and to your point, kind of at the beat that we had in the second quarter of around $150 million on the top and $90 million on the bottom, I think you need to keep in mind that incremental headwind from when we previously gave guidance to the tune of $75 million. And clearly, there's an EBITDA impact associated with that as well. That is only partially offset by the Donatelle acquisition that's going in. So on a true underlying basis, if you put FX and acquisitions aside, in addition to the Q2 beat, we are raising the top line close to $100 million in the bottom line, around $30 million or so.\nArun Viswanathan: Okay, perfect. And then, I guess just as a quick follow-up. As you look into '25, where are you kind of in that recovery maybe on E&I would you say like where do you expect fab rates to kind of utilization rates to end the year? And do you see those kind of continuing to move up as you move into '25?\nLori Koch: Yes. I think we'll end the year overall in utilization in the high 70s that will be different between advanced nodes and more legacy nodes. So the advanced node should be in the low 8s and the more mature notes with would not quite be at the average. So it sets up well for 2025 to get back to the more normal utilization patterns that exist in the semi space. As I had noted earlier, we overall probably see high single-digit growth in E&I in total in 2025 with a lot of growth coming from continued acceleration with AI on both the data center side as well as on the ICS side.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov. Next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham of Citi.\nPatrick Cunningham: Just on the Donatelle acquisition, first, maybe talk about the strategic fit there and even potential cross-selling opportunities where it's complementary in the portfolio? And then can you also help us size the transaction and how much earnings contribution we should expect in the second half?\nLori Koch: Yes. So we closed Spectrum earlier this week -- or Donatelle earlier this week. We get up Donatelle nicely with our Spectrum acquisition that we're actually lapping a year on here, August 1. And so they've got nice exposure to some of the large medical device OEMs that Spectrum did not have. So there's a lot of cross-selling opportunity to come in there as they've also got some really nice machining and tooling competencies that will add to the portfolio. In total, the revenue is about $75 million from Donatelle. It's got slightly better margins than what the Spectrum acquisition did. So a nice addition there.\nAntonella Franzen: Yes. The only thing I would add is the $75 million is a full year number, just to clarify.\nPatrick Cunningham: Yes. And then, maybe just a clarification on corporate earnings. I think there was a sizable step-up into 2Q. I know you mentioned there were some expenses that moved around but were there any areas of strength on the underlying retained businesses that helped 2Q? And how much lower should back half earnings be on the corporate line?\nLori Koch: Yes. So I would say in the second quarter, in addition to the timing of expenses, we did have a good strong margin performance in terms of the retained businesses as well. As we shift into the second half of the year, as I mentioned earlier, we do expect the overall earnings in corporate to come down there is a little bit of pressure that we have in terms of our solar business that we have within the retained businesses. So we have a little bit of earnings headwind related to there. And I mentioned earlier, a little bit of timing related to actual corporate expense.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.\nVincent Andrews: Could I ask quickly on electronics. The timing differences that you called out in the quarter that were favorable to the quarter, are you seeing in your 3Q order book that those are indeed shifted to 2Q? Are you just assuming that? And then we'll see how the quarter plays out. And then separately, Ed, if I could ask you on the PFAS on the personal injury cases, just a little bit of clarification in terms of it sounds like we'll go from 6,000 to 3,000 cases. But has that case count been increasing? Or has it been static around those levels, firstly? And then secondly, on your comments that DuPont is sort of, I think you said 3% to 6% or 3% to 7% sort of the assumed liability. Is that to mean that, that would be your sort of exposure to any payout should there be any? Or is that your exposure to the amount of cases? And lastly on that, how do you expect this to proceed in terms of will something actually go to trial? Will it be the typical MDL where you pick 1 and they pick 1 and you see what the outcomes are and then maybe you try to settle? Or is there a path to settling ahead of time? Or just sort of what you think the process is going to be?\nEdward Breen: Yes. So the cases have crept up over time but the slope has obviously changed, come down. And remember, it's predominantly firefighters. It's not other individuals. So the drop will be at least down to 3,000 of cases. And I'd just say, overall, because it's firefighting foam, it goes back to the last settlement we did where we never made the firefighting foam but we had 1 surfactant that went in for 10 or 11 years. So net-net was determined that the exposure of Corteva [ph] us was in the 3% to 7% range. And so I think you can do the math like we were able to do when we settled the water cases and kind of get this into a certain box. And remember, we're only 1/3 of 3% to 7%, as I mentioned earlier. And Mike, just to your -- kind of one of your last points. Obviously, we always try to settle these as a class, like we did the water cases and we'll work hard to do that. And I said we would love to clean a lot of this up before the actual separations occur.\nLori Koch: Yes. And maybe on your order question. So our order book is trending alongside the guide that we had given. So we feel like we're in good shape there.\nOperator: And our last question comes from the line of Steve Byrne of Bank of America.\nSteve Byrne: Yes. Your cost of goods were down 2% in the quarter. Can you provide a little more detail on that, such as were raws down more than that? Your volumes being a little higher might suggest that raws were down more than that. But more importantly, where do you think that cost of goods year-over-year is likely to go as we move forward?\nAntonella Franzen: This is Antonella. So a couple of things that I would mention there to keep in mind. So one, obviously, we are seeing a bit of an impact from deflation of cost that's in there. Secondly, I would also mention in terms of restructuring, we took a lot of actions as we announced the program last year towards late November; some of those actions have actually been accelerated. So we are seeing even more of a benefit this year than we were originally anticipating. So as you may recall, we were first expected we'd have about $100 million of restructuring savings in 2024. We now expect that to be closer to $115 million or so for the year. So that's also helping from a COGS perspective and kind of bringing our costs down.\nSteve Byrne: And then you mentioned on Slide 14, a lot of products in development. And you mentioned your water business has some DLE opportunity. Just a question on that. Is this 1 lithium project at a temperate later to that could be many, many years from now? Or is there some breadth to this opportunity that you see in lithium?\nLori Koch: We continue to see a nice opportunity. We're actually investing in a facility in Europe to be able to take advantage as well from a production perspective. So it's still a little early. I mean, the potential market opportunity on the low end is probably in the $250 million range as we position ourselves as a component supplier into the space.\nOperator: I will now turn the call back over to Chris for closing remarks.\nChris Mecray: Thank you for joining the call today. As a reminder, our materials are posted on the website, including the transcript from today's call. Thank you for joining. Good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Antonella Franzen",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to be here today and honored to serve as CFO of DuPont. Turning to Slide 5; I will cover our second quarter financial highlights in further detail. Our second quarter results were clearly encouraging. Volume recovery is a key driver of our improved Q2 financial performance. Additionally, our ongoing commitment to drive productivity and operational excellence as well as continued savings from restructuring actions announced last November are also contributing to top line growth, margin expansion and cash flow improvement. Net sales of $3.2 billion increased 2% versus the year ago period, as a favorable portfolio benefit of 4%, reflecting the Spectrum acquisition was partially offset by a 2% currency headwind. Organic sales were flat as a 2% increase in volume was offset by a 2% decrease in price. Higher volume was driven by broad-based growth in electronics markets within semi and interconnect solutions with year-over-year reported volumes up more than 20% and mid-teens, respectively. These gains were partially offset by year-over-year declines in China within Water Solutions as well as Tyvek Medical packaging. However, we did see sequential improvement in these areas, as Lori mentioned. On a segment view, E&I organic sales inflected to grow 8% while W&P organic sales decline moderated to 6%. Organic sales in corporate decreased 5% versus the year ago period. From a regional perspective, Asia Pacific delivered 3% organic sales growth versus the year ago period with growth driven by China, where organic sales were up 8%, led by strong growth in E&I. In other regions, the North America was down 2% and Europe was down 7%. Second quarter operating EBITDA of $798 million increased 8% versus the year ago period as volume gains, lower product costs, Savings from restructuring actions and the earnings contribution from Spectrum were partially offset by higher variable compensation. Operating EBITDA margin during the quarter was 25.2%, up 130 basis points versus the year ago period and up 190 basis points sequentially from first quarter. Additionally, I am very pleased with our cash flow performance as we reported another quarter of strong cash generation and conversion. On a continuing operations basis, cash from operations of $527 million, less capital expenditures of $102 million, resulted in adjusted free cash flow of $425 million. Adjusted free cash flow conversion during the quarter was 104%. Turning to Slide 6; adjusted EPS for the quarter of $0.97 per share increased 14% from $0.85 in the year-ago period. Higher segment earnings of $0.10 and the benefit of a lower share count of $0.09 were partially offset by lower interest income of $0.05, resulting from a reduction in cash on hand versus the prior year. Other below-the-line items totaled a net $0.02 headwind as a higher tax rate and depreciation were partially offset by lower exchange losses versus the year ago period. Our base tax rate for the quarter was 26.4%, up from 23.7% in the year ago period, driven by certain discrete tax expenses as well as geographic mix and earnings. Our full year 2024 base tax rate is now estimated to be at the high end of our prior range or approximately 24%. Turning to segment results, beginning with E&I on Slide 7. E&I second quarter net sales of $1.5 billion increased 15% versus the year ago period, as the Spectrum sales contribution of 9% and organic sales growth of 8% were partially offset by a currency headwind of 2%. Organic sales growth of 8% reflects a 10% increase in volume, partially offset by a 2% decrease in price. At the line of business level, organic sales for semi were up more than 20%, driven by continued semi demand recovery, including AI-driven technology ramps as well as higher volumes for OLED materials led by new product launches. A resurgence of demand for leading-edge materials requiring higher content and accelerated buying in support of new fab capacity, primarily in China, also contributed to the volume increase in the second quarter. Overall, semi fab utilization improved from the first quarter, with average utilization in the mid-70s. Within Interconnect Solutions, organic sales were up low teens, driven by mid-teens volume gains, reflecting continued broad-based consumer electronics recovery, incremental share gains and a demand benefit from AI-driven technology ramps. We also saw earlier-than-expected timing of orders within certain consumer electronics markets that helped volumes in the second quarter. As expected, organic sales for Industrial Solutions were down low double digits, due primarily to ongoing destocking for Kalrez and biopharma markets. On a sequential basis, sales for Industrial Solutions increased 9% during the second quarter, including an improvement in Kalrez and biopharma. Operating EBITDA for E&I of $419 million was up 20% versus the year ago period, driven by volume growth and the impact of increased production rates in both semi and interconnect solutions, savings from restructuring actions and the earnings contribution from Spectrum. These gains were partially offset by lower volume in Industrial Solutions and higher variable compensation. Operating EBITDA margin of 27.8% increased 120 basis points versus the year ago period. Turning to Slide 8; W&P second quarter net sales of $1.4 billion, declined 7% versus the year ago period due to a 6% organic sales decline, of which 4% related to volume and 2% related to price, as well as a 1% currency headwind. Within Safety Solutions, organic sales were down high single digits versus the year ago period on lower volumes, driven mainly by channel inventory destocking for Tyvek Medical Packaging. However, we did see a sequential increase of more than 20% in this end market, confirming a recovery is in process. Within Water Solutions, organic sales were down high single digits versus the year ago period, driven primarily by lower volumes resulting from distributor inventory destocking. Market conditions in Water Solutions also improved during the second quarter with net sales up 12% sequentially which was ahead of our expectations and driven primarily by an initial recovery in China. Shelter Solutions sales increased low single digits on an organic basis due to demand improvement in construction markets compared to the prior year period. Operating EBITDA for W&P during the quarter of $344 million was down 7% due to lower volumes and higher variable compensation, partially offset by the impact of lower product costs and savings from restructuring actions. W&P saw a nice step-up sequentially from the first quarter in both the top and bottom line with nearly 50% incremental margin. Moving to our outlook on Slide 9; for the third quarter, we expect net sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS to increase sequentially to approximately $3.2 billion, $815 million and $1.03 per share, respectively. For the full year 2024, we are raising our guidance for net sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS. At the midpoint of the revised ranges provided, we now expect full year net sales of about $12.45 billion, operating EBITDA of about $3.085 billion and adjusted EPS of $3.75 per share. Our full year net sales guide reflects about $50 million of incremental foreign currency headwinds in the second half of the year versus prior guidance assumptions which are expected to be partly offset by a sales contribution from the Donatelle acquisition which closed earlier this week. With that, we are pleased to take your questions and let me turn it back to the operator to open the Q&A. Sure, Scott. It's Antonella. So just a couple of quick things that I would mention. I think it's important to keep in mind, particularly in W&P, we had some really strong pricing over the last couple of years. And I would say, particularly, there's a few businesses where our pricing over the last 2 years was about in the mid-teens that more than compensated for any of the cost increases that we saw. So it's not unlikely that we would see a couple of points that we would kind of give back really more just so to maintain share. So to your point, it's really the timing of the price increases that we had. Yes. So this is Antonella. Just a couple of comments there. So as we mentioned, we did see a nice lift off of Q1 in both medical packaging in Tyvek as well as in our Water business, where we saw the biggest impact of destocking. A we move forward, we do continue to expect that we will see a little bit more lift in medical package as we go through the year. For water, as we mentioned, we actually saw a bigger lift headed into Q2 than we were originally expecting. So that will be pretty consistent. As we head into the third quarter, we'll see a little bit more of a lift in the fourth quarter as well. So overall, revenue is relatively flattish as we go into the second half of the year for W&P. And I would just keep in mind, there's probably a little bit of muted seasonality that we built in, in the shelter business, just given the soft resi market and just we're keeping a close eye on the macros out there. And so that's a little bit of a cautious view, I would say that we have built into our guidance currently. No. Actually the margins in W&P are expected to be flattish to up a little bit actually as we head into the third quarter and expect it to continue to improve as we head into the fourth quarter as well. Yes. So keep in mind, as Ed mentioned earlier, we did have the settlements. So really, that's predominantly all the cash out of about $408 million related to the MOU settlement. Actually, I would say, our ways in our guidance, when we kind of take a look at it is not only adding in the Q2 beat but actually a bit more than that as well. So kind of the way to look at it is if you look where our previous guidance was and to your point, kind of at the beat that we had in the second quarter of around $150 million on the top and $90 million on the bottom, I think you need to keep in mind that incremental headwind from when we previously gave guidance to the tune of $75 million. And clearly, there's an EBITDA impact associated with that as well. That is only partially offset by the Donatelle acquisition that's going in. So on a true underlying basis, if you put FX and acquisitions aside, in addition to the Q2 beat, we are raising the top line close to $100 million in the bottom line, around $30 million or so. Yes. The only thing I would add is the $75 million is a full year number, just to clarify. This is Antonella. So a couple of things that I would mention there to keep in mind. So one, obviously, we are seeing a bit of an impact from deflation of cost that's in there. Secondly, I would also mention in terms of restructuring, we took a lot of actions as we announced the program last year towards late November; some of those actions have actually been accelerated. So we are seeing even more of a benefit this year than we were originally anticipating. So as you may recall, we were first expected we'd have about $100 million of restructuring savings in 2024. We now expect that to be closer to $115 million or so for the year. So that's also helping from a COGS perspective and kind of bringing our costs down."

            "name": "Lori Koch",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you for joining. I'm excited to be here today for my first quarterly call as CEO and to be joined by Antonella, our newly appointed CFO. We both look forward to partnering with Ed and our global teams to continue to drive value creation for all stakeholders. We remain focused on driving results and demonstrating the performance potential of our combined portfolio while furthering the plans to unlock value through our previously announced separation. This morning, we reported second quarter financial results ahead of our previous guidance, reflecting continued positive momentum led by broad-based electronics recovery as well as sequential improvement from all W&P lines of business. We were very pleased with this outcome and by the continued focus and strong execution of our global team. On a consolidated basis for the quarter, we saw improvement across all key financial metrics. Net sales and operating EBITDA were both up year-over-year and sequentially, including a 17% pickup in operating EBITDA versus the first quarter. We saw strength in the semi business driven by growth in advanced technology applications, including AI. We also realized continued recovery and new wins within consumer electronics market to drive both year-over-year and sequential growth for interconnect solutions. We did see some favorable timing benefits within each of these businesses during second quarter relative to our expectations. In the W&P segment, we were pleased to see a better-than-anticipated sequential step-up in our water business in China as well as improvement in Tyvek medical packaging within Safety Solutions which was in line with our expectations. Our year-over-year growth in operating EBITDA reflects solid margin expansion with operating EBITDA margin improvement of 130 basis points, driven by favorable business mix, stronger production rates in our electronics businesses and realization of restructuring-related cost savings, partially offset by higher variable compensation expense. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 14% year-over-year. Strong cash generation and related conversion of over 100% was another bright spot for the quarter, highlighting disciplined working capital management and made a sequential sales ramp. For the full year 2024, we are raising our guidance for net sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS which Antonella will detail shortly. I also wanted to highlight that earlier this week; we closed our acquisition of Donatelle, a manufacturer of sophisticated medical devices. We are delighted to welcome the Donatelle team to DuPont and are excited about this transaction which will deepen and complement our expertise in medical device market alongside Spectrum which we acquired last year. Donatelle will be managed within our E&I Industrial Solutions line of business alongside the Spectrum team. Together, these offerings are expected to enhance our position as a partner of choice for customers in the high-growth medical device field. I'll now turn the call over to Ed, who will provide a progress update on our planned separation. Yes. Jeff, maybe to your first question. So yes, the majority of the growth that we saw within the semi and ICS business was just market recovery but there was probably about $30 million of pre-buy, especially within Asia Pacific, as some of the new fabs come online. So that drove the Q2 performance up a little bit and then it will mute a little bit the ramp into Q3 and the back half of the year. But overall, still really nice recovery in the electronic space. As we have noted, a lot of it is coming from the AI acceleration that's felt in both the semi and the ICS business. In total, AI is about $250 million of sales for us today; so a lot of improvement to be able to drive growth there. Like I had mentioned, it's felt across the board in semi as well as ICS on the packaging and the thermal management side. Yes. So the $30 million of pre-buy was probably about $20 million in semi and about $10 million of Interconnect. So on the Interconnect side, it would be a little bit of a timing shift for some of the premium smartphone deliveries. Yes. It's the same product. It's just more content into the space because of the advanced nodes. And so the advanced nodes have more stacks and/or thermal management requirements that require more of our material. So 1 rule of thumb that we point out is in the semi space. MSI is a typical indicator of market growth and we would be 200 to 300 basis points above market growth because of the advanced node exposure that we have. So they need more material to be able to produce the higher-end chips. Yes. I think to your point, we haven't -- yes, so I think you have to go back a couple of years to kind of see the more normal seasonality pattern that would exist. And so if you go back, it's probably more about $50 million to $100 million lift from Q2 to Q3 and then normally about a $100 million decline from Q3 to Q4. So this year's recovery is muting that. And also the pre-buy in Q2 is muting that a bit from Q2 to Q3, so rising about $30 million. But our decline Q3 to Q4 is muted down to about $50 million in the guide, because that's the continued recovery that we see across the board. So seasonality is a bit challenging, to your point, whenever you're having market inflections but that's what's into our number. Like if you take away the pre-buy, then you would see more the normal seasonality. Yes. We intend to report in the new structure prior to the Form 10 detailed filings would go out. So we're targeting sometime early next year to have leadership appointments and then ultimately report on the new segments would be the future spin. Yes. So we will most likely have three reportable segments for Remainco, one of which is health care which would be the combination of Tyvek, Spectrum, the Liveo Biopharma business and now Donatelle given that acquisition closed. And the other two reportable segments would be a next-gen mobility which would help all of our EV automotive exposure. And then the remaining would be generally the safety business and the shelter business and the rest of the printing businesses and industrial businesses, industrial solutions that aren't semi related. Yes. So we expect nice high single-digit growth in the current construct of E&I as we head into 2025, a lot of that coming from the growth acceleration from AI as well as overall continued pickup within the consumer electronics space. So we think we'll be from a utilization perspective on the semi front more in the high 70s as we exit 2024 overall. It's more like in the low 80s in the advanced nodes in DRAM and then lower than that in the legacy nodes and some of the more legacy memory applications. Yes. So ICS, I kind of think about it in 2 big buckets as far as market opportunity is concerned. One is like a powerhouse with respect to interconnect solutions and 1 is a powerhouse with respect to thermal management and you see opportunity on the 3 lines of business underneath across both of those segments. And so the Laird acquisition has continued to play out nicely for us to drive opportunity across the ICS portfolio. It's been really timely with the AI boost and the ADAS boost that's coming to have that thermal management business within our portfolio. No. No, there's no competitive dynamics. It's really just the destock from the 2023 high volumes that went on. So there's nothing competitively. We did see sequential improvement in Kalrez as we had expected. We actually do forecast of return to volume growth in Industrial Solutions in total in the back half. So it was really just getting through the destock in Kalrez and also in the biopharma which are both in Industrial Solutions. Yes, so good memory. I had signaled that usually, Q2 is a little muted because of the interest payment which we did pay. It was really a reflection of better working capital performance for the most part. So we had sequential revenue but we're really able to keep the working capital headwind. So we've done a really nice job primarily on the inventory front around driving productivity across our businesses to get better at cash. So we're still in that 90% target range for the year, we're at about 96% quarter-to-date. So we're in good shape to be able to deliver against the targets that we have out there. Yes, really, that was driven by a bit of our corporate expenses. So there's always a little bit of timing from quarter-to-quarter. So I would say when you take a look at kind of corporate expenses, we're probably a little heavy in Q1, a little light in Q2 and on average, kind of expected where we would typically be. As you kind of look into the second half of the year, as you look at corporate as a segment, we did point out in the materials that we do expect overall less income coming from corporate in the second half of the year than we had in the first half of the year. Yes. We expect volumes to be up low single digits in the third quarter year-over-year for Industrial Solutions and then more in the low double-digit range for the fourth quarter. So we saw a nice inflection sequentially and then we'll see a return to year-over-year volume growth in the second half. Yes. So we haven't had any conversations on selling the water business. So our intent is still to spend. Each of the 3 spins will pick up their pro rata share of the of the PFAS liability per the trailing 12-month EBITDA underneath the sharing agreement with Corteva. For the water business, as we mentioned from Q2 to Q3, we do expect it to be relatively flat as we get into the fourth quarter we do expect a sequential increase in terms of the top line. And some of that is just driven by some project-related activity that we have there. In terms of safety, we did talk about that's where our medical packaging business is within Tyvek, we do expect to see some sequential improvement there as well. I think there, the growth will be a little less muted as we go through the course of the year because there's just a couple of little other puts and takes within that business. Yes. And we'll work to get the Remainco SIC code changed as well. So we've been trying for since we spun out of to get a change more to the multi-industrial diversified SIC code. And so I think we continue to make our case that we should not have the chemicals SIC code anymore. And so we'll work with that one as well. Yes. I think we'll end the year overall in utilization in the high 70s that will be different between advanced nodes and more legacy nodes. So the advanced node should be in the low 8s and the more mature notes with would not quite be at the average. So it sets up well for 2025 to get back to the more normal utilization patterns that exist in the semi space. As I had noted earlier, we overall probably see high single-digit growth in E&I in total in 2025 with a lot of growth coming from continued acceleration with AI on both the data center side as well as on the ICS side. Yes. So we closed Spectrum earlier this week -- or Donatelle earlier this week. We get up Donatelle nicely with our Spectrum acquisition that we're actually lapping a year on here, August 1. And so they've got nice exposure to some of the large medical device OEMs that Spectrum did not have. So there's a lot of cross-selling opportunity to come in there as they've also got some really nice machining and tooling competencies that will add to the portfolio. In total, the revenue is about $75 million from Donatelle. It's got slightly better margins than what the Spectrum acquisition did. So a nice addition there. Yes. So I would say in the second quarter, in addition to the timing of expenses, we did have a good strong margin performance in terms of the retained businesses as well. As we shift into the second half of the year, as I mentioned earlier, we do expect the overall earnings in corporate to come down there is a little bit of pressure that we have in terms of our solar business that we have within the retained businesses. So we have a little bit of earnings headwind related to there. And I mentioned earlier, a little bit of timing related to actual corporate expense. Yes. And maybe on your order question. So our order book is trending alongside the guide that we had given. So we feel like we're in good shape there. We continue to see a nice opportunity. We're actually investing in a facility in Europe to be able to take advantage as well from a production perspective. So it's still a little early. I mean, the potential market opportunity on the low end is probably in the $250 million range as we position ourselves as a component supplier into the space."

            "name": "Edward Breen",
            "content": "Thanks and good morning, everyone. As seen in our second quarter results, we are well into the recovery phase from last year's inventory corrections in most key end markets and electronics may be setting up for a prolonged positive cycle. Turning to the separations; we've received very encouraging feedback since our May announcement of our intent to separate the electronics and water businesses and the formation of 3 independent companies. We believe our investors broadly appreciate the value creation opportunity of having 3 industry-leading global companies with compelling growth opportunities and distinct investment propositions. As we shift gears to ramp up our separation activities, we have also worked to ensure our teams internally are highly motivated to remain focused on serving customers and driving business performance. That remains the top priority and I'm confident our operating teams will continue to execute. As you can see on Slide 4, we have already begun working on the rigorous project management processes necessary to ensure the separation work is executed smoothly. Our teams have plenty of experience to rely on to ensure we stay within the 18- to 24-month time line from our May announcement with all 3 companies well positioned for day 1. One key short-term milestone that has already been completed is the establishment of key work stream leaders as part of our integrated project management team under Lori and Antonella's leadership, along with myself. Key separation work streams underway include legal entity standup, IT separation and stand, our financials and talent selection. A current priority, along with our Board, is to complete executive leadership appointments for electronics and water along with corporate governance aspects including board appointments. We currently anticipate announcements in early 2025. We are also making progress towards the future capital structures of the 3 intended companies. Specifically, during June, we redeemed $650 million of our 2038 bonds and entered into new interest rate swaps that hedged the rate risk on our longer-dated maturities. To the extent that it becomes necessary to repay these bonds, the new swaps hedge the risk of higher debt repayment costs that would occur in a lower interest rate environment. So while it is still early in the process, you can see that the separation work is progressing along and we look forward to updating you as we move forward. Before I turn it over to Antonella, I'd like to mention 1 of the updates detailed in our 10-Q which will be filed later today, specifically around the South Carolina MDL. Now that the water district settlement has become final, the court has indicated a focus on the personal injury cases. Earlier this year, the court ordered cases not involving 1 of the 8 medical patients to be dismissed by August 22 unless certain evidence is presented. About half of the 6,000 cases depending on June 30 are expected to be dismissed on that basis. They can be refiled over the next 4 years if those evidence requirements are later met. We do not, however, expect any trials in 2024 in the South Carolina MDL. With that, let me turn it over to Antonella, who will provide additional details on our financial results and outlook. Yes. Steve, there's really 2 buckets left. Obviously, we sell the big 1 on the water district cases. The 2 buckets left in the state AG cases and the personal injury cases. And I think the comment we made this morning on the PI basis, I think, is fairly significant because it reduces the cases from about 6,000 down to about 3,000. And remember, this is not like some of the other settlements we did where we had a location and we settled because we used PFAS. In this case, this is because of firefighting phone again. So only 3,000 cases and this goes back to what the plaintiffs also said in our settlement that we are probably responsible for 3% to 7% as a consortium group and we're only 1/3 of the 3% to 7%. So I think you can wrap your head around a number that's pretty reasonable here. No. I think the difference is just to distinguish that we didn't make firefight [ph]. So, if you made it, you're in a different little bit of a category but we did not make it. So -- which is I think why our percent is just 3% to 7% and we're 1/3 of that. Pretty nice news. I don't expect Steve any settlement this year but we are working hard to settle as much to the rest of the PFAS as we can by the time of the spin to get them out clean. So we're working hard at it. Yes. Yes. So your last point, no, we wouldn't do anything where we bolt something on the asset. I don't want to get out in front of ourselves on any speculation of what's going on. But as I said on the last earnings call, John, if there is interest in the water business, we obviously will look at it and study it hard if there's a better path to creating value for our shareholders, we would clearly do that. And I'll just leave it at that for now. Yes. So it kind of goes back to the whole superfund circle issue. And to make it very clear, manufacturers of products are not responsible under circle. There's kind of 4 key categories, if you don't mind me telling you these for a minute just to clarify this issue. The responsible parties are current owners and operators of facilities where substances are located, [indiscernible] owners of facilities where hazardous substances were disposed, aggregators and generators, persons who arrange for disposal has a substance at a site and transporters who transported it to those sites. So by the way, there's a Supreme Court case on this, just to clarify it more. An entity will not be held liable as an arranger merely for selling a new and useful product if the purchaser of that product later and unbent to the seller dispose of the product in a way that led to contaminate it. So I think it's pretty darn clear, as we've said all along that we don't have responsibility under this I'll just say it this way. We are going to work at for. The electronics is very clear where that should be and we will work that issue. I mean there are pure-play comps in those industries that there's only a couple of key competitors against some that have their marking in the water business is the same way; so that will be worked. Yes. So the cases have crept up over time but the slope has obviously changed, come down. And remember, it's predominantly firefighters. It's not other individuals. So the drop will be at least down to 3,000 of cases. And I'd just say, overall, because it's firefighting foam, it goes back to the last settlement we did where we never made the firefighting foam but we had 1 surfactant that went in for 10 or 11 years. So net-net was determined that the exposure of Corteva [ph] us was in the 3% to 7% range. And so I think you can do the math like we were able to do when we settled the water cases and kind of get this into a certain box. And remember, we're only 1/3 of 3% to 7%, as I mentioned earlier. And Mike, just to your -- kind of one of your last points. Obviously, we always try to settle these as a class, like we did the water cases and we'll work hard to do that. And I said we would love to clean a lot of this up before the actual separations occur."

[Operator Instructions] \n Finally, I would like to advise all participants that this call is being recorded. Thank you. \n I'd now like to welcome Chris Mecray to begin the conference. Chris, over to you. \nChristopher Mecray: Good morning, and thank you for joining us for DuPont's First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining me today are Ed Breen, Chief Executive Officer; and Lori Koch, Chief Financial Officer. \n We've prepared slides to supplement our remarks, which are posted on DuPont's website under the Investor Relations tab and through the webcast link. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the slides.\n During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance or results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Our Form 10-K, as updated by our current periodic reports, includes detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences.\n Unless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today are on a continuing operations basis and exclude significant items. We will also refer to other non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our press release and presentation materials that have been posted to DuPont's Investor Relations website. \n I'll now turn the call over to Ed. \nEdward Breen: Good morning, and thank you for joining our First Quarter 2024 Financial Review. Our results for the period exceeded our expectations, driven by better-than-expected volumes in all segments. Broadly, the first quarter confirmed that we are past the bottom in electronics and on the road to recovery. Our Semiconductor Technologies business reported sequential sales growth of 8% in the first quarter and 10% year-over-year, driven by a pickup in the underlying chip demand and normalization of customer inventory levels, both slightly earlier than expected.\n In Interconnect Solutions, we saw a second straight quarter of year-over-year volume growth with volumes up 4%. We did, however, continue to see channel inventory destocking, as expected, resulting in year-over-year revenue declines in certain industrial-based businesses, but we believe those conditions have bottomed and our assumed recovery timing is also consistent with our previous expectations. That said, and given first quarter performance, we are raising our full year 2024 guidance for net sales, operating EBITDA, and adjusted EPS. Lori will further detail the outlook shortly.\n Compared to the year ago period, first quarter reported sales of $2.9 billion declined 3%, operating EBITDA of $682 million declined 4%, and adjusted EPS of $0.79 per share declined 6%. We continue to prioritize working capital and delivered significant year-over-year improvement in cash flow during the quarter. In late April, we completed the $500 million accelerated share repurchase transaction launched in February, retiring a total of 6.9 million shares in this tranche and bringing total share repurchases to over 15% of our outstanding shares since November 2022.\n Turning to Slide 4, I want to reiterate that we remain excited about the growth potential of our businesses, centered around 5 secular high-growth areas. We are excited about the through-cycle strength of our portfolio as end markets recover from recent destocking headwinds, and our teams continue to focus on operational excellence. \n Almost 1/3 of sales exposure for our portfolio today is focused on electronics, including leadership positions and strong customer relationships serving semiconductor manufacturing, primarily via consumables used in the chip manufacturing process, as well as serving broader consumer-based electronics markets with films, displays, and printed circuit board materials used in smartphones, PCs, and tablets.\n We are very pleased to participate in the AI-driven growth acceleration within electronics via our semi-related products geared towards advanced node chips for data centers and other key AI applications, such as mobile products. Electronics end markets have positively inflected, and we expect continued volume pickup in both Semi and ICS over the course of 2024. Our Water business at 12% of our portfolio constitutes a broad range of filtration technologies and operates in markets expected to generate strong growth, driven by evolving wastewater regulation and the global response to concerns around water scarcity and circularity. We believe demand for filtration products, which have been impacted by slower project work in the last year and associated distributor destocking has bottomed and will begin to recover later in the second quarter. \n We have excellent leadership positions in various end markets within protection and industrial technologies. Within industrial technologies, about 10% of the DuPont portfolio is geared to growing health care markets, including Spectrum medical devices, Tyvek medical packaging and Liveo biopharma consumables. We have seen ongoing solid demand for devices and expect to see recovery in medical packaging beginning later in the second quarter. Biopharma product demand is expected to recover beginning later in the year after bottoming in recent periods.\n DuPont's next-generation auto market participation constitutes about 10% of total sales and is geared to advanced technologies, enabling secular demand trends for hybrid and electric vehicles within battery, motor and other applications. Demand for our advanced water-related products has remained healthy, and we have a global customer base that includes EV customers in each region. We see excellent longer-term opportunity across our auto-related portfolio. \n With that, let me turn it over to Lori to review our financial performance and outlook. \nLori Koch: Thanks, Ed, and good morning. Our first quarter results were clearly encouraging with further signs of electronics recovery matched with bottoming across our industrial-based end markets. Additionally, our commitment to drive productivity and operational excellence has minimized decremental margins and has helped to produce significant cash flow improvement in recent quarters. Our results have and will continue to benefit from the restructuring actions announced last November.\n Turning to Slide 5, I'll cover our first quarter financial highlights. Net sales of $2.9 billion decreased 3% versus the year ago period, as a 6% organic sales decline and a 1% currency headwind was partially offset by favorable portfolio benefits of 4%, primarily from the Spectrum acquisition. The organic sales decline reflects a 5% decrease in volume and a 1% decrease in price. Lower volume was driven by the impact of continued channel inventory destocking in Water Solutions, mainly in China, and Safety Solutions, most notably for Tyvek medical packaging, and Industrial Solutions for Tyvek's parts and Liveo biopharma products. These declines were partially offset by strong growth in electronics where Semi and Interconnect Solutions volumes increased 8% in aggregate versus the prior year period.\n On a segment view, W&P and E&I organic sales declined 10% and 2%, respectively, while organic sales and corporate increased 1%. From a regional perspective, sales decreased on an organic basis globally versus the year ago period, with Europe, North America and Asia Pacific down 8%, 7%, and 4%, respectively. In China, sales volumes were up 3% year-over-year as growth in E&I more than offset declines in W&P due to continued pressure in water markets.\n First quarter operating EBITDA of $682 million decreased 4% as volume declines were partially offset by the impact of lower product costs and Spectrum earnings contribution. Operating EBITDA during the quarter of 23.3% was down 40 basis points versus the year ago period. \n I am pleased with our cash flow improvement as we focus our efforts on optimizing working capital performance. On a continuing operations basis, cash flow from operations of $493 million, less capital expenditures of $207 million resulted in adjusted free cash flow of $286 million in the first quarter, a significant increase versus $173 million in the year ago period. Adjusted free cash flow conversion during the quarter was 86%, significantly ahead of last year.\n Turning to Slide 6. Adjusted EPS for the quarter of $0.79 per share decreased from $0.84 in the year ago period. Lower segment earnings, higher net interest expense and higher depreciation more than offset a $0.06 benefit from a lower share count. Our tax rate for the quarter was 24.6%, up from 23.4% in the year ago period, driven by geographic mix and earnings. Our full year 2024 base tax rate outlook of 23% to 24% remains unchanged.\n Turning to segment results, beginning with E&I on Slide 7. E&I's first quarter net sales of $1.4 billion increased 5% as a Spectrum sales contribution of 8% was partially offset by an organic sales decline of 2% and a 1% currency headwind. The organic sales decline reflects a 1% decrease in volume and a 1% decrease in price due to the pass-through of lower metal prices. Effective with our first quarter reporting, I will highlight that we realigned certain product lines within our 3 E&I lines of business. The changes streamline our cost structure, while also optimizing certain product offerings to better focus on our customers. Additional detail has been provided on Slide 15 in the appendix.\n For the first quarter of 2024, organic sales for Semiconductor Technologies were up 10% versus the year ago period due to the start of overall semiconductor market demand recovery, along with normalization of customer inventory levels and continued strong demand for OLED display materials. We expect underlying semi demand to continue to improve throughout the year, and note that our forecasts continue to call for semi fab utilization rates to increase from the low 70s percent that we saw in the first quarter to a fourth quarter exit rate in the low 80s.\n Within Interconnect Solutions, organic sales were up slightly as mid-single-digit volume gains were mostly offset by the impact of lower metals prices. This was the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year volume growth for ICS as broad electronic markets continue to recover. Organic sales for Industrial Solutions were down about 20% due primarily to ongoing channel inventory destocking for Kalrez O-rings and our Liveo product lines within biopharma markets. We continue to expect to see order improvement over the next several quarters in our Kalrez business. And our Liveo biopharma business is also still expected to recover later in the second half. \n Operating EBITDA from E&I of $374 million was up 3% versus the year ago period, driven by strength in Semi and Interconnect Solutions and the earnings contribution from Spectrum, partially offset by the impact of lower volumes in Industrial Solutions.\n Turning to Slide 8. W&P first quarter net sales of $1.3 billion declined 11% versus the year ago period due to a 10% decrease in volume and a 1% currency headwind. Within Safety Solutions, organic sales were down low teens on lower volumes, driven mainly by channel inventory destocking, most notably for Tyvek medical packaging products. We believe our customers' inventory is close to normal at this point for Tyvek medical packaging. \n Within Water, organic sales were down mid-teens, driven by distributor inventory destocking and lower industrial demand in China. We continue to have active communication with our distributors and believe orders will pick up towards the end of the second quarter.\n Shelter Solutions were flat on an organic basis compared to the year ago period, and we expect sequential lift in the second quarter. Operating EBITDA for W&P during the quarter of $295 million decreased 14% due to lower volumes, partially offset by the impact of lower product costs.\n Turning to Slide 9, I'll provide an update on our full year 2024 guidance as well as our expectations for the second quarter. We are raising our full year guidance for net sales, operating EBITDA, and adjusted EPS. At the midpoint of the revised ranges provided, we now expect full year net sales of about $12.25 billion, operating EBITDA of about $2.975 billion, and adjusted EPS of $3.60 a share, which now indicates expected year-over-year earnings growth.\n For the second quarter of 2024, we expect net sales of about $3.025 billion, operating EBITDA of about $710 million and adjusted EPS of $0.84 per share. The sequential sales and earnings lift in the second quarter assumes volume improvement driven by favorable seasonality in both ICS and Shelter, continued electronics recovery, and reduced destocking impacts in water and medical packaging.\n Year-over-year sales and earnings growth in the second half, embedded within our full year guidance, is expected to be driven by further electronics market recovery, including continued improvement in semiconductor fab and PCB utilization rates along with a return to volume growth in W&P. Second half earnings drivers include both volume improvement as well as expected mix benefit. \n With that, I'll turn it back to Ed. \nEdward Breen: Thanks, Lori. I'd like to note that we published our annual sustainability report earlier this week, highlighting the work of our global team to meet our commitments across all aspects of ESG, and I'm pleased with the progress and speed with which we are advancing our 2030 goals. There are 3 dimensions to our sustainability strategy: innovation; protecting people in the planet; and empowering employees and communities. I'd like to mention just a few recent accomplishments.\n More than 80% of our innovation portfolio is expected to advance our customer sustainability road map. This is a critical metric that aligns our product development with customers' expectations for both performance and sustainability. We were pleased to be recognized for this commitment by Samsung Electronics, which awarded us as a Best ESG Partner this past year.\n On climate, we delivered another year of strong performance, surpassing our 2030 goals, which are aligned with the ambition of the Paris Accord. This past year, we achieved a 58% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions from a 2019 baseline, exceeding our 2030 goal of 50%. And we achieved a 39% reduction from the 2020 baseline in Scope 3 emissions, also ahead of our 2030 goal.\n This past year, we made strong progress in the continued deployment of a company-wide operational excellence framework designed to drive continuous improvement in productivity, including deployment of standardized tools, best-in-class technologies, and practices that enhance workflows, reduce errors, minimize waste, and improve safety. Related to this, 2023 was our safest year on record for employees and contractors.\n Finally, our strong governance practices underpin our sustainability strategy as we remain committed to transparent reporting on our policies and performance with oversight from our Board. A key focus in 2023 was strengthening the DuPont Supplier Code of Conduct with our new Responsible Supplier program. These are just a few of the many great examples in the report of how our teams are delivering on our purpose in driving sustainability. \n With that, we are pleased to take your questions, and let me turn it back to the operator to open the Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] \n Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. \nJeffrey Sprague: Ed, good to see the bottom is apparently in here. And really, the nature of my question is you did a lot of hard work trying to protect margins and minimize decrementals through this protracted period of volume declines. Now that we're heading the other way, I just wonder if you could give us any perspective on, I don't know, costs that need to come back or how you feel about structural costs. And maybe the punch line is just a little bit of guidance on your incrementals as we think about volumes going the other way in E&I. \nEdward Breen: Yes, Jeff. So the cost actions we took, the bulk of them will stay in place. I would say, out of the $150 million we did and we announced in November, we'll get about $100 million of that cost savings this year. And I would say out of the $150 million though, as you get into 2025, and we're really cranking along in all our end markets, we'd probably bring back about $30 million or $40 million of cost, which is kind of on the factory footprint side, where it will be a little bit of cost there, so that would be it. \n A little bit probably in 2025 on comp because we didn't pay out 100% on our bonus plans and probably won't be -- it could be 100% this year so maybe that comp year-over-year won't be that different, but certainly from last year, 2023, a little bit of that headwind there, and '24, potentially not in '25.\n Incrementals, in the second half of the year, maybe just give you that for us, as we start bouncing back here, remember, we get some absorption benefit, obviously, because of the improvement in our sales rate. Our incrementals are planned to be around 56% in the second half of the year. And I also think, Jeff, we've derisked the second half of the year now with the baseline we're working off of now. \n We only have to ramp $340 million in sales first half to second half, which is 6%, and our EBITDA is planned in our guidance to ramp about 14%. That gets you to 56% incrementals. So I think it's significantly derisked from potentially where we were. \nLori Koch: Yes, and the 56% is first half, second half. If you look at our margin profile in the second half versus the first half in the implied guide, it is up almost 200 basis points in the low 25% range, which is a nice tailwind as we head into 2025. \nEdward Breen: Yes. And Jeff, maybe just one other because the electronics is bouncing back nice. We've always consistently, quarter in, quarter out, brand that business at like 31% to 32% EBITDA margins. Going forward, with Spectrum in there, we'd pressed the EBITDA margins just because it's a great business but they're a little bit lower than the average. So it brings it down like 100 basis points. But having said that, we should be able to run that business as we're cranking back at like 32% EBITDA margin as we get into 2025. \nJeffrey Sprague: Great. And actually, the follow-up question that's going to play into the margin calculus also, you just think about kind of electronics over time, parts of it sort of being a price down market naturally -- nature of the business. But when we think of some of the more sophisticated things going on in Semi and the like and maybe other places in the E&I portfolio, how do you feel about your ability to get price or to avoid price down over time in these businesses? \nEdward Breen: Yes. Well, Jeff, usually, the price down is at 1%. That's kind of what we've averaged so it's not really significant. Having said that, more and more of this portfolio over the next set of years is going to be advanced nodes with all the AI coming, and by the way, the AI then moving down into mobile devices. And as you know, we're advantaged there. That's how we always outgrow MSI by 200 to 300 basis points.\n So as more of the business skews there, that helps our margins just from a mix perspective, but we also get price on the more advanced platforms that we have in electronics. So ICS will probably still lose price. That's more our PCB stuff that are the laminates and displays and all that, we'll lose a little bit of price, but I got to think we'll do a little better on the chip side. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. \nC. Stephen Tusa: I think you guys had said you expected like a 10% sequential bounce off the first quarter. This is a little -- the EBITDA -- I mean, good first quarter, but the EBITDA quarter-over-quarter is a little bit lower than that, more like 4%, 5%, I guess on your guide. And anything that changed that view? Was there anything pulled forward in the first quarter that kind of takes out of the second quarter or just conservatism? \nLori Koch: Yes. No, I think it was more a reflection of the overdelivery of Q1. So originally, when we said a 10% sequential lift, we were guiding to Q1 of $610 million so would have got you roughly to $670 million. So delivering the $682 million mutes the ramp a little bit, but we still are now at $710 million versus the original $670 million, so no, actually some upside to the expectations that we had back in February when we gave that number. \nC. Stephen Tusa: Okay, that makes sense. And is there anything that is a little worse than you would have expected? It seems like obviously, electronics is coming along really nicely. The other stuff may be a little more sticky on the Industrial side. And anything that is kind of standing out as just not coming along as you would have expected on the Industrial businesses recovery? \nEdward Breen: Steve, it's pretty much as we said last quarter. Shelter will be up sequentially first to second, mostly because of seasonality, but that clearly had bottomed out already to water. By the way, we just had our manager of our Water business over in China in the last 2 weeks, and they're saying they're going to start placing more orders towards the back end of this quarter. So that feels the same.\n Same with the health care medical packaging business towards the end of this quarter, beginning of next quarter. And the only 2 that are delayed on -- they're bottomed, by the way, but they haven't recovered yet, but this is no change from what we said before is our Biopharma business, looks more like the back half of the calendar year, and our Kalrez business looks like a second half recovery. So pretty much in line.\n By the way, the one other bright spot I liked, we had been negative on growth in China through last year and we had 3% growth in China. So that market has been slowly turning back up for us. And by the way, that 3% was predominantly because the electronics business turned, we were up 15% in E&I in China in the first quarter. So that's turned nicely for us. And our semi customers in China were ordering at about -- it was about that same sales rate, about 15% growth, including the local China semi customers, not the multinational. So that was good to see. \nC. Stephen Tusa: Okay. And then just last quickly, any updates on price raws spread for you guys? I know it's less important these days but any update there? \nLori Koch: Yes, we did have a little more favorability than what we saw in Q1 that we believe will hold for the year that contributed partially to the Q1 beat. So if you look at the Q1 beat, it was about $110 million or so on revenue and then about $70 million on earnings. So obviously, we got some upside there outside of volume, and that was primarily better price/cost spread. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research. \nScott Davis: This may be hard to define explicitly, Ed, but you've mentioned a couple of quarters in a row the AI chip and data center benefit in E&I. Help us understand materiality when you think about new chip designs and such and the content of your product that's going to be needed. Does it structurally raise the growth rate, do you think, over, call it, a 5-year period? Or is there enough stuff get cannibalized and it kind of nets out to a slight positive? But perhaps, I don't know, I just have no idea so I'll ask you. \nEdward Breen: Yes. So the AI -- so the data center size for us is about $700 million of our revenue and $250 million of that ballpark, it's kind of hard to tell exactly, Scott, but about $250 million of that is AI-specific. And that is growing north of 20% right now, that base. And I do think it's -- look, I think we're going into a super cycle in semiconductor here over the next decade because of all this AI. And remember, the AI now, everyone is going to push it down into your devices. So it's going to be a pretty broad-based growth market.\n My gut is in next year, I don't want to get into forecast yet for 2025, but I got to imagine the E&I business is going to grow high single digits in 2025. And we're expecting fab utilization to exit -- starting the year in the low 70s, exiting the year in the low 80s. And I would think we're probably in the low 90s by the middle of next year, and that would give us that high single-digit growth rate. And then the AI chips, by the way, really help us because it's a higher margin business than our mix, so it should tee up for a really nice 2025. But that market is going to continue to grow north of 20% here and it's got a long cycle coming up. \nScott Davis: Okay, so material for sure. So just to back up a little bit in Water Solutions in China. I know it's not -- it's a little minutia. But was there a prebuy or some sort of, I don't want to call it channel stuffing, because that's not what I mean? But was there some sort of weird behaviors that, that customer ended up with so much excess inventory? Is it purely just the macro turned a little sideways or down on the folks in there caught with extra inventory? \nEdward Breen: Yes. So it wasn't one customer, Scott, just to clarify. I don't know if you meant it that way. We have... \nScott Davis: No, I didn't mean it that way. \nEdward Breen: We have many distributors, but 4 main distributors in China that do the bulk of our business that we don't do direct by the way. We do a lot of direct business, too. I think what -- I mean, what they verbalized to us, obviously, again, our team was just there with them this past week is industrial production slowed down. They were ordering at a higher rate, and they had to go through a destock.\n And the destock, by the way, is not as long as some of the other destocks. It looks like if it's ending here at the end of this quarter, it was about 5, 6 months of kind of working their inventories back down. So we think we're in pretty good shape going into the third quarter here. And again, we expect orders to start coming in kind of in the June timeframe to start picking up there. So it's more of the macro, I guess, I would say, Scott. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts of Mizuho. \nJohn Ezekiel Roberts: Just one for me. Maybe Lori, you could give us an update on adhesives multi-base in Tedlar. I would have thought they'd be down like your Industrial segment and they've got some auto exposure there, which was probably weak. But actually, corporate sales were up 1% year-over-year. What's going on there? \nLori Koch: Yes. So we continue to see strength on the EV side of auto. So as you had mentioned, overall auto builds are weaker right now, but there's still a lot of upside within the EV side. So that was up double digits in the quarter and we expect that to stay for the year. A lot of the upside in the volume in the quarter came from Tedlar, which is in the photovoltaic space, so we had really nice volumes within Tedlar that gave us the 1% organic for the quarter. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson of Wolfe Research. \nChristopher Parkinson: Just want to turn on the ICS side. You've seen a bit of a market share shift between Chinese OEs versus the Americans and the Northeast Asians. And I know you have exposure everywhere. And at the same time, you've also seen an increase in the sophistication of Chinese handsets. So can you just kind of parse through that in terms of where the market is right here, right now and how the Street should be thinking about your relative content exposures and how we should think about that business recovering throughout '24 and perhaps '25? \nEdward Breen: Well, I'd give you, Chris, maybe just high level that if you go back to the middle of last year, the PCB utilization rates were kind of all the way down in the mid-40s. In the first quarter, they're kind of in the mid-50s. We think we exit the year in the low 60s -- in the second half of the year, we'll kind of be in the low 60s. And normal, by the way, for PCB utilization rates is kind of low 70s. They never run in the 90s, like the semis do. So you can kind of see the progression of that plan out here kind of over the next year. \nLori Koch: Yes. We continue to see wins within the metallization space more on the circuitry side, so we've seen a nice volume lift in the first quarter, and we expect that to be maintained for the rest of the year. And we have had some share gains outside of that in the premium smartphone space on both the fulfillment side and then the other device side as well with PCs and others. \nChristopher Parkinson: Got it. Lori, you know my favorite question as a follow-up is on W&P margins. I mean, obviously, over the last few quarters, there have been a bunch of put and takes, inclusive of the destocking. But with that progressively improving throughout '24, can you help us just give us the latest and greatest on how you're thinking about the long-term margin optionality in terms of op efficiencies, leverage, mix, so on and so forth? \nLori Koch: Yes. We still see the entitlement for W&P margins in that 27% range. And so as you know, they've been challenged in the first quarter, really a function of the lower volumes. There's a lot of heavy assets in that business that take a hit when the volumes are down. We've done a nice job controlling costs to minimize the decrementals to low levels, but that is impacting it. And then the larger impact comes from just the mix side.\n So the Tyvek business is down primarily because of the medical packaging destock that's going on, that we expect to start to see resolution here at the end of this quarter and then improvement as we head into the back half. And so when you start to see those 2 items wane, we do see nice margin improvement first half, second half. So the first half margins will probably stay at that 23% level. And then we see them ticking up about 100 basis points as we get to the back half of the year. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. \nDavid Begleiter: Ed, you only raised the full year guidance by the amount of the Q1 beat. Is that because it's still early in the year or are you a little more cautious on the back half demand environment? \nEdward Breen: Yes, David, no change on our thinking on the back half. It's just as I said earlier, I feel good we've derisked the ramp in the year. So no, I don't feel any different about it. And hopefully, it ends up being a little bit conservative. \nDavid Begleiter: Very good. And can you just provide us another update on PFAS right now? \nEdward Breen: Yes, nothing significantly new there, David. The next thing coming up is the -- that we would want to settle is the Stade AG cases. I don't think that will be a 2024 event. I think it's more of a 2025 event. And then there's probably a couple of states that we will settle separately from the class action. It's where we had locations set. So I think you might potentially see one or two of those get settled maybe during this calendar year. So that's where it's at.\n I think, David, the good news with the settlement, by the way, the other settlement is done now. The water districts is totally done, signed off by the judge. And I think the nice thing about that when it comes to all the firefighting foam is that it became very clear in that litigation and then what was written about it, that the exposure of the consortium of Corteva, DuPont, and Chemours is 3% to 7% of the total exposure. And remember, DuPont's 1/3 of the 3% to 7%. So I think that helps box in what these numbers are going to be as we settle the other cases. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead of Barclays. \nMichael Leithead: First question I wanted to ask on W&P, I wanted to ask about price. It seems like it's holding in, I'd say, fairly well despite double-digit volume declines in the past few quarters. So what's your expectation for price? Should we expect this to stay relatively flat as we move through the year? \nLori Koch: Yes. So yes, we delivered flat price, overall, in W&P in the quarter. We still have some expectation to give back 1% or 2%, primarily in the Shelter business as we go throughout the year, but we have done a really nice job, as you had mentioned, holding on to price. \nMichael Leithead: Got it. That's helpful. And then bigger picture, Ed, how is Spectrum performing relative to your initial expectations? \nEdward Breen: Right on what we told our Board. It's nice to see they are basically not going through a destock, which is good. And the -- I think we've told you this before, we -- the business is growing nicely but there's also a major ramp going on with one key medical device company, and that ramp is -- by the way, it was a very significant ramp so we were -- that was the one area we've been watching really close. And they are ramping very nice with that customer. It's more of a manufacturing ramp we had to go through that was pretty significant, and that's on track also. So feeling good about that.\n And it's clearly an area we like. Between Tyvek medical packaging, the Spectrum business and the Liveo business, it's a really nice percentage of our portfolio now, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks. So it's 10% of the company, and it's just a nice end market, stable end market to be in and with a very solid steady growth rate. So we're really liking that business. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Spector of UBS. \nJoshua Spector: I was wondering if you could talk about your expectation on buybacks versus M&A. I know you talked about no M&A in 2024 kind of through the September period. Can you extend that through the rest of this year and maybe think about '25 in terms of your total capital allocation? \nEdward Breen: Yes. I would think -- so we're not planning on any acquisition this year. If we -- when we do one, I would think it's more in the tuck-in size. We're not looking at anything big. We would love to add to the health care platform. There's a fair amount of what I'd call tuck-in opportunities there. So I mean, it's possible we could do one this year, but it's not really in our plans.\n Our team, Lori and I have said that the team is all hands on deck operationally as we were going through the destock. And that was our focus area. We still have an outstanding ASR for -- we just completed the one $500 million ASR. We have one more to do so we would plan on doing that, obviously, this year. And then after that, I think, will be a nice mix of some tuck-in acquisition. And depending where our stock price is, I've always been a pretty big share repurchaser when I feel our stock or our multiple is not where it should be. So I don't think you'll see any change in our thinking there. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Sison of Wells Fargo. \nRichard Garchitorena: This is Richard on for Mike. So I just wanted to ask in terms of the guidance for the full year and what you're seeing in terms of demand and destocking coming to an end, should we expect year-over-year volume growth starting in the third quarter? Or how are you looking at volumes in the second half of the year? \nLori Koch: Yes. In the guide that we gave, we do see a return to volume growth in the second half. It ramps as you go from 3Q to 4Q, really just a comp because 4Q was our weakest quarter last year. But yes, we will be returning to growth from both a volume and earnings perspective in the second half. \nRichard Garchitorena: Okay, great. And then just in terms of your comments on China recovery, was that more specific to E&I? Or maybe if you can talk about what you're seeing on the Water Solutions side because you do find that industrial demand remains weak in China, but I guess you're saying it's recovering better than you thought? \nLori Koch: Yes. No change there. So the volume uptick that we saw in China in the first quarter was primarily E&I. As I had mentioned, we are up kind of mid-teens for volumes in China. We still do see industrial weakness that's impacting W&P primarily in the water space. So no change to our expectations that we will get the orders in from the key distributors towards the end of this quarter and be able to ship those to see a ramp sequentially in Water and then a further ramp as you head into the second half. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch of Fermium Research. \nFrank Mitsch: Lori, if I could follow up on a free cash flow question. What are your expectations? You did 86% free cash flow conversion in 1Q. What is your expectations for 2024? \nLori Koch: Yes. I think we'll be at or near our target of greater than 90%. So I was really pleased with the Q1 performance of 86%. That's a sizable improvement from where we were last year, which was around 45%. I do expect to take a little bit of a dip down in Q2, really reflecting the payment of our biannual interest expense. So that's about $200 million. We pay it in May and in November. So we'll see a headwind in Q2. But overall, I expect it to deliver nice free cash flow conversion for the year really around the target. \nFrank Mitsch: Terrific. And Ed, you commented multiple times on how progress -- that you're seeing the progress in Asia, especially in China. The year-over-year negative deltas has been lessening down to 4% organic decline in 1Q. Are you anticipating that to be flat or up in 2Q and beyond in terms of the year-over-year comp? \nLori Koch: Yes. We expect overall China to be both price and volume and currency headwinds about flat for the year. So as you had mentioned in the Q1 numbers, we were up in volume. But overall, it was about flat with the currency headwinds. So yes, an improvement in volume that we expect to see and some currency headwinds as the year goes on. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrne of Bank of America. \nSteve Byrne: The 3-year stack on volumes in your Water & Protection segment is flat. The losses over the last 4 or 5 quarters essentially offset the gains in 2021 and you had kind of flat volumes in '22. So just a question about that. Do you see that as suggesting just modest underlying volume growth? Or do you think that there might be some losses to generic products in that segment? And did you have visibility on those inventory levels that were -- that have been destocked now? \nLori Koch: Yes. I mean, I think the history has been impacted a lot by COVID. So we saw unwind of the garments that were a sizable benefit during the 2020 timeframe when you saw an unwind, not unlike most of the peers out there that saw a run-up from the garment perspective. And then once we moved through that, then we transitioned into the general industrial destock. So I think we need to look into 2025 to really get a good read on the volumes in that business.\n And right now, we're expecting low to mid-single-digit volume growth in 2025 off of a more normal macro. So no concerns overall around the efficacy of those products in the market. It's really just getting beyond those chunky one-timers around COVID and then the broader industrial destock to be able to see the true growth profile of that business. \nSteve Byrne: And then Kalrez and Tedlar, these are both \n fluoropolymer products. Just a question for you on that. Do you have any customers that are saying, I'm going to switch to something else just to avoid the\n fluoropolymer issue? And how are you managing your own wastewater from the manufacturing of those products? \nLori Koch: No. I mean, in fact, in Tedlar, we're actually seeing some questions around. It is a PFAS-free, so there's some opportunity there to maybe pick up some share on the Advanced Materials side or the PV side and be opportunistic. And I know directly back from customers, and obviously, we published our sustainability report earlier this week. There's a lot of examples in there around our commitments to that as well as just overall water key drivers around the sustainability footprint. \nOperator: And our last question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander from Jefferies LLC. \nLaurence Alexander: Just a quick one on the electronics side. How far do you see the growth trajectory for that business? Or how much can you expand it before you need to do a significant round of CapEx additions? \nEdward Breen: Yes. The good news on the E&I side, by the way, which is very different than the W&P side, they're not heavy assets. More of our CapEx on the electronics side, Laurence, actually goes into our testing equipment. We have to have very state-of-the-art testing equipment in the key regions where our customers are. And so that's where we'll add some CapEx over time. But we can kind of modularly upgrade the electronics manufacturing locations. So that's not going to be a big CapEx spend for us.\n But my gut is we'll be looking at some expansion work here as we see this kind of super cycle coming on the semi side. So that's -- by the way, if this were like our Tyvek business, as you know, we're launching [ Lynade ] over in Luxembourg. We've already done our first test runs of product, by the way, which has gone very well, but that project was $450 million. We don't have anything like that on the electronics side. So that's good and it's quicker to upgrade, the manufacturing capacity also in the electronics side. So we'll stay on top of that as we see this growth over the next steady years to come. \nOperator: There are no further questions at this time, so I'd like to hand the call back to Chris Mecray. \nChristopher Mecray: Okay. Thank you, everybody, for joining the call. We appreciate your interest. And as always, we'll post a copy of the transcript on the DuPont IR website. This concludes the call. Thank you. \nOperator: That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may now all disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Lori Koch",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed, and good morning. Our first quarter results were clearly encouraging with further signs of electronics recovery matched with bottoming across our industrial-based end markets. Additionally, our commitment to drive productivity and operational excellence has minimized decremental margins and has helped to produce significant cash flow improvement in recent quarters. Our results have and will continue to benefit from the restructuring actions announced last November.\n Turning to Slide 5, I'll cover our first quarter financial highlights. Net sales of $2.9 billion decreased 3% versus the year ago period, as a 6% organic sales decline and a 1% currency headwind was partially offset by favorable portfolio benefits of 4%, primarily from the Spectrum acquisition. The organic sales decline reflects a 5% decrease in volume and a 1% decrease in price. Lower volume was driven by the impact of continued channel inventory destocking in Water Solutions, mainly in China, and Safety Solutions, most notably for Tyvek medical packaging, and Industrial Solutions for Tyvek's parts and Liveo biopharma products. These declines were partially offset by strong growth in electronics where Semi and Interconnect Solutions volumes increased 8% in aggregate versus the prior year period.\n On a segment view, W&P and E&I organic sales declined 10% and 2%, respectively, while organic sales and corporate increased 1%. From a regional perspective, sales decreased on an organic basis globally versus the year ago period, with Europe, North America and Asia Pacific down 8%, 7%, and 4%, respectively. In China, sales volumes were up 3% year-over-year as growth in E&I more than offset declines in W&P due to continued pressure in water markets.\n First quarter operating EBITDA of $682 million decreased 4% as volume declines were partially offset by the impact of lower product costs and Spectrum earnings contribution. Operating EBITDA during the quarter of 23.3% was down 40 basis points versus the year ago period. \n I am pleased with our cash flow improvement as we focus our efforts on optimizing working capital performance. On a continuing operations basis, cash flow from operations of $493 million, less capital expenditures of $207 million resulted in adjusted free cash flow of $286 million in the first quarter, a significant increase versus $173 million in the year ago period. Adjusted free cash flow conversion during the quarter was 86%, significantly ahead of last year.\n Turning to Slide 6. Adjusted EPS for the quarter of $0.79 per share decreased from $0.84 in the year ago period. Lower segment earnings, higher net interest expense and higher depreciation more than offset a $0.06 benefit from a lower share count. Our tax rate for the quarter was 24.6%, up from 23.4% in the year ago period, driven by geographic mix and earnings. Our full year 2024 base tax rate outlook of 23% to 24% remains unchanged.\n Turning to segment results, beginning with E&I on Slide 7. E&I's first quarter net sales of $1.4 billion increased 5% as a Spectrum sales contribution of 8% was partially offset by an organic sales decline of 2% and a 1% currency headwind. The organic sales decline reflects a 1% decrease in volume and a 1% decrease in price due to the pass-through of lower metal prices. Effective with our first quarter reporting, I will highlight that we realigned certain product lines within our 3 E&I lines of business. The changes streamline our cost structure, while also optimizing certain product offerings to better focus on our customers. Additional detail has been provided on Slide 15 in the appendix.\n For the first quarter of 2024, organic sales for Semiconductor Technologies were up 10% versus the year ago period due to the start of overall semiconductor market demand recovery, along with normalization of customer inventory levels and continued strong demand for OLED display materials. We expect underlying semi demand to continue to improve throughout the year, and note that our forecasts continue to call for semi fab utilization rates to increase from the low 70s percent that we saw in the first quarter to a fourth quarter exit rate in the low 80s.\n Within Interconnect Solutions, organic sales were up slightly as mid-single-digit volume gains were mostly offset by the impact of lower metals prices. This was the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year volume growth for ICS as broad electronic markets continue to recover. Organic sales for Industrial Solutions were down about 20% due primarily to ongoing channel inventory destocking for Kalrez O-rings and our Liveo product lines within biopharma markets. We continue to expect to see order improvement over the next several quarters in our Kalrez business. And our Liveo biopharma business is also still expected to recover later in the second half. \n Operating EBITDA from E&I of $374 million was up 3% versus the year ago period, driven by strength in Semi and Interconnect Solutions and the earnings contribution from Spectrum, partially offset by the impact of lower volumes in Industrial Solutions.\n Turning to Slide 8. W&P first quarter net sales of $1.3 billion declined 11% versus the year ago period due to a 10% decrease in volume and a 1% currency headwind. Within Safety Solutions, organic sales were down low teens on lower volumes, driven mainly by channel inventory destocking, most notably for Tyvek medical packaging products. We believe our customers' inventory is close to normal at this point for Tyvek medical packaging. \n Within Water, organic sales were down mid-teens, driven by distributor inventory destocking and lower industrial demand in China. We continue to have active communication with our distributors and believe orders will pick up towards the end of the second quarter.\n Shelter Solutions were flat on an organic basis compared to the year ago period, and we expect sequential lift in the second quarter. Operating EBITDA for W&P during the quarter of $295 million decreased 14% due to lower volumes, partially offset by the impact of lower product costs.\n Turning to Slide 9, I'll provide an update on our full year 2024 guidance as well as our expectations for the second quarter. We are raising our full year guidance for net sales, operating EBITDA, and adjusted EPS. At the midpoint of the revised ranges provided, we now expect full year net sales of about $12.25 billion, operating EBITDA of about $2.975 billion, and adjusted EPS of $3.60 a share, which now indicates expected year-over-year earnings growth.\n For the second quarter of 2024, we expect net sales of about $3.025 billion, operating EBITDA of about $710 million and adjusted EPS of $0.84 per share. The sequential sales and earnings lift in the second quarter assumes volume improvement driven by favorable seasonality in both ICS and Shelter, continued electronics recovery, and reduced destocking impacts in water and medical packaging.\n Year-over-year sales and earnings growth in the second half, embedded within our full year guidance, is expected to be driven by further electronics market recovery, including continued improvement in semiconductor fab and PCB utilization rates along with a return to volume growth in W&P. Second half earnings drivers include both volume improvement as well as expected mix benefit. \n With that, I'll turn it back to Ed. Yes, and the 56% is first half, second half. If you look at our margin profile in the second half versus the first half in the implied guide, it is up almost 200 basis points in the low 25% range, which is a nice tailwind as we head into 2025. Yes. No, I think it was more a reflection of the overdelivery of Q1. So originally, when we said a 10% sequential lift, we were guiding to Q1 of $610 million so would have got you roughly to $670 million. So delivering the $682 million mutes the ramp a little bit, but we still are now at $710 million versus the original $670 million, so no, actually some upside to the expectations that we had back in February when we gave that number. Yes, we did have a little more favorability than what we saw in Q1 that we believe will hold for the year that contributed partially to the Q1 beat. So if you look at the Q1 beat, it was about $110 million or so on revenue and then about $70 million on earnings. So obviously, we got some upside there outside of volume, and that was primarily better price/cost spread. Yes. So we continue to see strength on the EV side of auto. So as you had mentioned, overall auto builds are weaker right now, but there's still a lot of upside within the EV side. So that was up double digits in the quarter and we expect that to stay for the year. A lot of the upside in the volume in the quarter came from Tedlar, which is in the photovoltaic space, so we had really nice volumes within Tedlar that gave us the 1% organic for the quarter. Yes. We continue to see wins within the metallization space more on the circuitry side, so we've seen a nice volume lift in the first quarter, and we expect that to be maintained for the rest of the year. And we have had some share gains outside of that in the premium smartphone space on both the fulfillment side and then the other device side as well with PCs and others. Yes. We still see the entitlement for W&P margins in that 27% range. And so as you know, they've been challenged in the first quarter, really a function of the lower volumes. There's a lot of heavy assets in that business that take a hit when the volumes are down. We've done a nice job controlling costs to minimize the decrementals to low levels, but that is impacting it. And then the larger impact comes from just the mix side.\n So the Tyvek business is down primarily because of the medical packaging destock that's going on, that we expect to start to see resolution here at the end of this quarter and then improvement as we head into the back half. And so when you start to see those 2 items wane, we do see nice margin improvement first half, second half. So the first half margins will probably stay at that 23% level. And then we see them ticking up about 100 basis points as we get to the back half of the year. Yes. So yes, we delivered flat price, overall, in W&P in the quarter. We still have some expectation to give back 1% or 2%, primarily in the Shelter business as we go throughout the year, but we have done a really nice job, as you had mentioned, holding on to price. Yes. In the guide that we gave, we do see a return to volume growth in the second half. It ramps as you go from 3Q to 4Q, really just a comp because 4Q was our weakest quarter last year. But yes, we will be returning to growth from both a volume and earnings perspective in the second half. Yes. No change there. So the volume uptick that we saw in China in the first quarter was primarily E&I. As I had mentioned, we are up kind of mid-teens for volumes in China. We still do see industrial weakness that's impacting W&P primarily in the water space. So no change to our expectations that we will get the orders in from the key distributors towards the end of this quarter and be able to ship those to see a ramp sequentially in Water and then a further ramp as you head into the second half. Yes. I think we'll be at or near our target of greater than 90%. So I was really pleased with the Q1 performance of 86%. That's a sizable improvement from where we were last year, which was around 45%. I do expect to take a little bit of a dip down in Q2, really reflecting the payment of our biannual interest expense. So that's about $200 million. We pay it in May and in November. So we'll see a headwind in Q2. But overall, I expect it to deliver nice free cash flow conversion for the year really around the target. Yes. We expect overall China to be both price and volume and currency headwinds about flat for the year. So as you had mentioned in the Q1 numbers, we were up in volume. But overall, it was about flat with the currency headwinds. So yes, an improvement in volume that we expect to see and some currency headwinds as the year goes on. Yes. I mean, I think the history has been impacted a lot by COVID. So we saw unwind of the garments that were a sizable benefit during the 2020 timeframe when you saw an unwind, not unlike most of the peers out there that saw a run-up from the garment perspective. And then once we moved through that, then we transitioned into the general industrial destock. So I think we need to look into 2025 to really get a good read on the volumes in that business.\n And right now, we're expecting low to mid-single-digit volume growth in 2025 off of a more normal macro. So no concerns overall around the efficacy of those products in the market. It's really just getting beyond those chunky one-timers around COVID and then the broader industrial destock to be able to see the true growth profile of that business.

            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining our First Quarter 2024 Financial Review. Our results for the period exceeded our expectations, driven by better-than-expected volumes in all segments. Broadly, the first quarter confirmed that we are past the bottom in electronics and on the road to recovery. Our Semiconductor Technologies business reported sequential sales growth of 8% in the first quarter and 10% year-over-year, driven by a pickup in the underlying chip demand and normalization of customer inventory levels, both slightly earlier than expected.\n In Interconnect Solutions, we saw a second straight quarter of year-over-year volume growth with volumes up 4%. We did, however, continue to see channel inventory destocking, as expected, resulting in year-over-year revenue declines in certain industrial-based businesses, but we believe those conditions have bottomed and our assumed recovery timing is also consistent with our previous expectations. That said, and given first quarter performance, we are raising our full year 2024 guidance for net sales, operating EBITDA, and adjusted EPS. Lori will further detail the outlook shortly.\n Compared to the year ago period, first quarter reported sales of $2.9 billion declined 3%, operating EBITDA of $682 million declined 4%, and adjusted EPS of $0.79 per share declined 6%. We continue to prioritize working capital and delivered significant year-over-year improvement in cash flow during the quarter. In late April, we completed the $500 million accelerated share repurchase transaction launched in February, retiring a total of 6.9 million shares in this tranche and bringing total share repurchases to over 15% of our outstanding shares since November 2022.\n Turning to Slide 4, I want to reiterate that we remain excited about the growth potential of our businesses, centered around 5 secular high-growth areas. We are excited about the through-cycle strength of our portfolio as end markets recover from recent destocking headwinds, and our teams continue to focus on operational excellence. \n Almost 1/3 of sales exposure for our portfolio today is focused on electronics, including leadership positions and strong customer relationships serving semiconductor manufacturing, primarily via consumables used in the chip manufacturing process, as well as serving broader consumer-based electronics markets with films, displays, and printed circuit board materials used in smartphones, PCs, and tablets.\n We are very pleased to participate in the AI-driven growth acceleration within electronics via our semi-related products geared towards advanced node chips for data centers and other key AI applications, such as mobile products. Electronics end markets have positively inflected, and we expect continued volume pickup in both Semi and ICS over the course of 2024. Our Water business at 12% of our portfolio constitutes a broad range of filtration technologies and operates in markets expected to generate strong growth, driven by evolving wastewater regulation and the global response to concerns around water scarcity and circularity. We believe demand for filtration products, which have been impacted by slower project work in the last year and associated distributor destocking has bottomed and will begin to recover later in the second quarter. \n We have excellent leadership positions in various end markets within protection and industrial technologies. Within industrial technologies, about 10% of the DuPont portfolio is geared to growing health care markets, including Spectrum medical devices, Tyvek medical packaging and Liveo biopharma consumables. We have seen ongoing solid demand for devices and expect to see recovery in medical packaging beginning later in the second quarter. Biopharma product demand is expected to recover beginning later in the year after bottoming in recent periods.\n DuPont's next-generation auto market participation constitutes about 10% of total sales and is geared to advanced technologies, enabling secular demand trends for hybrid and electric vehicles within battery, motor and other applications. Demand for our advanced water-related products has remained healthy, and we have a global customer base that includes EV customers in each region. We see excellent longer-term opportunity across our auto-related portfolio. \n With that, let me turn it over to Lori to review our financial performance and outlook. Thanks, Lori. I'd like to note that we published our annual sustainability report earlier this week, highlighting the work of our global team to meet our commitments across all aspects of ESG, and I'm pleased with the progress and speed with which we are advancing our 2030 goals. There are 3 dimensions to our sustainability strategy: innovation; protecting people in the planet; and empowering employees and communities. I'd like to mention just a few recent accomplishments.\n More than 80% of our innovation portfolio is expected to advance our customer sustainability road map. This is a critical metric that aligns our product development with customers' expectations for both performance and sustainability. We were pleased to be recognized for this commitment by Samsung Electronics, which awarded us as a Best ESG Partner this past year.\n On climate, we delivered another year of strong performance, surpassing our 2030 goals, which are aligned with the ambition of the Paris Accord. This past year, we achieved a 58% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions from a 2019 baseline, exceeding our 2030 goal of 50%. And we achieved a 39% reduction from the 2020 baseline in Scope 3 emissions, also ahead of our 2030 goal.\n This past year, we made strong progress in the continued deployment of a company-wide operational excellence framework designed to drive continuous improvement in productivity, including deployment of standardized tools, best-in-class technologies, and practices that enhance workflows, reduce errors, minimize waste, and improve safety. Related to this, 2023 was our safest year on record for employees and contractors.\n Finally, our strong governance practices underpin our sustainability strategy as we remain committed to transparent reporting on our policies and performance with oversight from our Board. A key focus in 2023 was strengthening the DuPont Supplier Code of Conduct with our new Responsible Supplier program. These are just a few of the many great examples in the report of how our teams are delivering on our purpose in driving sustainability. \n With that, we are pleased to take your questions, and let me turn it back to the operator to open the Q&A. Yes, Jeff. So the cost actions we took, the bulk of them will stay in place. I would say, out of the $150 million we did and we announced in November, we'll get about $100 million of that cost savings this year. And I would say out of the $150 million though, as you get into 2025, and we're really cranking along in all our end markets, we'd probably bring back about $30 million or $40 million of cost, which is kind of on the factory footprint side, where it will be a little bit of cost there, so that would be it. \n A little bit probably in 2025 on comp because we didn't pay out 100% on our bonus plans and probably won't be -- it could be 100% this year so maybe that comp year-over-year won't be that different, but certainly from last year, 2023, a little bit of that headwind there, and '24, potentially not in '25.\n Incrementals, in the second half of the year, maybe just give you that for us, as we start bouncing back here, remember, we get some absorption benefit, obviously, because of the improvement in our sales rate. Our incrementals are planned to be around 56% in the second half of the year. And I also think, Jeff, we've derisked the second half of the year now with the baseline we're working off of now. \n We only have to ramp $340 million in sales first half to second half, which is 6%, and our EBITDA is planned in our guidance to ramp about 14%. That gets you to 56% incrementals. So I think it's significantly derisked from potentially where we were. Yes. And Jeff, maybe just one other because the electronics is bouncing back nice. We've always consistently, quarter in, quarter out, brand that business at like 31% to 32% EBITDA margins. Going forward, with Spectrum in there, we'd pressed the EBITDA margins just because it's a great business but they're a little bit lower than the average. So it brings it down like 100 basis points. But having said that, we should be able to run that business as we're cranking back at like 32% EBITDA margin as we get into 2025. Yes. Well, Jeff, usually, the price down is at 1%. That's kind of what we've averaged so it's not really significant. Having said that, more and more of this portfolio over the next set of years is going to be advanced nodes with all the AI coming, and by the way, the AI then moving down into mobile devices. And as you know, we're advantaged there. That's how we always outgrow MSI by 200 to 300 basis points.\n So as more of the business skews there, that helps our margins just from a mix perspective, but we also get price on the more advanced platforms that we have in electronics. So ICS will probably still lose price. That's more our PCB stuff that are the laminates and displays and all that, we'll lose a little bit of price, but I got to think we'll do a little better on the chip side. Steve, it's pretty much as we said last quarter. Shelter will be up sequentially first to second, mostly because of seasonality, but that clearly had bottomed out already to water. By the way, we just had our manager of our Water business over in China in the last 2 weeks, and they're saying they're going to start placing more orders towards the back end of this quarter. So that feels the same.\n Same with the health care medical packaging business towards the end of this quarter, beginning of next quarter. And the only 2 that are delayed on -- they're bottomed, by the way, but they haven't recovered yet, but this is no change from what we said before is our Biopharma business, looks more like the back half of the calendar year, and our Kalrez business looks like a second half recovery. So pretty much in line.\n By the way, the one other bright spot I liked, we had been negative on growth in China through last year and we had 3% growth in China. So that market has been slowly turning back up for us. And by the way, that 3% was predominantly because the electronics business turned, we were up 15% in E&I in China in the first quarter. So that's turned nicely for us. And our semi customers in China were ordering at about -- it was about that same sales rate, about 15% growth, including the local China semi customers, not the multinational. So that was good to see. Yes. So the AI -- so the data center size for us is about $700 million of our revenue and $250 million of that ballpark, it's kind of hard to tell exactly, Scott, but about $250 million of that is AI-specific. And that is growing north of 20% right now, that base. And I do think it's -- look, I think we're going into a super cycle in semiconductor here over the next decade because of all this AI. And remember, the AI now, everyone is going to push it down into your devices. So it's going to be a pretty broad-based growth market.\n My gut is in next year, I don't want to get into forecast yet for 2025, but I got to imagine the E&I business is going to grow high single digits in 2025. And we're expecting fab utilization to exit -- starting the year in the low 70s, exiting the year in the low 80s. And I would think we're probably in the low 90s by the middle of next year, and that would give us that high single-digit growth rate. And then the AI chips, by the way, really help us because it's a higher margin business than our mix, so it should tee up for a really nice 2025. But that market is going to continue to grow north of 20% here and it's got a long cycle coming up. Yes. So it wasn't one customer, Scott, just to clarify. I don't know if you meant it that way. We have... We have many distributors, but 4 main distributors in China that do the bulk of our business that we don't do direct by the way. We do a lot of direct business, too. I think what -- I mean, what they verbalized to us, obviously, again, our team was just there with them this past week is industrial production slowed down. They were ordering at a higher rate, and they had to go through a destock.\n And the destock, by the way, is not as long as some of the other destocks. It looks like if it's ending here at the end of this quarter, it was about 5, 6 months of kind of working their inventories back down. So we think we're in pretty good shape going into the third quarter here. And again, we expect orders to start coming in kind of in the June timeframe to start picking up there. So it's more of the macro, I guess, I would say, Scott. Well, I'd give you, Chris, maybe just high level that if you go back to the middle of last year, the PCB utilization rates were kind of all the way down in the mid-40s. In the first quarter, they're kind of in the mid-50s. We think we exit the year in the low 60s -- in the second half of the year, we'll kind of be in the low 60s. And normal, by the way, for PCB utilization rates is kind of low 70s. They never run in the 90s, like the semis do. So you can kind of see the progression of that plan out here kind of over the next year. Yes, David, no change on our thinking on the back half. It's just as I said earlier, I feel good we've derisked the ramp in the year. So no, I don't feel any different about it. And hopefully, it ends up being a little bit conservative. Yes, nothing significantly new there, David. The next thing coming up is the -- that we would want to settle is the Stade AG cases. I don't think that will be a 2024 event. I think it's more of a 2025 event. And then there's probably a couple of states that we will settle separately from the class action. It's where we had locations set. So I think you might potentially see one or two of those get settled maybe during this calendar year. So that's where it's at.\n I think, David, the good news with the settlement, by the way, the other settlement is done now. The water districts is totally done, signed off by the judge. And I think the nice thing about that when it comes to all the firefighting foam is that it became very clear in that litigation and then what was written about it, that the exposure of the consortium of Corteva, DuPont, and Chemours is 3% to 7% of the total exposure. And remember, DuPont's 1/3 of the 3% to 7%. So I think that helps box in what these numbers are going to be as we settle the other cases. Right on what we told our Board. It's nice to see they are basically not going through a destock, which is good. And the -- I think we've told you this before, we -- the business is growing nicely but there's also a major ramp going on with one key medical device company, and that ramp is -- by the way, it was a very significant ramp so we were -- that was the one area we've been watching really close. And they are ramping very nice with that customer. It's more of a manufacturing ramp we had to go through that was pretty significant, and that's on track also. So feeling good about that.\n And it's clearly an area we like. Between Tyvek medical packaging, the Spectrum business and the Liveo business, it's a really nice percentage of our portfolio now, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks. So it's 10% of the company, and it's just a nice end market, stable end market to be in and with a very solid steady growth rate. So we're really liking that business. Yes. I would think -- so we're not planning on any acquisition this year. If we -- when we do one, I would think it's more in the tuck-in size. We're not looking at anything big. We would love to add to the health care platform. There's a fair amount of what I'd call tuck-in opportunities there. So I mean, it's possible we could do one this year, but it's not really in our plans.\n Our team, Lori and I have said that the team is all hands on deck operationally as we were going through the destock. And that was our focus area. We still have an outstanding ASR for -- we just completed the one $500 million ASR. We have one more to do so we would plan on doing that, obviously, this year. And then after that, I think, will be a nice mix of some tuck-in acquisition. And depending where our stock price is, I've always been a pretty big share repurchaser when I feel our stock or our multiple is not where it should be. So I don't think you'll see any change in our thinking there. Yes. The good news on the E&I side, by the way, which is very different than the W&P side, they're not heavy assets. More of our CapEx on the electronics side, Laurence, actually goes into our testing equipment. We have to have very state-of-the-art testing equipment in the key regions where our customers are. And so that's where we'll add some CapEx over time. But we can kind of modularly upgrade the electronics manufacturing locations. So that's not going to be a big CapEx spend for us.\n But my gut is we'll be looking at some expansion work here as we see this kind of super cycle coming on the semi side. So that's -- by the way, if this were like our Tyvek business, as you know, we're launching [ Lynade ] over in Luxembourg. We've already done our first test runs of product, by the way, which has gone very well, but that project was $450 million. We don't have anything like that on the electronics side. So that's good and it's quicker to upgrade, the manufacturing capacity also in the electronics side. So we'll stay on top of that as we see this growth over the next steady years to come."
