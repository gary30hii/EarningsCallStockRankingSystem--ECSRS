At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the spear presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] With that, I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker, Ms. Melissa Napier. Thank you, and please go ahead.\nMelissa Napier: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to today\u2019s earnings call. I\u2019m joined by Pietro Satriano, our CEO; and Dirk Locascio, our CFO. Pietro and Dirk will provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020. We\u2019ll take your questions after our prepared remarks conclude. Please provide your name, your firm and limit yourself to one question. During today\u2019s call and unless otherwise stated, we\u2019re comparing our fourth quarter and full fiscal year result for the same period in fiscal year 2019. Please keep in mind that the fourth quarter in fiscal 2020 included 14 weeks versus 13 weeks in 2019, and full fiscal 2020 results included 53 weeks versus 52 weeks in fiscal 2019. References to organic financial results during today\u2019s call exclude contributions from Smart Foodservice, which we acquired in April 2020. For the Food Group, our organic financial results reflect contributions from September 14, 2020, which is the one-year anniversary of the completion of the acquisition through the end of the 2020 fiscal year. Our earnings release issued earlier this morning and today's presentation slides can be accessed on the Investor Relations page of our website. In addition to historical information, certain statements made during today's call are considered forward-looking statements. Please review the risk factors in our 2019 Form 10-K and last quarter's 10-Q filed with the SEC for these potential factors, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in those statements. Lastly, during today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. All reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the schedules on our earnings press release as well as in the appendices to the presentation slides posted on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Pietro.\nPietro Satriano: Thanks, Melissa. Good morning, everyone. I hope everyone's year is off to a good start. I'd like to start by thanking our 26,000 associates, whose commitment to serving and helping our customers during what has been almost an entire year of the pandemic has truly been second to none. The results we are covering today are only possible because of their hard work. I'm going to begin today's remarks on slide 2 with a brief summary of the three main topics we are going to cover. First, even though we are very pleased with how well our Great Food. Made Easy strategy has served us over the years, we continue to develop and enhance our capabilities so that our strategy can have an even greater success over the coming years. Second, we have taken several steps to position the business for a recovery, and we are confident that these actions will allow us to continue to gain market share as the recovery takes shape. And third, the changes we have made to our cost structure and the new business we have won over the last eight months has strengthened the future earnings power of the business. I will cover the first two topics and Dirk will cover the last one.  Moving -- 3. Our Great Food, Made Easy strategy has proven to be enduring, but this does not mean we are standing still. We are continuing to evolve our capabilities to further improve the customer experience and take advantage of future growth opportunities.  Let's start with innovative products, which is at the heart of Great Food. During COVID, there was a shift in the products that customers rely on the most, products that travel well and packaging that builds trust with consumers. We adopted our Scoop platform to quickly jump on these trends and results from our last two Scoop launches have been in line with prior pre-COVID launches.  Even with the pandemic, consumer interest for more sustainable, healthier choices continues to grow. That's why the theme of our spring Scoop, which launches in two weeks is Hungry for Better. The lineup features: new products under Serve Good, our growing lineup of sustainably sourced products; a range of plant-based meat alternatives for burgers and tacos; and a range of functional food with ingredients that introduce a healthy twist to some of those favorites.  Continuing with the theme of product innovation, as we have mentioned in the past, one of the big benefits of the acquisition of Food Group is the ability to leverage some unique capabilities in Center-of-the-plate and Produce, two categories that drive a higher basket and greater stickiness.  Having made good progress on the integration front, we are now beginning to introduce these Food Group capabilities into legacy U.S. Foods market. And while it will take some time to roll these capabilities out across the country, we are excited about how these capabilities will accelerate the opportunity to grow share of wallet in those two categories.  Moving to technology, which is at the heart of making things easy for customers. The consumer shift to more digital and more off-premise dining has made our technology and e-commerce offerings even more important than they were before. For example, 68% of consumers say they are more likely to purchase takeout than they were pre-COVID.  As a result, we are seeing a corresponding increase in demand from operators for applications that help them ride the growth in off-premise dining. Our partnership with ChowNow is a good example. We also continue to invest in our technology platform, having recently improved our product search capabilities and our analytics platform to allow us to drive more targeted pricing and product recommendation to customers and to our sellers.  The last set of capabilities on the right that we are evolving is our operating model. One of the key learnings from COVID has been how we can operate more effectively as a company. We've learned to use technology to leverage individual process experts to more quickly adopt its practices across the country. As an example, we recently rolled out a new warehouse pick process in four weeks, something that might have taken us four months in the past.  As a result of these learnings, we are refining our operating model by shifting some responsibilities and resources from our region teams to our centers of excellence. These centers of excellence have responsibility for identifying and deploying best practices across the country and this shift in resources will result in a more consistent execution.  In conjunction with this shift, we have reduced the number of regions from six to four in the second quarter. This does not change the cost savings that we announced in August, but is simply a logical evolution of our operating model informed by the experiences over the last 12 months and they end up providing more consistent execution. Also in conjunction with this shift, we are consolidating merchandising and local sales under Andrew Iacobucci. Andrew has been overseeing these two functions on an interim basis for the last 12 months, and so now he becomes our Chief Commercial Officer. Also critical to advancing our strategy has been the capabilities we now have access to as a result of the acquisitions of Food Group and Smart Foodservice. So, let's move to Page 4 for an update on the business performance and integration, starting with Food Group. Integration and synergy capture are on track. So far, we have completed two warehouse system conversions, and we expect to have the third completed by early next quarter. The conversions to date have gone very well, and we expect to have the remainder completed in the second half of this year, in line with our original plan, despite some of the early delays from COVID. We are also on track to achieve our previously announced $65 million in annualized synergies and the business is performing in line with expectations. The Smart Foodservice business continues to outperform our delivery business, and we continue to be excited about the future growth opportunities in the cash and carry space. You will recall, part of the strategic rationale for the acquisition of Smart Foodservice, is the incremental sale, it drives to our delivery business. To help capitalize on this opportunity, we will rebrand all Smart Foodservice locations to the US Foods CHEF'STORE brand in the first quarter. This rebranding will also facilitate our entry into new geographic markets, where US Foods has an established presence. For 2021, we plan to open three to four stores, primarily in existing Smart Foodservice markets. But we do expect the pace of store openings to pick up in future years, as we expand the footprint into new geographies. I'm now on Slide 5, where I would like to close with a quick overview of how we are positioning our business to gain market share as our industry recovers. In prior calls, we talked about the $800 million of annualized new customer wins with larger customers in 2020. We feel good about the 2021 pipeline and our ability to continue to profitably gain market share with larger national customers. To prepare for the expected increase in case volume that we foresee in the coming quarters, we have started to hire warehouse, transportation and sales associates in anticipation of the recovery. We are also investing in inventory to support our customers while partnering with several of our larger customers to understand the demand curve they are seeing in their business. And lastly, the evolution of our capabilities and our operating model, that I discussed earlier position us to emerge from COVID as a stronger and more effective business. I would now like to turn the call over to Dirk, for a discussion of our fourth quarter financial results, and how we have strengthened the future earnings power of our business.\nDirk Locascio: Thank you, Pietro, and good morning. I'll begin on Slide 7. I'm going to cover a few highlights for the quarter, before we discuss our thoughts on 2021. Melissa mentioned this earlier but just as a reminder, our fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2020 results do contain an extra week, so the fourth quarter 2020 results reflect 14 weeks of activity while the full year results reflect 53 weeks. As we discussed at the ICR conference in January, case volumes slowed in the last half of Q4 as COVID cases increased and additional restrictions were put in place on in-person dining. We have seen an improvement in restaurant and overall volume trends in January, which although early on, is encouraging. We've also successfully onboarded 99% of the $800 million of new large customer wins that we discussed last quarter and Pietro mentioned. Our pipeline remains robust and we expect to continue to win new business, resulting in further share gains. Typically, in our fourth quarter, we see a meaningful seasonal gross profit margin lift based on changes to our product mix, some of which from holiday parties and events. This year, we did not see that margin lift and our gross profit rate was in line with the third quarter. Lastly, our Q4 operating expenses on a 13-week constant basis increased compared to our third quarter 2020 expenses. As a reminder, the third quarter OpEx benefited from a $17 million non-recurring real estate gain. During the fourth quarter, we also experienced higher healthcare and incentive compensation costs. On the healthcare side, we typically see an increased cost in the fourth quarter, and this year's cost increase was more than the normal seasonal increase as associates who are not able or chose not to schedule procedures earlier in the year, did so in Q4. On the incentive comp side, mid-year 2020, we developed a revised incentive plan that resulted in some additional compensation costs in the fourth quarter. Distribution costs for the quarter was in line with Q3. However, as Pietro noted, we do expect distribution costs to temporarily increase in the first half of 2021, as we continue to increase hiring in warehouse and delivery ahead of the recovery. Moving to slide eight. Sales inflation for the fourth quarter was 2%, similar to the past few quarters and remains in a very manageable range. The 53rd week contributed 5.3% to our fourth quarter net sales. Net sales for the quarter, excluding the extra week, were in line with Q3 net sales. Adjusted gross profit margin for the fourth quarter decreased approximately 110 basis points from the prior year, which is similar to the Q3 change versus prior year. Adjusted gross profit margin in Q4 did not have the typical seasonal margin improvement, as I noted earlier. Adjusted operating expense in the fourth quarter increased 90 basis points from the prior year, compared to about 50 basis point increase from prior year in Q3, when you exclude the Q3 non-recurring property gain. The 40 basis point increase in our adjusted OpEx, as a percent of sales, from Q3 to Q4, ex the property gain, was primarily the result of the healthcare and incentive comp factors I discussed. As the recovery in case volume occurs, we do expect the negative mix impact on our gross profit and the negative impact of OpEx deleverage to improve and expect the current impacts to be transitory. On slide nine, adjusted EBITDA was $174 million for the quarter, including approximately $8 million for the extra week. When you exclude the real estate gain from our third quarter results and the benefit of the extra week in the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA declined $26 million in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. This is primarily due to the OpEx items I just noted. Adjusted net income was $10 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.05 for the fourth quarter. Pietro discussed how we're positioning the business for recovery, and this remains our primary focus at the present time, and we expect our financial results to significantly improve as case volume continues to recover. I'm now on slide 10, where I'll spend a few minutes on our outlook for 2021. We remain confident that case volume will recover as COVID cases decline, restaurant restrictions are lifted and vaccine distribution expands. Since the timing of the recovery remains uncertain, we're not providing financial guidance for 2021. Regarding synergies, we did achieve the $10 million of Food Group synergies we were targeting for 2020 and remain on track for the full $65 million of synergies by the end of 2023. We're also on track to achieve the $20 million of Smart synergies by the end of 2024. Our liquidity position remains strong with over $800 million of cash on hand and over $2.7 billion of total liquidity. Our revolving credit line remains largely undrawn. And as the recovery takes shape, we expect to use the excess cash on our balance sheet to reduce outstanding debt. The cash flow of our business remained strong, and in 2021, we'll be focused on investing in our business and reducing debt. Delevering is a priority in the coming years. In 2020, we reduced our capital spend to those items essential to the continued operation of the business. At this time, we are planning to resume a more normal level of capital spend, focusing on building and expansion projects that we slowed or paused last year in addition to continuing to invest in our technology platform. The resumption of these projects will help drive growth as the recovery takes shape. Moving to slide 11. The actions we took during 2020 have strengthened the future earnings power across our business. We are continuing to focus on profitably winning market share with new business wins across small and large customers. As our case volume with small and large customers recover, we expect our gross profit margin will improve as well. This is largely due to the expected improvements in our customer mix. When you combine this with a $180 million of fixed cost reductions, most of which we expect to be permanent, we expect the business to likely operate a higher EBITDA margin post COVID. Finally, our business continues to generate strong cash flow that will be used for future debt reduction and to further improve the earnings power of the business. We generated over $400 million of operating cash flow even in a pandemic impacted fiscal 2020, demonstrating the resiliency of our business. Operator, we can now open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we would like to take any questions you may have today. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Lauren Silberman from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nLauren Silberman: Hi, thanks for the question. So with light now at the end of the tunnel, can you share how you're thinking about the growth strategy in a post-COVID era and the composition of that growth across new business, wallet share expansion, M&A? Where do you see the most meaningful incremental opportunities today relative to your expectations pre-COVID?\nDirk Locascio: Sure.\nPietro Satriano: So in many ways -- sorry, Dirk. In many ways, in terms of where we anticipate the growth, as I said, it's \u2013 our strategy has served us well, and the strategy talks to both the types of customers we target and the capabilities we've developed over time, and so independent restaurants remain an important focus point for us. As we've talked about in prior calls, there's perhaps a small shift within that, a micro shift in terms of menu types, in terms of geographies, urban to suburban. But independent restaurants, we believe, have \u2013 will continue to thrive in the post-pandemic era. We have, as we've talked about, increased our emphasis on some of the larger customers compared to the past. This was motivated by the opportunity we saw and they were looking for in terms of being served by more established customers, as well as an attractive margin profile associated with these customers. And then in terms of healthcare and hospitality, we expect those two customer types to recover, healthcare probably being closer in and hospitality probably taking a little bit longer to recover compared to the other segments.\nQ \u2013 Lauren Silberman: Are there any incremental growth opportunities do you see today relative to what you were forecasting or expecting kind of pre-COVID?\nA \u2013 Pietro Satriano: So the large customer space, as I think I've said has proven to be kind of fertile ground, probably more than we thought pre-COVID and we are taking advantage of that opportunity. That's the profitable business coming in. We've talked historically about our foray into retail, the foodservice side of retail, which we've got a couple of pilots going on across the country, which look promising. And then the third is cash and carry, we've always talked about cash and carry as an important channel for growth. It's a higher-margin profile than the core business. It's growing more quickly. It helps grow share wallet. Obviously, with the acquisition of Smart Foodservice, that presents an opportunity to accelerate that growth. And what we've seen from that channel is some exposure to the consumer side of things that has helped keep comps relatively positive relative to the core business. And I think some of that consumer business will stick, but that is kind of icing on the cake. That's not the main reason for pursuing that business.\nQ \u2013 Lauren Silberman: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: We have our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nQ \u2013 John Ivankoe: Hi. Thank you. A couple of related questions, I think. First, can you talk about kind of the state of the addressable independent restaurant market? I mean, obviously, there's so many different numbers that are out there. There are obviously very different ways of even defining what an independent is. But if you can \u2013 I mean, I guess, as we're in the middle of February, just kind of give your -- best guess year-over-year of the percentage of addressable independent restaurants that you think are going to come back to business basically this spring or summer when the vaccine takes? And then secondly, can you shed some light in terms of how desperate your performance is across markets, comparing for example, the southeast to the northeast or the \u2013 or California, just in terms of what you're seeing is maybe green shoots or leading indicators in terms of how the consumer will come back and use restaurants and specifically U.S. Foods market share gains within those markets? Thanks. : Okay. And I'll tie the two questions together, because they're related. And the headline John is that, the outlook is very promising for independents. We \u2013 in January we saw \u2013 so Dirk talked about, December being a softer month than the run rate in the fourth quarter. What we're seeing so far in January, in terms of volume, in terms of customer count, in terms of basket size, we're seeing trends that are not only better than the exit rate in December, where we saw that softness, but better than the earlier part of the fourth quarter. So the recovery, kind of, continues to happen, and that's driven by some of the things you mentioned in your question. Some of the southern markets with fewer restrictions continue to operate very close to last year levels. Then we've had a couple of regions, the Midwest, California reduce restrictions over the intervening period. And in both those regions, we've seen a pretty dramatic and quick increase in sales as restrictions have reduced. So from a metric perspective, things continue to progress on the recovery front and as well as we see different geographies have jurisdictions, we're seeing them recover. And the last thing I would add is the sentiment amongst independent restaurant owners is positive. They see the potential impact of the vaccine. Good weather, despite the horrific snowfall we had in Chicago, yesterday is on the horizon. And the aid from the federal government at the end of December has also helped give a lot of independent restaurants a new lease on life.\nJohn Ivankoe: And if I can ask the question, I'll just ask it very directly. I mean, is the decline in independent restaurants, is it \u2013 do you think at the end of this, is it down high-single digits? Is it down 10% or 20%, or obviously, you can use other numbers that are even higher to quote some certain industry sources. I mean, are you kind of honing in on a number? And then just kind of comment on what kind of share you think you can take on what? It certainly is going to be a smaller number of restaurants year-over-year on the independent, but how much do you think you can perhaps outperform the overall industry?\nPietro Satriano: Yes. So to be honest, John, I don't know that we know for certain. So we expect, ultimately, in our sales, as a result of both the recovery and our continued share gains. We expect independent restaurants to account for same amount of business as it been pre-COVID. At some point, we just can't say \u2013 we don't have a crystal ball to say what quarter precisely it will be. The number \u2013 the restaurant count, I think is what you're referring to, may very well be lower for some period. I think a lot of what's published is forecast of the future. What we see in our data in terms of actuals is, as we've talked about, restaurant count is down slightly over prior year and not nearly anything like what's being reported as forecast. So we think the signs are there for a healthy recovery of independents, and we think ultimately it recovers fully to what was pre-COVID for our business anyhow.\nJohn Ivankoe: Thank you so much for the time and color.\nPietro Satriano: Yes.\nOperator: We have our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Two questions. One, just following up on the last one, but I guess, thinking about it more from your competitors on the Foodservice distribution side rather than the customer side. Just wondering if you could share some thoughts on the \u2013 your small and mid-sized competitors, especially as you talk about share gains and presumably, the opportunity you see there, whether or not you're seeing closures or opportunities there. And with that as a backdrop, any thoughts on M&A, especially as you talk about excess cash, primarily for debt paydown? I'm just trying to get your sense for the foodservice distribution side of the landscape and then, one follow-up.\nPietro Satriano: Okay. So I'll talk about the state of competitors, I'll let Dirk talk to part B of your question on, return of capital. So, there really hasn't been much of a change in the competitive landscape, since this summer. I think, if you go back, nine months, I think we all expected more shakeout from smaller and regional competitors, basically, the speed of the recovery, right? If you go back to our summer earnings call, where we showed how quickly growth was coming back. That has benefited not just us, but also some of the smaller and regional players. So, I think the shakeout that we potentially anticipated, hasn't happened, and that's just because the industry has recovered more quickly, than it has. Our share gains, we know exactly where share gains come from, when it comes to larger customers. And as I've said, they've typically come from, the regional players for a couple of reasons. One is, our standard operating model across the country, just makes it easier for those larger customers to do business. And they see an accessibility that they may not see in smaller players. When it comes to the smaller customer wins, on the street, it's hard to tell where those come from. Dirk, do you want to talk about the second part of Jeffrey's question?\nDirk Locascio: Sure. So I think, Jeff, as we've talked about before, our focus is on integrating the two acquisitions that we've done. I think, because what Pietro commented, that we haven't seen the fallouts, really what our team has been focusing on is, even though, there haven't been closures or many distressed sales going out of business, et cetera, there are still areas where our teams locally continue to hear about different operators that may be having inventory challenges or staffing challenges, et cetera. And outside of buying someone, there's still an opportunity to gain share in those markets because of our strength, our product offering, et cetera, that can open the door to those customers. And we've been focused on taking advantage of that. And I would expect us to. And so, it's really that combination of organic growth and the successful integration of our two deals are the primary focus.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Got it. And just as a follow-up, Dirk, on that exact point. I mean, it seems like in your prepared remarks. And even just now, you mentioned, I guess, the challenge that some of your peers are facing. And I'm guessing, you guys are as well, with presumably, sales weakness in the short-term. And costs elevated ahead of the recovery specific to -- I think you guys talked about inventory, and a variety of labor aspects. So, I just want to make sure that's a fair assessment that we're in some kind of unusual timeframe, where the sales aren't recovering yet, but the costs are quite high. I'm just wondering, how we should think about that, in terms of sales and EBITDA, whether it's just this quarter or the first half of the year, kind of the magnitude of the mismatch potentially. Thank you.\nDirk Locascio: Sure. And you're right. It's a different kind of unusual, than it was last year, where now, it's a matter of managing through the challenges that are still in existence. But, I think, as Lauren put it, the light at the end of the tunnel is closer. And so it's managing for that recovery. And so, as a result, likely, the next couple of quarters, become a little bit choppy as far as sales and staffing. And because we know that across our supply chain and sales teams, you can't staff up overnight. So it's one of those that we're managing diligently for the today, but also planning ahead. And so, I would expect, likely -- it's hard to know exactly, depending on what that recovery looks like. But at least for the first half of the year, you would see higher operating costs, as you hire ahead of the volume recovery. But we would expect that to be transitory. And as the volume comes back, I would expect our cost structure to be lower than it was prior when you contemplate the different actions we took.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Understood. Thank you.\nDirk Locascio: Thanks, Jeffrey.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJohn Glass: Hi. Thanks, good morning. First, just on the services that you offer the independent restaurants, you talked about ChowNow, and I think there's probably other some value-added services. Do you have stats that would suggest how independent restaurants perform relative to others, those that embrace those services versus those that don't? And I guess maybe more importantly, is this change of views, could that be a revenue stream at some point? Could you ultimately offer a services business along with the food distribution business, particularly in the independent restaurant space?\nPietro Satriano: So we've talked in the past about how those services result in typically a higher basket or higher retention -- and/or higher retention, I should say. And that was definitely the case with the ChowNow customers earlier in the year; the reopening rate was much faster, the closure rate, whether it was temporary or permanently much lower. In terms of part B of your question, I think I've used this analogy before. It's like the old razors and blade analogy. We make money on the blade by selling food every day and the increased basket size, increased retention and the fact that we sell more food is how we make money. We haven't, at this point, considered. And, obviously, costs are passed on to the operators. So we haven't considered making it not a revenue stream but a profit stream.\nJohn Glass: All right. Thank you. And just maybe a follow-up, on the seasonality of the business, how different in a normal year is January and February versus March? I would think that March is a heavier sales volume month. So, I guess, the question is how dependent really for the first quarter on March just anyway? And, obviously, given there's a lot of change though, even current trends may not really matter much to the quarter, given you expect volumes -- the seasonality of the volumes in the business?\nDirk Locascio: Sure. I'll take that. You're right, so January tends to be a lower volume month and it ramps up tends to as the quarter goes on. And that's why we were measured in our comments that January is positive to see it but it is still early on. So watching that as February, March play out will be important. But it is still positive to see the widespread improvements that we saw in January.\nJohn Glass: Thank you.\nDirk Locascio: Thanks.\nOperator: We have our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nEdward Kelly: Hi, guys. Good morning. Could you just provide a bit more color on how much better case growth trends have been in January and February versus Q4? And then Dirk, I'm also curious just around the gross margin performance, what was the impact of acquisitions this quarter, any impact of the loss of the seasonal benefit? And does that go away in Q1, so we should start to see at least some improvement, I guess, sequentially in Q1 off of that?\nPietro Satriano: Good morning, Ed. You packed a lot into that question. As we are saying, so we're not -- we haven't talked about a specific number for January, but it is meaningfully better than we were seeing in December, especially in the restaurants. And I think part of it again is not a number because it is again early on with the one period, but it is a level that is very positive and also that it's fairly widespread. Pietro talked about at different levels, so meaning those places that have more restrictions have seeing more meaningful upticks as they've reopened. And so, those are all very positive as we look ahead, assuming that they continue.  When you think -- so acquisitions, we haven't talked about the specific impacts there, but they were modestly positive from an overall EBITDA margin and gross margin as a business. And the seasonal piece is predominantly a fourth quarter impact, where we do see that increase. So it is less of an impact in the other quarters. And so it's hard to speculate on exactly what margins do depending on what mix, which has been the biggest impacts based on a recovery looks like in Q1, Q2. However, we do remain confident that as volume comes back, that mix impacts will reduce and therefore improve gross margin over time.\nEdward Kelly: Okay. And then just a follow-up related to the cadence of EBITDA performance. So I know there's cost investments that need to be made to prepare for the reopen. But as sales get better, should we still expect the cadence of EBITDA to be better over the next few months? So for instance, was January's EBITDA better than December's? And if the top line trend continues, do we expect sequentially better improvement in sort of February or March?\nA \u2013 Dirk Locascio: Edward, so a few things that I'll point out on that is that, so different months have fairly different levels of EBITDA based on sort of the volume base in those periods. So January, for example, tends to be a lower volume month than most of the other months of the year. So it's not as straightforward as just a steady cadence up.  I think the other thing that as we look through in the earlier parts of the year, it's harder to predict exactly what the operating cost impact is and volume impact is because so far, what we've seen in different geographies is that recovery isn't necessarily linear. And so depending on that, there's just -- because of some of the uncertainties and thoughts about trying to be vague as opposed to that uncertainty leads to just lack of clarity exactly what the cadence looks like, But we do expect that as volume improves, that we will see improvement in EBITDA.\nEdward Kelly: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We have our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nQ \u2013 John Heinbockel: So Pietro, let me start with how are you thinking about the investments in the sales force, right? Magnitude, generally speaking, the types of people, roles you want to invest in. And when you then think about the opportunity, particularly the existing customer opportunity and drop size, where do you think drop size ends, right? Obviously, it's going to recover with the recovery. But when you think about, I guess 12, 15 months from now post-COVID, drop size versus what it was before. Do you think it will be significantly greater? Hello?\nA \u2013 Pietro Satriano: Sorry, I am here, apologies for that. So John, in terms of the investments you were talking about \u2013 and just as a reminder, right, it's drivers, it's selectors, it's also salespeople as we talked about. In terms of order of magnitude it's \u2013 part of the way back to where we were pre the reductions we made last April. So, not all way back, but part of the way back. And again, it's because we just have much greater clarity now as to the recovery and as well, it's just \u2013 there's more involved, right, in these days and servicing a customer than there might have been a couple of years ago, just given some of the service challenges that come with COVID and volatility of demand. And in terms of the nature of the investment that will be both sellers and new business managers are \u2013 as you remember, from when we talked about this a couple of years ago, the investment in new business managers has been one that has paid off for us. We're very pleased with it, so we'll continue on that front as well. In terms of drop size, we would expect drop size to be at least as high, if not higher, than it was pre-COVID. It could come from the fact that there maybe fewer customers to serve and demand is being redistributed. But I think more importantly, our efforts to grow share of wallet, our push on produce and center of the plate that I talked about earlier, our continued improvements in our execution ability, all those kind of set us up well to grow share of wallet and have higher drop sizes over time, which obviously improve our supply chain economics.\nJohn Heinbockel: Okay. And then, I guess, as a longer-term follow-up, if you think about getting back right to pro forma 2019, right, sales and profitability. Is it fair to think because of the cost takeouts and the increase in drop size that the EBITDA gets back to that pro forma quicker? And could it be a year \u2013 could it be as much as a year quicker when you think about the cadence or is that still too hard to tell?\nPietro Satriano: Dirk?\nDirk Locascio: So John, this is Dirk. I think it's too early to tell, but I think the way you're thinking about it is definitely the right way to think about it, is we would expect it to be sooner because of the cost reduction opportunity that we took advantage of last year and improvements that that drives. I think the exact timing, depending on the recovery and what that looks like, will drive that. But we do feel, as Pietro and I both commented, that because of the actions we've taken, both from top line from growing share and the new business wins as well as on the cost side, really positions the business well to be very successful in a post-COVID world.\nJohn Heinbockel: Okay. Thank you.\nDirk Locascio: Thanks.\nOperator: We have our next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh from BTIG. Your line is open. Your line is open.\nPeter Saleh: Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask, you mentioned that you're rehiring or hiring some warehouse employees and other drivers in anticipation of the increase in demand. Can you give us a sense of how many of these employees, are coming back to the system or rehires versus new employees? Just trying to understand how efficient and how much training will be involved to get these employees up to speed. Is this something we're going to start to see more efficiencies in the second quarter or the second half of the year, or just trying to understand the efficiencies behind that.\nDirk Locascio: So, we would expect the majority of these individuals to be new hires, as opposed to bringing them back, especially in the supply chain, as we begin to increase that hiring again, because it\u2019s spread really across most of our roughly 70 distribution centers. On the sales side, similar, most of them -- so this is not a reduce and rehire the same individuals. It's also an opportunity for talent as we move ahead. So that's part of why it's important to really get ahead of this in these earlier months, because there is a bit of a ramp-up. But we are hiring, especially on the sales side, typically, individuals who are very experienced in sales. So that, combined with our internal programs, we expect them to be able to ramp up. I would think your specific question on timing, it's hard to know exactly, depending on the timing, but that productivity likely ramps up from those associates ,as you continue to progress through the year.\nPeter Saleh: Great. And just -- can you just give us a little bit of more color around the decision to rebrand the Smart Foodservice to CHEF'STORE? Any additional costs you guys expect and what are the benefits and when we should expect to see those?\nPietro Satriano: Yes. So the costs are some one-time costs in terms of re-signing. A lot of that kind of gets absorbed into the regular maintenance or refurbishment budget you would have for fleet of retail stores. In terms of the benefit, I think when we made the acquisition, we talked about not just the ability to tap into new customers, tap into your existing customers are now shopping at cash and carry. You talk about how -- what we call the one plus one equals three phenomenon, where we saw an increase in our delivery business from customers who were also shopping our CHEF'STORE as a result of, we suspect, greater share of mind and the effectiveness of our omni-channel strategy. So by rebranding, we make that link more direct in the customers' minds. We've also got, at the same time, ensuring that customers and our sellers have the appropriate incentives to equally take advantage of and market both channels, which again, is something we've learned from by experience with our six CHEF'STOREs in the south. So those benefits show up in terms of enhanced revenue for those channels. It will -- typically, when you do these things in terms of timing, we get an initial lift. And over time, that lift stays or -- we continue to see a lift, but over time the growth in that lift incrementally kind of matures over a period of time, a period of years.\nPeter Saleh: Great. Very helpful. Thank you very much.\nOperator: We have our next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania from BMO Capital. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nKelly Bania: Hi. Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about -- a little bit more about the incentive compensation changes you made, how much that impacted the quarter? What was the thought process behind that? I know it's always hard to talk about on a call, but just curious if you can help us understand the motivation and the changes that you're expecting from that?\nPietro Satriano: So these were incentive compensation changes for the broader leadership of the company. And as you can imagine, and as we headed into the second half of the year, what we did was just create an incentive for the second half of the year that rewarded the level that you would expect in terms of sales and profitability. Yeah, that's really -- I think it's that straightforward.\nKelly Bania: Okay. And just also on expenses, in terms of the $180 million cost savings that you've identified last quarter, should we just assume that's fully, kind of, being realized on a quarterly basis at this point? And just any thoughts on how you feel about the execution of that and the long-term potential of that really falling to the bottom line?\nDirk Locascio: Sure, Kelly. So yes, that's the right way to think about it. So it is in -- that is in full run rate, it would be in the Q4. As part of -- you remember a bit when we were talking about our Q3 results, why I talked about that you wouldn't expect to see really any incremental savings because what we saw in Q4, we're definitely seeing it come through as expected and -- in both Q3 and Q4. In Q4, you do have some things that offset it was some of the temporary actions that were still in place in Q3, such as furloughs as an example or adjustments to sellers pay that was resumed to normal in the fourth quarter. But that is showing up. And our expectation is really unchanged that we expect the majority of the $180 million to be truly permanent and portions that we reinvest back over time primarily being in the sales reinvestments, as Pietro talked about to continue to enable growth as well as things like continuing to enhance our leadership position in digital and in areas like that.\nKelly Bania: Thank you.\nDirk Locascio: Thanks.\nOperator: We have our next question comes from the line of Alex Slagle from Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nAlex Slagle: Thanks. Good morning. A follow-up on a previous question. If you could comment on your ability to staff back up in the warehouses and drivers to meet demand. Just if you anticipate any challenges actually being able to staff up quick enough if the pool of potential employees is maybe not as deep as it was before. And then any view on labor inflation dynamics for 2021 and if you have thoughts on that?\nPietro Satriano: So in terms of the staffing question, which, obviously, has an impact on the wage inflation question, so far, we've seen some markets, I'd say, select markets where we've experienced tightness in the market. That's been primarily drivers, not in the warehouse side. And that's one of the reasons why we are trying to get ahead of it. We're well-staffed now and we want to stay well-staffed as volume goes up, which is part of the reason we're going to it because we are seeing a little bit of tightness in some markets. It's hard to say how enduring or persistent that will be. There are so many factors. COVID is still an important factor in some communities. And so it's hard to say whether -- what the impact will be, or how permanent that impact will be and what the impact will be on wages at this point. We haven't seen it quite yet.\nAlex Slagle: Got it. And any thoughts on the freight outlook?\nA \u2013 Dirk Locascio: On the freight outlook, it continues to be a tighter freight market. And again, similar to recent quarters, you'd see a little bit more tightening in the fourth quarter. I would expect it to continue to be a tighter market through the earlier part of 2021, at least. The other thing \u2013 so even while that's happening, one of the things that we're doing is continuing to work with our vendor partners and logistics teams to really continue to find ways to optimize our network. I think also, what we'll find is as volume recovers and is less volatile than say it was in the fourth quarter. We can be more effective in the way we manage our freight as well on the way in. The last thing, I would say is that, we'll continue to watch is, if you look over time over multiple economic cycles, what you've tended to see pretty consistently is that when it gets tighter, carriers add capacity. So it's harder to know in this case, if and when, but that has been a pretty repeatable thing over time, so we'll watch that as well. But in the meantime, the combination of sort of the things we can impact within our own control are the things that we'll focus on.\nQ \u2013 Alex Slagle: Got it. Thank you.\nA \u2013 Dirk Locascio: All right. Thanks.\nOperator: We have our next question comes from the line of William Reuter from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nQ \u2013 William Reuter: Hi. I just have one. In terms of your outlook for food inflation, what are you seeing for this year, and then the timing of when that may roll through? And then how do you think that may impact your gross margins throughout the year?\nA \u2013 Dirk Locascio: Sure. One of the things that, we've seen is food inflation overall has been pretty consistent the last several quarters at that roughly 2%. And what we've seen in there is not that different than past trends where sort of the non-commodities more stable, you see the commodities, the individual commodities, so whether it's a beef or cheese can inflate or deflate over periods. And our folks so -- overall, don't see a real different environment as we look ahead. And where our team continues to focus on is, where you have that inflation and deflation happening in the commodities is really managing through that from our own execution as well as from a margin perspective. When you do see that inflation or deflation, just as a reminder, the roughly two-thirds of our business that's based on contracts, it sort of automatically passes through whatever that contract resets. It can be weekly, biweekly, monthly depending on a particular contract. And then what you find is in the noncontract business, it \u2013 we tend to be able to pass it through relatively quickly. The things that can make it a little bit longer is if you have one particular class that significantly inflates and maybe it takes, instead of a couple of weeks, it takes three or four weeks, but generally able to pass it through and not have an impact overall on our gross margins.\nQ \u2013 William Reuter: Perfect. That's all for me. Thank you.\nA \u2013 Dirk Locascio: Thank you.\nOperator: And we have our last question from the line of Fred Wightman from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nQ \u2013 Fred Wightman: Hey, guys. Good morning. Just wondering if you could dig into the trends that you're seeing outside of the restaurant industry a bit more, I think that Dirk made a comment that you were seeing that pickup outside of non-restaurants as well during January. But maybe just specifically on the education side, can you give an update on sort of the recovery outlook there and timeline, given some of the recent CDC communications regarding in-person dining?\nA \u2013 Dirk Locascio: Sure, Fred. On that one to point out, maybe focus on kind of three key with healthcare, education and hospitality. And I'll just start with healthcare, in the sense that, healthcare has been pretty steady, and as you've seen in the past in that kind of mid to upper-single digits lower. And that one, I think, as you start to see more vaccinations, just people being able to get out more, we would expect that to bounce back relatively quickly. It's been pretty stable. And as \u2013 in senior living, et cetera, people can have visitors get out, et cetera, that's to bounce back. Hospitality and education, showing signs of improvement, but they're starting from much softer places than some of these other customer types. But on those is, to your point, as schools, for example, start to reopen, you expect that to come back. We're working with some of our larger customers to really understand that demand in those couple of areas. Say, for education, the one thing I will remind is although it is -- and it's also a smaller part of our business, the profitability tends to be on the lower end. So that one impacts cases more than it probably does profit, but still staying close to that from a product demand and then also with our customers on hospitality. And that one, we would expect just based on survey data, et cetera, that you see as the leisure side, which is the bigger piece to likely snap back quicker than business over the course of the year.\nFred Wightman: Great. Thank you.\nDirk Locascio: Thanks.\nOperator: And you have no questions at this time. Pietro, you may continue.\nPietro Satriano: Thank you. So I'll just leave you with, I think, there are three takeaways from today's call. First, the recovery continues to show extremely positive signs of promise. And while there's some question as to the exact pace of the recovery, we feel increasingly confident about the prospects for our industry. Second, our scale, our strategy and the strengthening of our capabilities position us to continue to gain market share. And third, as you can see, we've clearly strengthened the future earnings power of the business. Appreciate everyone joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you next time. That concludes our call for today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you all for participating, and you may now disconnect. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dirk Locascio",
            "content": "Thank you, Pietro, and good morning. I'll begin on Slide 7. I'm going to cover a few highlights for the quarter, before we discuss our thoughts on 2021. Melissa mentioned this earlier but just as a reminder, our fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2020 results do contain an extra week, so the fourth quarter 2020 results reflect 14 weeks of activity while the full year results reflect 53 weeks. As we discussed at the ICR conference in January, case volumes slowed in the last half of Q4 as COVID cases increased and additional restrictions were put in place on in-person dining. We have seen an improvement in restaurant and overall volume trends in January, which although early on, is encouraging. We've also successfully onboarded 99% of the $800 million of new large customer wins that we discussed last quarter and Pietro mentioned. Our pipeline remains robust and we expect to continue to win new business, resulting in further share gains. Typically, in our fourth quarter, we see a meaningful seasonal gross profit margin lift based on changes to our product mix, some of which from holiday parties and events. This year, we did not see that margin lift and our gross profit rate was in line with the third quarter. Lastly, our Q4 operating expenses on a 13-week constant basis increased compared to our third quarter 2020 expenses. As a reminder, the third quarter OpEx benefited from a $17 million non-recurring real estate gain. During the fourth quarter, we also experienced higher healthcare and incentive compensation costs. On the healthcare side, we typically see an increased cost in the fourth quarter, and this year's cost increase was more than the normal seasonal increase as associates who are not able or chose not to schedule procedures earlier in the year, did so in Q4. On the incentive comp side, mid-year 2020, we developed a revised incentive plan that resulted in some additional compensation costs in the fourth quarter. Distribution costs for the quarter was in line with Q3. However, as Pietro noted, we do expect distribution costs to temporarily increase in the first half of 2021, as we continue to increase hiring in warehouse and delivery ahead of the recovery. Moving to slide eight. Sales inflation for the fourth quarter was 2%, similar to the past few quarters and remains in a very manageable range. The 53rd week contributed 5.3% to our fourth quarter net sales. Net sales for the quarter, excluding the extra week, were in line with Q3 net sales. Adjusted gross profit margin for the fourth quarter decreased approximately 110 basis points from the prior year, which is similar to the Q3 change versus prior year. Adjusted gross profit margin in Q4 did not have the typical seasonal margin improvement, as I noted earlier. Adjusted operating expense in the fourth quarter increased 90 basis points from the prior year, compared to about 50 basis point increase from prior year in Q3, when you exclude the Q3 non-recurring property gain. The 40 basis point increase in our adjusted OpEx, as a percent of sales, from Q3 to Q4, ex the property gain, was primarily the result of the healthcare and incentive comp factors I discussed. As the recovery in case volume occurs, we do expect the negative mix impact on our gross profit and the negative impact of OpEx deleverage to improve and expect the current impacts to be transitory. On slide nine, adjusted EBITDA was $174 million for the quarter, including approximately $8 million for the extra week. When you exclude the real estate gain from our third quarter results and the benefit of the extra week in the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA declined $26 million in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. This is primarily due to the OpEx items I just noted. Adjusted net income was $10 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.05 for the fourth quarter. Pietro discussed how we're positioning the business for recovery, and this remains our primary focus at the present time, and we expect our financial results to significantly improve as case volume continues to recover. I'm now on slide 10, where I'll spend a few minutes on our outlook for 2021. We remain confident that case volume will recover as COVID cases decline, restaurant restrictions are lifted and vaccine distribution expands. Since the timing of the recovery remains uncertain, we're not providing financial guidance for 2021. Regarding synergies, we did achieve the $10 million of Food Group synergies we were targeting for 2020 and remain on track for the full $65 million of synergies by the end of 2023. We're also on track to achieve the $20 million of Smart synergies by the end of 2024. Our liquidity position remains strong with over $800 million of cash on hand and over $2.7 billion of total liquidity. Our revolving credit line remains largely undrawn. And as the recovery takes shape, we expect to use the excess cash on our balance sheet to reduce outstanding debt. The cash flow of our business remained strong, and in 2021, we'll be focused on investing in our business and reducing debt. Delevering is a priority in the coming years. In 2020, we reduced our capital spend to those items essential to the continued operation of the business. At this time, we are planning to resume a more normal level of capital spend, focusing on building and expansion projects that we slowed or paused last year in addition to continuing to invest in our technology platform. The resumption of these projects will help drive growth as the recovery takes shape. Moving to slide 11. The actions we took during 2020 have strengthened the future earnings power across our business. We are continuing to focus on profitably winning market share with new business wins across small and large customers. As our case volume with small and large customers recover, we expect our gross profit margin will improve as well. This is largely due to the expected improvements in our customer mix. When you combine this with a $180 million of fixed cost reductions, most of which we expect to be permanent, we expect the business to likely operate a higher EBITDA margin post COVID. Finally, our business continues to generate strong cash flow that will be used for future debt reduction and to further improve the earnings power of the business. We generated over $400 million of operating cash flow even in a pandemic impacted fiscal 2020, demonstrating the resiliency of our business. Operator, we can now open the call for questions. Sure. Sure. So I think, Jeff, as we've talked about before, our focus is on integrating the two acquisitions that we've done. I think, because what Pietro commented, that we haven't seen the fallouts, really what our team has been focusing on is, even though, there haven't been closures or many distressed sales going out of business, et cetera, there are still areas where our teams locally continue to hear about different operators that may be having inventory challenges or staffing challenges, et cetera. And outside of buying someone, there's still an opportunity to gain share in those markets because of our strength, our product offering, et cetera, that can open the door to those customers. And we've been focused on taking advantage of that. And I would expect us to. And so, it's really that combination of organic growth and the successful integration of our two deals are the primary focus. Sure. And you're right. It's a different kind of unusual, than it was last year, where now, it's a matter of managing through the challenges that are still in existence. But, I think, as Lauren put it, the light at the end of the tunnel is closer. And so it's managing for that recovery. And so, as a result, likely, the next couple of quarters, become a little bit choppy as far as sales and staffing. And because we know that across our supply chain and sales teams, you can't staff up overnight. So it's one of those that we're managing diligently for the today, but also planning ahead. And so, I would expect, likely -- it's hard to know exactly, depending on what that recovery looks like. But at least for the first half of the year, you would see higher operating costs, as you hire ahead of the volume recovery. But we would expect that to be transitory. And as the volume comes back, I would expect our cost structure to be lower than it was prior when you contemplate the different actions we took. Thanks, Jeffrey. Sure. I'll take that. You're right, so January tends to be a lower volume month and it ramps up tends to as the quarter goes on. And that's why we were measured in our comments that January is positive to see it but it is still early on. So watching that as February, March play out will be important. But it is still positive to see the widespread improvements that we saw in January. Thanks. So John, this is Dirk. I think it's too early to tell, but I think the way you're thinking about it is definitely the right way to think about it, is we would expect it to be sooner because of the cost reduction opportunity that we took advantage of last year and improvements that that drives. I think the exact timing, depending on the recovery and what that looks like, will drive that. But we do feel, as Pietro and I both commented, that because of the actions we've taken, both from top line from growing share and the new business wins as well as on the cost side, really positions the business well to be very successful in a post-COVID world. Thanks. So, we would expect the majority of these individuals to be new hires, as opposed to bringing them back, especially in the supply chain, as we begin to increase that hiring again, because it's spread really across most of our roughly 70 distribution centers. On the sales side, similar, most of them -- so this is not a reduce and rehire the same individuals. It's also an opportunity for talent as we move ahead. So that's part of why it's important to really get ahead of this in these earlier months, because there is a bit of a ramp-up. But we are hiring, especially on the sales side, typically, individuals who are very experienced in sales. So that, combined with our internal programs, we expect them to be able to ramp up. I would think your specific question on timing, it's hard to know exactly, depending on the timing, but that productivity likely ramps up from those associates ,as you continue to progress through the year. Sure, Kelly. So yes, that's the right way to think about it. So it is in -- that is in full run rate, it would be in the Q4. As part of -- you remember a bit when we were talking about our Q3 results, why I talked about that you wouldn't expect to see really any incremental savings because what we saw in Q4, we're definitely seeing it come through as expected and -- in both Q3 and Q4. In Q4, you do have some things that offset it was some of the temporary actions that were still in place in Q3, such as furloughs as an example or adjustments to sellers pay that was resumed to normal in the fourth quarter. But that is showing up. And our expectation is really unchanged that we expect the majority of the $180 million to be truly permanent and portions that we reinvest back over time primarily being in the sales reinvestments, as Pietro talked about to continue to enable growth as well as things like continuing to enhance our leadership position in digital and in areas like that. Thanks. Thanks."

            "name": "Pietro Satriano",
            "content": "Thanks, Melissa. Good morning, everyone. I hope everyone's year is off to a good start. I'd like to start by thanking our 26,000 associates, whose commitment to serving and helping our customers during what has been almost an entire year of the pandemic has truly been second to none. The results we are covering today are only possible because of their hard work. I'm going to begin today's remarks on slide 2 with a brief summary of the three main topics we are going to cover. First, even though we are very pleased with how well our Great Food. Made Easy strategy has served us over the years, we continue to develop and enhance our capabilities so that our strategy can have an even greater success over the coming years. Second, we have taken several steps to position the business for a recovery, and we are confident that these actions will allow us to continue to gain market share as the recovery takes shape. And third, the changes we have made to our cost structure and the new business we have won over the last eight months has strengthened the future earnings power of the business. I will cover the first two topics and Dirk will cover the last one.  Moving -- 3. Our Great Food, Made Easy strategy has proven to be enduring, but this does not mean we are standing still. We are continuing to evolve our capabilities to further improve the customer experience and take advantage of future growth opportunities.  Let's start with innovative products, which is at the heart of Great Food. During COVID, there was a shift in the products that customers rely on the most, products that travel well and packaging that builds trust with consumers. We adopted our Scoop platform to quickly jump on these trends and results from our last two Scoop launches have been in line with prior pre-COVID launches.  Even with the pandemic, consumer interest for more sustainable, healthier choices continues to grow. That's why the theme of our spring Scoop, which launches in two weeks is Hungry for Better. The lineup features: new products under Serve Good, our growing lineup of sustainably sourced products; a range of plant-based meat alternatives for burgers and tacos; and a range of functional food with ingredients that introduce a healthy twist to some of those favorites.  Continuing with the theme of product innovation, as we have mentioned in the past, one of the big benefits of the acquisition of Food Group is the ability to leverage some unique capabilities in Center-of-the-plate and Produce, two categories that drive a higher basket and greater stickiness.  Having made good progress on the integration front, we are now beginning to introduce these Food Group capabilities into legacy U.S. Foods market. And while it will take some time to roll these capabilities out across the country, we are excited about how these capabilities will accelerate the opportunity to grow share of wallet in those two categories.  Moving to technology, which is at the heart of making things easy for customers. The consumer shift to more digital and more off-premise dining has made our technology and e-commerce offerings even more important than they were before. For example, 68% of consumers say they are more likely to purchase takeout than they were pre-COVID.  As a result, we are seeing a corresponding increase in demand from operators for applications that help them ride the growth in off-premise dining. Our partnership with ChowNow is a good example. We also continue to invest in our technology platform, having recently improved our product search capabilities and our analytics platform to allow us to drive more targeted pricing and product recommendation to customers and to our sellers.  The last set of capabilities on the right that we are evolving is our operating model. One of the key learnings from COVID has been how we can operate more effectively as a company. We've learned to use technology to leverage individual process experts to more quickly adopt its practices across the country. As an example, we recently rolled out a new warehouse pick process in four weeks, something that might have taken us four months in the past.  As a result of these learnings, we are refining our operating model by shifting some responsibilities and resources from our region teams to our centers of excellence. These centers of excellence have responsibility for identifying and deploying best practices across the country and this shift in resources will result in a more consistent execution.  In conjunction with this shift, we have reduced the number of regions from six to four in the second quarter. This does not change the cost savings that we announced in August, but is simply a logical evolution of our operating model informed by the experiences over the last 12 months and they end up providing more consistent execution. Also in conjunction with this shift, we are consolidating merchandising and local sales under Andrew Iacobucci. Andrew has been overseeing these two functions on an interim basis for the last 12 months, and so now he becomes our Chief Commercial Officer. Also critical to advancing our strategy has been the capabilities we now have access to as a result of the acquisitions of Food Group and Smart Foodservice. So, let's move to Page 4 for an update on the business performance and integration, starting with Food Group. Integration and synergy capture are on track. So far, we have completed two warehouse system conversions, and we expect to have the third completed by early next quarter. The conversions to date have gone very well, and we expect to have the remainder completed in the second half of this year, in line with our original plan, despite some of the early delays from COVID. We are also on track to achieve our previously announced $65 million in annualized synergies and the business is performing in line with expectations. The Smart Foodservice business continues to outperform our delivery business, and we continue to be excited about the future growth opportunities in the cash and carry space. You will recall, part of the strategic rationale for the acquisition of Smart Foodservice, is the incremental sale, it drives to our delivery business. To help capitalize on this opportunity, we will rebrand all Smart Foodservice locations to the US Foods CHEF'STORE brand in the first quarter. This rebranding will also facilitate our entry into new geographic markets, where US Foods has an established presence. For 2021, we plan to open three to four stores, primarily in existing Smart Foodservice markets. But we do expect the pace of store openings to pick up in future years, as we expand the footprint into new geographies. I'm now on Slide 5, where I would like to close with a quick overview of how we are positioning our business to gain market share as our industry recovers. In prior calls, we talked about the $800 million of annualized new customer wins with larger customers in 2020. We feel good about the 2021 pipeline and our ability to continue to profitably gain market share with larger national customers. To prepare for the expected increase in case volume that we foresee in the coming quarters, we have started to hire warehouse, transportation and sales associates in anticipation of the recovery. We are also investing in inventory to support our customers while partnering with several of our larger customers to understand the demand curve they are seeing in their business. And lastly, the evolution of our capabilities and our operating model, that I discussed earlier position us to emerge from COVID as a stronger and more effective business. I would now like to turn the call over to Dirk, for a discussion of our fourth quarter financial results, and how we have strengthened the future earnings power of our business. So in many ways -- sorry, Dirk. In many ways, in terms of where we anticipate the growth, as I said, it's \u2013 our strategy has served us well, and the strategy talks to both the types of customers we target and the capabilities we've developed over time, and so independent restaurants remain an important focus point for us. As we've talked about in prior calls, there's perhaps a small shift within that, a micro shift in terms of menu types, in terms of geographies, urban to suburban. But independent restaurants, we believe, have \u2013 will continue to thrive in the post-pandemic era. We have, as we've talked about, increased our emphasis on some of the larger customers compared to the past. This was motivated by the opportunity we saw and they were looking for in terms of being served by more established customers, as well as an attractive margin profile associated with these customers. And then in terms of healthcare and hospitality, we expect those two customer types to recover, healthcare probably being closer in and hospitality probably taking a little bit longer to recover compared to the other segments.\nQ \u2013 Lauren Silberman: Are there any incremental growth opportunities do you see today relative to what you were forecasting or expecting kind of pre-COVID?\nA \u2013 Pietro Satriano: So the large customer space, as I think I've said has proven to be kind of fertile ground, probably more than we thought pre-COVID and we are taking advantage of that opportunity. That's the profitable business coming in. We've talked historically about our foray into retail, the foodservice side of retail, which we've got a couple of pilots going on across the country, which look promising. And then the third is cash and carry, we've always talked about cash and carry as an important channel for growth. It's a higher-margin profile than the core business. It's growing more quickly. It helps grow share wallet. Obviously, with the acquisition of Smart Foodservice, that presents an opportunity to accelerate that growth. And what we've seen from that channel is some exposure to the consumer side of things that has helped keep comps relatively positive relative to the core business. And I think some of that consumer business will stick, but that is kind of icing on the cake. That's not the main reason for pursuing that business.\nQ \u2013 Lauren Silberman: Great. Thanks so much. Yes. So to be honest, John, I don't know that we know for certain. So we expect, ultimately, in our sales, as a result of both the recovery and our continued share gains. We expect independent restaurants to account for same amount of business as it been pre-COVID. At some point, we just can't say \u2013 we don't have a crystal ball to say what quarter precisely it will be. The number \u2013 the restaurant count, I think is what you're referring to, may very well be lower for some period. I think a lot of what's published is forecast of the future. What we see in our data in terms of actuals is, as we've talked about, restaurant count is down slightly over prior year and not nearly anything like what's being reported as forecast. So we think the signs are there for a healthy recovery of independents, and we think ultimately it recovers fully to what was pre-COVID for our business anyhow. Yes. Okay. So I'll talk about the state of competitors, I'll let Dirk talk to part B of your question on, return of capital. So, there really hasn't been much of a change in the competitive landscape, since this summer. I think, if you go back, nine months, I think we all expected more shakeout from smaller and regional competitors, basically, the speed of the recovery, right? If you go back to our summer earnings call, where we showed how quickly growth was coming back. That has benefited not just us, but also some of the smaller and regional players. So, I think the shakeout that we potentially anticipated, hasn't happened, and that's just because the industry has recovered more quickly, than it has. Our share gains, we know exactly where share gains come from, when it comes to larger customers. And as I've said, they've typically come from, the regional players for a couple of reasons. One is, our standard operating model across the country, just makes it easier for those larger customers to do business. And they see an accessibility that they may not see in smaller players. When it comes to the smaller customer wins, on the street, it's hard to tell where those come from. Dirk, do you want to talk about the second part of Jeffrey's question? So we've talked in the past about how those services result in typically a higher basket or higher retention -- and/or higher retention, I should say. And that was definitely the case with the ChowNow customers earlier in the year; the reopening rate was much faster, the closure rate, whether it was temporary or permanently much lower. In terms of part B of your question, I think I've used this analogy before. It's like the old razors and blade analogy. We make money on the blade by selling food every day and the increased basket size, increased retention and the fact that we sell more food is how we make money. We haven't, at this point, considered. And, obviously, costs are passed on to the operators. So we haven't considered making it not a revenue stream but a profit stream. Good morning, Ed. You packed a lot into that question. As we are saying, so we're not -- we haven't talked about a specific number for January, but it is meaningfully better than we were seeing in December, especially in the restaurants. And I think part of it again is not a number because it is again early on with the one period, but it is a level that is very positive and also that it's fairly widespread. Pietro talked about at different levels, so meaning those places that have more restrictions have seeing more meaningful upticks as they've reopened. And so, those are all very positive as we look ahead, assuming that they continue.  When you think -- so acquisitions, we haven't talked about the specific impacts there, but they were modestly positive from an overall EBITDA margin and gross margin as a business. And the seasonal piece is predominantly a fourth quarter impact, where we do see that increase. So it is less of an impact in the other quarters. And so it's hard to speculate on exactly what margins do depending on what mix, which has been the biggest impacts based on a recovery looks like in Q1, Q2. However, we do remain confident that as volume comes back, that mix impacts will reduce and therefore improve gross margin over time. Dirk? Yes. So the costs are some one-time costs in terms of re-signing. A lot of that kind of gets absorbed into the regular maintenance or refurbishment budget you would have for fleet of retail stores. In terms of the benefit, I think when we made the acquisition, we talked about not just the ability to tap into new customers, tap into your existing customers are now shopping at cash and carry. You talk about how -- what we call the one plus one equals three phenomenon, where we saw an increase in our delivery business from customers who were also shopping our CHEF'STORE as a result of, we suspect, greater share of mind and the effectiveness of our omni-channel strategy. So by rebranding, we make that link more direct in the customers' minds. We've also got, at the same time, ensuring that customers and our sellers have the appropriate incentives to equally take advantage of and market both channels, which again, is something we've learned from by experience with our six CHEF'STOREs in the south. So those benefits show up in terms of enhanced revenue for those channels. It will -- typically, when you do these things in terms of timing, we get an initial lift. And over time, that lift stays or -- we continue to see a lift, but over time the growth in that lift incrementally kind of matures over a period of time, a period of years. So these were incentive compensation changes for the broader leadership of the company. And as you can imagine, and as we headed into the second half of the year, what we did was just create an incentive for the second half of the year that rewarded the level that you would expect in terms of sales and profitability. Yeah, that's really -- I think it's that straightforward. So in terms of the staffing question, which, obviously, has an impact on the wage inflation question, so far, we've seen some markets, I'd say, select markets where we've experienced tightness in the market. That's been primarily drivers, not in the warehouse side. And that's one of the reasons why we are trying to get ahead of it. We're well-staffed now and we want to stay well-staffed as volume goes up, which is part of the reason we're going to it because we are seeing a little bit of tightness in some markets. It's hard to say how enduring or persistent that will be. There are so many factors. COVID is still an important factor in some communities. And so it's hard to say whether -- what the impact will be, or how permanent that impact will be and what the impact will be on wages at this point. We haven't seen it quite yet. Thank you. So I'll just leave you with, I think, there are three takeaways from today's call. First, the recovery continues to show extremely positive signs of promise. And while there's some question as to the exact pace of the recovery, we feel increasingly confident about the prospects for our industry. Second, our scale, our strategy and the strengthening of our capabilities position us to continue to gain market share. And third, as you can see, we've clearly strengthened the future earnings power of the business. Appreciate everyone joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you next time. That concludes our call for today."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ms. Melissa Napier. Thank you. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nMelissa Napier: Thanks Cara. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. Joining me on today's call are Pietro Satriano, our CEO; and Dirk Locascio, our CFO. Pietro and Dirk will provide an overview of our results for the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2020, as well as provide some details on volume trends that we saw during the month of October. We'll take your questions after our prepared remarks conclude. Please provide your name, your firm and limit yourself to one question. During today's call and unless otherwise stated, we're comparing our third quarter results to the same period in fiscal 2019. Our earnings release issued earlier this morning, and today's presentation slides can be accessed on the Investor Relations page of our website. References to organic financial results during today's call exclude contributions from Smart Foodservice, which we acquired in April of 2020 and also exclude contributions from the Food Group for the time period prior to the anniversary date of the closing of the acquisition. In addition to historical information, certain statements made during today's call are considered forward-looking statements. Please review the risk factors in our 2019 Form 10-K and our last quarter's 10-Q filed with the SEC for these potential factors, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in those statements. Lastly, during today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. All reconciliations to the most comparable financial measures are included in the schedules on our earnings press release as well as in the appendices to the presentation slides posted on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Pietro.\nPietro Satriano: Thank you, Melissa. And good morning, everyone. Before we get started, I would like to thank all our associates for their dedication and commitment that they have displayed in helping our customers navigate this challenging environment. Their efforts have truly been second to none.  I'm going to begin on Slide 2 with an executive summary of what we'll cover today. First, as evidenced by the continued appetite of consumers to eat out and take out, as well as the continued ingenuity of restaurants across the country, we remain confident that our industry will return to pre-COVID levels over time. Second, the third quarter saw a marked improvement in our business. Case volumes have steadily improved, and we\u2019re profitably gaining market share. Third, Recent acquisitions of Food Group and Smart Foodservice have performed in line with expectations and the integration of Food Group is on track. And finally, the steady improvement in our case volume combined with our cost reduction actions led to adjusted EBITDA that was a marked improvement over the second quarter. Dirk will cover this fourth point in his review of the financial results and I will cover the first three.  Starting with our perspective on the industry. Moving to Slide 4, the chart on the left compares consumer visits at food away from home establishments like restaurants to visits at food-at-home establishments like grocery stores. As you can see, pre-COVID food away from home visits were roughly 50% of total consumer visits. After stepping down in late March and April, consumer visits at food away from home establishment has consistently increased and are trending back towards the 50% level that the industry experienced pre-COVID. This recovery illustrates the desire of the consumer to purchase from food away from home establishment, a habit that has been shaped over decades, and helps we affirm our belief that our industry will ultimately recover to pre-COVID level.  One of the drivers of this recovery has been off-premise dining, which continues to grow in importance. As we said on our last call, for full-service restaurants, 55% of traffic in June was off-premise compared to 19% pre-COVID. A more recent survey state that 68% of consumers in this country are a takeout at least once a month post-COVID compared to 45% pre-COVID, an increase of 51%. The continued growth in off-premise dining also gives us the confidence that restaurants in the colder climates will be able to navigate the winter months.  Over the past several months we have seen restaurants embrace those kitchens, also known as virtual kitchens, a way by which operators can use their kitchen space to create new brands focused solely on takeout and delivery. In addition, some operators are experimenting with tents, igloos and heaters as a way to prolong outdoor dining, and others are promoting air purification mechanisms such as UV lighting as a way to build consumer trust for indoor dining. The ingenuity of restaurant operators has checked the permanent closure rate at a low level. And we've even begun to hear about some well run and well capitalized operators looking for opportunities to open new restaurants as the external environment improves. Let's now go to Slide 5, and take a look at our own volume performance across different customer types. Throughout the third quarter and into the early part of the fourth quarter, we have seen a steady improvement in case volume across most of our customer types. The green line on the chart shows total restaurant case volumes, including both independent and chain restaurants. The uptick you see in the month of August and September is both a result of an improvement in the industry as well as US Foods gaining share. Organic restaurant case volume for the week ending October 24th was down just under 10% compared to prior year, which was remarkable given that we were down almost 60% at the beginning of the pandemic.  When we compare independents to chain over the last few weeks, organic independent case volume has been down approximately 11% to 12% year-on-year, while organic chain case volume has been down approximately 7% to 8% year-on-year.  Moving to other customer types, our case volume with both healthcare and hospitality has also improved. Healthcare designated by the blue line has picked up as hospitals have started allowing visitors to return in a limited fashion. Hospitality designated by the yellow line has also picked up, as hotel occupancy rates have improved, especially in some geographies and formats, as leisure travelers have substituted one kind of travel for another. Last quarter, I commented on the $500 million of new business we had won in the first half of this year. This business is now fully on-boarded, and I'm happy to report that on an annual run rate basis, we are on pace to on-board a total of over $800 million of new business by the end of this calendar year. Several of the new wins since we last spoke, are in the healthcare arena, demonstrating the strength of our new business pipeline across the multiple different customer types. The pipeline remains strong. And as we look ahead to next year, we expect to continue to gain market share. And as we have previously discussed, the new business win across these multiple customer types, had good contribution margins, helping us grow overall profitability. Let's move to Slide 6 and a discussion of the factors that have led to these market share gains. As we see it, US Foods has 4 distinct advantages over many competitors. The first is our scale and our scope. Our national footprint and consistent approach to servicing multi-geography customers are particular appeal to large customers who are looking for a stable distribution partner like US Foods.  Second is our digital leadership. Our e-commerce offering has been particularly important during these times as customers are able to shop our extensive product offering and place orders online.  Third, is our suite of value-added services or CHECK Business Tools. One of our more popular value-added services has been ChowNow, a platform that allows customers to do takeout and delivery with much more favorable economics than competing services. Since the pandemic began, the number of customers using ChowNow has increased 50%. Now not only does this drive more loyalty to US Foods, but we have seen that customers who use ChowNow are buying more, approximately 80% more than customers are not using that platform, which also confirms how much off-premise dining has grown in importance. A new addition to our portfolio of value-added services is our Ghost Kitchen playbook, supported by proprietary analytics, and this has helped customers mitigate the impact of COVID by extending their off-premise reach, both geographically and into new menu concepts that are particularly suited for delivery. And the fourth advantage is our growing portfolio of innovative products. In September, we launched our Fall Scoop, focused on off-premise dining. The launch featured new items such as Tamper-Evident containers, cleaning and sanitizing products and individually packaged ingredients that allow restaurants to create home meal kits. Response to this food launch was just terrific, and customer penetration was comparable to rates that we used to see pre-COVID. Last week, we launched our Holiday Scoop, which features more new items, many in keeping with current customer needs, including the only EPA-registered 2-in-1 sanitizer that is effective against the virus that causes COVID-19, thereby helping operators keep their environment safe and building trust with diners. This Holiday Scoop also features items for off-premise dining with solutions that are perfect for family meals, including several sustainable items to add to an already strong line of products that serve the platform. These differentiated products and solutions are a great example of how we continue to be the leading and most relevant distributor to operators. Lastly, on Page 7, I want to provide an update on our 2 recent acquisitions. As we discussed last quarter, the Food Group's national chain business continues to perform well, benefiting from some of the recent favorable QSR trends we have seen play out in the industry. On the integration front, systems conversion required to enable some of the expected synergies are also progressing well. In August, we completed the first systems conversion in the Seattle market, and that went without a hitch. Over this past weekend, we completed our second systems conversion and early signs point to another successful conversion. As a result, we have made up most of the temporary pause due to COVID, and we are on pace to achieve the previously communicated $65 million of annual run rate synergies on the original time line, of which we expect to realize $10 million of those synergies this year in 2020. Moving to Smart Foodservice, case volumes continue to outperform our delivered business, with comps down in the low to mid-single-digits over prior year. The cash and carry business typically performs well in economic downturns as customers look to the value offering it provides. The Smart Foodservice stores are also open to the public, and this has allowed us to capture some of the shift to food-at-home over the last several months without changing our business model. Adjusted EBITDA remains on pace with our expectations, and we expect to achieve the synergy target that we have previously discussed. Lastly, I'm pleased to announce the opening of 2 new Smart Foodservice stores in the fourth quarter of this year. This is just the beginning of our store expansion plan, with the ultimate goal to double the existing store count. I'll now turn it over to Dirk for a discussion of our third quarter financial results.\nDirk Locascio: Thank you, Pietro. I'd like to begin on Slide 9, where I'll cover the highlights for the quarter before taking a deeper dive into our financial results. Our third quarter results showed significant improvement from the prior quarter and highlight the work we've done to position the business for success post-COVID. As Pietro mentioned, we saw consistent improvement in case volume as the quarter progressed. This improvement is attributable to our ability to gain market share as well as improvement in the underlying fundamentals of the industry. Our adjusted gross profit margin improved 70 basis points from the second quarter and was stable throughout the quarter. We expect our adjusted gross profit margin will continue to improve as our case volume recovers and our customer product mix returns to pre-COVID levels. On the cost side, we enacted a series of permanent cost reductions in the second and third quarters that will position the business for higher EBITDA margins post-COVID. On an annualized basis, we eliminated approximately $180 million of fixed costs from the business, and we'll continue to manage our variable costs in line with case volumes. These fixed cost reductions are mostly in the corporate and back office areas of the business, and I'm pleased to report that we continue to see strong collection efforts on our outstanding accounts receivable. And as a result, we\u2019ve further reduced the uncollectible account receivable reserve by $30 million again this quarter. Our incremental COVID-related uncollectible account reserve now sits at $65 million and we have not seen a degradation in the quality of our receivables since COVID began. Moving to Slide 10. Our third quarter financial results improved significantly from the trough we experienced in the second quarter. Net sales compared to the prior year were down 10.5% for the quarter, driven by a combination of lower case volume and negative customer mix, which is a significant improvement from the 29% year-over-year net sales decline we saw in the second quarter. Inflation for the quarter was 220 basis points, primarily driven by inflation in the beef and cheese categories. Our adjusted gross profit margin was down 100 basis points compared to the prior year but improved 70 basis points from the second quarter. Changes in our customer and product mix and lower inbound logistics income were the drivers of the year-over-year decline. Lower inbound case volume resulted in us needing to reoptimize our freight network to compensate for the loss of scale that we benefit from at higher inbound case volume levels. This work is in process, and we expect our inbound logistics income to improve as the reoptimization works take effect and inbound case volumes improve. As I previously mentioned, we expect our adjusted gross margin to increase as our case volume recovers and customer product mix returns to more normal pre-COVID levels. Gross margin at the customer level remains similar to pre-COVID rates, and we continue to see a rational competitive environment. Adjusted operating expense increased 20 basis points compared to the prior year. However, this was a 100 basis point improvement compared to the second quarter. We experienced a 20 basis point year-over-year increase despite experiencing fixed cost deleverage from lower case volume. During the quarter, we successfully managed our variable cost to be in line with case volume while enacting the permanent cost reductions I discussed earlier. In the third quarter, there were a couple of items that had a net benefit to adjusted operating expense of approximately 20 basis points, the largest of which was a $17 million gain on the piece of excess land in Southern California. We don't expect these items to repeat in the upcoming quarters. Even with the benefits factored in, we're extremely pleased with the work we've done on the cost side. Our cost structure remains flexible, allowing us to quickly adapt to changes in our case volume. On Slide 11, I thought it would be helpful to spend a few minutes discussing our operating leverage and adjusted EBITDA margin. Prior to COVID, our adjusted EBITDA margin, which is the difference between adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating expense, is running in the mid-4% range and increasing annually. At the trough in the second quarter, this delta shrunk to 190 basis points, but has quickly expanded again to 3.6% in the third quarter. This is a direct result of the improvement in our customer mix and the cost actions we've taken. And if you notice, our adjusted operating expense as a percent of sales in the quarter is largely in line with where it was pre-COVID. This is despite the fixed cost deleverage from lower case volume. As our case volume improves, we expect the organization to operate at lower adjusted operating expense level than we did pre-COVID. And on the adjusted gross profit margin side of the equation, the recovery in our independent restaurant case volume is helping us to drive improvements. And as I just mentioned, we continue to work to reoptimize our inbound freight network. This work and an increase in our independent case volume will help adjusted gross profit recover to be in line with pre-COVID levels. The net effect, we believe, will be an expansion of our adjusted EBITDA margin post-COVID. Moving to Slide 12. Our adjusted EBITDA results for the third quarter improved meaningfully from the second quarter in both dollars and EBITDA margin. Adjusted EBITDA was $209 million for the quarter, which means based on this run rate, the business is generating approximately $800 million of adjusted EBITDA on an annualized basis despite case volume being down in the high teens. This is another indication of the flexible cost structure and operating model that exists within the business. In the third quarter, we returned to positive earnings, generating $32 million of adjusted net income and $0.15 of adjusted diluted earnings per share. Since we had a GAAP net loss for the quarter, the additional preferred equity shares are not included in the share count for the third quarter. When we do return to positive GAAP net income, those shares will be factored in to the earnings per share calculations. If these were included in the Q3 earnings calculation, our adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter would have been $0.13. Turning to Slide 13. The business remains in a strong liquidity and cash flow position. We ended the third quarter with $1 billion of cash on hand and $2.7 billion of total liquidity. In the second quarter, we had a large working capital benefit, which we expected to reverse in the third quarter. As of the end of the third quarter, this reversal is largely complete. During the quarter, we reinvested in inventory to support current case volume levels and return vendors to a normal payment schedule. Going forward, we'll manage working capital in line with the recovery in case volume. In the current case volume levels, the business is cash flow positive, and we expect to return to the strong cash flow levels we experienced pre-COVID as case volume continues to recover. We remain focused on reducing our net debt balance and lowering our net debt leverage ratio, which stands at 5.9 times at the end of the third quarter. Over time, we expect to reduce our leverage ratio through both an improvement in EBITDA dollars and a reduction in our outstanding debt, as we've consistently demonstrated the ability to do in the past. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the progress we've made during the third quarter and the benefits we expect the business to experience from a continued recovery in case volume. With that, operator, we can now open the call up for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Partners.\nJohn Heinbockel: Pietro, two things I wanted to dig into. The $180 million, how much of that did you see in the third quarter? And is that -- now that is a run rate beginning in the fourth quarter. And how did you go about sort of safeguarding? It sounds like it didn't impact the field at all safeguarding that would not impact your top-line.\nPietro Satriano : You talk about the $180 million in cost reductions, John?\nJohn Heinbockel : Yes.\nPietro Satriano : Yes. So the -- primarily -- and Dirk can add more on this, the focus has been primarily on the back office. We did make some small reductions in the sales force as you know, John, back in April, aligning the size of sales force with the expected customer count over the long-term. And so we -- and as a result, as you can see by the market share gains and by the success we've had in terms of bringing on large customers, the reductions we've made have not impacted us. We've learned to operate in a kind of more lean, more agile fashion as a result of COVID. And as Dirk said, we think that over the long -- mid to long-term, that also presents -- will result in a higher EBITDA margin. Dirk, anything you want to add?\nDirk Locascio : I would just add, Pietro is just, again, a reminder on the sales reduction that Pietro mentioned were the ones that happened earlier in the year and the more recent reductions were mostly back office types of roles. And John, to your point, we do expect to be at a full run rate here in the fourth quarter.\nJohn Heinbockel : All right. And then maybe as a follow-up, right, the idea -- it makes sense, right, that the business would be more profitable on a margin rate basis given the $180 million plus synergy. When you think about returning to pro forma, right, sales and profitability, how quickly do you think -- it would seem like profit would come back maybe faster than top-line. Is that fair? And would you think -- could it be a year sooner that profitability, again, given the $180 million on the synergy, the profitability would come back before you got to a pro forma revenue number or no?\nDirk Locascio : So with that, John, I think it is a reasonable assumption that it would come back quicker. It's hard to predict exactly how much quicker. But to your point, as volume recovers, that does help profitability. But given the actions we've taken on cost that go into effect essentially now, it is reasonable to expect the profitability would come back quicker.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital.\nKelly Bania : Just a couple of questions. First on the Smart Foodservice and SGA. Wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about how those are performing and the contributions there? It sounds like Smart Food performing quite strong. And then just another question on the efficiency as you're bringing on some costs back as trends improve and how you see that trend continuing?\nDirk Locascio : I can start and then Pietro can add as appropriate. I think some -- as Pietro indicated earlier, for the acquisitions, they're performing well relative to the environment we're in. To your point, Smart holding up quite well as a business. So starting with Food Group, their sales were slightly better than US Foods, organic for the quarter, really driven by a higher mix of chain business. And the overall EBITDA decline was a little bit better than the organic business, in large part because of some of the synergy benefits that have begun to flow through. Also, just from a Food Group, as Pietro noted, with the second successful system conversion, we continue to make good progress on the integration of that business and are pleased at the pace now in which we have reaccelerated to move ahead with that. From a Smart Foodservice, you're exactly right. So that business has held up quite well for some of the reasons Pietro talked about. The case volumes being really down in the low to mid-single-digit range, and EBITDA not much off from prior year levels. So we continue to be excited by what that presents from an existing footprint as well as expansion opportunities from this highly profitable business. So we're pleased today with both of them and continuing to work to strengthen our footprint and our penetration in both of them and continue to build on that.\nPietro Satriano : The only minor point I would add, Kelly, is that the performance we've seen with Smart Foodservice in terms of the low to mid-single-digit comps -- negative comps is very much in line with our 6 CHEF'STORE in a different part of the country. So it just goes to reaffirm the resilience of this channel and the appeal of this channel, especially in these kind of more challenging economic times.\nKelly Bania : Perfect. And just the efficiency, just as you've kind of brought back some costs as sales have improved, and just if you can just tie that in maybe with the size of the sales force of where it is now? And how much of that contributes to the $180 million in cost savings?\nDirk Locascio : Sure. So the reason that we tried to separate out the $180 million from variable costs is one of the things that -- so I used -- maybe start with distribution is that our distribution labor pool is flexing up and down and depending on what the results and the case volumes are in different markets. And so we've been pretty active in managing that, and we'll continue to do in order to match volume. So that's the main area where you see labor moving around a lot. From the other selling and admin, we have brought back some sellers from the original reductions. But I think in that case, we're pretty pleased with the size of where we are and the one thing that we've talked a lot about in the past and have demonstrated that, in that case, as volume improves in certain markets as needed, we will bring sellers back in order to profitably grow sales. But the bulk of the $180 million that we've talked about is more admin and back office type rules, which we would expect to largely stay in place as this continues to recover.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo.\nEdward Kelly : I want to start with just current case growth trends, and maybe if you could provide a bit more color around what you're seeing currently. I know you have through -- it looks like, I guess, the week of October 24, it looks like total organic case is maybe down somewhere in the high teens. Just curious if you've seen any change in that more recently, just given the rise in COVID cases and the cooler weather? And then we are seeing globally restrictions kind of rising here, which maybe we start to see some of that in the U.S. Do you think that we could see some step back in the recovery as we sort of like get deeper into fall and winter?\nPietro Satriano : It's Pietro. So in terms of the pattern, I mean, you could see the -- from -- after which pages -- it's been a slow and steady increase throughout the fall, the increase has slowed a little bit from where it was this summer, not surprisingly. But it's a slow and steady increase kind of versus where we were the week before, the week before that. In terms of the possible headwinds we might head into that you mentioned, I mean, the thing I would also ask you think about is the offsetting positive tailwinds. So let's walk through, I think, the things you mentioned. So the number of increasing COVID cases, one of the things we did do is, there was -- what was characterized as a second wave in the Sun Belt this summer, and what we did is we looked at the sales in those states, primarily Georgia, Florida, Arizona, Texas, and what we found was there was a bit of a step back for a little bit of time. But then what we found is sales bounced back, and they recovered at a higher level than they were before that second wave. So the long-term trend or mid-term trend continues to go up and just kind of overcome the COVID cases. So yes, so people might -- consumers might go on the sidelines for some period of time, but then they come back and they come back in even greater numbers than they were pre that spike. So I think that's encouraging. I think in terms of colder climate, I talked about that a little bit in my comments. In some parts of the country, obviously, there's not as much outdoor dining that can happen. But I think the wildcard is the continued growing importance of off-premise dining, whether it's takeout or delivery. And there's a number of things restaurants are doing to both make diners feel more comfortable about indoor dining and as well trying to prolong the outdoor season. In terms of restrictions, you're right, there's a couple of places in the last week that have put restrictions in place. There's still also places in the country that have restrictions in place that haven't come off like California. So I think those might have offset across the portfolio of geographies. So what I would say is short-term, there may be as many positive tailwinds as some of the headwinds that you described. And I think medium to long-term, the trajectory continues to remain positive.\nEdward Kelly : Okay. And then I was curious, I guess, Dirk, if you could provide some color on the cadence of sort of EBITDA by month. And I'm asking this question because just taking a step back, the Q4 consensus estimate looks to be around $270 million or so, which to me seems a little high. I'm just kind of curious as to how we should be thinking about Q4?\nDirk Locascio: Sure. So the overall -- just in broad terms, the cadence wasn't all that different. You end up with a little stronger EBITDA as volume recovered throughout the quarter. But beyond that, there's not a whole lot I have to add. I think the other incremental piece is, we would expect a little more of the cost savings to show up in Q4. But otherwise -- sorry, the timing of the cadence in the quarter, nothing specific to call out beyond that as far as the specific timing.\nEdward Kelly : So where you were sort of running end of Q3, maybe a sprinkle in a little bit more cost saves, and that's kind of how we think about EBITDA by month in Q4. Is that fair?\nDirk Locascio : There's always some things on seasonality and timing of things. But I think when you think about the core business, that's a good way to think about it. And I think that -- I know there's just interest in the coming few months, I think so we're trying to balance that as you would want us to, but at the same time, trying to make these decisions to balance for this timeframe that post-COVID in order to make sure that we're doing the things of really setting ourselves up for success on the other side. Pietro talked about this of gaining share on small and large customers, and we've had very strong success in the last few months on that and are going to continue to push ahead to really help prepare the business further for the near-term as well as the mid-term.\nEdward Kelly : Okay. If I could just squeeze one more and this for you Pietro, I guess. You're optimistic that profitability can exceed pre-COVID levels. Some of this depends, I guess, probably on making the right decisions on the business that you take in today. Can you just talk a bit about how you're balancing the desire to drive near-term EBITDA growth, with sort of the focus on post-COVID margins and the $800 million that you brought in, those margins kind of look similar to what the company would earn pre-COVID? Just curious as you're thinking about all that.\nPietro Satriano : Yes. So as I tried to allude to in my comments, the margins for the new business that we have brought in are very healthy, for large customers are obviously lower than independents or small customers. But there -- if you look at that spectrum of large customers that come in, in the upper quartiles of the margin profile of the large customers that we historically had in our portfolio. So we've been very judicious in terms of the rate at which we bring on those customers. I think the factors that are driving the interest of customers to make a different decision about who to partner with, that's probably more to do with some of the advantages I talked about. The scale, the stability we provide, some of the value-added, especially some of those smaller multi-unit local customers, those value-added still make a big difference. And I think that's really what is driving those profitable market share gains.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.\nJohn Ivankoe: I wanted to revisit the $180 million of cost savings, which you said the majority of which are in via back office and corporate. That's not a small number as -- obviously, I know that you know. Are there any future investments or functionality that you've kind of taken off the front burner that maybe you're losing as some of those cost cuts? And were there any major department consolidations, other type of structural work that kind of happened to hit that $180 million? And the final question, just in case I get cut off, some companies have kind of talked about regionalization of their business, changing the way their sales force is compensated, just kind of taking the opportunity of doing a broader restructuring, not just on the corporates and back office, but also the -- what's facing the customer. Is that on the table? Is that off the table? Where are you in that process?\nDirk Locascio : Maybe Pietro, I'll start with some of the initial costs, then maybe you can comment on some of the business model things. So I think on that, John, with -- out of the $180 million, so most of it being people-related costs. But what I would say is we took an approach to really try to balance so that we weren't making decisions that we felt negatively impacted the customer, our ability to service the customer. In fact, our focus on customer and service levels to customers is more relentless, I would say, in the last 3 to 6 months than it was prior to COVID really, in fact, in some cases, investing more in inventory as we really strive for that. I think as we've gone through, there's a lens we've applied across these different areas, some of it because in some of these admins, if you do have volume lower, you can take some of this out. We have found some ways through using some of our continuous improvement process to streamline some processes. So -- but as you think about big investments in the way our priorities are structured, we have applied a prioritization and are not sacrificing the future and our top priorities at the expense of this cost and still feel very good about our ability to maintain and expand on leadership in many areas coming out of their side of COVID.\nPietro Satriano : Yes. And then in terms of some of the other things you've said, are they on or off the table, John. I presume you're referring to a couple of things. One is, move to multi-site area. And you'll remember, we moved to that management model in 2015. We're very happy with it. We think it served us well. Most areas have a presence that overlooks 2 markets, we think that's the right number, and we aligned our region structure at that time to be consistent with that span. So we think we did that work a number of years ago, and we're happy with the results of that work in terms of our operating model.\nJohn Ivankoe : And anything on the sales facing part of the business just in terms of how the customer is being served, whether it's rethinking the way that they're being compensated or what the coverage are and how the territory managers are integrated just within the selling organization. I mean, if there are any changes that the customer could see that could also make you more efficient?\nPietro Satriano : Right. So thanks for that reminder. The team-based selling approach is, again, one we put in place many years ago. As you know, we modified our approach to compensation slightly a couple of years ago. So again, those are changes that we made, have already made, and we want to make sure that they settle. The only thing that has been pretty different in this environment compared to where we were before is the ability of, in particular, our restaurant operations consultants, right? We have specialists who are focused on product, and then we are -- we have experts or specialists, we call them ROCs, restaurant operation consultants, who are focused on the back office of the restaurant, and we've been able to really increase their reach through the webinars and through virtual technology. So what we've been able to do is, as opposed to have one ROC or a couple of ROCs in the market try to learn everything about, especially with respect to the reopening blueprint or with respect to back in March or April, how to best apply for the government support, we were able to specialize and give people a much broader reach, which results in a better customer experience with customers. I suspect some of that will persist, John. You're able to kind of expand the reach and provide a better experience for the customers. So when it comes to more of the product specialists, which is more hands on, I don't expect a lot of change on that front.\nJohn Ivankoe : And I'm sure everyone is looking forward to getting the food shows back on the schedule. That'd be a nice reminder that COVID is over.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse.\nLauren Silberman: Can you dimensionalize organic independent case growth for the impact of restaurant same-store sales declines versus net new restaurant customer acquisition versus wallet share gains? So to what extent have seen store sales decreases amongst existing customers and closures been offset by wallet share gains and on-boarding of new customers?\nPietro Satriano: So what I would say, Laura, is some of the gains, as I said, have come from market share gains and market share is -- we've recently been able to try to triangulate around that. There's not great data on that. We're starting to get better data. Of course, some customers, especially those where there's -- remained to be indoor restrictions, had same-store sales fall, but some have compensated, as I've said, through off-premise dining and throughout the dining, of course, the summer and the colder climates. So it's really -- there's a number of different factors, and I think it would be hard to generalize. I don't know that we have all the data, and I think it would be hard to generalize to -- specifically with respect to your question.\nLauren Silberman: Fully understood. Just to follow-up on the near-term organic case growth. It looks like restaurants about down 10% the last few weeks. So I know you felt some of the near-term headwinds. But as we think about further sales gains from here, are they largely predicated on increases in capacity restrictions? Or do you really see the most meaningful opportunities for continued recovery near term, assuming the current environment is status quo?\nPietro Satriano: So I think over time, so the next 2 to 4 months, I don't know if anyone -- as Ed was implying that the current environment may improve, may very well deteriorate, it depends on different parts of the country. And as I said, there are just as many potential positive forces as headwinds with respect to the near-term environment. I think what I would focus on is more of the medium to long-term environment, Laura, where we think that consumers -- if there are some consumers who are obviously perhaps staying on the sidelines, who perhaps haven't replaced other dining out occasions with off-premise, that over time, especially once there's a vaccine in place, I think that those consumer habits go back to where they were. And what we're really encouraged by is just the steady -- the slow and steady increase in organic performance despite the second wave, despite some of the other things. We're just seeing -- what's really encouraging over the medium to long-term is the slow and steady increase in organic performance amongst new tenants.\nLauren Silberman: We've seen a pretty significant disparity in performance in urban and suburban market. So what's your relative exposure concentration in urban versus suburban areas?\nPietro Satriano : I don't know that we're able to quantify that, alright, but I think you do raise a point. That's another example of where some of the more urban markets have been hit hard, but we've seen the offsetting shift to some areas. And again, when you cover the country like we do, it's like a very well-diversified portfolio of stock, a bunch of puts and takes and we're making sure our local leaders to make sure they shift appropriately, whether it's to different menu types that are more resilient, or different sub-geographies that are experiencing growth.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Slagle with Jefferies.\nAlex Slagle : I wanted to follow-up on the margin commentary. And gross margin improved a solid 70 basis points quarter-over-quarter this quarter. Just wondering how we should think about the dynamics heading into the 4Q, which historically is a pretty high-margin quarter. Obviously, this year faces some unusual circumstances. If there's any factors we should consider in our 4Q view?\nDirk Locascio : Sure. I think that when I start with the core customer margins, as I mentioned earlier, they've been quite stable, and we continue to see a pretty rational competitive environment. So at this point, it doesn't indicate that as something to consider changing. I think the main thing is really the mix again, and it plays out any differently than historically or recent run rates. But as far as the core underlying health, there's nothing specific that I would call out there. And we would expect the gross margins as volume and mix recovers to continue to improve as it has in more recent months. Like I said, from the -- at the second quarter call, I called it out the last 2 months of that quarter versus this and we have seen improvements as volume and mix has recovered. And as volume recovers over time, we expect that to happen, and it's kind of hard to predict exactly, which that happens in Q4 versus the coming quarters, but we are seeing that positivity happen as volume recovers.\nAlex Slagle : And then a follow-up on the Smart Foodservice business. It sounds like you opened a couple of stores so far in the 4Q. Do you have a rough idea on what you think the pace of  development will look like into '21?\nDirk Locascio : So on those, we've opened one. We have one more that will be opened. And we haven't talked about a specific near-term pace. One of the things that we do have more in the pipeline for opening next year. And as Pietro commented earlier, our plans continue to be to double the footprint over the long-term. We're working to integrate that in the business and really allow us to have that strong omni-channel presence that will be difficult to match. And as you may remember, we've talked about in the past is the positive that we see with our own smaller footprint of CHEF'STORE is not only do we get the incremental business from those stores, and delivered customers who shop there are also buying more. So it's not -- it's accretive on that front. And so we look forward to as we continue to expand to likely see the benefits on that as well. So exciting future for Smart Foodservice as part of the US Foods' family.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Carla Casella with JPMorgan.\nCarla Casella : I'm wondering, given the changes that you've made, the new contracts that you've gotten and the acquisitions, can you give us a sense for the breakdown of your business, what percentage of your sales overall are to key categories like either the restaurants, the independents versus hospitality and healthcare?\nPietro Satriano : Do you mind repeating that one more time, please?\nCarla Casella : I'm looking for the business mix where it stands today, given the acquisitions and the new business you've added, if you could break it out. If it's changed dramatically between restaurants, hospitality and healthcare? Or you can tell us how much of the business is still independents?\nPietro Satriano : Sure. So at this point, we haven't quantified specifically, what I would say, though, is because there's also some shifts, as you're well aware, with current changes in volumes. So for example, hospitality being lower. But what we expect is when you look at the core business and the customers over time, we wouldn't expect that to shift meaningfully from where we had been historically. You end up with hospitality being a little bit less than the spend historically just because of the -- it is recovering, but taking a little bit longer to recover than otherwise. But as you think about the business recovering over the long-term, I would think about the mix similar to where it's been.\nCarla Casella : So as you said in the past, what percentage of your sales are to independent or to restaurants?\nDirk Locascio : So what we've talked about is we've said -- I'm trying to remember that roughly -- Melissa, you have to keep me honest here, is it roughly\u2026?\nMelissa Napier : About a third to independents, about a third to healthcare hospitality, about a third to what we would call all other. And then, Carla, we've also said about 50% of sales are to restaurants. So that would be independent as well as chains.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeff Priester : This is actually Jeff Priester on for Jeff Bernstein. 2 questions for you. Can you just give us a sense of how your inventory levels and inventory management is trending kind of as you've rebuilt your inventory following the second quarter, maybe kind of positioning it relative to your pre-COVID levels? And then second, do you have a sense of whether or not your customers on average are still running simplified menus? Are they back to running their full menus, maybe through SKU count per customer or any other metrics you want to provide?\nDirk Locascio : Sure. So what we're -- as I've mentioned earlier, we're actively managing our inventory just because of the pace at which certain inventory items or SKUs are moving. We're running a couple of days higher on DIOH. But pretty, I'd say, not that far different. And our replenishment sales teams are actively monitoring. And we're really striking the balance between the cost -- I'm sorry, the -- having the inventory levels and the service levels. And because we have some vendor challenges of getting the product in on time, getting the product that we order here, it's a matter of, we've chosen to invest a little bit extra in inventory in order to serve our customers. So again, a little more, not all that different and monitoring closely. I think to your question about the menus, it does indicate that customers are still running more simplified menus, and I think that's a way for them I think you know, for them to manage their own inventory and risk scope in a loss or spoilage in this environment. And I would expect that, that will continue for a while until we return to a more stable environment.\nJeff Priester : Got you. And then is there any update on the number of customer -- of your customers that are not taking deliveries right now, whether it be temporary or permanent closures?\nDirk Locascio : So it's -- what we've talked about is that we expect that the level of closures sort of in the single-digits. And we do have -- that we will work with our sellers on sort of some of them being temporary and some permanent and -- but expect, at this point, the level of closures to still remain in the single-digits. I think the thing that gets harder to tell over time is how that trends. But at this point, one of the things that we've seen is operators do continue to be very resilient. And as we've talked about before, I think get through and Pietro talked about it in a few different ways today as operators really expand the offerings they have through takeout and delivery that they're much better positioned now as a general group, it appears that when we first entered COVID as far as dealing with some of the uncertainty and some of the restrictions are in place.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass : First, if I could just go back to gross margin. You had last quarter provided some helpful detail around year-over-year change related to volume declines, acquisition puts and takes, customer mix, et cetera. Do you have those details for this quarter, what the pressures were by those sort of various buckets?\nDirk Locascio : For gross profit, specifically?\nJohn Glass : Correct.\nDirk Locascio : Sure. So what I would say is, so out of the roughly 100 basis points, it's entirely driven by the combination of mix and the impact of sales inflation. Sort of the acquisitions were pretty benign this quarter as far as an impact. And so it really is the combination of those mix and inflation. And actually, as I commented earlier, across our customer margins and the balance, it really is quite stable of a backdrop of an environment. So that's what gives us the -- but the positivity, optimism of the continued return as volume continues to improve. And even across the mix, we've seen improvement in the third quarter as we've seen those volumes recover.\nJohn Glass : And then just as a follow-up, the -- do you have a sense or can you sort of quantify what you think your wallet share has changed among independent customers? Some talk about gaining wallet share among their existing customers are holding aside perhaps new customer acquisition. Can you give a sense of how much improvement you've seen in wallet shares such that maybe someone's switching in a secondary distributor to the primary distributor? However you measure that wallet share among independent customers.\nDirk Locascio : Sure. So we haven't talked about a specific number, but we do believe we are gaining share among the independents. And there is, as Pietro comment earlier, not great industry data. There's some industry data through NPD that we use that does on a more [blind] basis, our share in each of the markets compared to others. And that data indicates in the more recent months that we are gaining share versus the rest of the industry, pretty broad-based across our regions in the independent space. And then with the larger customers in national sales, with the wins that Pietro talked about, also believe we're gaining share on that as customers continue to engage with our team about conversions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of William Reuter with Bank of America.\nWilliam Reuter : I just have 2. In your prepared remarks, you talked about how permanent restaurant closures seem to be relatively benign at this point. But I guess, if you could talk about sequentially between the second and third quarter, if you did see an acceleration of some of those closures? And then you discussed [800] gross store openings that you've achieved this year. Are there any offsetting customer losses that were meaningful? That's all from me.\nDirk Locascio: Sure. So in that case, from a closure, there's nothing that I would call out as far as any meaningful change from Q2 to Q3. And I think, in fact, in many cases, operators that were closed in Q2, we started to see some openings as they adapted through the environment that we're operating in. So it's nothing meaningful to call out specifically there. And then, do you mind repeating your second question again, please?\nWilliam Reuter : Yes. The second question was just you gained 800 gross new doors, the 500 of chains. And then if there's any losses to offset those?\nDirk Locascio : Sure. So there's -- the number, I think it's roughly $100 million or so that offset that. On a net basis, in fact, this is one of the strongest years our national sales team has had in a number of years. And again, as Pietro, just literally said earlier, for us, when we talk about profitably growing sales, that is we're taking that serious. And with these wins, it's not coming because we're just bringing in cases. It's about attractive economics on these and our sales team, bringing forth some of the differences we have from scale, consistency of operations, tools, et cetera, and are very, very pleased with the growth and net levels of wins in the pipeline on that business remains very strong.\nOperator: And your final question comes from the line of Carla Casella with JPMorgan.\nCarla Casella : So I had a follow-up. On the cash flow side -- actually, 2 follow-ups. You're currently paying your preferred in time or picking it. Do you expect to continue to do that? And then you also sold some assets in the quarter, and I'm wondering if you have much more that's slated for sale and what actually you sold?\nDirk Locascio : Sure. So we expect to play through pick the first year, that's the way the agreement was structured, and then I would expect that we were paying cash post and that then is just one of the instruments we're focusing on. One of the things over time that we have consistently demonstrated is focused when we talk about delevering of really following through and executing on that and getting back to our 2.5 to 3 times, which, in fact, we had achieved right before the 2 recent acquisitions, and I would expect us to continue to use strong cash flow post COVID in order to do that as we move ahead. The -- to your point on the sale. So the piece of property we sold was an excess piece of property in California that we had that we bought a number of years ago. We, from time to time, will buy pieces of property for potential future distribution centers and in this particular case, as time has gone on, and we looked at our footprint, we determined that we would not need it. And thankfully, the market has improved since we bought it and so that's why we had the $17 million gain and ultimately left that in our operations because we do buy and sell -- or sell excess properties from time to time with the kind of gains or losses, but we wanted to make sure we called out in our script and earnings release, et cetera, in order to be clear of what was in the results. As far as your question about do we have many others? I wouldn't expect. I mean, typically, in a given year, we may have 1 or 2. There's just nothing -- there's a couple of smaller ones that potentially we have on the market now. And if we have progress on those, we would give updates as we move forward.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time.\nDirk Locascio : Okay. Thank you. I think that, unfortunately, right toward the end there, Pietro was kicked off the call. So just in closing. Just -- I hope as you leave today's call, really you have 3 takeaways. First, just the industry is resilient, expected to return to pre-COVID volume levels. Second, that our scale and differentiation as a company are leading to market share gains. And third, that our financial results significantly improved from the trough in the second quarter. And for this, I just want to reiterate and thank all of our associates who have really worked tirelessly since the beginning of this pandemic to serve our customers.  So with that, thank you all for joining our call today, and that ends our comments. Thank you. Have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dirk Locascio",
            "content": "Thank you, Pietro. I'd like to begin on Slide 9, where I'll cover the highlights for the quarter before taking a deeper dive into our financial results. Our third quarter results showed significant improvement from the prior quarter and highlight the work we've done to position the business for success post-COVID. As Pietro mentioned, we saw consistent improvement in case volume as the quarter progressed. This improvement is attributable to our ability to gain market share as well as improvement in the underlying fundamentals of the industry. Our adjusted gross profit margin improved 70 basis points from the second quarter and was stable throughout the quarter. We expect our adjusted gross profit margin will continue to improve as our case volume recovers and our customer product mix returns to pre-COVID levels. On the cost side, we enacted a series of permanent cost reductions in the second and third quarters that will position the business for higher EBITDA margins post-COVID. On an annualized basis, we eliminated approximately $180 million of fixed costs from the business, and we'll continue to manage our variable costs in line with case volumes. These fixed cost reductions are mostly in the corporate and back office areas of the business, and I'm pleased to report that we continue to see strong collection efforts on our outstanding accounts receivable. And as a result, we've further reduced the uncollectible account receivable reserve by $30 million again this quarter. Our incremental COVID-related uncollectible account reserve now sits at $65 million and we have not seen a degradation in the quality of our receivables since COVID began. Moving to Slide 10. Our third quarter financial results improved significantly from the trough we experienced in the second quarter. Net sales compared to the prior year were down 10.5% for the quarter, driven by a combination of lower case volume and negative customer mix, which is a significant improvement from the 29% year-over-year net sales decline we saw in the second quarter. Inflation for the quarter was 220 basis points, primarily driven by inflation in the beef and cheese categories. Our adjusted gross profit margin was down 100 basis points compared to the prior year but improved 70 basis points from the second quarter. Changes in our customer and product mix and lower inbound logistics income were the drivers of the year-over-year decline. Lower inbound case volume resulted in us needing to reoptimize our freight network to compensate for the loss of scale that we benefit from at higher inbound case volume levels. This work is in process, and we expect our inbound logistics income to improve as the reoptimization works take effect and inbound case volumes improve. As I previously mentioned, we expect our adjusted gross margin to increase as our case volume recovers and customer product mix returns to more normal pre-COVID levels. Gross margin at the customer level remains similar to pre-COVID rates, and we continue to see a rational competitive environment. Adjusted operating expense increased 20 basis points compared to the prior year. However, this was a 100 basis point improvement compared to the second quarter. We experienced a 20 basis point year-over-year increase despite experiencing fixed cost deleverage from lower case volume. During the quarter, we successfully managed our variable cost to be in line with case volume while enacting the permanent cost reductions I discussed earlier. In the third quarter, there were a couple of items that had a net benefit to adjusted operating expense of approximately 20 basis points, the largest of which was a $17 million gain on the piece of excess land in Southern California. We don't expect these items to repeat in the upcoming quarters. Even with the benefits factored in, we're extremely pleased with the work we've done on the cost side. Our cost structure remains flexible, allowing us to quickly adapt to changes in our case volume. On Slide 11, I thought it would be helpful to spend a few minutes discussing our operating leverage and adjusted EBITDA margin. Prior to COVID, our adjusted EBITDA margin, which is the difference between adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating expense, is running in the mid-4% range and increasing annually. At the trough in the second quarter, this delta shrunk to 190 basis points, but has quickly expanded again to 3.6% in the third quarter. This is a direct result of the improvement in our customer mix and the cost actions we've taken. And if you notice, our adjusted operating expense as a percent of sales in the quarter is largely in line with where it was pre-COVID. This is despite the fixed cost deleverage from lower case volume. As our case volume improves, we expect the organization to operate at lower adjusted operating expense level than we did pre-COVID. And on the adjusted gross profit margin side of the equation, the recovery in our independent restaurant case volume is helping us to drive improvements. And as I just mentioned, we continue to work to reoptimize our inbound freight network. This work and an increase in our independent case volume will help adjusted gross profit recover to be in line with pre-COVID levels. The net effect, we believe, will be an expansion of our adjusted EBITDA margin post-COVID. Moving to Slide 12. Our adjusted EBITDA results for the third quarter improved meaningfully from the second quarter in both dollars and EBITDA margin. Adjusted EBITDA was $209 million for the quarter, which means based on this run rate, the business is generating approximately $800 million of adjusted EBITDA on an annualized basis despite case volume being down in the high teens. This is another indication of the flexible cost structure and operating model that exists within the business. In the third quarter, we returned to positive earnings, generating $32 million of adjusted net income and $0.15 of adjusted diluted earnings per share. Since we had a GAAP net loss for the quarter, the additional preferred equity shares are not included in the share count for the third quarter. When we do return to positive GAAP net income, those shares will be factored in to the earnings per share calculations. If these were included in the Q3 earnings calculation, our adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter would have been $0.13. Turning to Slide 13. The business remains in a strong liquidity and cash flow position. We ended the third quarter with $1 billion of cash on hand and $2.7 billion of total liquidity. In the second quarter, we had a large working capital benefit, which we expected to reverse in the third quarter. As of the end of the third quarter, this reversal is largely complete. During the quarter, we reinvested in inventory to support current case volume levels and return vendors to a normal payment schedule. Going forward, we'll manage working capital in line with the recovery in case volume. In the current case volume levels, the business is cash flow positive, and we expect to return to the strong cash flow levels we experienced pre-COVID as case volume continues to recover. We remain focused on reducing our net debt balance and lowering our net debt leverage ratio, which stands at 5.9 times at the end of the third quarter. Over time, we expect to reduce our leverage ratio through both an improvement in EBITDA dollars and a reduction in our outstanding debt, as we've consistently demonstrated the ability to do in the past. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the progress we've made during the third quarter and the benefits we expect the business to experience from a continued recovery in case volume. With that, operator, we can now open the call up for questions. Thank you. I would just add, Pietro is just, again, a reminder on the sales reduction that Pietro mentioned were the ones that happened earlier in the year and the more recent reductions were mostly back office types of roles. And John, to your point, we do expect to be at a full run rate here in the fourth quarter. So with that, John, I think it is a reasonable assumption that it would come back quicker. It's hard to predict exactly how much quicker. But to your point, as volume recovers, that does help profitability. But given the actions we've taken on cost that go into effect essentially now, it is reasonable to expect the profitability would come back quicker. I can start and then Pietro can add as appropriate. I think some -- as Pietro indicated earlier, for the acquisitions, they're performing well relative to the environment we're in. To your point, Smart holding up quite well as a business. So starting with Food Group, their sales were slightly better than US Foods, organic for the quarter, really driven by a higher mix of chain business. And the overall EBITDA decline was a little bit better than the organic business, in large part because of some of the synergy benefits that have begun to flow through. Also, just from a Food Group, as Pietro noted, with the second successful system conversion, we continue to make good progress on the integration of that business and are pleased at the pace now in which we have reaccelerated to move ahead with that. From a Smart Foodservice, you're exactly right. So that business has held up quite well for some of the reasons Pietro talked about. The case volumes being really down in the low to mid-single-digit range, and EBITDA not much off from prior year levels. So we continue to be excited by what that presents from an existing footprint as well as expansion opportunities from this highly profitable business. So we're pleased today with both of them and continuing to work to strengthen our footprint and our penetration in both of them and continue to build on that. Sure. So the reason that we tried to separate out the $180 million from variable costs is one of the things that -- so I used -- maybe start with distribution is that our distribution labor pool is flexing up and down and depending on what the results and the case volumes are in different markets. And so we've been pretty active in managing that, and we'll continue to do in order to match volume. So that's the main area where you see labor moving around a lot. From the other selling and admin, we have brought back some sellers from the original reductions. But I think in that case, we're pretty pleased with the size of where we are and the one thing that we've talked a lot about in the past and have demonstrated that, in that case, as volume improves in certain markets as needed, we will bring sellers back in order to profitably grow sales. But the bulk of the $180 million that we've talked about is more admin and back office type rules, which we would expect to largely stay in place as this continues to recover. Sure. So the overall -- just in broad terms, the cadence wasn't all that different. You end up with a little stronger EBITDA as volume recovered throughout the quarter. But beyond that, there's not a whole lot I have to add. I think the other incremental piece is, we would expect a little more of the cost savings to show up in Q4. But otherwise -- sorry, the timing of the cadence in the quarter, nothing specific to call out beyond that as far as the specific timing. There's always some things on seasonality and timing of things. But I think when you think about the core business, that's a good way to think about it. And I think that -- I know there's just interest in the coming few months, I think so we're trying to balance that as you would want us to, but at the same time, trying to make these decisions to balance for this timeframe that post-COVID in order to make sure that we're doing the things of really setting ourselves up for success on the other side. Pietro talked about this of gaining share on small and large customers, and we've had very strong success in the last few months on that and are going to continue to push ahead to really help prepare the business further for the near-term as well as the mid-term. Maybe Pietro, I'll start with some of the initial costs, then maybe you can comment on some of the business model things. So I think on that, John, with -- out of the $180 million, so most of it being people-related costs. But what I would say is we took an approach to really try to balance so that we weren't making decisions that we felt negatively impacted the customer, our ability to service the customer. In fact, our focus on customer and service levels to customers is more relentless, I would say, in the last 3 to 6 months than it was prior to COVID really, in fact, in some cases, investing more in inventory as we really strive for that. I think as we've gone through, there's a lens we've applied across these different areas, some of it because in some of these admins, if you do have volume lower, you can take some of this out. We have found some ways through using some of our continuous improvement process to streamline some processes. So -- but as you think about big investments in the way our priorities are structured, we have applied a prioritization and are not sacrificing the future and our top priorities at the expense of this cost and still feel very good about our ability to maintain and expand on leadership in many areas coming out of their side of COVID. Sure. I think that when I start with the core customer margins, as I mentioned earlier, they've been quite stable, and we continue to see a pretty rational competitive environment. So at this point, it doesn't indicate that as something to consider changing. I think the main thing is really the mix again, and it plays out any differently than historically or recent run rates. But as far as the core underlying health, there's nothing specific that I would call out there. And we would expect the gross margins as volume and mix recovers to continue to improve as it has in more recent months. Like I said, from the -- at the second quarter call, I called it out the last 2 months of that quarter versus this and we have seen improvements as volume and mix has recovered. And as volume recovers over time, we expect that to happen, and it's kind of hard to predict exactly, which that happens in Q4 versus the coming quarters, but we are seeing that positivity happen as volume recovers. So on those, we've opened one. We have one more that will be opened. And we haven't talked about a specific near-term pace. One of the things that we do have more in the pipeline for opening next year. And as Pietro commented earlier, our plans continue to be to double the footprint over the long-term. We're working to integrate that in the business and really allow us to have that strong omni-channel presence that will be difficult to match. And as you may remember, we've talked about in the past is the positive that we see with our own smaller footprint of CHEF'STORE is not only do we get the incremental business from those stores, and delivered customers who shop there are also buying more. So it's not -- it's accretive on that front. And so we look forward to as we continue to expand to likely see the benefits on that as well. So exciting future for Smart Foodservice as part of the US Foods' family. So what we've talked about is we've said -- I'm trying to remember that roughly -- Melissa, you have to keep me honest here, is it roughly...? Sure. So what we're -- as I've mentioned earlier, we're actively managing our inventory just because of the pace at which certain inventory items or SKUs are moving. We're running a couple of days higher on DIOH. But pretty, I'd say, not that far different. And our replenishment sales teams are actively monitoring. And we're really striking the balance between the cost -- I'm sorry, the -- having the inventory levels and the service levels. And because we have some vendor challenges of getting the product in on time, getting the product that we order here, it's a matter of, we've chosen to invest a little bit extra in inventory in order to serve our customers. So again, a little more, not all that different and monitoring closely. I think to your question about the menus, it does indicate that customers are still running more simplified menus, and I think that's a way for them I think you know, for them to manage their own inventory and risk scope in a loss or spoilage in this environment. And I would expect that, that will continue for a while until we return to a more stable environment. So it's -- what we've talked about is that we expect that the level of closures sort of in the single-digits. And we do have -- that we will work with our sellers on sort of some of them being temporary and some permanent and -- but expect, at this point, the level of closures to still remain in the single-digits. I think the thing that gets harder to tell over time is how that trends. But at this point, one of the things that we've seen is operators do continue to be very resilient. And as we've talked about before, I think get through and Pietro talked about it in a few different ways today as operators really expand the offerings they have through takeout and delivery that they're much better positioned now as a general group, it appears that when we first entered COVID as far as dealing with some of the uncertainty and some of the restrictions are in place. For gross profit, specifically? Sure. So what I would say is, so out of the roughly 100 basis points, it's entirely driven by the combination of mix and the impact of sales inflation. Sort of the acquisitions were pretty benign this quarter as far as an impact. And so it really is the combination of those mix and inflation. And actually, as I commented earlier, across our customer margins and the balance, it really is quite stable of a backdrop of an environment. So that's what gives us the -- but the positivity, optimism of the continued return as volume continues to improve. And even across the mix, we've seen improvement in the third quarter as we've seen those volumes recover. Sure. So we haven't talked about a specific number, but we do believe we are gaining share among the independents. And there is, as Pietro comment earlier, not great industry data. There's some industry data through NPD that we use that does on a more [blind] basis, our share in each of the markets compared to others. And that data indicates in the more recent months that we are gaining share versus the rest of the industry, pretty broad-based across our regions in the independent space. And then with the larger customers in national sales, with the wins that Pietro talked about, also believe we're gaining share on that as customers continue to engage with our team about conversions. Sure. So in that case, from a closure, there's nothing that I would call out as far as any meaningful change from Q2 to Q3. And I think, in fact, in many cases, operators that were closed in Q2, we started to see some openings as they adapted through the environment that we're operating in. So it's nothing meaningful to call out specifically there. And then, do you mind repeating your second question again, please? Sure. So there's -- the number, I think it's roughly $100 million or so that offset that. On a net basis, in fact, this is one of the strongest years our national sales team has had in a number of years. And again, as Pietro, just literally said earlier, for us, when we talk about profitably growing sales, that is we're taking that serious. And with these wins, it's not coming because we're just bringing in cases. It's about attractive economics on these and our sales team, bringing forth some of the differences we have from scale, consistency of operations, tools, et cetera, and are very, very pleased with the growth and net levels of wins in the pipeline on that business remains very strong. Sure. So we expect to play through pick the first year, that's the way the agreement was structured, and then I would expect that we were paying cash post and that then is just one of the instruments we're focusing on. One of the things over time that we have consistently demonstrated is focused when we talk about delevering of really following through and executing on that and getting back to our 2.5 to 3 times, which, in fact, we had achieved right before the 2 recent acquisitions, and I would expect us to continue to use strong cash flow post COVID in order to do that as we move ahead. The -- to your point on the sale. So the piece of property we sold was an excess piece of property in California that we had that we bought a number of years ago. We, from time to time, will buy pieces of property for potential future distribution centers and in this particular case, as time has gone on, and we looked at our footprint, we determined that we would not need it. And thankfully, the market has improved since we bought it and so that's why we had the $17 million gain and ultimately left that in our operations because we do buy and sell -- or sell excess properties from time to time with the kind of gains or losses, but we wanted to make sure we called out in our script and earnings release, et cetera, in order to be clear of what was in the results. As far as your question about do we have many others? I wouldn't expect. I mean, typically, in a given year, we may have 1 or 2. There's just nothing -- there's a couple of smaller ones that potentially we have on the market now. And if we have progress on those, we would give updates as we move forward. Okay. Thank you. I think that, unfortunately, right toward the end there, Pietro was kicked off the call. So just in closing. Just -- I hope as you leave today's call, really you have 3 takeaways. First, just the industry is resilient, expected to return to pre-COVID volume levels. Second, that our scale and differentiation as a company are leading to market share gains. And third, that our financial results significantly improved from the trough in the second quarter. And for this, I just want to reiterate and thank all of our associates who have really worked tirelessly since the beginning of this pandemic to serve our customers.  So with that, thank you all for joining our call today, and that ends our comments. Thank you. Have a good day."

            "name": "Pietro Satriano",
            "content": "Thank you, Melissa. And good morning, everyone. Before we get started, I would like to thank all our associates for their dedication and commitment that they have displayed in helping our customers navigate this challenging environment. Their efforts have truly been second to none.  I'm going to begin on Slide 2 with an executive summary of what we'll cover today. First, as evidenced by the continued appetite of consumers to eat out and take out, as well as the continued ingenuity of restaurants across the country, we remain confident that our industry will return to pre-COVID levels over time. Second, the third quarter saw a marked improvement in our business. Case volumes have steadily improved, and we're profitably gaining market share. Third, Recent acquisitions of Food Group and Smart Foodservice have performed in line with expectations and the integration of Food Group is on track. And finally, the steady improvement in our case volume combined with our cost reduction actions led to adjusted EBITDA that was a marked improvement over the second quarter. Dirk will cover this fourth point in his review of the financial results and I will cover the first three.  Starting with our perspective on the industry. Moving to Slide 4, the chart on the left compares consumer visits at food away from home establishments like restaurants to visits at food-at-home establishments like grocery stores. As you can see, pre-COVID food away from home visits were roughly 50% of total consumer visits. After stepping down in late March and April, consumer visits at food away from home establishment has consistently increased and are trending back towards the 50% level that the industry experienced pre-COVID. This recovery illustrates the desire of the consumer to purchase from food away from home establishment, a habit that has been shaped over decades, and helps we affirm our belief that our industry will ultimately recover to pre-COVID level.  One of the drivers of this recovery has been off-premise dining, which continues to grow in importance. As we said on our last call, for full-service restaurants, 55% of traffic in June was off-premise compared to 19% pre-COVID. A more recent survey state that 68% of consumers in this country are a takeout at least once a month post-COVID compared to 45% pre-COVID, an increase of 51%. The continued growth in off-premise dining also gives us the confidence that restaurants in the colder climates will be able to navigate the winter months.  Over the past several months we have seen restaurants embrace those kitchens, also known as virtual kitchens, a way by which operators can use their kitchen space to create new brands focused solely on takeout and delivery. In addition, some operators are experimenting with tents, igloos and heaters as a way to prolong outdoor dining, and others are promoting air purification mechanisms such as UV lighting as a way to build consumer trust for indoor dining. The ingenuity of restaurant operators has checked the permanent closure rate at a low level. And we've even begun to hear about some well run and well capitalized operators looking for opportunities to open new restaurants as the external environment improves. Let's now go to Slide 5, and take a look at our own volume performance across different customer types. Throughout the third quarter and into the early part of the fourth quarter, we have seen a steady improvement in case volume across most of our customer types. The green line on the chart shows total restaurant case volumes, including both independent and chain restaurants. The uptick you see in the month of August and September is both a result of an improvement in the industry as well as US Foods gaining share. Organic restaurant case volume for the week ending October 24th was down just under 10% compared to prior year, which was remarkable given that we were down almost 60% at the beginning of the pandemic.  When we compare independents to chain over the last few weeks, organic independent case volume has been down approximately 11% to 12% year-on-year, while organic chain case volume has been down approximately 7% to 8% year-on-year.  Moving to other customer types, our case volume with both healthcare and hospitality has also improved. Healthcare designated by the blue line has picked up as hospitals have started allowing visitors to return in a limited fashion. Hospitality designated by the yellow line has also picked up, as hotel occupancy rates have improved, especially in some geographies and formats, as leisure travelers have substituted one kind of travel for another. Last quarter, I commented on the $500 million of new business we had won in the first half of this year. This business is now fully on-boarded, and I'm happy to report that on an annual run rate basis, we are on pace to on-board a total of over $800 million of new business by the end of this calendar year. Several of the new wins since we last spoke, are in the healthcare arena, demonstrating the strength of our new business pipeline across the multiple different customer types. The pipeline remains strong. And as we look ahead to next year, we expect to continue to gain market share. And as we have previously discussed, the new business win across these multiple customer types, had good contribution margins, helping us grow overall profitability. Let's move to Slide 6 and a discussion of the factors that have led to these market share gains. As we see it, US Foods has 4 distinct advantages over many competitors. The first is our scale and our scope. Our national footprint and consistent approach to servicing multi-geography customers are particular appeal to large customers who are looking for a stable distribution partner like US Foods.  Second is our digital leadership. Our e-commerce offering has been particularly important during these times as customers are able to shop our extensive product offering and place orders online.  Third, is our suite of value-added services or CHECK Business Tools. One of our more popular value-added services has been ChowNow, a platform that allows customers to do takeout and delivery with much more favorable economics than competing services. Since the pandemic began, the number of customers using ChowNow has increased 50%. Now not only does this drive more loyalty to US Foods, but we have seen that customers who use ChowNow are buying more, approximately 80% more than customers are not using that platform, which also confirms how much off-premise dining has grown in importance. A new addition to our portfolio of value-added services is our Ghost Kitchen playbook, supported by proprietary analytics, and this has helped customers mitigate the impact of COVID by extending their off-premise reach, both geographically and into new menu concepts that are particularly suited for delivery. And the fourth advantage is our growing portfolio of innovative products. In September, we launched our Fall Scoop, focused on off-premise dining. The launch featured new items such as Tamper-Evident containers, cleaning and sanitizing products and individually packaged ingredients that allow restaurants to create home meal kits. Response to this food launch was just terrific, and customer penetration was comparable to rates that we used to see pre-COVID. Last week, we launched our Holiday Scoop, which features more new items, many in keeping with current customer needs, including the only EPA-registered 2-in-1 sanitizer that is effective against the virus that causes COVID-19, thereby helping operators keep their environment safe and building trust with diners. This Holiday Scoop also features items for off-premise dining with solutions that are perfect for family meals, including several sustainable items to add to an already strong line of products that serve the platform. These differentiated products and solutions are a great example of how we continue to be the leading and most relevant distributor to operators. Lastly, on Page 7, I want to provide an update on our 2 recent acquisitions. As we discussed last quarter, the Food Group's national chain business continues to perform well, benefiting from some of the recent favorable QSR trends we have seen play out in the industry. On the integration front, systems conversion required to enable some of the expected synergies are also progressing well. In August, we completed the first systems conversion in the Seattle market, and that went without a hitch. Over this past weekend, we completed our second systems conversion and early signs point to another successful conversion. As a result, we have made up most of the temporary pause due to COVID, and we are on pace to achieve the previously communicated $65 million of annual run rate synergies on the original time line, of which we expect to realize $10 million of those synergies this year in 2020. Moving to Smart Foodservice, case volumes continue to outperform our delivered business, with comps down in the low to mid-single-digits over prior year. The cash and carry business typically performs well in economic downturns as customers look to the value offering it provides. The Smart Foodservice stores are also open to the public, and this has allowed us to capture some of the shift to food-at-home over the last several months without changing our business model. Adjusted EBITDA remains on pace with our expectations, and we expect to achieve the synergy target that we have previously discussed. Lastly, I'm pleased to announce the opening of 2 new Smart Foodservice stores in the fourth quarter of this year. This is just the beginning of our store expansion plan, with the ultimate goal to double the existing store count. I'll now turn it over to Dirk for a discussion of our third quarter financial results. You talk about the $180 million in cost reductions, John? Yes. So the -- primarily -- and Dirk can add more on this, the focus has been primarily on the back office. We did make some small reductions in the sales force as you know, John, back in April, aligning the size of sales force with the expected customer count over the long-term. And so we -- and as a result, as you can see by the market share gains and by the success we've had in terms of bringing on large customers, the reductions we've made have not impacted us. We've learned to operate in a kind of more lean, more agile fashion as a result of COVID. And as Dirk said, we think that over the long -- mid to long-term, that also presents -- will result in a higher EBITDA margin. Dirk, anything you want to add? The only minor point I would add, Kelly, is that the performance we've seen with Smart Foodservice in terms of the low to mid-single-digit comps -- negative comps is very much in line with our 6 CHEF'STORE in a different part of the country. So it just goes to reaffirm the resilience of this channel and the appeal of this channel, especially in these kind of more challenging economic times. It's Pietro. So in terms of the pattern, I mean, you could see the -- from -- after which pages -- it's been a slow and steady increase throughout the fall, the increase has slowed a little bit from where it was this summer, not surprisingly. But it's a slow and steady increase kind of versus where we were the week before, the week before that. In terms of the possible headwinds we might head into that you mentioned, I mean, the thing I would also ask you think about is the offsetting positive tailwinds. So let's walk through, I think, the things you mentioned. So the number of increasing COVID cases, one of the things we did do is, there was -- what was characterized as a second wave in the Sun Belt this summer, and what we did is we looked at the sales in those states, primarily Georgia, Florida, Arizona, Texas, and what we found was there was a bit of a step back for a little bit of time. But then what we found is sales bounced back, and they recovered at a higher level than they were before that second wave. So the long-term trend or mid-term trend continues to go up and just kind of overcome the COVID cases. So yes, so people might -- consumers might go on the sidelines for some period of time, but then they come back and they come back in even greater numbers than they were pre that spike. So I think that's encouraging. I think in terms of colder climate, I talked about that a little bit in my comments. In some parts of the country, obviously, there's not as much outdoor dining that can happen. But I think the wildcard is the continued growing importance of off-premise dining, whether it's takeout or delivery. And there's a number of things restaurants are doing to both make diners feel more comfortable about indoor dining and as well trying to prolong the outdoor season. In terms of restrictions, you're right, there's a couple of places in the last week that have put restrictions in place. There's still also places in the country that have restrictions in place that haven't come off like California. So I think those might have offset across the portfolio of geographies. So what I would say is short-term, there may be as many positive tailwinds as some of the headwinds that you described. And I think medium to long-term, the trajectory continues to remain positive. Yes. So as I tried to allude to in my comments, the margins for the new business that we have brought in are very healthy, for large customers are obviously lower than independents or small customers. But there -- if you look at that spectrum of large customers that come in, in the upper quartiles of the margin profile of the large customers that we historically had in our portfolio. So we've been very judicious in terms of the rate at which we bring on those customers. I think the factors that are driving the interest of customers to make a different decision about who to partner with, that's probably more to do with some of the advantages I talked about. The scale, the stability we provide, some of the value-added, especially some of those smaller multi-unit local customers, those value-added still make a big difference. And I think that's really what is driving those profitable market share gains. Yes. And then in terms of some of the other things you've said, are they on or off the table, John. I presume you're referring to a couple of things. One is, move to multi-site area. And you'll remember, we moved to that management model in 2015. We're very happy with it. We think it served us well. Most areas have a presence that overlooks 2 markets, we think that's the right number, and we aligned our region structure at that time to be consistent with that span. So we think we did that work a number of years ago, and we're happy with the results of that work in terms of our operating model. Right. So thanks for that reminder. The team-based selling approach is, again, one we put in place many years ago. As you know, we modified our approach to compensation slightly a couple of years ago. So again, those are changes that we made, have already made, and we want to make sure that they settle. The only thing that has been pretty different in this environment compared to where we were before is the ability of, in particular, our restaurant operations consultants, right? We have specialists who are focused on product, and then we are -- we have experts or specialists, we call them ROCs, restaurant operation consultants, who are focused on the back office of the restaurant, and we've been able to really increase their reach through the webinars and through virtual technology. So what we've been able to do is, as opposed to have one ROC or a couple of ROCs in the market try to learn everything about, especially with respect to the reopening blueprint or with respect to back in March or April, how to best apply for the government support, we were able to specialize and give people a much broader reach, which results in a better customer experience with customers. I suspect some of that will persist, John. You're able to kind of expand the reach and provide a better experience for the customers. So when it comes to more of the product specialists, which is more hands on, I don't expect a lot of change on that front. So what I would say, Laura, is some of the gains, as I said, have come from market share gains and market share is -- we've recently been able to try to triangulate around that. There's not great data on that. We're starting to get better data. Of course, some customers, especially those where there's -- remained to be indoor restrictions, had same-store sales fall, but some have compensated, as I've said, through off-premise dining and throughout the dining, of course, the summer and the colder climates. So it's really -- there's a number of different factors, and I think it would be hard to generalize. I don't know that we have all the data, and I think it would be hard to generalize to -- specifically with respect to your question. So I think over time, so the next 2 to 4 months, I don't know if anyone -- as Ed was implying that the current environment may improve, may very well deteriorate, it depends on different parts of the country. And as I said, there are just as many potential positive forces as headwinds with respect to the near-term environment. I think what I would focus on is more of the medium to long-term environment, Laura, where we think that consumers -- if there are some consumers who are obviously perhaps staying on the sidelines, who perhaps haven't replaced other dining out occasions with off-premise, that over time, especially once there's a vaccine in place, I think that those consumer habits go back to where they were. And what we're really encouraged by is just the steady -- the slow and steady increase in organic performance despite the second wave, despite some of the other things. We're just seeing -- what's really encouraging over the medium to long-term is the slow and steady increase in organic performance amongst new tenants. I don't know that we're able to quantify that, alright, but I think you do raise a point. That's another example of where some of the more urban markets have been hit hard, but we've seen the offsetting shift to some areas. And again, when you cover the country like we do, it's like a very well-diversified portfolio of stock, a bunch of puts and takes and we're making sure our local leaders to make sure they shift appropriately, whether it's to different menu types that are more resilient, or different sub-geographies that are experiencing growth. Do you mind repeating that one more time, please? Sure. So at this point, we haven't quantified specifically, what I would say, though, is because there's also some shifts, as you're well aware, with current changes in volumes. So for example, hospitality being lower. But what we expect is when you look at the core business and the customers over time, we wouldn't expect that to shift meaningfully from where we had been historically. You end up with hospitality being a little bit less than the spend historically just because of the -- it is recovering, but taking a little bit longer to recover than otherwise. But as you think about the business recovering over the long-term, I would think about the mix similar to where it's been."

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Melissa Napier. Thank you. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nMelissa Napier: Thank you, Vincent, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. Joining me on today's call are Pietro Satriano, our CEO; and Dirk Locascio, our CFO. Pietro and Dirk will provide an update on our results for the second quarter and the first 6 months of fiscal 2020. We'll take your questions after our prepared remarks conclude. [Operator Instructions].  During today's call and unless otherwise stated, we're comparing our second quarter results to the same period in fiscal year 2019. Our earnings release issued earlier this morning, and today's presentation slides can be accessed on the Investor Relations page of our website. Also during today's call, references to organic financial results exclude contributions from the Food Group, which we acquired in September of 2019; and from Smart Foodservice, which we acquired in April of 2020.  In addition to historical information, certain statements made during today's call are considered forward-looking statements. Please review the risk factors in our 2019 Form 10-K and last quarter's 10-Q filed with the SEC for these potential factors, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in those statements.  And lastly, during today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. All reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the schedules on our earnings press release as well as in the appendices to the presentation slides posted on our website.  Pietro, I'll now turn the call over to you to get us started.\nPietro Satriano: Thanks, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. COVID-19 continues to have a significant impact on our industry and our company. And as I did last time, I want to begin by thanking all our associates for the exemplary fashion in which they have continued to help our customers make it, especially amidst this challenging environment.  There are 3 topics we will cover today: the industry, our position in the industry and second quarter results. As summarized on Page 2, here are the main takeaways for today. First, a perspective on the industry. We believe that despite the impact of COVID-19, the prospects for our industry remained very good. Based on what we saw in the markets that we opened earlier, we believe volumes will ultimately recover close to pre-COVID levels, and both gross profit and operating costs are trending in a way that all bodes well for a return to profitability close to pre-COVID levels.  Second, a reminder of our advantaged position. Our nationwide scale and differentiated value proposition remain as relevant as ever, providing customers with the innovative products, technology and business tools, as well as the expert support needed to navigate this uncertain environment.  And third, a recap of the quarter. Given the environment, I would characterize our performance for the quarter as solid and promising, with margins and profitability improving sequentially throughout the quarter. In addition, we continue to make good progress in reducing our cost structure to be in line with current volumes, and lastly, our focus on collections result in reversing a significant part of the uncollectible account reserve we took at the end of the first quarter.  Let's now take a deeper dive on the industry and move to Slide 4. Here, we show recent volume trends for sales to restaurants for both the industry and for US Foods and why we are optimistic about an eventual recovery. On the left-hand side, you can see NPD data on transactions at restaurants. This is a good proxy for restaurant sales. As you can see, transactions recovered quickly from their low in March. And by June, transactions were about 15% lower than a year ago, which is where the industry has since leveled off. However, it is important to note that the industry is still far from fully reopened. According to NPD, only 78% of restaurants are in geographies that permit on-premise dining. And even when permitted to reopen dining rooms, capacity is at a fraction of what it could be. This recovery illustrates that consumers want to get back to eating from restaurants, and this bodes well for restaurant demand post-COVID.  The question does remain despite a robust recovery during the quarter, will the restaurant industry continue its recovery. Here, we turn to our own sales to independent restaurants, a key determinant of the health of the restaurant industry. On the right-hand side, we have grouped our roughly 60 markets and 2 cohorts organized by date of reopening or restriction lifting. At the end of June, our sales to independent restaurants in markets that opened the earliest, shown by the green line, were only off 10% to 12% versus prior year, and this is packed despite the fact that restaurants still had seating restrictions in many areas. This compares to markets in later phases, shown in blue and red, whose variance to prior year was greater anywhere from 20% to 30% at the end of June. Again, this shows us that once consumers feel safe, they will return to restaurants, and it's what gives us the confidence that when markets do fully reopen, we will see a recovery in volume close to pre-COVID levels.  Lastly, in both industry and our own trends, we have seen QSR chains recover to a greater degree than full service restaurants. The QSR model is more oriented to office consumption that is favored in the current environment. Having said that, full service restaurants, which includes many independents, have shown a remarkable ability to adapt. A year ago, only 19% of full-service traffic was for off-premise consumption. In June, even though dining rooms were reopening in many parts of the country, 55% of traffic was off-premise. Not only does this highlight the resiliency of restaurants, it also shows that consumers still very much want the many diversity that full-service restaurants offer.  Let's now go to Page 5 to cover our volume across all customer types. Continuing with sales to restaurants, which includes independents and chains on this chart and as shown by the yellow line, you can see that this line very much follows the pattern we saw for the industry data on the prior page but at a slightly lower level. This is because we are slightly underweighted with QSR. Given how well chains and QSR have held up in the current environment, we have put some additional focus on targeting those customer types and we've had good success so far. In the second and third quarter of this year, we are onboarding over $500 million of new business, several times the amount of similar business that we onboarded in the same time period last year. This business is at a good contribution margin. Our success demonstrates 2 things: first, a desire by many multi geography customers to put their trust in large-scale distributors like US Foods; and secondly, our own ability to quickly pivot to a segment experiencing more favorable tailwinds.  Let's now go to health care, which is represented by the orange line, and which shows that volume has partially recovered as the pace of elective surgeries have picked up through the middle of the quarter and stay-at-home restrictions began to ease. We believe with absolute certainty that this segment will ultimately recover to pre-COVID levels as health care facilities return to a more normal operations in the future. Hospitality, which for us is the smaller between health care and hospitality in our portfolio, is showing a modest recovery, thanks to summer travel. We expect this part of our industry will take longer to recover to pre-COVID levels as consumers potentially travel less and businesses place greater reliance on virtual work.  Some of the decreases in health care, hospitality and education have been made up by an added emphasis on retail, where a few significant large partnerships have led to meaningful volume. As mentioned in previous calls, while these volumes may not be as margin accretive as some of the lost volume, they do operate at a very low cost to serve and do provide some baseloading for underutilized facilities. This is yet another example of our ability to pivot to those customers with more favorable tailwinds. In fact, overall volume in July when we exclude hospitality and schools, 2 segments that were the hardest hit, was down 13% on prior year.  Our longer-term prospects for a return to pre-COVID profitability depend not only on volume, which we just discussed, but on gross profit and operating margin. And I'm now on Page 6. Category margins at the customer levels have held fairly constant, which all goes well for margins for volumes as volumes recover over time. Similarly, on the operating expense side, variable costs, which for us account for about half our operating costs have come down proportionally with volume, except for a slight lag. And as Dirk will discuss, we have adjusted our fixed costs to be more in line with reduced volumes. These trends in gross profit and operating margins, along with the promising signs of the volume recovery we saw in the early markets and our added emphasis on segments with more favorable tailwinds, are what leave us confident that we will ultimately recover close to prior levels of volume and profitability.  Moving to Page 7 and the second theme of our presentation today, a reminder of our advantaged position. As we have said in the past, part of what makes US Foods attractive is our nationwide scale and our differentiated value proposition. We expect these factors to continue to drive future market share gains. I want to spend a minute reminding us of these advantages and how we are evolving our strategy for the current environment.  Our nationwide footprint and our scale gave us multiple advantages over the myriad of regional and local competitors. Our scale gives us significant purchasing power, which results in better gross profit margins, and our footprint and operating model gives us the ability to serve multi-geography customers in a way that is difficult for most competitors to match. And with the uncertainty created by the current environment, we can offer stability and consistency to these multi-geography customers. The fact that we are currently onboarding more chain business at the same time last year is evidence of this.  We also continue to evolve our differentiated platform to ensure we continue to be seen as a leader in terms of innovative products, tools and technology and expert resources. First, let's talk about our exclusive innovative products. Keeping up with trends is seen by operators as no less important in the post-COVID world, with 82% of operators in a recent Dataessential survey staying as equally or even more important to remain on trend. Our September Scoop, which is about to launch, is already expected in helping operators with today's needs, with a particular focus on takeout and delivery, sanitation and labor-saving products.  Second, our tools and technology, especially those that enable restaurants to offer off-premise dining, continue to be in high demand. In just the last 3 months, we have doubled the number of customers who utilize the ChowNow platform for takeout and delivery.  And third, team-based selling. Our army of specialists and restaurant operations consultants that support our salespeople continue to offer webinars and consultations that are very well received by restaurant operators. Since COVID began, our restaurant operation consultants have conducted roughly 125 webinars with over 20,000 customers and prospects attending virtually.  In sum, our scale gives us an advantaged position, which is further reinforced by our differentiated platform, which continues to evolve to ensure we remain leaders in our industry.  I will now turn the call over to Dirk for the third theme of today: our second quarter results.\nDirk Locascio: Thank you, Pietro, and good morning, everyone. Business closures and the actions to promote social distancing due to COVID significantly impact our industry and business in the quarter, as Pietro noted. The highly unusual quarter also met some fairly different results even across the 3 months, with April seeing large negative impacts as COVID set in and May and June improving significantly.  As you heard Pietro also talk about, we, like the industry, experienced a significant improvement in our volume and results as the quarter progressed. Total case volumes have improved from the trough of down more than 50% overall to down 20% to 25% in more recent weeks. Independent restaurants followed a very similar trajectory. We believe the case volume decline we experienced in late March and April represented the bottom, and we experienced sequential week-to-week improvement in case volume trends throughout the end of the quarter, as you saw in the earlier chart.  As case volume trends improved, so did our volume -- our financial results with positive adjusted EBITDA dollars in both May and June. The rapid decline in case volume at the end of March and early April, especially in restaurants and hospitality, impacted our typical gross margin and operating expense structures, which I will talk more about in more detail on the next slide.  We took swift action in the quarter to address both areas of the P&L and believe we are well positioned compared to just a few months ago. I'm happy to report that strong collection efforts from our credit and sales teams resulted in us being able to reverse almost half or $75 million of the reserve for uncollectible accounts that we discussed on our last quarterly call. The additional COVID AR reserve now sits at $95 million, and we're actively working on collecting the remaining pre-COVID balances to further reduce this reserve.  In addition to supporting our existing customers, we're focused on growth with new customers. As you heard Pietro mentioned, we signed an annual run rate of over $500 million in new business, with most of it being national chain restaurant business. And a good portion of this focus in the QSR area, which, as you know, has been performing better in this environment. We said some of this business has already started shipping in the second quarter and other customers are slated to begin shipping in the third quarter. We will continue to pursue new business that makes sense from a profitability and geographic perspective.  Moving to Slide 10. Our net sales were down 29% for the quarter, driven by the lower case volume discussed earlier. Inflation for the quarter was 190 basis points with beef as the largest driver. Our GAAP gross profit dollar declined 41%, and GAAP gross margin was 14.7% for the second quarter. Our adjusted gross profit dollars declined 37%, and our adjusted gross margin was 16% for the quarter.  Gross profit was negatively impacted by several factors that we believe to be temporary. The rapid decline in case volume caused a higher level of inventory write-offs and product donations as well as lower logistics income. We also experienced a negative impact on gross margin as a result of changes to customer mix, including lower independent restaurants and hospitality and more retail and chain.  Our adjusted gross margin was down 190 basis points versus the prior year, with April contributing most significantly to the decrease. As we look at May and June, the decrease was about 100 basis points, with roughly 40 basis points of the decrease coming from the combination of adding the acquisitions into our base and the impact of year-over-year product inflation on sales. The remaining impact was split between inefficiencies in our logistics network from buying in smaller quantities and customer and associated product mix shifts. As Pietro said, customer margins have remained similar to pre-COVID levels, and we're seeing a rational competitive environment. As case volume recovers, we expect our mix and logistics income will also recover, leading to an overall recovery in gross margin to near pre-COVID levels.  On operating expenses, we were able to successfully manage our fixed and variable cost structure to be relatively in line with lower case volumes. In fact, across May and June, adjusted OpEx as a percent of sales was in line with the prior year, including the roughly 40 basis point benefit from adding the acquisitions into our base and the impact of year-over-year product inflation on sales. Thus, the Q2 OpEx basis point increase was due to April.  We actively managed variable labor and, in fact, saw warehouse and delivery productivity levels that were meaningfully better than pre-COVID levels. We also took actions during the quarter to address fixed costs through employee furloughs across the business, reductions in discretionary costs and salary reductions. As case volume rebounded, we did add back some fixed costs to match the volume recovery we were seeing. Our cost structure remains flexible, and we're continuing to actively managing costs, targeting to be largely in line with case volumes. This positions us well to manage through this challenging environment.  Moving to Page 11. I was very pleased with our team's ability to navigate a difficult operating environment and generate positive adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. After a difficult April, where we saw negative adjusted EBITDA dollars, the business produced positive adjusted EBITDA dollars in both May and June, with June being the strongest of the quarter as we would expect to continue to see positive EBITDA in the current environment. We believe our margin structure will return close to pre-COVID levels in time, supporting a further recovery in our mid- to long-term earnings power.  Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $88 million, and year-to-date adjusted EBITDA was $265 million. Second quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share was a loss of $0.25, and year-to-date was a loss of $010. As a result of the preferred equity investment that we discussed earlier in the second quarter, our earnings per share calculations are now based on net income or loss available to common shareholders. This new line in the P&L factors in the $5 million preferred dividend for the second quarter. In the second quarter, GAAP net income available to common shareholders was a loss of $97 million for the quarter and a loss of $229 million on a year-to-date basis.  Adjusted net income available to common shareholders was a loss of $54 million for the quarter and a loss of $22 million on a year-to-date basis. I'll note since we're in a net loss for the quarter and year-to-date, the total number of diluted shares outstanding does not reflect the recent preferred equity investment. At such time we return to the net income position, those additional shares will be included in the diluted share count and factor into our adjusted diluted EPS calculation.  I'm now on Page 12. Food Group and Smart Foodservice businesses both performed in line with our expectations given the current operating environment. Our Food Group business saw a trend that were very similar to organic business in the quarter. While a number of markets in the Northwest have been slower to reopen, Food Group markets also have a higher mix of national chain restaurants in the base, and volumes with that chain business have continued to perform well.  We've also resumed integration activities, beginning with the facility near Seattle that was first on our original integration time line. We will complete this first warehouse conversion later in August and still expect a $65 million in run rate synergies that we previously communicated. However, the ramp-up may be longer as a result of reduced volume.  The Smart Foodservice business help up very well in the quarter with same-store sales down only single digits from the prior year. This is due to 2 reasons: first and primarily, the cash and carry business model typically performs well in economic downturns as customers turn to the value offering it provides; and secondly, the cash and carry channel has allowed us to capture some of the spend that is temporarily shifted to food at home. In addition, you may recall, this channel is attractive across economic environments due to its higher profit margins and because of the incremental business we can drive from our existing delivered customers, which allows us to profitably consolidate our share of wallet with those customers. And lastly, all of the Smart Foodservice stores remained open through the quarter, and the EBITDA help up extremely well despite the challenging external environment.  With respect to our plans for this business, we still expect to double the store counts, and we still anticipate limited integration activities. In total, the acquisitions contributed approximately 17% of our case volume and approximately 23% of our adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter due primarily to Smartfood services EBITDA being closer to prior year. Turning to Page 13, I would like to spend a few minutes discussing our current liquidity position. Recall that during the second quarter, we completed a series of financing activities to fund the Smart Foodservice acquisition and further strengthen our overall liquidity. As a result of these actions, we're in a very strong cash and total liquidity position. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.7 billion of cash on hand and total liquidity of approximately $3 billion.  During the second quarter, the business was operating cash flow positive primarily but not solely from working capital benefits. In the second half of the year, we do expect some of this benefit to reverse as vendor payments return to a more normal schedule and we rebuild inventory levels to support our customers. Factoring out the working capital reversal I just noted, I would expect our operating cash flow to be positive in the second half of the year.  Our cash and liquidity positions give us an advantage over the smaller distributors in the industry. We are better able to support customer needs and can invest to support faster growth. We are focused on winning new business through organic market share gains and helping our existing customers navigate this difficult operating environments.  Operator, with that, we can open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. First question comes from the line of Chris Mandeville from Jefferies.\nChristopher Mandeville: Nice quarter. Pietro, can I ask, maybe is there a way whereby you could characterize your ability to take share with independents right now? And then separately, as it relates to that $500 million in new chain business that you're onboarding over the next quarter or two, can you comment on just the level of profitability that you're seeing with those contractus to maybe what you would have otherwise observed 6 to 9 months ago?\nPietro Satriano: Sure. So let's start with the -- your question on independents. Look, I think going back to my second theme around our differentiated value proposition, what we're seeing is that it's as relevant as ever. As long as you meet the, what I would call the, table stakes that customers require in terms of service, the work we have done in terms of evolving our support resources for independent restaurants in terms of helping them navigate these challenging times, I've mentioned 100 webinars have done -- we've done, I think those, for sure over the longer term, will serve us well in terms of in kind of goodwill and equity to gain share.  In the short term, it's a little bit harder to quantiy and to assess. Customer mix becomes a little bit more of a driver in the short term. So as an example, pizza restaurants have done relatively well in the current environment. We're not as heavily weighted in those -- in that segment across the country, and so I would say that the things we have done in the past and we continue to do are what's going to drive market share gains over the future.  In terms of book of business, we've been able to bring on that Dirk and I referred to. The margins are good. Look, I think the -- here's about what I would say, the reason those customers are switching isn't because we are awarding the business at very low margin. That's because, again, our scale and our operating model give these customers the confidence that we will be around for the long term. And as I've said before, prices tend to find their equilibrium in the large kind of big business. We have seen over the last few years, and I think I've mentioned this, margins slowly creep up in that larger multi-geography business.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.\nJohn Ivankoe: First a question on competitive market and then a question on fixed costs. At least on the news, there has been some discussion of a Maine's bankruptcy. And on the other hand, I think it was Cheney Brothers that received some private equity capital. So that's what, I guess, I've read about. I mean could you make some comments even if you don't want to use names just kind of the capitalization of the overall foodservice distributor industry and their ability to kind of recover their own working capital needs as the customers recover? I mean I know you made a comment that you're seeing rational new competition. But are you beginning to see some signs that you actually may have some competitors go away or perhaps consolidate? This is the first question.  And secondly, there were some comments made around fixed cost reductions. I think those were specific to the second quarter around furloughs, and I guess, which had also been in the first quarter as well. How do you identify at any cost on a fixed cost side that could actually be permanent that won't necessarily come back as volumes come back?\nPietro Satriano: Okay. I'll take the first and let Dirk talk to the second. So there has been -- there's about half a dozen names, John, in terms of competitors, regional and smaller, that are experiencing some degree of stress. It's hard to know exactly how stressed these competitors are, and most at this point seem to be hanging on. We don't -- they're all private companies so it's hard to know exactly the degree to know how they're well capitalized. We gave a couple of examples, one that had infusion and one that went through bankruptcy proceedings. Our intent is where we know that those opportunities exist is to really position ourselves favorably with the customers that they serve. That's the most accretive way to gain share, which is to take advantage of those situations. And the more uncertainty, the more of a roller coaster there is in the short term. Like I said, the prospects for the industry longer term are good, but the more uncertainty there is in the short term, then I think the more that will present other opportunities of that nature. Dirk?\nDirk Locascio: Sure. John, so we've -- as you noted, a lot of the cost reductions and cost actions that we've taken to date have been more temporary, and a lot of that is also as we find our way through and see what the recovery looks like and the industry looks like as we work through there. What I would say is, to date, though, we have used some combination of permanent and temporary reductions and continue to use both of these as we ensure our cost structure right size for our business and just we'll continue to evaluate. But like I said, the bulk today have been temporary. But as I said earlier, aligning our costs with our volumes going forward is important, and we'll continue to be very flexible in order to do that.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo.\nEdward Kelly: I wanted to ask you, Pietro, about the independent customers. First, it looks like in your slides, I guess, that the trends that your independent customers have maybe stepped back a bit recently with reopening issues. Total case growth , I don't think has so -- is that just new business offsetting that? And then what I really wanted to ask you is, can you tell us what percentage of your pre-COVID customer base is currently ordering product? Just to kind of get a sense as to how many of these guys are still open for business to give us a sense as to how much damage there has been done to date. And then how critical do you think PPP is, another round here, by the way, to the mix of your customer base remaining stable and good on the other side of all this?\nPietro Satriano: Okay. I'll try to remember all your questions. Ed, if I miss one, just remind me. So you're right. If you look at the right-hand side of Page 4 and even the left-hand side, which is a good proxy for the industry, the growth has slowed and, in some cases, may have stepped back a little bit. And that's really a function of, I think, as cases have spiked in the numbers of parts of the country, governments have gone backwards in terms of the phase of reopening or consumers are treading a little bit more cautiously or staying a little bit on the sidelines.  I think the broader point I was trying to make with respect to the restaurant sector is that consumers clearly have -- I think if we had talked a few months ago, we wondered whether consumers were, in fact, going to go back to eat out or to buy from restaurants and bring the food home, and I think we've clearly seen that. There isn't a secular movement to people now cooking at home a lot more than they did before, and I think that's what we think is promising. So the consumer will drive the recovery, which then gets to, I think, another part of your question which is the health of the independents.  So our customer count is, I think, roughly in line with what was pre-COVID. So we've had some new business because there's always some natural level of churn in the industry. And obviously, a lot of the restaurants, even with the off-premise sales, are doing or operating at lower levels of sales than prior year, which is why we're not quite back to prior year levels. The count is in line when you look at seasonally adjusted to last year. There are a number of restaurants who are closed. It's actually hard to tell whether they're permanently closed or temporarily close, some of them don't know. When I talk to our field leaders and ask them, they believe that the number of permanent closures today, at this point, is still in the low single digits. And so that's the consumer. That's the -- a little bit on the independents. And the third part of your question, Ed, remind me.\nEdward Kelly: It was on PPP and another round and that is to your customers.\nPietro Satriano: Yes. Yes. So clearly, so PPP, the first time around was a little bit and perfectly designed, but still a benefit to the industry. And we've tried to get a sense of what percent of our customers have benefited from PPP and the new flexible version. It's pretty high. And obviously, it's a benefit. And there's an added benefit that it provides stimulus to the economy, which drives spending. So I think to the degree that there is some form of stimulus, whether directly aimed at small business or restaurants or to the consumer, I think that will help us get through the next few months as we await for either to get better control of the virus as a country or a vaccine, which is, I think, when things really return back to pre-COVID levels.\nEdward Kelly: Okay. Can I just squeeze one more in for Dirk because I just struggle a little bit with this one? But from a cost perspective, you guys did an amazing job of getting costs down. Now you said something on the call around, I think costs sort of as a percentage of sales and maybe May and June were flattish. Have I heard that correctly? Which is kind of surprising, I guess, for your business, given the variable cost component. So maybe just help us understand that a little bit more. And then Dirk, how do we think about SG&A, maybe, I guess, year-over-year growth is the best way to do it in Q3 versus the 20% decline we saw in Q2?\nDirk Locascio: Sure, Ed. I think that -- so as I said, you did hear correct, May and June was being in line with the prior year. And I think that for us, it was important in all areas of the business, we went after smartly aligning costs with volume, not making irrational decisions. And as I commented that in May and June, we actually saw improved productivity across the supply chain as the team, whether it's less people on roads, kind of more effective ways of us operating within the distribution centers, et cetera. So for us, that's not going to stop. We're going to continue to focus on that as we move ahead.  And then SG&A, so we're going to continue similar actions. I think that when we think ahead, you may not be quite at the level of positive year-over-year that you saw in the second quarter, but we do expect it to be, again, meaningfully lower and trying to align our SG&A much more to, again, the lower volumes. And trying to also be -- continue to be flexible as we see volumes up and down with what our structure needs to be in order to support that. So this is a big focus for us really across all the areas of variable and fixed.\nEdward Kelly: Great, and a nice job in a tough environment, guys.\nPietro Satriano: Thank you, Ed.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania from BMO Capital.\nKelly Bania: I wanted to see if you can just help us out, understanding what kind of EBITDA margin -- you mentioned EBITDA was -- margin was positive in June. Just maybe help us understand kind of what level that is at. And I guess, if sales kind of remain at this level for a while, what's the realistic EBITDA margin into Q3 and Q4 at the current run rate?\nDirk Locascio: Sure. Kelly, this is Dirk. When we think, as I said, going from negative EBITDA to improvement in May and then further in June, very pleased with the performance on that. And at this point, I'm going to stay away from a number or a margin, and it's not to be cute or evasive, but I think we all know that the environment continues to change almost day by day. What I will say though is if the environment stays at current levels, we would expect meaningful EBITDA in the back half of the year. So the thing I just want to be clear is, meaning not just scraping by with positive, and we're going to continue to focus on the levers and the actions that we do around servicing our customers and then around really optimizing our gross margin, our OpEx as we go to the back half of the year.\nKelly Bania: Perfect. And in terms of, I think, market share, I think people are trying to just get a sense of how market share is within your various customer segments. So just curious if you could talk a little bit about drop size by customer and just to kind of really think about how much is happening at the unit level versus kind of the aggregate level. I don't know if there's any color you can add there.\nPietro Satriano: Kelly, it's Pietro. I'm not sure there's a lot of color we can add, and you can probably draw some of your own conclusions, right? So sales are a little bit behind where they were last year. It varies by geography, no surprise. Customer accounts are in line with where we were last year. We continue to push for new business because, obviously, if customers are operating at a lower level of business, which they are today, then obviously, bringing on new customers helps make up for that. And as Dirk said, we've really worked well in terms of our distribution costs to ensure that those have come down in line. So whether optimizing the routing or the delivery for current -- today's current reality, it's also helping maintain profitability where it is.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Partners.\nJohn Heinbockel: So Pietro, two things. On the cost control front, have you done anything that might be more strategic either in the warehouses or in the routing approach, right? That's not just tweaking, but you took this opportunity to do something more substantial that then lives on after a recovery, right, that makes the whole network a lot more productive and low cost than it had been before. Are there any examples of that?\nPietro Satriano: Yes. So I would say there is an effort underway in the company that we're calling -- we imagine, which is really ensuring that both, A, our value proposition to customers continues to evolve, to be relevant; and B, where there are opportunities to become more operationally effective and efficient, we're looking at those. I'd say it's -- so while there have been some benefits, as Dirk described the environment, some of the benefits have come from reengineering, how we do some of the work. And we have a whole pipeline of, I want to call my ideas, of projects underway to do that. Some are in line with the supply chain road map we've shared in the past, some are new. And I think, honestly, John, it would be premature to discuss these on a public forum at this point.\nJohn Heinbockel: Well, then as a follow-up to that. When you think about longer term and recovery to pre-COVID levels, sales versus profitability, you might naturally say sales have to get to a pre-COVID level before profit margins do. How do you think about those two versus each other? And are we thinking about a 2-year process or much longer than that in terms of duration when you kind of put your prognosticating hat on?\nPietro Satriano: So I think in terms of prognosis, on the sales side, it's very hard to say. I mean we continue to be surprised by the increases and decreases in the number of cases, and that's obviously impacting what consumers do. I think in terms of the cost side of things, look, we've learned -- I will say, we've learned a lot about how to operate in this environment. I think we can emerge from this being -- so there's the some obvious cost benefits from the lower volume that we moved on quickly. So you're not recruiting as much, you don't need as many recruiters. We talked earlier about some of the permanent reductions we made in the sales force as a result of potentially being fewer customers to be -- for us to serve. We've looked at a more efficient model to serving chain customers that we adopted from our food group, something they were further ahead on us, and we've now rolled that out to the company. So we -- the last few months have really been about the, what I would call, the more obvious opportunities, and we will continue to look at other opportunities to operate in a leaner and more agile fashion as we've learned to do so in this environment.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Two questions. Just one, as we think about the new business you talked about, presumably, it's I would assume now taking share from smaller distributors. I know you mentioned that you didn't necessarily win the business on price, but you want it more on scale and operating model. So I just wanted to clarify, first and foremost, that I guess you're talking about, I guess, taking share from smaller independent distributors who presumably would otherwise want to retain this business. And just to clarify, it does sound like it's, again, more quick service chain business and therefore, why you didn't reduce the margin meaningfully. This is at a lower margin than presumably your more desired independent business, and then I had a follow-up..\nPietro Satriano: Yes, that's correct. So in terms of the first part of your question the business that we've acquired has been from smaller, more regional, sometimes local, but I would clarify some more as regional distributors. And yes, the margins are for that chain business, whether it's QSR or chain, tend to be a little lower than the independent business. We're still very focused on the independent business. It's one where we have an advantage, where we can make a difference, and we can get back to growth over time. But all we're doing is taking advantage and being opportunistic of opportunities that may not have been around a year ago and putting a little bit of additional focus and emphasis and resources on that business, which, again, from a rate perspective, it may not look as attractive, but we're adding EBITDA dollar dollars to bottom line, and it's attractive enough on the rate perspective that it can withstand the test of time.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Got you. And then I had a question that was common earlier about the EBITDA margins going forward, and it was very encouraging to hear you talk about meaningful EBITDA in the second half, that it wasn't just necessarily just skating by. So just wondering, obviously, with the uncertainty, large, We don't expect formal guidance, but can you share anything about maybe what the -- on a factual basis, what the margin percentage was in June and July. Since it sounds like we're talking about the sales remained at those levels, you'd have meaningful EBITDA on in the back half. Any color on June and July?\nDirk Locascio: Yes. This is Dirk. I'll take that. I think, unfortunately, not a lot more to share. And again, I think it's -- as I said to I think it was Kelly that asked, it's less about being evasive and more just with the environment, continuing to change. I think as we get through the third quarter and see if the environment stays stable or improving, then that will allow us to have a little more insight as to the go forward. But at this point, just continue to come back with the focus and actions we have around both the gross profit and OpEx in order to grow and manage the environment we're in, in order to really optimize the EBITDA the best we can in the environment we're in.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Got you. And just my last question, there was mentioned on last quarterly calls from all the big distributors talking about maybe some grocery store distribution opportunities. Those are relationships you were starting to build during the depth of the crisis, and maybe that could lead to more sustained long-term new accounts servicing food retail. Just wondering how that's progressed, if at all, and if it is kind of a big part of the future, kind of where those potential sales and margins lie?\nPietro Satriano: Great. So this is Pietro again. So the green line on Page 5, which shows the big jump in sales from retail, that comes from a very small number of large grocery retailers, and that's more traditional grocery. And as I said, we were opportunistic about that and provide some good baseline volume for our facilities. It's margin accretive, but it is at the lower end.  The opportunity we talked in more detail, and pre-COVID was around the home meal replacement part of the grocery store that looks more like a restaurant, right? The deli, the sit-down part of some grocery stores. That's where we see a big a opportunity. That's in our sweet spot. Particular opportunity, we believe, is more with smaller, regional players who don't have the scale to do what some of the larger players do. It's a little bit like restaurants, right? The opportunity is more with the smaller independent in terms of making a difference and driving accretive margin. So it's no different on the grocery side. That will take some time. It's a series of business development efforts. We have a couple of markets where we've been extremely well, serving regional grocers in the home meal replacement part of the store, and what we're doing is scaling that playbook across other markets to make some inroads into that business.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Karru Martinson from Jefferies.\nKarru Martinson: Just when we look at the strength in independents and the spike in demand, how much of that is being driven by the expansion of outdoor dining? And how should we think about that as we go into the fall and the winter?\nPietro Satriano: Sure. So some of it, for sure, is driven by off-premise, whether it's outdoor dining or takeout or delivery. All of those are contributing. And it has made up some, but not all of the restrictions on indoor dining.  In terms of the impact of weather, obviously, does not impact takeout or delivery. But again, if you look at different parts of the country, July In Florida and Arizona, there's not a lot of outdoor dining going on, right? So some parts, it's a bit of a portfolio across the country.  But look, I think the other thing I would say is independent restaurants have proved just very creative and very resilient in being able to take advantage of new opportunities. And so I think as we move forward into the winter, barring and nationwide lockdown, which, again, I don't expect, but no one really knows for sure. I will expect for some of that -- a lot of that volume to continue as we go forward.\nKarru Martinson: And then just lastly, you saw a larger regional filed Chapter 11 and going into restructuring. What is the health of those smaller independents out there? Are there acquisition opportunities? Or do you feel that this is just a case of putting the sales resources behind it to take that share from them?\nPietro Satriano: I think it's more of the latter of taking advantage of those opportunities. I think as I said earlier as well, some of the smaller regionals or independents, but some are decent size. Some over time have carried too much leverage, and they're the ones that are stressed. Others have run more conservative. So really, it's really about taking the advantage of the opportunities with -- in terms of serving those customers where uncertainty exists.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh from BTIG.\nPeter Saleh: Great. I just wanted to ask about simplification optimization, if you guys are seeing something like that. We're seeing a lot of that among the larger chains, where they're cutting much of their menu and focus in one , center or the plate. Are you seeing something similar to that at the independent restaurants? And how does that impact your product mix at least in the near term?\nPietro Satriano: Yes, so we're seeing it. I think the larger chains did move more quickly, but I think some of the independents are following suit now based on what I hear talking to the field. I think in terms of us, look, it's a good -- at a time of uncertainty, where you're not sure when you'll be forced to go back in terms of restrictions that will forward -- smart way forward the restaurants to run their business, and it allows us to be more responsive, right? All distributors carry thousands of SKUs in their buildings, and that tail is harder to serve. So to the degree that restaurants simplify their menus, it's good for them in terms of reducing waste, and it's good for us in terms of reducing some supply chain waste in the system.\nPeter Saleh: Great. And then I think you guys alluded to some maybe regional disparities or just some weaknesses as some of the case volumes picked up. Can you guys give us a little bit more color on maybe what you're seeing more recently in some of the larger states as case volumes kind of tick up?\nPietro Satriano: Yes. So I think what I was referring to is the chart on Page 4 where some states opened earlier. We saw more of a recovery, and I think it's as simple as a fact as those states have 1 or 2 weeks longer to recover. If you look at those 3 lines, on Page 4, they all have a fairly similar pattern. It's just some states started earlier and got to closer at prior year levels, and that's across the country. When I look at the market for each of those cohorts, they happen across the country.  I think by way of a general theme, some of the larger urban markets have taken longer to reopen, right, New York, Chicago, L.A., some of those big markets have taken longer. And we're seeing that in our numbers, and those are big markets for us. I think I'd mentioned on the last call, and I think we're still seeing this -- some of the more rural or suburban markets have recovered more quickly. But I think back to my first point, it really is eventually just a matter of time before all markets kind of return to close to pre-COVID levels.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Rebecca Scheuneman from Morningstar.\nRebecca Scheuneman: So you talked about how with some of these small independent distributors being stressed that you've been able to win about $500 million in new business -- in new chain business there. Is there also opportunities with these accounts to win some independent business? Or are these stressed distributors primarily focused on chains?\nPietro Satriano: Absolutely. So they vary. Some distributors -- so they typically have a broad range of business. The relative size may vary. But absolutely, we -- what we've done is we've equipped through our CRM platform that fits directly with our sales force on the Street. We directed them where we think the opportunities are. It's just a little harder to say at this point the kind of success we've had because it's one distributor who serves a portion of the market, and customer might come on more slowly, whereas the larger customers tend to come on in a lumpier fashion. So I think it's just too early to say, but absolutely, the opportunities are across independent and larger chains.\nRebecca Scheuneman: Okay. Great. And also, so as we look at permanent restaurant closures, we're kind of thinking that those will be concentrated more in the independent area. Do you think that there could possibly be kind of a permanent industry shift towards more chain business? Or how do you see that playing out?\nPietro Satriano: Look, you're seeing that a little bit today, right? And I think as I mentioned in my comments, the segments or customer types that are more equipped for off-premise dining, like fast casual and QSR, have recovered more quickly because that's where consumers felt safer in this environment. But eventually post vaccine, it's hard to say. I don't know that there's any reason why there's a permanent shift to more of a larger chain concept. The -- some of -- a lot of the -- you've seen the news, right? A lot of these larger chains have closed, and they're not immune from the pressures of this environment. And like I said, the independents are a fairly resilient bunch, they may close, but they may reopen in a different location under a different name. I think post vaccine, I think I'd be hesitant to say that there's a permanent shift.\nRebecca Scheuneman: Okay. Great. My last question, if I could, it may be a little bit early, but I was wondering if you have a sense as to -- if you look at your education segment, like what percentage of those clients have students returning in the fall?\nPietro Satriano: Yes. So the education segment has really been a tricky one. The good news for us is it's a minority -- sorry, the education business falls and the all other, when we've talked about all other, and it's the smallest portion of the all others. So the impact is small for us. And then you have to distinguish between college and university and K-12. College and university, I believe about half of colleges are bringing students back and half or not. With K-12, I think, as all parents on this call know, a lot of those decisions are being made literally as we speak. It's too early to call. What we are doing, again, impact on volume and margin is less material for us. The thing we are very focused on is inventory and making sure that we're in close contact with those customers to make sure that we have an ability to serve them without taking on undue inventory risk.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Bryan Hunt from Wells Fargo.\nBryan Hunt: Great. Just two questions. One, when I look at cash flow, is there any way you can give us an idea of when you go to make collections, the dollar amount or the number of accounts that just aren't responding as well as how fast do you think AP will normalize on a days basis?\nDirk Locascio: Sure. So it's twofold. One. I think when you look at the -- if we take the second one, to the normalization, we would expect to largely happen over the third quarter. I think it's -- but that's shorter in term. And then when you think of the -- can you repeat your first part again, please?\nBryan Hunt: Yes. When you look at the first part, Your collection of bad debt, you all made a big, obviously, reserve in Q1. You reverse part of that in Q2 based on the success of recouping some of that reserves and receivables from customers. When you go to make collections on receivables of that remaining roughly $100 million amount, and I guess $95 million to be exact, how many of that $95 million just aren't responding or have permanently closed?\nDirk Locascio: Thank you. It's actually a relatively small number. So our credit team and our sales team have worked just incredibly closely together for some really good success. And even some of those customers that had -- whether they closed temporarily or operating a limited basis, that they're having a very good communication and openness. So it's actually pretty small. So the bulk of even what's left there has continued to engage with us. And each week, we continue to see that pre-COVID balance go down. And also, those teams are working closely with customers. It's even for the post-COVID balances to make sure we're managing credit well as we go forward.\nBryan Hunt: And then my last question. You talked about excluding hospitality in schools, and granted July is not a big school month, but your case volume was down about 13% in the month of July. How about when you include hospitality in schools, what's the kind of year-over-year change in tempo? And that's it for me. Best of luck\nPietro Satriano: Well, I think if you look kind of the June timing that you would see in there, we've been running at that down 20% to 25% range overall has been pretty consistent in more recent weeks as we ended up the quarter.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Judah Frommer from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nJudah Frommer: Just wanted to follow-up quickly on kind of the EBITDA recovery comments. We do see in the slide that you're talking about return to pre-COVID levels. I did think I heard a couple of times in the comments that we get close to pre-COVID levels. Is that just kind of a timing mismatch until the HR you mentioned, the vaccine. Maybe we're near a COVID level. But then after that, we're at pre-COVID levels. And then kind of beyond that, as things really do normalize, maybe again post vaccine. Can you remind us of drivers of EBITDA margin improvement? Obviously, the Smart Foodservice business is a higher-margin business. You have synergies in the Food Group acquisition. So anything to think of just longer term to show us that we shouldn't be capping you at your pre-COVID margins?\nPietro Satriano: Sure. Maybe I'll start, Dirk. So generally, what we've tried to say is longer term, the prospects for the industry, which were an important part for US Foods, a positive, and I've characterized that as close to pre-COVID. Whether it's exactly pre-COVID or how close to pre-COVID, it's really hard to say at this point. But when you look at the 3 drivers: the volume and the recovery we've seen in the parts of the country that have been the earliest and our success in some segments with favorable tailwinds, our ability to maintain margins when you normalize for these onetime hits in terms of spoilers and donations and our ability to manage our costs, again, all of that together, we think gets us pretty close to pre COVID exactly how close. It's really hard to say at this point. There's too much that's unknown. But really, what we're trying to convey is our confidence that there's a good path to getting to a profit levels close to pre COVID over the eventual long term. And a lot of that is probably determined by a vaccine.\nDirk Locascio: Okay. And then the only thing I would add on top of that to bet your point on the drivers is as we think about coming from all the areas of the P&L like we've talked about in the past, really over time, I think you still do have a lot of taste preference for the variability in that independents offer and to the point of whether the timing of vaccine and when that recovers, but still believe that a lot of those trends will revert. Also really drive -- continuing to drive gross profit gains through the things like private brands, continued sourcing gains, things like that, that we have been, and then on the OpEx side to drive efficiencies and better ways of operating across both SG&A and our supply chain.  So we don't think at all that it's necessarily where we were pre-COVID in the cap. It's a matter of whatever the external environment takes in order to get back to there, what we're going to continue to do is operate the business, continue to grow EBITDA dollars and EBITDA margin, just like we have historically.  And then finally, the point that you made that adds on to both the dollars and the EBITDA margin, the most recent acquisition of Smart Foodservice, where that adds dollars and then expansion opportunity we have there, where we expect that we can more than double the stores and the fact that it's more profitable than in the broadline businesses as we continue to grow that. And then the added benefit we get from further market share from those customers as we grow it. So all in, still significant opportunity on the recovery to grow dollars and margin.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of William Reuter from Bank of America.\nWilliam Reuter: I just have two. The first is you mentioned that SG&A in the next quarter will be down, but not as much as we saw in this quarter. But it sounds like most of the costs that you reduced you said were temporary. So I guess is there some way you can help us understand what percentage of your SG&A we should be thinking about as being fixed versus variable in the back half of the year?\nDirk Locascio: Well, I think the -- let's come back to that. We expect to continue to focus quite a bit on our cost as we have. I think I'll just use maybe an example of something like some of the temporary pay reductions that we put in place, we have to in the second quarter and are not continuing for associates during the third quarter. So it's a matter of, again, continuing to be smart, but at the same time, want to make sure that we're treating our associates fairly as we go through this but also continuing, like Pietro said, looking at other areas of the business where we can drive efficiency and effectiveness that are temporary and more permanent. So I think that and not knowing exactly how the marketplace plays out, which can impact costs, is again why I'm not trying to be vague versus just the fact of just articulating that the positive trajectory we expect to continue if just as hard to estimate the exact levels of the dollars, but positive momentum.\nWilliam Reuter: Okay. And then in terms of the education business, can you provide which percent is colleges versus K-12, just in big brush strokes?\nDirk Locascio: We're pretty well -- we have a split across the spectrum when you look there. So we don't have the specific numbers, but it's pretty meaningful across each of the areas from K-12 and college and university.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Carla Casella from JPMorgan.\nCarla Casella: You commented in your prepared remarks that the reopened customers, you're seeing sales down only about 10%. Do you get a sense if that's the true sell-through? Is there some sort of a pantry loading going on there as well?\nPietro Satriano: So just to clarify, it was customers that had been reopened the longest, the greatest number of weeks, right, that we mind. And it's hard to tell how much -- there's always a little bit of kind of restocking once you're closed, but I think you could see enough of a trend in terms of year-on-year closing the gap that I think in terms of the spare of your question, a lot of the performance we were seeing relative to prior year was truly sustainable sales more than just pantry loading, which occurred in 1 week.\nOperator: There are no further questions. Please continue.\nPietro Satriano: Okay. So maybe I'll say a few words in closing. I want to thank all of you for participating today and for all your questions. I hope the call today leaves you with the 3 takeaways I started with: first, the outlook for industry remains positive post COVID; second, our scale and differentiation present a genuine opportunity market share; and third, the second quarter results both our ability to stay relevant to our customers and to manage our costs in this challenging environment. For all of this, I want to thank our associates who worked tirelessly since the beginning of this crisis. Thank you for tuning in today. Have a good day, and please stay safe.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dirk Locascio",
            "content": "Thank you, Pietro, and good morning, everyone. Business closures and the actions to promote social distancing due to COVID significantly impact our industry and business in the quarter, as Pietro noted. The highly unusual quarter also met some fairly different results even across the 3 months, with April seeing large negative impacts as COVID set in and May and June improving significantly.  As you heard Pietro also talk about, we, like the industry, experienced a significant improvement in our volume and results as the quarter progressed. Total case volumes have improved from the trough of down more than 50% overall to down 20% to 25% in more recent weeks. Independent restaurants followed a very similar trajectory. We believe the case volume decline we experienced in late March and April represented the bottom, and we experienced sequential week-to-week improvement in case volume trends throughout the end of the quarter, as you saw in the earlier chart.  As case volume trends improved, so did our volume -- our financial results with positive adjusted EBITDA dollars in both May and June. The rapid decline in case volume at the end of March and early April, especially in restaurants and hospitality, impacted our typical gross margin and operating expense structures, which I will talk more about in more detail on the next slide.  We took swift action in the quarter to address both areas of the P&L and believe we are well positioned compared to just a few months ago. I'm happy to report that strong collection efforts from our credit and sales teams resulted in us being able to reverse almost half or $75 million of the reserve for uncollectible accounts that we discussed on our last quarterly call. The additional COVID AR reserve now sits at $95 million, and we're actively working on collecting the remaining pre-COVID balances to further reduce this reserve.  In addition to supporting our existing customers, we're focused on growth with new customers. As you heard Pietro mentioned, we signed an annual run rate of over $500 million in new business, with most of it being national chain restaurant business. And a good portion of this focus in the QSR area, which, as you know, has been performing better in this environment. We said some of this business has already started shipping in the second quarter and other customers are slated to begin shipping in the third quarter. We will continue to pursue new business that makes sense from a profitability and geographic perspective.  Moving to Slide 10. Our net sales were down 29% for the quarter, driven by the lower case volume discussed earlier. Inflation for the quarter was 190 basis points with beef as the largest driver. Our GAAP gross profit dollar declined 41%, and GAAP gross margin was 14.7% for the second quarter. Our adjusted gross profit dollars declined 37%, and our adjusted gross margin was 16% for the quarter.  Gross profit was negatively impacted by several factors that we believe to be temporary. The rapid decline in case volume caused a higher level of inventory write-offs and product donations as well as lower logistics income. We also experienced a negative impact on gross margin as a result of changes to customer mix, including lower independent restaurants and hospitality and more retail and chain.  Our adjusted gross margin was down 190 basis points versus the prior year, with April contributing most significantly to the decrease. As we look at May and June, the decrease was about 100 basis points, with roughly 40 basis points of the decrease coming from the combination of adding the acquisitions into our base and the impact of year-over-year product inflation on sales. The remaining impact was split between inefficiencies in our logistics network from buying in smaller quantities and customer and associated product mix shifts. As Pietro said, customer margins have remained similar to pre-COVID levels, and we're seeing a rational competitive environment. As case volume recovers, we expect our mix and logistics income will also recover, leading to an overall recovery in gross margin to near pre-COVID levels.  On operating expenses, we were able to successfully manage our fixed and variable cost structure to be relatively in line with lower case volumes. In fact, across May and June, adjusted OpEx as a percent of sales was in line with the prior year, including the roughly 40 basis point benefit from adding the acquisitions into our base and the impact of year-over-year product inflation on sales. Thus, the Q2 OpEx basis point increase was due to April.  We actively managed variable labor and, in fact, saw warehouse and delivery productivity levels that were meaningfully better than pre-COVID levels. We also took actions during the quarter to address fixed costs through employee furloughs across the business, reductions in discretionary costs and salary reductions. As case volume rebounded, we did add back some fixed costs to match the volume recovery we were seeing. Our cost structure remains flexible, and we're continuing to actively managing costs, targeting to be largely in line with case volumes. This positions us well to manage through this challenging environment.  Moving to Page 11. I was very pleased with our team's ability to navigate a difficult operating environment and generate positive adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. After a difficult April, where we saw negative adjusted EBITDA dollars, the business produced positive adjusted EBITDA dollars in both May and June, with June being the strongest of the quarter as we would expect to continue to see positive EBITDA in the current environment. We believe our margin structure will return close to pre-COVID levels in time, supporting a further recovery in our mid- to long-term earnings power.  Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $88 million, and year-to-date adjusted EBITDA was $265 million. Second quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share was a loss of $0.25, and year-to-date was a loss of $010. As a result of the preferred equity investment that we discussed earlier in the second quarter, our earnings per share calculations are now based on net income or loss available to common shareholders. This new line in the P&L factors in the $5 million preferred dividend for the second quarter. In the second quarter, GAAP net income available to common shareholders was a loss of $97 million for the quarter and a loss of $229 million on a year-to-date basis.  Adjusted net income available to common shareholders was a loss of $54 million for the quarter and a loss of $22 million on a year-to-date basis. I'll note since we're in a net loss for the quarter and year-to-date, the total number of diluted shares outstanding does not reflect the recent preferred equity investment. At such time we return to the net income position, those additional shares will be included in the diluted share count and factor into our adjusted diluted EPS calculation.  I'm now on Page 12. Food Group and Smart Foodservice businesses both performed in line with our expectations given the current operating environment. Our Food Group business saw a trend that were very similar to organic business in the quarter. While a number of markets in the Northwest have been slower to reopen, Food Group markets also have a higher mix of national chain restaurants in the base, and volumes with that chain business have continued to perform well.  We've also resumed integration activities, beginning with the facility near Seattle that was first on our original integration time line. We will complete this first warehouse conversion later in August and still expect a $65 million in run rate synergies that we previously communicated. However, the ramp-up may be longer as a result of reduced volume.  The Smart Foodservice business help up very well in the quarter with same-store sales down only single digits from the prior year. This is due to 2 reasons: first and primarily, the cash and carry business model typically performs well in economic downturns as customers turn to the value offering it provides; and secondly, the cash and carry channel has allowed us to capture some of the spend that is temporarily shifted to food at home. In addition, you may recall, this channel is attractive across economic environments due to its higher profit margins and because of the incremental business we can drive from our existing delivered customers, which allows us to profitably consolidate our share of wallet with those customers. And lastly, all of the Smart Foodservice stores remained open through the quarter, and the EBITDA help up extremely well despite the challenging external environment.  With respect to our plans for this business, we still expect to double the store counts, and we still anticipate limited integration activities. In total, the acquisitions contributed approximately 17% of our case volume and approximately 23% of our adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter due primarily to Smartfood services EBITDA being closer to prior year. Turning to Page 13, I would like to spend a few minutes discussing our current liquidity position. Recall that during the second quarter, we completed a series of financing activities to fund the Smart Foodservice acquisition and further strengthen our overall liquidity. As a result of these actions, we're in a very strong cash and total liquidity position. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.7 billion of cash on hand and total liquidity of approximately $3 billion.  During the second quarter, the business was operating cash flow positive primarily but not solely from working capital benefits. In the second half of the year, we do expect some of this benefit to reverse as vendor payments return to a more normal schedule and we rebuild inventory levels to support our customers. Factoring out the working capital reversal I just noted, I would expect our operating cash flow to be positive in the second half of the year.  Our cash and liquidity positions give us an advantage over the smaller distributors in the industry. We are better able to support customer needs and can invest to support faster growth. We are focused on winning new business through organic market share gains and helping our existing customers navigate this difficult operating environments.  Operator, with that, we can open it up for questions. Sure. John, so we've -- as you noted, a lot of the cost reductions and cost actions that we've taken to date have been more temporary, and a lot of that is also as we find our way through and see what the recovery looks like and the industry looks like as we work through there. What I would say is, to date, though, we have used some combination of permanent and temporary reductions and continue to use both of these as we ensure our cost structure right size for our business and just we'll continue to evaluate. But like I said, the bulk today have been temporary. But as I said earlier, aligning our costs with our volumes going forward is important, and we'll continue to be very flexible in order to do that. Sure, Ed. I think that -- so as I said, you did hear correct, May and June was being in line with the prior year. And I think that for us, it was important in all areas of the business, we went after smartly aligning costs with volume, not making irrational decisions. And as I commented that in May and June, we actually saw improved productivity across the supply chain as the team, whether it's less people on roads, kind of more effective ways of us operating within the distribution centers, et cetera. So for us, that's not going to stop. We're going to continue to focus on that as we move ahead.  And then SG&A, so we're going to continue similar actions. I think that when we think ahead, you may not be quite at the level of positive year-over-year that you saw in the second quarter, but we do expect it to be, again, meaningfully lower and trying to align our SG&A much more to, again, the lower volumes. And trying to also be -- continue to be flexible as we see volumes up and down with what our structure needs to be in order to support that. So this is a big focus for us really across all the areas of variable and fixed. Sure. Kelly, this is Dirk. When we think, as I said, going from negative EBITDA to improvement in May and then further in June, very pleased with the performance on that. And at this point, I'm going to stay away from a number or a margin, and it's not to be cute or evasive, but I think we all know that the environment continues to change almost day by day. What I will say though is if the environment stays at current levels, we would expect meaningful EBITDA in the back half of the year. So the thing I just want to be clear is, meaning not just scraping by with positive, and we're going to continue to focus on the levers and the actions that we do around servicing our customers and then around really optimizing our gross margin, our OpEx as we go to the back half of the year. Yes. This is Dirk. I'll take that. I think, unfortunately, not a lot more to share. And again, I think it's -- as I said to I think it was Kelly that asked, it's less about being evasive and more just with the environment, continuing to change. I think as we get through the third quarter and see if the environment stays stable or improving, then that will allow us to have a little more insight as to the go forward. But at this point, just continue to come back with the focus and actions we have around both the gross profit and OpEx in order to grow and manage the environment we're in, in order to really optimize the EBITDA the best we can in the environment we're in. Sure. So it's twofold. One. I think when you look at the -- if we take the second one, to the normalization, we would expect to largely happen over the third quarter. I think it's -- but that's shorter in term. And then when you think of the -- can you repeat your first part again, please? Thank you. It's actually a relatively small number. So our credit team and our sales team have worked just incredibly closely together for some really good success. And even some of those customers that had -- whether they closed temporarily or operating a limited basis, that they're having a very good communication and openness. So it's actually pretty small. So the bulk of even what's left there has continued to engage with us. And each week, we continue to see that pre-COVID balance go down. And also, those teams are working closely with customers. It's even for the post-COVID balances to make sure we're managing credit well as we go forward. Okay. And then the only thing I would add on top of that to bet your point on the drivers is as we think about coming from all the areas of the P&L like we've talked about in the past, really over time, I think you still do have a lot of taste preference for the variability in that independents offer and to the point of whether the timing of vaccine and when that recovers, but still believe that a lot of those trends will revert. Also really drive -- continuing to drive gross profit gains through the things like private brands, continued sourcing gains, things like that, that we have been, and then on the OpEx side to drive efficiencies and better ways of operating across both SG&A and our supply chain.  So we don't think at all that it's necessarily where we were pre-COVID in the cap. It's a matter of whatever the external environment takes in order to get back to there, what we're going to continue to do is operate the business, continue to grow EBITDA dollars and EBITDA margin, just like we have historically.  And then finally, the point that you made that adds on to both the dollars and the EBITDA margin, the most recent acquisition of Smart Foodservice, where that adds dollars and then expansion opportunity we have there, where we expect that we can more than double the stores and the fact that it's more profitable than in the broadline businesses as we continue to grow that. And then the added benefit we get from further market share from those customers as we grow it. So all in, still significant opportunity on the recovery to grow dollars and margin. Well, I think the -- let's come back to that. We expect to continue to focus quite a bit on our cost as we have. I think I'll just use maybe an example of something like some of the temporary pay reductions that we put in place, we have to in the second quarter and are not continuing for associates during the third quarter. So it's a matter of, again, continuing to be smart, but at the same time, want to make sure that we're treating our associates fairly as we go through this but also continuing, like Pietro said, looking at other areas of the business where we can drive efficiency and effectiveness that are temporary and more permanent. So I think that and not knowing exactly how the marketplace plays out, which can impact costs, is again why I'm not trying to be vague versus just the fact of just articulating that the positive trajectory we expect to continue if just as hard to estimate the exact levels of the dollars, but positive momentum. We're pretty well -- we have a split across the spectrum when you look there. So we don't have the specific numbers, but it's pretty meaningful across each of the areas from K-12 and college and university."

            "name": "Pietro Satriano",
            "content": "Thanks, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. COVID-19 continues to have a significant impact on our industry and our company. And as I did last time, I want to begin by thanking all our associates for the exemplary fashion in which they have continued to help our customers make it, especially amidst this challenging environment.  There are 3 topics we will cover today: the industry, our position in the industry and second quarter results. As summarized on Page 2, here are the main takeaways for today. First, a perspective on the industry. We believe that despite the impact of COVID-19, the prospects for our industry remained very good. Based on what we saw in the markets that we opened earlier, we believe volumes will ultimately recover close to pre-COVID levels, and both gross profit and operating costs are trending in a way that all bodes well for a return to profitability close to pre-COVID levels.  Second, a reminder of our advantaged position. Our nationwide scale and differentiated value proposition remain as relevant as ever, providing customers with the innovative products, technology and business tools, as well as the expert support needed to navigate this uncertain environment.  And third, a recap of the quarter. Given the environment, I would characterize our performance for the quarter as solid and promising, with margins and profitability improving sequentially throughout the quarter. In addition, we continue to make good progress in reducing our cost structure to be in line with current volumes, and lastly, our focus on collections result in reversing a significant part of the uncollectible account reserve we took at the end of the first quarter.  Let's now take a deeper dive on the industry and move to Slide 4. Here, we show recent volume trends for sales to restaurants for both the industry and for US Foods and why we are optimistic about an eventual recovery. On the left-hand side, you can see NPD data on transactions at restaurants. This is a good proxy for restaurant sales. As you can see, transactions recovered quickly from their low in March. And by June, transactions were about 15% lower than a year ago, which is where the industry has since leveled off. However, it is important to note that the industry is still far from fully reopened. According to NPD, only 78% of restaurants are in geographies that permit on-premise dining. And even when permitted to reopen dining rooms, capacity is at a fraction of what it could be. This recovery illustrates that consumers want to get back to eating from restaurants, and this bodes well for restaurant demand post-COVID.  The question does remain despite a robust recovery during the quarter, will the restaurant industry continue its recovery. Here, we turn to our own sales to independent restaurants, a key determinant of the health of the restaurant industry. On the right-hand side, we have grouped our roughly 60 markets and 2 cohorts organized by date of reopening or restriction lifting. At the end of June, our sales to independent restaurants in markets that opened the earliest, shown by the green line, were only off 10% to 12% versus prior year, and this is packed despite the fact that restaurants still had seating restrictions in many areas. This compares to markets in later phases, shown in blue and red, whose variance to prior year was greater anywhere from 20% to 30% at the end of June. Again, this shows us that once consumers feel safe, they will return to restaurants, and it's what gives us the confidence that when markets do fully reopen, we will see a recovery in volume close to pre-COVID levels.  Lastly, in both industry and our own trends, we have seen QSR chains recover to a greater degree than full service restaurants. The QSR model is more oriented to office consumption that is favored in the current environment. Having said that, full service restaurants, which includes many independents, have shown a remarkable ability to adapt. A year ago, only 19% of full-service traffic was for off-premise consumption. In June, even though dining rooms were reopening in many parts of the country, 55% of traffic was off-premise. Not only does this highlight the resiliency of restaurants, it also shows that consumers still very much want the many diversity that full-service restaurants offer.  Let's now go to Page 5 to cover our volume across all customer types. Continuing with sales to restaurants, which includes independents and chains on this chart and as shown by the yellow line, you can see that this line very much follows the pattern we saw for the industry data on the prior page but at a slightly lower level. This is because we are slightly underweighted with QSR. Given how well chains and QSR have held up in the current environment, we have put some additional focus on targeting those customer types and we've had good success so far. In the second and third quarter of this year, we are onboarding over $500 million of new business, several times the amount of similar business that we onboarded in the same time period last year. This business is at a good contribution margin. Our success demonstrates 2 things: first, a desire by many multi geography customers to put their trust in large-scale distributors like US Foods; and secondly, our own ability to quickly pivot to a segment experiencing more favorable tailwinds.  Let's now go to health care, which is represented by the orange line, and which shows that volume has partially recovered as the pace of elective surgeries have picked up through the middle of the quarter and stay-at-home restrictions began to ease. We believe with absolute certainty that this segment will ultimately recover to pre-COVID levels as health care facilities return to a more normal operations in the future. Hospitality, which for us is the smaller between health care and hospitality in our portfolio, is showing a modest recovery, thanks to summer travel. We expect this part of our industry will take longer to recover to pre-COVID levels as consumers potentially travel less and businesses place greater reliance on virtual work.  Some of the decreases in health care, hospitality and education have been made up by an added emphasis on retail, where a few significant large partnerships have led to meaningful volume. As mentioned in previous calls, while these volumes may not be as margin accretive as some of the lost volume, they do operate at a very low cost to serve and do provide some baseloading for underutilized facilities. This is yet another example of our ability to pivot to those customers with more favorable tailwinds. In fact, overall volume in July when we exclude hospitality and schools, 2 segments that were the hardest hit, was down 13% on prior year.  Our longer-term prospects for a return to pre-COVID profitability depend not only on volume, which we just discussed, but on gross profit and operating margin. And I'm now on Page 6. Category margins at the customer levels have held fairly constant, which all goes well for margins for volumes as volumes recover over time. Similarly, on the operating expense side, variable costs, which for us account for about half our operating costs have come down proportionally with volume, except for a slight lag. And as Dirk will discuss, we have adjusted our fixed costs to be more in line with reduced volumes. These trends in gross profit and operating margins, along with the promising signs of the volume recovery we saw in the early markets and our added emphasis on segments with more favorable tailwinds, are what leave us confident that we will ultimately recover close to prior levels of volume and profitability.  Moving to Page 7 and the second theme of our presentation today, a reminder of our advantaged position. As we have said in the past, part of what makes US Foods attractive is our nationwide scale and our differentiated value proposition. We expect these factors to continue to drive future market share gains. I want to spend a minute reminding us of these advantages and how we are evolving our strategy for the current environment.  Our nationwide footprint and our scale gave us multiple advantages over the myriad of regional and local competitors. Our scale gives us significant purchasing power, which results in better gross profit margins, and our footprint and operating model gives us the ability to serve multi-geography customers in a way that is difficult for most competitors to match. And with the uncertainty created by the current environment, we can offer stability and consistency to these multi-geography customers. The fact that we are currently onboarding more chain business at the same time last year is evidence of this.  We also continue to evolve our differentiated platform to ensure we continue to be seen as a leader in terms of innovative products, tools and technology and expert resources. First, let's talk about our exclusive innovative products. Keeping up with trends is seen by operators as no less important in the post-COVID world, with 82% of operators in a recent Dataessential survey staying as equally or even more important to remain on trend. Our September Scoop, which is about to launch, is already expected in helping operators with today's needs, with a particular focus on takeout and delivery, sanitation and labor-saving products.  Second, our tools and technology, especially those that enable restaurants to offer off-premise dining, continue to be in high demand. In just the last 3 months, we have doubled the number of customers who utilize the ChowNow platform for takeout and delivery.  And third, team-based selling. Our army of specialists and restaurant operations consultants that support our salespeople continue to offer webinars and consultations that are very well received by restaurant operators. Since COVID began, our restaurant operation consultants have conducted roughly 125 webinars with over 20,000 customers and prospects attending virtually.  In sum, our scale gives us an advantaged position, which is further reinforced by our differentiated platform, which continues to evolve to ensure we remain leaders in our industry.  I will now turn the call over to Dirk for the third theme of today: our second quarter results. Sure. So let's start with the -- your question on independents. Look, I think going back to my second theme around our differentiated value proposition, what we're seeing is that it's as relevant as ever. As long as you meet the, what I would call the, table stakes that customers require in terms of service, the work we have done in terms of evolving our support resources for independent restaurants in terms of helping them navigate these challenging times, I've mentioned 100 webinars have done -- we've done, I think those, for sure over the longer term, will serve us well in terms of in kind of goodwill and equity to gain share.  In the short term, it's a little bit harder to quantiy and to assess. Customer mix becomes a little bit more of a driver in the short term. So as an example, pizza restaurants have done relatively well in the current environment. We're not as heavily weighted in those -- in that segment across the country, and so I would say that the things we have done in the past and we continue to do are what's going to drive market share gains over the future.  In terms of book of business, we've been able to bring on that Dirk and I referred to. The margins are good. Look, I think the -- here's about what I would say, the reason those customers are switching isn't because we are awarding the business at very low margin. That's because, again, our scale and our operating model give these customers the confidence that we will be around for the long term. And as I've said before, prices tend to find their equilibrium in the large kind of big business. We have seen over the last few years, and I think I've mentioned this, margins slowly creep up in that larger multi-geography business. Okay. I'll take the first and let Dirk talk to the second. So there has been -- there's about half a dozen names, John, in terms of competitors, regional and smaller, that are experiencing some degree of stress. It's hard to know exactly how stressed these competitors are, and most at this point seem to be hanging on. We don't -- they're all private companies so it's hard to know exactly the degree to know how they're well capitalized. We gave a couple of examples, one that had infusion and one that went through bankruptcy proceedings. Our intent is where we know that those opportunities exist is to really position ourselves favorably with the customers that they serve. That's the most accretive way to gain share, which is to take advantage of those situations. And the more uncertainty, the more of a roller coaster there is in the short term. Like I said, the prospects for the industry longer term are good, but the more uncertainty there is in the short term, then I think the more that will present other opportunities of that nature. Dirk? Okay. I'll try to remember all your questions. Ed, if I miss one, just remind me. So you're right. If you look at the right-hand side of Page 4 and even the left-hand side, which is a good proxy for the industry, the growth has slowed and, in some cases, may have stepped back a little bit. And that's really a function of, I think, as cases have spiked in the numbers of parts of the country, governments have gone backwards in terms of the phase of reopening or consumers are treading a little bit more cautiously or staying a little bit on the sidelines.  I think the broader point I was trying to make with respect to the restaurant sector is that consumers clearly have -- I think if we had talked a few months ago, we wondered whether consumers were, in fact, going to go back to eat out or to buy from restaurants and bring the food home, and I think we've clearly seen that. There isn't a secular movement to people now cooking at home a lot more than they did before, and I think that's what we think is promising. So the consumer will drive the recovery, which then gets to, I think, another part of your question which is the health of the independents.  So our customer count is, I think, roughly in line with what was pre-COVID. So we've had some new business because there's always some natural level of churn in the industry. And obviously, a lot of the restaurants, even with the off-premise sales, are doing or operating at lower levels of sales than prior year, which is why we're not quite back to prior year levels. The count is in line when you look at seasonally adjusted to last year. There are a number of restaurants who are closed. It's actually hard to tell whether they're permanently closed or temporarily close, some of them don't know. When I talk to our field leaders and ask them, they believe that the number of permanent closures today, at this point, is still in the low single digits. And so that's the consumer. That's the -- a little bit on the independents. And the third part of your question, Ed, remind me. Yes. Yes. So clearly, so PPP, the first time around was a little bit and perfectly designed, but still a benefit to the industry. And we've tried to get a sense of what percent of our customers have benefited from PPP and the new flexible version. It's pretty high. And obviously, it's a benefit. And there's an added benefit that it provides stimulus to the economy, which drives spending. So I think to the degree that there is some form of stimulus, whether directly aimed at small business or restaurants or to the consumer, I think that will help us get through the next few months as we await for either to get better control of the virus as a country or a vaccine, which is, I think, when things really return back to pre-COVID levels. Thank you, Ed. Kelly, it's Pietro. I'm not sure there's a lot of color we can add, and you can probably draw some of your own conclusions, right? So sales are a little bit behind where they were last year. It varies by geography, no surprise. Customer accounts are in line with where we were last year. We continue to push for new business because, obviously, if customers are operating at a lower level of business, which they are today, then obviously, bringing on new customers helps make up for that. And as Dirk said, we've really worked well in terms of our distribution costs to ensure that those have come down in line. So whether optimizing the routing or the delivery for current -- today's current reality, it's also helping maintain profitability where it is. Yes. So I would say there is an effort underway in the company that we're calling -- we imagine, which is really ensuring that both, A, our value proposition to customers continues to evolve, to be relevant; and B, where there are opportunities to become more operationally effective and efficient, we're looking at those. I'd say it's -- so while there have been some benefits, as Dirk described the environment, some of the benefits have come from reengineering, how we do some of the work. And we have a whole pipeline of, I want to call my ideas, of projects underway to do that. Some are in line with the supply chain road map we've shared in the past, some are new. And I think, honestly, John, it would be premature to discuss these on a public forum at this point. So I think in terms of prognosis, on the sales side, it's very hard to say. I mean we continue to be surprised by the increases and decreases in the number of cases, and that's obviously impacting what consumers do. I think in terms of the cost side of things, look, we've learned -- I will say, we've learned a lot about how to operate in this environment. I think we can emerge from this being -- so there's the some obvious cost benefits from the lower volume that we moved on quickly. So you're not recruiting as much, you don't need as many recruiters. We talked earlier about some of the permanent reductions we made in the sales force as a result of potentially being fewer customers to be -- for us to serve. We've looked at a more efficient model to serving chain customers that we adopted from our food group, something they were further ahead on us, and we've now rolled that out to the company. So we -- the last few months have really been about the, what I would call, the more obvious opportunities, and we will continue to look at other opportunities to operate in a leaner and more agile fashion as we've learned to do so in this environment. Yes, that's correct. So in terms of the first part of your question the business that we've acquired has been from smaller, more regional, sometimes local, but I would clarify some more as regional distributors. And yes, the margins are for that chain business, whether it's QSR or chain, tend to be a little lower than the independent business. We're still very focused on the independent business. It's one where we have an advantage, where we can make a difference, and we can get back to growth over time. But all we're doing is taking advantage and being opportunistic of opportunities that may not have been around a year ago and putting a little bit of additional focus and emphasis and resources on that business, which, again, from a rate perspective, it may not look as attractive, but we're adding EBITDA dollar dollars to bottom line, and it's attractive enough on the rate perspective that it can withstand the test of time. Great. So this is Pietro again. So the green line on Page 5, which shows the big jump in sales from retail, that comes from a very small number of large grocery retailers, and that's more traditional grocery. And as I said, we were opportunistic about that and provide some good baseline volume for our facilities. It's margin accretive, but it is at the lower end.  The opportunity we talked in more detail, and pre-COVID was around the home meal replacement part of the grocery store that looks more like a restaurant, right? The deli, the sit-down part of some grocery stores. That's where we see a big a opportunity. That's in our sweet spot. Particular opportunity, we believe, is more with smaller, regional players who don't have the scale to do what some of the larger players do. It's a little bit like restaurants, right? The opportunity is more with the smaller independent in terms of making a difference and driving accretive margin. So it's no different on the grocery side. That will take some time. It's a series of business development efforts. We have a couple of markets where we've been extremely well, serving regional grocers in the home meal replacement part of the store, and what we're doing is scaling that playbook across other markets to make some inroads into that business. Sure. So some of it, for sure, is driven by off-premise, whether it's outdoor dining or takeout or delivery. All of those are contributing. And it has made up some, but not all of the restrictions on indoor dining.  In terms of the impact of weather, obviously, does not impact takeout or delivery. But again, if you look at different parts of the country, July In Florida and Arizona, there's not a lot of outdoor dining going on, right? So some parts, it's a bit of a portfolio across the country.  But look, I think the other thing I would say is independent restaurants have proved just very creative and very resilient in being able to take advantage of new opportunities. And so I think as we move forward into the winter, barring and nationwide lockdown, which, again, I don't expect, but no one really knows for sure. I will expect for some of that -- a lot of that volume to continue as we go forward. I think it's more of the latter of taking advantage of those opportunities. I think as I said earlier as well, some of the smaller regionals or independents, but some are decent size. Some over time have carried too much leverage, and they're the ones that are stressed. Others have run more conservative. So really, it's really about taking the advantage of the opportunities with -- in terms of serving those customers where uncertainty exists. Yes, so we're seeing it. I think the larger chains did move more quickly, but I think some of the independents are following suit now based on what I hear talking to the field. I think in terms of us, look, it's a good -- at a time of uncertainty, where you're not sure when you'll be forced to go back in terms of restrictions that will forward -- smart way forward the restaurants to run their business, and it allows us to be more responsive, right? All distributors carry thousands of SKUs in their buildings, and that tail is harder to serve. So to the degree that restaurants simplify their menus, it's good for them in terms of reducing waste, and it's good for us in terms of reducing some supply chain waste in the system. Yes. So I think what I was referring to is the chart on Page 4 where some states opened earlier. We saw more of a recovery, and I think it's as simple as a fact as those states have 1 or 2 weeks longer to recover. If you look at those 3 lines, on Page 4, they all have a fairly similar pattern. It's just some states started earlier and got to closer at prior year levels, and that's across the country. When I look at the market for each of those cohorts, they happen across the country.  I think by way of a general theme, some of the larger urban markets have taken longer to reopen, right, New York, Chicago, L.A., some of those big markets have taken longer. And we're seeing that in our numbers, and those are big markets for us. I think I'd mentioned on the last call, and I think we're still seeing this -- some of the more rural or suburban markets have recovered more quickly. But I think back to my first point, it really is eventually just a matter of time before all markets kind of return to close to pre-COVID levels. Absolutely. So they vary. Some distributors -- so they typically have a broad range of business. The relative size may vary. But absolutely, we -- what we've done is we've equipped through our CRM platform that fits directly with our sales force on the Street. We directed them where we think the opportunities are. It's just a little harder to say at this point the kind of success we've had because it's one distributor who serves a portion of the market, and customer might come on more slowly, whereas the larger customers tend to come on in a lumpier fashion. So I think it's just too early to say, but absolutely, the opportunities are across independent and larger chains. Look, you're seeing that a little bit today, right? And I think as I mentioned in my comments, the segments or customer types that are more equipped for off-premise dining, like fast casual and QSR, have recovered more quickly because that's where consumers felt safer in this environment. But eventually post vaccine, it's hard to say. I don't know that there's any reason why there's a permanent shift to more of a larger chain concept. The -- some of -- a lot of the -- you've seen the news, right? A lot of these larger chains have closed, and they're not immune from the pressures of this environment. And like I said, the independents are a fairly resilient bunch, they may close, but they may reopen in a different location under a different name. I think post vaccine, I think I'd be hesitant to say that there's a permanent shift. Yes. So the education segment has really been a tricky one. The good news for us is it's a minority -- sorry, the education business falls and the all other, when we've talked about all other, and it's the smallest portion of the all others. So the impact is small for us. And then you have to distinguish between college and university and K-12. College and university, I believe about half of colleges are bringing students back and half or not. With K-12, I think, as all parents on this call know, a lot of those decisions are being made literally as we speak. It's too early to call. What we are doing, again, impact on volume and margin is less material for us. The thing we are very focused on is inventory and making sure that we're in close contact with those customers to make sure that we have an ability to serve them without taking on undue inventory risk. Well, I think if you look kind of the June timing that you would see in there, we've been running at that down 20% to 25% range overall has been pretty consistent in more recent weeks as we ended up the quarter. Sure. Maybe I'll start, Dirk. So generally, what we've tried to say is longer term, the prospects for the industry, which were an important part for US Foods, a positive, and I've characterized that as close to pre-COVID. Whether it's exactly pre-COVID or how close to pre-COVID, it's really hard to say at this point. But when you look at the 3 drivers: the volume and the recovery we've seen in the parts of the country that have been the earliest and our success in some segments with favorable tailwinds, our ability to maintain margins when you normalize for these onetime hits in terms of spoilers and donations and our ability to manage our costs, again, all of that together, we think gets us pretty close to pre COVID exactly how close. It's really hard to say at this point. There's too much that's unknown. But really, what we're trying to convey is our confidence that there's a good path to getting to a profit levels close to pre COVID over the eventual long term. And a lot of that is probably determined by a vaccine. So just to clarify, it was customers that had been reopened the longest, the greatest number of weeks, right, that we mind. And it's hard to tell how much -- there's always a little bit of kind of restocking once you're closed, but I think you could see enough of a trend in terms of year-on-year closing the gap that I think in terms of the spare of your question, a lot of the performance we were seeing relative to prior year was truly sustainable sales more than just pantry loading, which occurred in 1 week. Okay. So maybe I'll say a few words in closing. I want to thank all of you for participating today and for all your questions. I hope the call today leaves you with the 3 takeaways I started with: first, the outlook for industry remains positive post COVID; second, our scale and differentiation present a genuine opportunity market share; and third, the second quarter results both our ability to stay relevant to our customers and to manage our costs in this challenging environment. For all of this, I want to thank our associates who worked tirelessly since the beginning of this crisis. Thank you for tuning in today. Have a good day, and please stay safe."

[Operator Instructions] I'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Melissa Napier, SVP, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nMelissa Napier: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. Joining me on today's call are Pietro Satriano, our CEO; and Dirk Locascio, our CFO. Since mid-March of 2020 towards the end of our first quarter, the business operations of our restaurant, hospitality and education customers were significantly disrupted by the spread of the COVID-19 virus. On today's earnings call, we will focus our commentary on trends seen in the business for both a pre-COVID and post-COVID time frame, extending through the week ended May 2, 2020. We'll also be discussing the actions recently taken to strengthen our liquidity and provide an acquisition update for both Food Group and Smart Foodservice. Today's presentation slides, which include volume trend information for the first few weeks of Q2 as well as the Q1 slides that we typically prepare, can be accessed on the Investor Relations page of our website, along with our Q1 earnings release issued earlier this morning. We'll take your questions after our prepared remarks conclude. Please provide your name, your firm and limit yourself to one question. During today's call and unless otherwise stated, we're comparing our quarter and full year fiscal results to the same period in fiscal year 2019. Also during today's call, references to organic financial results exclude contributions from the Food Group, which we acquired in September of 2019. In addition to historical information, certain statements made during today's call are considered forward-looking statements. Please review the risk factors in our 2019 Form 10-K and our Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 23, 2020 for further information on these potential factors, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in those statements. During today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. All reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the schedules on our earnings press release, as well as in the appendices to the presentation slides posted on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Pietro.\nPietro Satriano: Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call and our first call since COVID-19 has had such a dramatic impact on our country and our industry. As Melissa said, we'll spend most of the time reviewing the impact of COVID-19 on our business and our response to this unprecedented challenge. But before I do so, I would like to take a moment to say thanks, first, thank you to all the health care workers who are on the front lines, fighting the COVID-19 outbreak every day. Thank you to our associates who every day play a vital role in maintaining the food supply of our country, and then thank you to our customers and their staff, many of whom have suffered devastating losses during this period. In this time of need, we have tried to do our part to provide meals to those less fortunate and we encourage all who can to do the same. Slide 3 provides an outline of the agenda for our discussion today. As Melissa mentioned, our focus will be on recent trends and our response to COVID-19, but we have provided the standard quarterly slides at the end of our presentation for your review. Since the outbreak, our response has been formed by three guiding principles: keeping our associates safe, helping our customers, and conserving cash and generating additional liquidity. Ultimately, these three guiding principles are what will ensure the long-term health and success of our company. Let's go to Slide 4 for a very brief overview of the first quarter. January and February case growth and EBITDA performance was in line with our expectations for the quarter prior to the COVID-19 outbreak in March. Volumes rapidly began to decline starting the second week of March as many states enacted stay-at-home orders. Case volumes stabilized at just over minus 50% and now have begun to recover in the last few weeks. Our gross margin rate was negatively impacted as a result of the change in customer and product mix, which we do expect to recover as volumes return. And lastly at the end of first quarter, we implemented a number of actions to bring our costs more in line with our reduced volumes. But the timing of these actions resulted in less impact to the Q1 results. In the first quarter, we also booked an incremental $170 million reserve from collectible accounts based on the expectation that COVID-19 would impact our ability to collect outstanding balances from customers. Moving to Page 5, I would now like to talk about volume trends by customer type from the middle of March to the end of April. The yellow line shows volume for restaurants, which includes both independents and chains. After falling close to 60%, volume for restaurants has improved in recent weeks. We attribute this to a number of factors, including restaurants reopening in part as a result of SBA loans under the CARES Act, stimulus payments hitting consumers' bank accounts, and both restaurants and consumers taking greater advantage of curbside pickup and delivery. Looking forward, we do see opportunities to gain share with this customer type as we see prospects and customers, some of them approaching us and expressing a concern with the viability of some smaller distributors in our sector. Our healthcare volume, shown in orange, has been less impacted than other areas of the business. The decline in case volumes as a result of the postponement of elective and preventative procedures across most of the country's hospitals and we do expect this volume to recover more quickly as hospitals have begun to reinstate these procedures. Not surprisingly, hospitality, the blue line has been one of the hardest hit customer types as travel and large gatherings have come to a virtual standstill. We expect that it will take longer for this particular customer type to recover. Lastly, I am pleased with the progress we have made signing over 30 partnership agreements with grocery retailers, providing some baseline volume, and additional opportunities for growth in the restaurant section of these grocery stores which is right in our wheelhouse. These trends across the varied customer types are roughly in line with what we've observed in the industry as reported by third-party data. Moving to Slide 6, while no one knows exactly when or how our industry returns to normal, we can point to some promising signs about the resilience and the ultimate recovery of our industry. According to consumer research conducted by Technomic, consumers do long to get back to eating out, with 49% of consumers saying dining out is the activity they look forward to the most after social distancing restrictions are lifted. Another promising sign is the growth in spending in the last two weeks, estimated close to 30% and this coming mostly from takeout and delivery. So while a recovery is likely to be gradual and potentially bumpy, our trends those of the industry and consumer attitudes do point to an eventual recovery for our sector. Helping our customers remains one of our guiding principles. And on Slide 7, we illustrate how we have pivoted our team-based selling and value-added services to help our customers make it through this challenging period. We've conducted numerous webinars on various topics, including helping customers navigate the CARES Act, activating social media, implementing takeout and reopening their businesses on the constraints of social distancing, including helping them create opening orders and checklists to successfully reopen. In addition, our chefs and our restaurant operations consultants have been available for one-on-one consults with customers. To-date, over 10,000 customers have taken advantage of these services and have provided overwhelmingly positive feedback. We believe this natural extension of our differentiation strategy, not only helps customers with these - with their current challenges, it also creates a tremendous future engagement and loyalty towards the U.S. Foods brand. Until, the virus is no longer a threat, keeping our associates safe is our first guiding principle. In our facilities, we put in place measures early on to ensure the health and well-being of our associates. These measures included conducting associate wellness checks before entering our facilities, practicing social distancing, including assigning associates to specific work zones within warehouses, enhancing cleaning procedures and instituting new protocols for deliveries. These measures have resulted in a very low number of COVID cases and minimal risk to business interruption. Nonetheless, early on, we also put business continuity plans in place to ensure we could continue to serve our customers, prioritizing health care from any node in our network of over 70 distribution centers. Lastly, given the dramatically reduced volumes, we quickly put measures in place to bring both fixed and variable costs in line with reduced volumes so as to conserve cash, our third guiding principle. In distribution, which accounts for the majority of our operating expenses, we quickly accomplished the rightsizing of our cost structure through a combination of furloughs, and temporarily contracting some of our drivers and selectors to retailers who have experienced a surge in demand. This latter measure has the added benefit of helping us retain this experienced workforce for an eventual recovery. I will now turn it over to Dirk, who will begin by discussing the other measures we have taken to align our costs to current volume and the measures we have taken to strengthen our balance sheet. Dirk?\nDirk Locascio: Thank you, Pietro, and good morning. You heard Pietro talk about the steps we've taken to manage our variable distribution costs. We've also taken a number of actions on our selling and admin costs and other activity in managing our CapEx and working capital as well. Within our selling organization, we furloughed some sales support associates and reduced the size of our sales force to match the lower case volume we are likely to experience over the coming months. Our team-based selling model and technology position us to continue to support our customers in the way that we have before, which is important in this challenging environment. We will continue to actively monitor the pace of the potential recovery and believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the future growth opportunities. On the admin, one more fixed cost side of the business, we've also taken actions to address our cost structure, including inactive furloughs for corporate and field admin associates, implemented hiring freezes and deferring annual merit increases, taking temporary salary reductions put in place for associates at the manager level and above and Board compensation temporarily reduced. Finally, we've also significantly reduced discretionary spend and costs such as travel, marketing and consulting. All of these actions are designed to preserve cash as we navigate the current unprecedented situation. More broadly, in cash management, we've also paused noncritical CapEx spend and are actively managing all areas of working capital. To date, we've had good success collecting outstanding accounts receivable balances with approximately 80% of our pre-COVID balances collected. While this is a good start, it is too soon to know the full extent of customer losses and the resulting impact on our working capital. Pietro previously mentioned, we recorded the $170 million uncollectible account reserve as an early estimate of future receivables of total losses expected and are actively working to lower this reserve amount through our collection efforts. We're also managing down our inventory levels to reflect the lower volume and temporarily extended our accounts payable terms. As volume returns, we would expect, accordingly, to reinvest to increase inventory and expect to resume to our normal payables cadence. On slide 10, specific to acquisitions, the Food group business has seen case volume declines that are very similar to those Pietro discussed for the U.S. Foods legacy business. As a result of social differencing restrictions, we've paused integration activities until travel resumes and restaurants reopen. As a result of this pause, we do expect a delay in achieving synergy targets that is in line with the delay for integration activities. Once it is safe to resume, we're prepared to quickly restart our integration activities. On April 24, we closed the Smart Foodservice acquisition. As a reminder, Smart Foodservice is a network of 70 small-format cash-and-carry stores that generated $85 million in 2019 adjusted EBITDA at a 7% to 8% margin rate. One of the reasons this business is attractive to us is that it\u2019s leading position in the $17 billion cash and carry channel which has higher growth rates and better margin than our delivered business. Our existing CHEF'STORE have shown us that cash-and-carry also results in greater share of wallet with delivered customers. The sales growth opportunity, combined with Smart Foodservice attractive EBITDA margins, make the future growth opportunities that much more attractive. In addition, the cash-and-carry business typically performs well during the economic downturns. April case volumes were down 5% to 10% from a year ago versus down roughly 50% for our delivered business. In the economic downturns, more customers appreciate the value offering of cash-and-carry and our Smart Foodservice and CHEF'STORE locations provide. Moving to Slide 11. The financing actions we've recently completed position us well regardless of the length for depth of the economic recovery. Securing this additional liquidity was important given the uncertainty surrounding the impact from COVID. We believe our available liquidity positions us to emerge as a strong competitor post-COVID and grow at above-market rates. We've spent quite a bit of time understanding potential impacts to the business, depending on duration and severity of COVID. We've modeled various recovery scenarios and believe two are the more likely. A quicker recovery, which would entail a gradual and phased recovery across the country beginning in 2020 and continuing into 2021, or a slower recovery, which entails more choppy case volumes through 2020 and a more fulsome recovery beginning in 2021. This includes the possibility of a second downturn. In both of these situations, we have ample liquidity. Furthermore, we've also modeled a stress test or downside scenario. Our modeling indicates that even under the stress test scenario with no recovery until the second half of 2021 and only a gradual recovery even after that in the second half, as well as a significant slowdown in customer receivable collections, we have sufficient liquidity to weather this type of extended downturn. Moving to 12, on Slide 12, you can see the number of transactions we completed recently that I referenced. We thought it would be helpful to provide an estimated view into net debt and liquidity and as of the end of April 20, post these transactions. So the April view here is our pro forma estimates of net debt and liquidity as of the end of the month. To summarize, we completed a $500 million preferred equity offering that will fund tomorrow, a $1 billion senior secured notes offering and a $300 million term loan. Before completing the KKR transaction, we evaluated different forms and sources of capital raise, including public common equity. And ultimately determine the preferred equity investment from KKR was the best option in part due to the fact that is expected to be less dilutive over time for existing shareholders. The proceeds from these offerings were used to fund the Smart Foodservice acquisition and to strengthen our overall liquidity position. On the left side of the page, you can see the change in our debt structure and liquidity as a result of these transactions. We completed one other change to our capital structure as it relates to our revolving credit facilities. We closed and paid off the ABS facility and are moving the receivables that back that facility to our ABL facility. The ABL facility will now be approximately $2 billion. The covenants under the ABL facility are more flexible and moving our receivables to this facility better preserves our liquidity during this downturn. As of the end of April, we had an estimated $1.6 billion of pro forma cash on hand, which gives us flexibility and allows us to operate the business from a position of strength. The net effect of the recent financing actions results in approximately $800 million of additional liquidity, giving us total estimated liquidity amount of $2.4 billion as of the end of April. Over time, liquidity amount will likely decline some as our receivable balance declines. Until such time, the case volume rebounds in a more meaningful way and as we return to our normal payables cadence. As I previously mentioned, we believe this is more than enough liquidity to weather this crisis regardless of the duration and even the stress test or down scenario that I spoke of previously. Moving on to Slide 13, on March 23, we withdrew our fiscal 2020 fiscal guidance, and due to the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, we're unable to provide an update on fiscal 2020 guidance at this time. We do expect COVID-19 to have a significant impact on our Q2 2020 results with some form of recovery coming after the second quarter. At the present time, it's too early to tell what this recovery looks like. We do look forward to providing more details on our next earnings call. Regardless of what the recovery looks like, the new recent financing activities that we've completed are expected to allow us to operate from a position of strength when COVID-19 passes. While the future is uncertain, we operate in a large, resilient industry and are well positioned to serve customers' needs as this recovery occurs. With that, operator, we can now open the call for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Judah Frommer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nJudah Frommer: Thanks for taking my question and for all the color. Maybe if we could just start out, what are you seeing between your independent customers versus your chain customers, not only in terms of recovery off of the bottom but as we see the independents kind of continue to struggle with volumes in their store, are you seeing any accelerated level of closures from those independents that could potentially offset the faster recovery from chains?\nPietro Satriano: So thanks, Judah. So during the - most of the last six weeks, there was minimal difference between chains and independent restaurants in terms of the volume declines and the speed with which those volumes declined. There was a little bit more resilience from the QSR sector, but generally, both were very much in line with each other. And it's premature to say, we do expect some closures. I think the NRA has called for closures on the order of 10% or 15%. I don't know that anyone knows exactly where closures will be. And there will be closures on both the corporate side, the corporate chain side and on the independent side. So we believe that, ultimately, both - as this sector recovers, I think both chains and both independents have an ability to thrive.\nJudah Frommer: Okay. And I thought I heard Dirk say that, that the sales force was rationalized to some extent. I think your public competitors have kind of talked about leveraging the size of their sales force as others kind of pull back and don't necessarily have salespeople selling into existing and new accounts right now. So can you just remind us of the approach between the team-based selling approach and maybe some technology on top that's allowing you to make sure you continue to kind of build market share while others may be pulling back through all this?\nPietro Satriano: Yes. So you're right, Jud, the combination of team-based selling, our strong e-commerce platform, our value-added services, we believe is a better way to grow profitably and with both existing customers and to acquire new customers. And that model continues. We did make some small adjustments to the size of the direct sales force or not the support side of things, not the team, behind the team-based selling, but the direct sales force. And that's because, again, as we expect a lower, smaller number of customers due to some closures. We wanted to right-size the sales force and ensure we put our best talent forward as the sector recovers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from participant [indiscernible]. Caller, please state your name and company name. Your line is open. [Operator Instructions]\nWilliam Reuter: William Reuter, Bank of America. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about - if you've experienced any challenges with regard to perishables and those becoming stale? And I guess, if there could be future write-downs of that inventory in the subsequent quarters? Thanks.\nDirk Locascio: This is Dirk. So yes, we've had some limited losses to date. And really, as we've quite actively managed through that across each of the perishable categories, let's say is not a sort of meaningful driver of the overall results and now are quite actively managing that from week-to-week as we go forward with the volumes where they are. And have done a combination of things of moving things around in our distribution centers and finding partnerships with various retail and others in order to minimize the losses that incur in that space.\nWilliam Reuter: Great. And then just one follow-up for me. Can you talk about maybe quantifying any headcount reductions that you have thus far implemented? And if you expect there could be further reductions that are going to be required if demand remains at lower levels? That\u2019s it. Thank you.\nDirk Locascio: So far, we haven't talked about a specific amount, but what we've done is - so Pietro talked about some of the actions we've taken on the sales organization and the rest of the organization from admin. We've taken a number of steps where we've handled it to date, primarily through temporary furloughs and meaningful portions to reflect the environment we were in. And really handling those on an ongoing basis, so as the environment continues to evolve, we'll continue to specifically manage through that from short-term and long term and permanent actions, as far as managing that, just being really smart with our ongoing admin costs in the environment we're in.\nOperator: The next question comes from participants whose information is [indiscernible]. Caller, please state your name and company name. Your line is open. [Operator Instructions]\nJeff Bernstein: This is Jeff Bernstein from Barclays. I have two questions, just one looking at Slide 5, I appreciate the granularity. And specific to the - presumably the yellow line for the restaurant industry, I'm just wondering - or one, maybe you can provide the data points, but it looks like the trough is down more than 60% the week of March 20, it seems like you saw a last improvement from there, but maybe it\u2019s kind of flattened out and stalled out at down what looks like 45%. So I'm just wondering whether you'd anticipate meaningful further gains from here or the timeframe for that and whether you\u2019re surprised by the lack of further upside of late. Just wondering maybe what sales assumption you have in your models for coming months for that restaurant line? And then I had one follow-up.\nPietro Satriano: So I won't put too much emphasis on just one week, which I think is what you see in the flattening. I think we continue to see a steady increase in business with restaurants, both chains and independents. And as I mentioned, that business is - that incremental business is coming from takeout and delivery as both restaurants and consumers become more interested and more adept at participating in that channel. And then as more and more restaurants continue to open over the coming weeks as the shelter in place orders get lifted. And we know from our conversation with the field that our salespeople are having with customers that they are all over the coming weeks, they're all planning to reopen. And I think you'll see that yellow line continue to trend steadily upwards.\nJeff Bernstein: Great. And then I believe you made comments in your prepared remarks about potential market share opportunities from perhaps some of your smaller distributor competitors. Just wondering, if you have any qualitative commentary in terms of the challenges, they're facing in terms of the opportunity to take accounts from those smaller competitors. What you've seen in the past in periods of challenge or whatnot in terms of the survival rate of those independents and the opportunity you have to take share?\nPietro Satriano: Yes. I think it's - what we are going through is really unlike anything we\u2019ve seen in the past. So it\u2019s hard to really use the path as a predictor. But as you can imagine, given our scale and the strength of our balance sheet, you would expect for us to have the ability to profitably gain share. And as I mentioned, there are some customers out there, for example, regional customers with whom we're having conversations who are concerned that their existing smaller regional players or smaller, more local players are being significantly stressed by this crisis. Again, because of the liquidity we have from an inventory perspective, we have the ability to respond quickly to anticipate the needs of our customers, something that perhaps competitor who's not as well capitalized might not be able to do. So, I think there are a number of reasons why you would expect the larger more well capitalized scale players to come out of this stronger than perhaps some of the other players in the industry.\nJeff Bernstein: Understood. And then lastly, just to clarify. I think, Dirk, you mentioned on your liquidity slide, roughly $2.4 billion currently. And I know you mentioned that you're very confident with that amount going through the middle of '21 or even through the end of '21. It seems like you got a 1.5 years or so when you feel very comfortable that would seem to imply a cash burn rate of north of $100 million a month. I'm just wondering if that's a fair assumption, assuming sales at these current levels with no presumed recovery? Just trying to get a ballpark on that cash burn rate by week or month or however you look at it.\nDirk Locascio: Sure. I'll just reiterate my comments about the confidence over that time frame. As you point out, that it's a very stress test scenario of no improvement through the middle of next year and even modest after that. And then there's also working capital, which is just as important from a cash impact and the uncertainty in exactly what that recovery looks like makes working capital a little less predictable. So I am really not sharing a specific burn number for these reasons. But as I commented earlier, I feel very good about our liquidity and that we are managing cash quite prudently across the operation or working capital during this downturn period.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Carla Casella with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nCarla Casella: I'm wondering if you've added a lot of retail customers, grocery-type. After COVID, do you see the overall mix shifting longer term, and where do you think that could go?\nPietro Satriano: So this is Pietro. I think there is two opportunities with the retail business that we've been able to - take advantage of or anticipate. The first one is we've provided additional capacity call it, surge capacity for - while those retailers were stressed additional access to perishable inventory that wasn't necessarily available at the time. And that business has been good for us because, as I said, it provided some additional baseline volume and helps keep our workforce - experienced workforce in place. I don't expect all of that business to be in place over the long-term, but some of it will for sure stay in place. And we'll be judicious about the right profile of that business where there's a good fit. Having said that, what we've talked in the past about that section of the grocery store, which looks and feels more like a restaurant, the grocerants, and that is right up our wheelhouse in terms of the types of products we serve. The margin profile associated with that business. And that's where we anticipate that these - some of these new relationships that we have formed will allow us to accelerate our ability to penetrate that part of the grocery store, which we see as an extension of food away from home.\nCarla Casella: Give - a sense for how big that business can be? I'm just wondering if the business that you're bidding on for that is continuing to grow and how saturated that market is?\nPietro Satriano: You're talking about that second part, the grocerant-type business, how big that is?\nCarla Casella: Exactly, yes.\nPietro Satriano: It's hard to say. There's no real good estimates at this point, but we do see an opportunity to kind of accelerate our position in that sector. Exactly how big the size of the price is, I think it's a little bit early to say.\nCarla Casella: Okay. And the competitive set dramatically different when you're looking at that part of the business?\nPietro Satriano: It is a little bit. I think you've heard some of our other competitors also be interested in that space, and they also serve by a different mix of competitors. And I think what the recent crisis has done is just allowed new relationships to be formed, right? It shaken things up a little bit, which provides an opportunity for us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim. Your line is open.\nJohn Heinbockel: Pietro have you yet seen or is it too early to see a significant pickup in incoming inquiries from some of your scale challenge competitors? And at this point, are you pretty channel agnostic, meaning independent chain. You pretty much take - because you have a lot of capacity take business where you can get it?\nPietro Satriano: Is that inquiries from competitors? Do you mean competitors or customers, John?\nJohn Heinbockel: No - inquiries from customers who want to leave scale, challenge competitors?\nPietro Satriano: Yes that's what I thought. Yes, we have. I thought I actually made that point in my prepared remarks. We have seen some and they've just expressed concerns about some of the competitors or distributors who serve them, hard to say whether just some of those concerns are well-founded or not. But I think it's what you would imagine. And so, we have and we believe when we look at our pipeline for the second quarter, we believe there will be some customers we are able to bring on because, again of some of the concern about the viability of some of the smaller scale competitors.\nJohn Heinbockel: And the idea of being agnostic as to - right in New York you run a warehouse network that supplies both independents and chains, so it kind of works for you, but fairly agnostic at this point or trial agnostic?\nPietro Satriano: Sorry, I didn't answer that second part. Thanks for the reminder. Look, we - as the landscape evolves between independents and chains, obviously, we'll continue to be flexible and opportunistic. I know there's a lot of concern out there about independents. But independents are very resilient bunch and I think from a consumer mindset perspective, there's always going to be, for many, a preference for independents. You just look at how they've gone into the curbside business. I mean it's - the fact that they have recovered as quickly as some of the chains, I think, is telling. I would say we definitely - the margin profile with the independents continues to be - we expect to continue to be more favorable. But we do see from the chain side of things, especially if capacity in the industry shrinks a little bit as a result of this crisis then I think that potentially narrows the gap between the independents and the chains, which makes the chains relatively more attractive to us. And as well - we've always said we're very opportunistic and selective about the kind of business we bring on. We're kind of done with some of the pruning that we did in the last few years. In fact, in the second quarter, we have a number of regional chains that we are bringing on board that will help that business.\nJohn Heinbockel: And then just lastly right, if you look at your average existing customer, I know there's probably no good average, but look at your market share and share wallet, right? So is that kind of in the mid-30s? And where can that go, right in an environment? Would seem - it's much easier, right, for someone to just consolidate more business with you than to leave somebody else entirely. So that would be a bigger opportunity or no?\nPietro Satriano: Yes. I mean I think we said at our Investor Day that our share of wallet, and you're right, it's an average, which has a big distribution around it\u2019s around 30%. And I do think that there will be opportunity to increase our share of wallet. If demand is lower for some period of time, I think that presents an opportunity for the restaurants to consolidate the number of distributors they have to make it economic for them and for us. And again, I think we are well-positioned from an inventory perspective. I'll give you an example. We have this exclusive relationship with ChowNow, which puts customers in the takeout business, the economics of it are very favorable compared to Grubhub or DoorDash, the way those economics traditionally were positioned. And the percent of the customers who stayed open who were on ChowNow versus those who were not was significantly higher. And the amount of interest we've had - has been really through the roof. So, again, our offering that perhaps customers didn't think they needed, I think, position us well to make those kinds of share wallet gains that you're referring to.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nEdward Kelly: First question I have for you is, just on the uncollectible accounts right down the $170 million. It's more than what we've seen at peers. So I'm just kind of curious if there's something different about your account base, how it's calculated, and then how you would assess any risk from here?\nDirk Locascio: Ed, it's Dirk, I'll take that. So as you noted, we increased our reserve for bad debt to $170 million, specifically related to pre-COVID AR. And that's our best estimate of total expected losses. And so, we were a little more conservative in order to reflect that estimate of full losses so, our current collection so far actually trending favorably and as we have our sales and credit teams working quite closely together along with our customers. And so we've got about 80% of our pre-COVID balances collected already to-date. So we would hope that the end collections exceed our original estimates and would be able to product the reserve in future quarters if collections do come in better than our initial estimates. And ultimately, are monitoring that pre and post-COVID balances and really not seeing any deterioration in our post-COVID compared to what we saw in our historical AR. So think of it as full expectation of losses and we\u2019re working to overachieve that.\nEdward Kelly: Okay, good. And then just over the next few quarters, I know it's very difficult to give any kind of guidance at this point. But over the next a few quarters as we start to think about a Q2 trough and then reopening after that, how do we think about the cost structure of the business, like what you've been able to take out in Q2 to offset the lower volumes? And then as things reopen, how does cost come back and that variable component change given the drop sizes will be larger, things like this - which are smaller that you've got to deal with?\nDirk Locascio: So Ed on that like if we start with the variable costs. We've really managed quite actively to try to take a high percentage of our variable costs out. So call it relative to the early 50% reductions in volumes, taking roughly 30% of variable cost out. So there is a portion in there that you're not going to fully take out. So it's really managing and putting good process in place as volume declined, and then we would expect to manage effectively on the way back up. So its adding cost back smartly aligned with that. And I think that positions us quite well as volume comes back with those variable costs across the distribution, selling and the like. I think on the admin side, what we tried to do is just - we've tried to be really smart in the way we've done that the furloughs and the reductions is really, so that we're not taking people away from those business critical functions. And then again, we'll reinvest back in those areas of bringing those folks back as volume recovers. So, what I would expect is, I would expect the results to continue to get better and trying to really minimize the noise as we're seeing volume increase back up, because also we want to make sure as that volume is increasing back up, that we're doing our best to really serve our customers effectively, both from an inventory, deliveries, et cetera.\nEdward Kelly: Okay. And then just last question, Pietro for you probably. Could you maybe just help us understand the mindset of a privately run distributor who is over half of this industry. I would assume today, they're trying to work down inventories just generate cash. What does recovery look like for this group, if you had to - and I know this is hard, but if you had to take a guess, sort of as we think about the other side of this? How much of that competitive set is actually going to remain? I think that's the one thing that, obviously there's a lot of unknowns right now. But it's obviously a large opportunity, but difficult to size, figure out the timing, right, what it could actually mean for you guys? I don't know if you have any thoughts there whatsoever?\nPietro Satriano: Yes no, it's a good question. And as you said Ed, it's one that's hard to answer. I think it depends and depends on where that distributor is on a number of dimensions, one kind of succession generational planning. Some of them have good succession plans in place. Others do not. And we know that from just not our - just M&A activity over the last few years. And then the other one is, just how well capitalized they are. Some have been very conservative in terms of how they've managed their balance sheet and others have been less so, which is what you'd expect. And we've heard that there's a set of players whose names keeps popping up in terms of - have been potential stress. So it's hard to quantify the mix of the two and the timing of decisions being made. From our perspective, what we're ensuring we do is - from a market share gain perspective and ability to respond to those customer needs that we are there [indiscernible] seen us as the best alternative for those customers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital. Your line is open.\nKelly Bania: Thanks for taking my questions and for all the color. I wanted to just ask a little bit more on independents. Any help on just how many of your independents or what percentage are operational right now? And just any color on how PPP has been for that sector? What percent of your independent customers were able to secure some assistance there? What the feedback has been? And just, as we think about the opening process across the country, what these capacity restrictions, how that could impact these independents, whether it's 25 or 50 or whatever is happening in each state. Just what kind of feedback you're hearing from customers on how they're kind of managing that restriction on the dining-in portion. Lots of questions there but?\nPietro Satriano: Yes, lot of questions. And I think the general headline would say is, we're still learning. They're still learning. That's why these seminars we do and these one-on-one consultations we do with those customers are helpful to us in terms of being agile and nimble in terms of what the kind of help we provide for them, and they're also helpful for them. On the PPP, some definitely have received - we definitely heard of customers receiving the funding, and some have used that to reopen. As you know, the PPP is directed towards payroll and a certain percent has to be towards payroll to be forgivable. So it's created, in some places, kind of odd incentives for customers to perhaps bring back more workers or works at higher wage than they otherwise might. But it's definitely had an impact in terms of reopening. I don't know that, we know what percent of customers have actually received PPP. The second one, in terms of the opening and closures, look, there's more restaurants reopening every week. That's what we hear from our field leaders that we talk to every week. And going to your third part of your question is about the restrictions, I think some are planning to reopen, but - we've actually surveyed our customers and in terms of how quickly they plan to reopen and it's in the neighborhood - but you would imagine, the next one to four weeks. Some are waiting to see or to - for the restrictions to be a little less strict than they are. So 25% capacity seems hard to manage. And they are waiting for the 50% threshold, there is opening right way, because just they want to get back in business. It really is a mix bag, and I think - I don\u2019t know that what we see today, or next week or the week after, is ultimately representative of - how the industry recovers. I think we want to be there to help our customers every step of the way. But I think we have to look out a few months when we get something that is not pre-COVID, but closer to a level of normalcy that provides relatively good traffic for customers and relatively good business for us.\nKelly Bania: Okay. Thank you. That's helpful.\nPietro Satriano: And then the other thing I would add.\nKelly Bania: I am sorry?\nPietro Satriano: Sorry - as that was in part what motivated our desire to strengthen our balance sheet and get the additional liquidity. I know we've had some questions around that. And we said to ourselves, look, no one really knows, there's a range of broad outcomes that are possible, and no one really knows which of those outcomes is most likely. It depends on public health decisions. It depends on how the virus develops, depends on a consumer mindset. So what, our posture has been to have the utmost flexibility and the utmost agility to respond to the situation as it unfolds.\nKelly Bania: That's helpful. I guess in terms of potential market share gains as this unfolds, do you see more opportunity on the chain side or the independent side? Because I guess I would think that some of those smaller regional distributors maybe over-indexed to the independents. But maybe just help us think about what that looks like and what - in your markets that could potentially look like over the next couple of years?\nPietro Satriano: Yes, I think the opportunity is both. I mean, you'd be surprised that some of these larger national concepts, they've typically take the country and break up into a number - not always, but they often take the country and break up into - and allocate it to a number of smaller regional distributors. I mean, we have some customers. They share their business with 12 other distributors across the country. And so, in there lies the opportunity, because we believe and others believe that some of those will be stressed. So I think the opportunity for market share gains is I think, at this point equal in both some of the chain business and some of the profitable chain business and some of the independent business.\nOperator: The next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJohn Ivankoe: I hope everyone is well. It\u2019s just a couple for me. Firstly, both you and Sysco talked about 30% market share per customer. Can you remind us like what - if there's any type of commonality of the 70% of share you don't have kind of coming through this crisis whether there\u2019s an opportunity to kind of add into that 70%, you're currently not serving is the first question. And then secondly, I mean you haven't - you talked much about acquiring some of the regional or local distributors that are financially stressed for a number of different reasons. I mean, are you in a position just in terms of overall integration and balance sheet to where if certain businesses were offered to you at a very low price. I mean, a very low price is something better than zero, if that operator thought zero was going to be the eventuality whether you could actually start to actually buy companies at this point as opposed to just having their customers come through attrition? Thank you.\nPietro Satriano: Okay. I'll talk about the share of wallet question. And the answer there is, I think we've talked in the past how you get two types of customers. It's interesting that our large competitor also estimates their share of wallet at comparable to ours. Within the independents, you have some who tend to have a more exclusive type relationship with their distributors. We have some of those. And I think those are the ones that we prefer because they provide certainty and provide a better cost to serve. And then for the others, I think as I've said in the past, they typically either are hedging their bets in terms of pricing or supply or they prefer some of the local fresh distributors from a reputational perspective. And I think opportunities in those two segments of distributors, the local and regional, I think, will occur. And like I said, some are well-run and well-capitalized and others are not, but you don't need too many of them to be stressed, to provide some good market share opportunities. And that's where our focus will be. We'll really be in terms of gaining share from those competitors. Dirk?\nDirk Locascio: Sure. And I think - John, I think from an integration and such. Our immediate focus is around really continuing to integrate Food Group and now Smart Foodservice, which is a much less effort to integrate and really doing that well along with getting our core business going. I think it's kind of TBD as some of these other mid- to smaller-sized distributors, if they struggle more, what that may or may not entail from - whether it was a transaction or just focus on taking the business via those opportunities. But again, our top priority remains really around getting those other two really integrated quite well and continuing to strengthen our core business and those two opportunities that we're excited to have completed.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Mandeville with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nChris Mandeville: Dirk, I guess, as you continue to engage with your customers throughout this time frame and as they kind of comeback online, doing their best to reduce costs while they're realizing limited capacity or just capacity constraints in general. I'm just wondering if you could touch on private label penetration today. Saw on the slide deck, it's up 80 basis points as of Q1. But where is that in terms of overall penetration? And really, could that be somewhat of a silver lining with respect to the current environment where you might be able to notably bridge your gap between yourselves and your peers in terms of that penetration rate?\nDirk Locascio: Sure. That's a good question. I think that, to your point, it's up and so similar overall percentages to where we've been running. And this is just as we've talked about, I think, in the past from time-to-time and even just typical downturns, you tend to see more operators who have opportunities to do this conversion and helps them from a cost and so our sellers are going to continue to focus on those penetration opportunities. And that is, I think silver lining is a good term to use, an opportunity for us to continue because it really is a great way for us to help those operators see value, along with increasing our penetration rates.\nChris Mandeville: Is there any way to really just articulate where you are today on penetration versus your peers?\nDirk Locascio: Well, they don't all necessarily distribute. So the one compared to our larger competitor, what we've looked at historically is that we've been a few hundred basis points below where they are and have continued to focus in recent years about growing by that 80 to 100 basis points per year and getting our penetration up, because as we think, over time, there is no reason that our penetration can't be at that level. And the question about why can't we go faster, it really comes back to just because operators tend to want to try new products, et cetera, as they do conversions. So we see lots of runway ahead of us still for growing here.\nChris Mandeville: Okay. And then just on the inflation front. So you realized some modest inflation in the quarter itself, but in light of some severe declines in dairy and really where the protein complex is in great flux right now. I mean, any way to square up or frame up how we're looking today or what the expectations are for calendar Q2?\nDirk Locascio: It really is, to your point, saw some modest inflation in Q1. It was a little bit lower than where we've been. And I think just because of some of the potential volatility in some of the center of the plate, it's going to be hard to predict exactly. What we are doing is really managing through that, trying to do it effectively as when we talk a lot of times in the center of the flight, it's really a benefit of most of our businesses that it tends to be passed through, and it's just a matter of contract being a set duration or through reps passing that through. And in this scenario, as you see that, it's also going to be about reps working with our customers, so that if you have inflation in a particular category hoping those individuals whether its portion sizes or alternative solutions, alternative protein source et cetera as we work through. But the actual level by itself is a little harder to break at this point.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rebecca Scheuneman with Morningstar. Your line is open.\nRebecca Scheuneman: Good morning, and thanks for squeezing me in. I know it\u2019s early but do you have a sense of how willing consumer have been to go back into restaurants in the region they have reopen their dining rooms. Are your field leaders out there doing any kind of check? Thank you.\nPietro Satriano: So the - I mean I think what was remarkable about this crisis is that volume fell or declined very quickly in every part of the country whether there was a shelter-in-place or not. Just consumers seem to respond very quickly to what was being proposed in terms of flattening the curve. I think since then what we\u2019ve seen is rural areas recover a little bit more quickly than some urban areas. I think the research shows that younger consumers are probably more willing to get out more quickly than perhaps some of the older populations. But again those are trends or that may impact what happens in the next few weeks and months. But in terms of the ultimate health of the industry longer-term, I would be hesitant to put too much weight on some of that.\nOperator: And your last question comes from Karru Martinson with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nKarru Martinson: So when we look at the mix of the business as you guys talked to it. In my old notes I had you guys as one-third chain, a third independents and a third hospitality and health care and other. How we look at that mix today where you guys are seeing that change?\nDirk Locascio: Sure. Good afternoon. So what we haven't specifically talked about that we focused more on is that's a proximity two-thirds of our business is across independents health care and hospitality and the remaining third has been across chain, education, government, et cetera. And what I'd say is our focus there in more recent times is again about profitably growing those target segments. And then as Pietro alluded to earlier for the chain, it's about really smartly adding those customers where it makes sense for us from a capacity and profitably. And that's where even some of the new business prospects that he's talked about that we expect to onboard in the coming months that our chain business is about really making sure that they are the right fit. And in these cases, we're looking forward to bringing them on board.\nPietro Satriano: Yes. I think that's the end with questions. So I'll just make a couple of closing comments, and then we'll end the call. So I want to, again close by thanking our associates who have been just terrific and who continue to play a vital role in ensuring the food supply of this country. And while our industry has clearly been dramatically impacted by the crisis, we do believe that our industry will ultimately recover and that the combination of our differentiation strategy, our ability to become a leaner and more agile company and the ample liquidity that we have in place leave us in a position of strength to emerge from this crisis. We appreciate all of you tuning in today, and please be safe. Have a good day. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dirk Locascio",
            "content": "Thank you, Pietro, and good morning. You heard Pietro talk about the steps we've taken to manage our variable distribution costs. We've also taken a number of actions on our selling and admin costs and other activity in managing our CapEx and working capital as well. Within our selling organization, we furloughed some sales support associates and reduced the size of our sales force to match the lower case volume we are likely to experience over the coming months. Our team-based selling model and technology position us to continue to support our customers in the way that we have before, which is important in this challenging environment. We will continue to actively monitor the pace of the potential recovery and believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the future growth opportunities. On the admin, one more fixed cost side of the business, we've also taken actions to address our cost structure, including inactive furloughs for corporate and field admin associates, implemented hiring freezes and deferring annual merit increases, taking temporary salary reductions put in place for associates at the manager level and above and Board compensation temporarily reduced. Finally, we've also significantly reduced discretionary spend and costs such as travel, marketing and consulting. All of these actions are designed to preserve cash as we navigate the current unprecedented situation. More broadly, in cash management, we've also paused noncritical CapEx spend and are actively managing all areas of working capital. To date, we've had good success collecting outstanding accounts receivable balances with approximately 80% of our pre-COVID balances collected. While this is a good start, it is too soon to know the full extent of customer losses and the resulting impact on our working capital. Pietro previously mentioned, we recorded the $170 million uncollectible account reserve as an early estimate of future receivables of total losses expected and are actively working to lower this reserve amount through our collection efforts. We're also managing down our inventory levels to reflect the lower volume and temporarily extended our accounts payable terms. As volume returns, we would expect, accordingly, to reinvest to increase inventory and expect to resume to our normal payables cadence. On slide 10, specific to acquisitions, the Food group business has seen case volume declines that are very similar to those Pietro discussed for the U.S. Foods legacy business. As a result of social differencing restrictions, we've paused integration activities until travel resumes and restaurants reopen. As a result of this pause, we do expect a delay in achieving synergy targets that is in line with the delay for integration activities. Once it is safe to resume, we're prepared to quickly restart our integration activities. On April 24, we closed the Smart Foodservice acquisition. As a reminder, Smart Foodservice is a network of 70 small-format cash-and-carry stores that generated $85 million in 2019 adjusted EBITDA at a 7% to 8% margin rate. One of the reasons this business is attractive to us is that it's leading position in the $17 billion cash and carry channel which has higher growth rates and better margin than our delivered business. Our existing CHEF'STORE have shown us that cash-and-carry also results in greater share of wallet with delivered customers. The sales growth opportunity, combined with Smart Foodservice attractive EBITDA margins, make the future growth opportunities that much more attractive. In addition, the cash-and-carry business typically performs well during the economic downturns. April case volumes were down 5% to 10% from a year ago versus down roughly 50% for our delivered business. In the economic downturns, more customers appreciate the value offering of cash-and-carry and our Smart Foodservice and CHEF'STORE locations provide. Moving to Slide 11. The financing actions we've recently completed position us well regardless of the length for depth of the economic recovery. Securing this additional liquidity was important given the uncertainty surrounding the impact from COVID. We believe our available liquidity positions us to emerge as a strong competitor post-COVID and grow at above-market rates. We've spent quite a bit of time understanding potential impacts to the business, depending on duration and severity of COVID. We've modeled various recovery scenarios and believe two are the more likely. A quicker recovery, which would entail a gradual and phased recovery across the country beginning in 2020 and continuing into 2021, or a slower recovery, which entails more choppy case volumes through 2020 and a more fulsome recovery beginning in 2021. This includes the possibility of a second downturn. In both of these situations, we have ample liquidity. Furthermore, we've also modeled a stress test or downside scenario. Our modeling indicates that even under the stress test scenario with no recovery until the second half of 2021 and only a gradual recovery even after that in the second half, as well as a significant slowdown in customer receivable collections, we have sufficient liquidity to weather this type of extended downturn. Moving to 12, on Slide 12, you can see the number of transactions we completed recently that I referenced. We thought it would be helpful to provide an estimated view into net debt and liquidity and as of the end of April 20, post these transactions. So the April view here is our pro forma estimates of net debt and liquidity as of the end of the month. To summarize, we completed a $500 million preferred equity offering that will fund tomorrow, a $1 billion senior secured notes offering and a $300 million term loan. Before completing the KKR transaction, we evaluated different forms and sources of capital raise, including public common equity. And ultimately determine the preferred equity investment from KKR was the best option in part due to the fact that is expected to be less dilutive over time for existing shareholders. The proceeds from these offerings were used to fund the Smart Foodservice acquisition and to strengthen our overall liquidity position. On the left side of the page, you can see the change in our debt structure and liquidity as a result of these transactions. We completed one other change to our capital structure as it relates to our revolving credit facilities. We closed and paid off the ABS facility and are moving the receivables that back that facility to our ABL facility. The ABL facility will now be approximately $2 billion. The covenants under the ABL facility are more flexible and moving our receivables to this facility better preserves our liquidity during this downturn. As of the end of April, we had an estimated $1.6 billion of pro forma cash on hand, which gives us flexibility and allows us to operate the business from a position of strength. The net effect of the recent financing actions results in approximately $800 million of additional liquidity, giving us total estimated liquidity amount of $2.4 billion as of the end of April. Over time, liquidity amount will likely decline some as our receivable balance declines. Until such time, the case volume rebounds in a more meaningful way and as we return to our normal payables cadence. As I previously mentioned, we believe this is more than enough liquidity to weather this crisis regardless of the duration and even the stress test or down scenario that I spoke of previously. Moving on to Slide 13, on March 23, we withdrew our fiscal 2020 fiscal guidance, and due to the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, we're unable to provide an update on fiscal 2020 guidance at this time. We do expect COVID-19 to have a significant impact on our Q2 2020 results with some form of recovery coming after the second quarter. At the present time, it's too early to tell what this recovery looks like. We do look forward to providing more details on our next earnings call. Regardless of what the recovery looks like, the new recent financing activities that we've completed are expected to allow us to operate from a position of strength when COVID-19 passes. While the future is uncertain, we operate in a large, resilient industry and are well positioned to serve customers' needs as this recovery occurs. With that, operator, we can now open the call for questions. Thank you. This is Dirk. So yes, we've had some limited losses to date. And really, as we've quite actively managed through that across each of the perishable categories, let's say is not a sort of meaningful driver of the overall results and now are quite actively managing that from week-to-week as we go forward with the volumes where they are. And have done a combination of things of moving things around in our distribution centers and finding partnerships with various retail and others in order to minimize the losses that incur in that space. So far, we haven't talked about a specific amount, but what we've done is - so Pietro talked about some of the actions we've taken on the sales organization and the rest of the organization from admin. We've taken a number of steps where we've handled it to date, primarily through temporary furloughs and meaningful portions to reflect the environment we were in. And really handling those on an ongoing basis, so as the environment continues to evolve, we'll continue to specifically manage through that from short-term and long term and permanent actions, as far as managing that, just being really smart with our ongoing admin costs in the environment we're in. Sure. I'll just reiterate my comments about the confidence over that time frame. As you point out, that it's a very stress test scenario of no improvement through the middle of next year and even modest after that. And then there's also working capital, which is just as important from a cash impact and the uncertainty in exactly what that recovery looks like makes working capital a little less predictable. So I am really not sharing a specific burn number for these reasons. But as I commented earlier, I feel very good about our liquidity and that we are managing cash quite prudently across the operation or working capital during this downturn period. Ed, it's Dirk, I'll take that. So as you noted, we increased our reserve for bad debt to $170 million, specifically related to pre-COVID AR. And that's our best estimate of total expected losses. And so, we were a little more conservative in order to reflect that estimate of full losses so, our current collection so far actually trending favorably and as we have our sales and credit teams working quite closely together along with our customers. And so we've got about 80% of our pre-COVID balances collected already to-date. So we would hope that the end collections exceed our original estimates and would be able to product the reserve in future quarters if collections do come in better than our initial estimates. And ultimately, are monitoring that pre and post-COVID balances and really not seeing any deterioration in our post-COVID compared to what we saw in our historical AR. So think of it as full expectation of losses and we're working to overachieve that. So Ed on that like if we start with the variable costs. We've really managed quite actively to try to take a high percentage of our variable costs out. So call it relative to the early 50% reductions in volumes, taking roughly 30% of variable cost out. So there is a portion in there that you're not going to fully take out. So it's really managing and putting good process in place as volume declined, and then we would expect to manage effectively on the way back up. So its adding cost back smartly aligned with that. And I think that positions us quite well as volume comes back with those variable costs across the distribution, selling and the like. I think on the admin side, what we tried to do is just - we've tried to be really smart in the way we've done that the furloughs and the reductions is really, so that we're not taking people away from those business critical functions. And then again, we'll reinvest back in those areas of bringing those folks back as volume recovers. So, what I would expect is, I would expect the results to continue to get better and trying to really minimize the noise as we're seeing volume increase back up, because also we want to make sure as that volume is increasing back up, that we're doing our best to really serve our customers effectively, both from an inventory, deliveries, et cetera. Sure. And I think - John, I think from an integration and such. Our immediate focus is around really continuing to integrate Food Group and now Smart Foodservice, which is a much less effort to integrate and really doing that well along with getting our core business going. I think it's kind of TBD as some of these other mid- to smaller-sized distributors, if they struggle more, what that may or may not entail from - whether it was a transaction or just focus on taking the business via those opportunities. But again, our top priority remains really around getting those other two really integrated quite well and continuing to strengthen our core business and those two opportunities that we're excited to have completed. Sure. That's a good question. I think that, to your point, it's up and so similar overall percentages to where we've been running. And this is just as we've talked about, I think, in the past from time-to-time and even just typical downturns, you tend to see more operators who have opportunities to do this conversion and helps them from a cost and so our sellers are going to continue to focus on those penetration opportunities.

And the question about why can't we go faster, it really comes back to just because operators tend to want to try new products, et cetera, as they do conversions. So we see lots of runway ahead of us still for growing here. It really is, to your point, saw some modest inflation in Q1. It was a little bit lower than where we've been.

            "content": "Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call and our first call since COVID-19 has had such a dramatic impact on our country and our industry. As Melissa said, we'll spend most of the time reviewing the impact of COVID-19 on our business and our response to this unprecedented challenge. But before I do so, I would like to take a moment to say thanks, first, thank you to all the health care workers who are on the front lines, fighting the COVID-19 outbreak every day. Thank you to our associates who every day play a vital role in maintaining the food supply of our country, and then thank you to our customers and their staff, many of whom have suffered devastating losses during this period. In this time of need, we have tried to do our part to provide meals to those less fortunate and we encourage all who can to do the same. Slide 3 provides an outline of the agenda for our discussion today. As Melissa mentioned, our focus will be on recent trends and our response to COVID-19, but we have provided the standard quarterly slides at the end of our presentation for your review. Since the outbreak, our response has been formed by three guiding principles: keeping our associates safe, helping our customers, and conserving cash and generating additional liquidity. Ultimately, these three guiding principles are what will ensure the long-term health and success of our company. Let's go to Slide 4 for a very brief overview of the first quarter. January and February case growth and EBITDA performance was in line with our expectations for the quarter prior to the COVID-19 outbreak in March. Volumes rapidly began to decline starting the second week of March as many states enacted stay-at-home orders. Case volumes stabilized at just over minus 50% and now have begun to recover in the last few weeks. Our gross margin rate was negatively impacted as a result of the change in customer and product mix, which we do expect to recover as volumes return. And lastly at the end of first quarter, we implemented a number of actions to bring our costs more in line with our reduced volumes. But the timing of these actions resulted in less impact to the Q1 results. In the first quarter, we also booked an incremental $170 million reserve from collectible accounts based on the expectation that COVID-19 would impact our ability to collect outstanding balances from customers. Moving to Page 5, I would now like to talk about volume trends by customer type from the middle of March to the end of April. The yellow line shows volume for restaurants, which includes both independents and chains. After falling close to 60%, volume for restaurants has improved in recent weeks. We attribute this to a number of factors, including restaurants reopening in part as a result of SBA loans under the CARES Act, stimulus payments hitting consumers' bank accounts, and both restaurants and consumers taking greater advantage of curbside pickup and delivery. Looking forward, we do see opportunities to gain share with this customer type as we see prospects and customers, some of them approaching us and expressing a concern with the viability of some smaller distributors in our sector. Our healthcare volume, shown in orange, has been less impacted than other areas of the business. The decline in case volumes as a result of the postponement of elective and preventative procedures across most of the country's hospitals and we do expect this volume to recover more quickly as hospitals have begun to reinstate these procedures. Not surprisingly, hospitality, the blue line has been one of the hardest hit customer types as travel and large gatherings have come to a virtual standstill. We expect that it will take longer for this particular customer type to recover. Lastly, I am pleased with the progress we have made signing over 30 partnership agreements with grocery retailers, providing some baseline volume, and additional opportunities for growth in the restaurant section of these grocery stores which is right in our wheelhouse. These trends across the varied customer types are roughly in line with what we've observed in the industry as reported by third-party data. Moving to Slide 6, while no one knows exactly when or how our industry returns to normal, we can point to some promising signs about the resilience and the ultimate recovery of our industry. According to consumer research conducted by Technomic, consumers do long to get back to eating out, with 49% of consumers saying dining out is the activity they look forward to the most after social distancing restrictions are lifted. Another promising sign is the growth in spending in the last two weeks, estimated close to 30% and this coming mostly from takeout and delivery. So while a recovery is likely to be gradual and potentially bumpy, our trends those of the industry and consumer attitudes do point to an eventual recovery for our sector. Helping our customers remains one of our guiding principles. And on Slide 7, we illustrate how we have pivoted our team-based selling and value-added services to help our customers make it through this challenging period. We've conducted numerous webinars on various topics, including helping customers navigate the CARES Act, activating social media, implementing takeout and reopening their businesses on the constraints of social distancing, including helping them create opening orders and checklists to successfully reopen. In addition, our chefs and our restaurant operations consultants have been available for one-on-one consults with customers. To-date, over 10,000 customers have taken advantage of these services and have provided overwhelmingly positive feedback. We believe this natural extension of our differentiation strategy, not only helps customers with these - with their current challenges, it also creates a tremendous future engagement and loyalty towards the U.S. Foods brand. Until, the virus is no longer a threat, keeping our associates safe is our first guiding principle. In our facilities, we put in place measures early on to ensure the health and well-being of our associates. These measures included conducting associate wellness checks before entering our facilities, practicing social distancing, including assigning associates to specific work zones within warehouses, enhancing cleaning procedures and instituting new protocols for deliveries. These measures have resulted in a very low number of COVID cases and minimal risk to business interruption. Nonetheless, early on, we also put business continuity plans in place to ensure we could continue to serve our customers, prioritizing health care from any node in our network of over 70 distribution centers. Lastly, given the dramatically reduced volumes, we quickly put measures in place to bring both fixed and variable costs in line with reduced volumes so as to conserve cash, our third guiding principle. In distribution, which accounts for the majority of our operating expenses, we quickly accomplished the rightsizing of our cost structure through a combination of furloughs, and temporarily contracting some of our drivers and selectors to retailers who have experienced a surge in demand. This latter measure has the added benefit of helping us retain this experienced workforce for an eventual recovery. I will now turn it over to Dirk, who will begin by discussing the other measures we have taken to align our costs to current volume and the measures we have taken to strengthen our balance sheet. Dirk? So thanks, Judah. So during the - most of the last six weeks, there was minimal difference between chains and independent restaurants in terms of the volume declines and the speed with which those volumes declined. There was a little bit more resilience from the QSR sector, but generally, both were very much in line with each other. And it's premature to say, we do expect some closures. I think the NRA has called for closures on the order of 10% or 15%. I don't know that anyone knows exactly where closures will be. And there will be closures on both the corporate side, the corporate chain side and on the independent side. So we believe that, ultimately, both - as this sector recovers, I think both chains and both independents have an ability to thrive. Yes. So you're right, Jud, the combination of team-based selling, our strong e-commerce platform, our value-added services, we believe is a better way to grow profitably and with both existing customers and to acquire new customers. And that model continues. We did make some small adjustments to the size of the direct sales force or not the support side of things, not the team, behind the team-based selling, but the direct sales force. And that's because, again, as we expect a lower, smaller number of customers due to some closures. We wanted to right-size the sales force and ensure we put our best talent forward as the sector recovers. So I won't put too much emphasis on just one week, which I think is what you see in the flattening. I think we continue to see a steady increase in business with restaurants, both chains and independents. And as I mentioned, that business is - that incremental business is coming from takeout and delivery as both restaurants and consumers become more interested and more adept at participating in that channel. And then as more and more restaurants continue to open over the coming weeks as the shelter in place orders get lifted. And we know from our conversation with the field that our salespeople are having with customers that they are all over the coming weeks, they're all planning to reopen. And I think you'll see that yellow line continue to trend steadily upwards. Yes. I think it's - what we are going through is really unlike anything we've seen in the past. So it's hard to really use the path as a predictor. But as you can imagine, given our scale and the strength of our balance sheet, you would expect for us to have the ability to profitably gain share. And as I mentioned, there are some customers out there, for example, regional customers with whom we're having conversations who are concerned that their existing smaller regional players or smaller, more local players are being significantly stressed by this crisis. Again, because of the liquidity we have from an inventory perspective, we have the ability to respond quickly to anticipate the needs of our customers, something that perhaps competitor who's not as well capitalized might not be able to do. So, I think there are a number of reasons why you would expect the larger more well capitalized scale players to come out of this stronger than perhaps some of the other players in the industry. So this is Pietro. I think there is two opportunities with the retail business that we've been able to - take advantage of or anticipate. The first one is we've provided additional capacity call it, surge capacity for - while those retailers were stressed additional access to perishable inventory that wasn't necessarily available at the time. And that business has been good for us because, as I said, it provided some additional baseline volume and helps keep our workforce - experienced workforce in place. I don't expect all of that business to be in place over the long-term, but some of it will for sure stay in place. And we'll be judicious about the right profile of that business where there's a good fit. Having said that, what we've talked in the past about that section of the grocery store, which looks and feels more like a restaurant, the grocerants, and that is right up our wheelhouse in terms of the types of products we serve. The margin profile associated with that business. And that's where we anticipate that these - some of these new relationships that we have formed will allow us to accelerate our ability to penetrate that part of the grocery store, which we see as an extension of food away from home. You're talking about that second part, the grocerant-type business, how big that is? It's hard to say. There's no real good estimates at this point, but we do see an opportunity to kind of accelerate our position in that sector. Exactly how big the size of the price is, I think it's a little bit early to say. It is a little bit. I think you've heard some of our other competitors also be interested in that space, and they also serve by a different mix of competitors. And I think what the recent crisis has done is just allowed new relationships to be formed, right? It shaken things up a little bit, which provides an opportunity for us. Is that inquiries from competitors? Do you mean competitors or customers, John? Yes that's what I thought. Yes, we have. I thought I actually made that point in my prepared remarks. We have seen some and they've just expressed concerns about some of the competitors or distributors who serve them, hard to say whether just some of those concerns are well-founded or not. But I think it's what you would imagine. And so, we have and we believe when we look at our pipeline for the second quarter, we believe there will be some customers we are able to bring on because, again of some of the concern about the viability of some of the smaller scale competitors. Sorry, I didn't answer that second part. Thanks for the reminder. Look, we - as the landscape evolves between independents and chains, obviously, we'll continue to be flexible and opportunistic. I know there's a lot of concern out there about independents. But independents are very resilient bunch and I think from a consumer mindset perspective, there's always going to be, for many, a preference for independents. You just look at how they've gone into the curbside business. I mean it's - the fact that they have recovered as quickly as some of the chains, I think, is telling. I would say we definitely - the margin profile with the independents continues to be - we expect to continue to be more favorable. But we do see from the chain side of things, especially if capacity in the industry shrinks a little bit as a result of this crisis then I think that potentially narrows the gap between the independents and the chains, which makes the chains relatively more attractive to us. And as well - we've always said we're very opportunistic and selective about the kind of business we bring on. We're kind of done with some of the pruning that we did in the last few years. In fact, in the second quarter, we have a number of regional chains that we are bringing on board that will help that business. Yes. I mean I think we said at our Investor Day that our share of wallet, and you're right, it's an average, which has a big distribution around it's around 30%. And I do think that there will be opportunity to increase our share of wallet. If demand is lower for some period of time, I think that presents an opportunity for the restaurants to consolidate the number of distributors they have to make it economic for them and for us. And again, I think we are well-positioned from an inventory perspective. I'll give you an example. We have this exclusive relationship with ChowNow, which puts customers in the takeout business, the economics of it are very favorable compared to Grubhub or DoorDash, the way those economics traditionally were positioned. And the percent of the customers who stayed open who were on ChowNow versus those who were not was significantly higher. And the amount of interest we've had - has been really through the roof. So, again, our offering that perhaps customers didn't think they needed, I think, position us well to make those kinds of share wallet gains that you're referring to. Yes no, it's a good question. And as you said Ed, it's one that's hard to answer. I think it depends and depends on where that distributor is on a number of dimensions, one kind of succession generational planning. Some of them have good succession plans in place. Others do not. And we know that from just not our - just M&A activity over the last few years. And then the other one is, just how well capitalized they are. Some have been very conservative in terms of how they've managed their balance sheet and others have been less so, which is what you'd expect. And we've heard that there's a set of players whose names keeps popping up in terms of - have been potential stress. So it's hard to quantify the mix of the two and the timing of decisions being made. From our perspective, what we're ensuring we do is - from a market share gain perspective and ability to respond to those customer needs that we are there [indiscernible] seen us as the best alternative for those customers. Yes, lot of questions. And I think the general headline would say is, we're still learning. They're still learning. That's why these seminars we do and these one-on-one consultations we do with those customers are helpful to us in terms of being agile and nimble in terms of what the kind of help we provide for them, and they're also helpful for them. On the PPP, some definitely have received - we definitely heard of customers receiving the funding, and some have used that to reopen. As you know, the PPP is directed towards payroll and a certain percent has to be towards payroll to be forgivable. So it's created, in some places, kind of odd incentives for customers to perhaps bring back more workers or works at higher wage than they otherwise might. But it's definitely had an impact in terms of reopening. I don't know that, we know what percent of customers have actually received PPP. The second one, in terms of the opening and closures, look, there's more restaurants reopening every week. That's what we hear from our field leaders that we talk to every week. And going to your third part of your question is about the restrictions, I think some are planning to reopen, but - we've actually surveyed our customers and in terms of how quickly they plan to reopen and it's in the neighborhood - but you would imagine, the next one to four weeks. Some are waiting to see or to - for the restrictions to be a little less strict than they are. So 25% capacity seems hard to manage. And they are waiting for the 50% threshold, there is opening right way, because just they want to get back in business. It really is a mix bag, and I think - I don't know that what we see today, or next week or the week after, is ultimately representative of - how the industry recovers. I think we want to be there to help our customers every step of the way. But I think we have to look out a few months when we get something that is not pre-COVID, but closer to a level of normalcy that provides relatively good traffic for customers and relatively good business for us. And then the other thing I would add. Sorry - as that was in part what motivated our desire to strengthen our balance sheet and get the additional liquidity. I know we've had some questions around that. And we said to ourselves, look, no one really knows, there's a range of broad outcomes that are possible, and no one really knows which of those outcomes is most likely. It depends on public health decisions. It depends on how the virus develops, depends on a consumer mindset. So what, our posture has been to have the utmost flexibility and the utmost agility to respond to the situation as it unfolds. Yes, I think the opportunity is both. I mean, you'd be surprised that some of these larger national concepts, they've typically take the country and break up into a number - not always, but they often take the country and break up into - and allocate it to a number of smaller regional distributors. I mean, we have some customers. They share their business with 12 other distributors across the country. And so, in there lies the opportunity, because we believe and others believe that some of those will be stressed. So I think the opportunity for market share gains is I think, at this point equal in both some of the chain business and some of the profitable chain business and some of the independent business. Okay. I'll talk about the share of wallet question. And the answer there is, I think we've talked in the past how you get two types of customers. It's interesting that our large competitor also estimates their share of wallet at comparable to ours. Within the independents, you have some who tend to have a more exclusive type relationship with their distributors. We have some of those. And I think those are the ones that we prefer because they provide certainty and provide a better cost to serve. And then for the others, I think as I've said in the past, they typically either are hedging their bets in terms of pricing or supply or they prefer some of the local fresh distributors from a reputational perspective. And I think opportunities in those two segments of distributors, the local and regional, I think, will occur. And like I said, some are well-run and well-capitalized and others are not, but you don't need too many of them to be stressed, to provide some good market share opportunities. And that's where our focus will be. We'll really be in terms of gaining share from those competitors. Dirk? So the - I mean I think what was remarkable about this crisis is that volume fell or declined very quickly in every part of the country whether there was a shelter-in-place or not. Just consumers seem to respond very quickly to what was being proposed in terms of flattening the curve. I think since then what we've seen is rural areas recover a little bit more quickly than some urban areas. I think the research shows that younger consumers are probably more willing to get out more quickly than perhaps some of the older populations. But again those are trends or that may impact what happens in the next few weeks and months. But in terms of the ultimate health of the industry longer-term, I would be hesitant to put too much weight on some of that. Yes. I think that's the end with questions. So I'll just make a couple of closing comments, and then we'll end the call. So I want to, again close by thanking our associates who have been just terrific and who continue to play a vital role in ensuring the food supply of this country. And while our industry has clearly been dramatically impacted by the crisis, we do believe that our industry will ultimately recover and that the combination of our differentiation strategy, our ability to become a leaner and more agile company and the ample liquidity that we have in place leave us in a position of strength to emerge from this crisis. We appreciate all of you tuning in today, and please be safe. Have a good day. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Melissa Napier. Please go ahead.\nMelissa Napier: Thank you and thank you everyone for your patience. We sincerely apologize for the delay. It took a bit longer than we had initially anticipated, but we are excited to get into today's commentary and talk about the overview of our results for the fourth quarter in fiscal year 2021 and also provide commentary on our outlook for fiscal 2022 and 2024, and talk a bit about our 2024 long-range plan. As usual, we'll take your questions after our prepared remarks conclude, and given the delay in the time of the start of the call, Pietro and Dirk will be happy to spend a bit of extra time on the call to be sure that all questions are answered. Our earnings release issued early this morning and today's presentation slides can be accessed on the Investor Relations page of our website, that information should be updated. During today's call and unless otherwise stated, we're comparing fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results to the same time period in fiscal year 2020. In addition to historical information, certain statements made during today's call are considered forward-looking statements. Please review the risk factors in our most recent Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of those potential factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these statements. And lastly, during today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, all reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the schedules on our earnings release as well as in the appendices to the presentation slides that are posted on the website. As noted, we're not providing reconciliations to forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Pietro.\nPietro Satriano: Thanks Melissa. Good morning, everyone, and apologies as well for the delay. Especially on a day where we've got so much to cover, so let's get into it. As you heard us say on the last call, our plans to drive continued value creation are centered on delivering against three financial outcomes, profitably grow share, expand gross margin and drive operational efficiency. In 2021, we made solid progress against those outcomes in the face of continued headwinds impacting the industry and our results in the fourth quarter clearly demonstrates the impact of these efforts. Today, we will present our long-range plan against those same financial outcomes. The plan covers the period from 2022 to 2024 and is anchored on the following strategy, setting ourselves apart on reliable service and fresh quality, continuing to offer differentiated solutions that help our customers make it, be it innovative products, digital commerce, expert resources and the only true omnichannel offering in our industry. And lastly, bringing an intense focus on cost reduction and operational efficiencies. Joining me for that discussion will be Andrew Iacobucci, Chief Commercial Officer and Bill Hancock Chief Supply Chain Officer. The Board and I have a high degree of confidence that our plan will deliver against the targets we are sharing today. So let me go to the takeaways for today's call, which are summarized on Slide 2. First, fourth quarter results were in line with the expectations that we outlined on our third quarter call. Strong execution resulted in a 58% increase and adjusted EBITDA compared to fourth quarter 2020. Second, throughout 2021, we continue to take actions that solidify the foundation of the business and put in place a new operating model that underpins our recent performance and gives us great confidence in our ability to grow EBITDA from here. And third, we are presenting a long-range plan that generates $1.7 billion in adjusted EBITDA in 2024. This plan reflects a combination of initiatives that are underway and the continued recovery of our industry. Let's move to Slide 3 with a brief review of our 2021 highlights. Starting with the first pillar of profitable market share gains, which increased across all target customer types. The biggest increase came in nationally managed business, which includes healthcare, hospitality and national and regional chains. The team has won approximately $1 billion in new business over the last two years, net of optimizing lower margin business. On the independent restaurant side, we also saw year-on-year market share gains. Contributing to our share gains was a solid service foundation. Based on monthly research with 4,000 customers, our net promoter score on service indicate that we are faring same or better than our major competitors. Our differentiated offerings and continued enhancements to our digital strategy also contributed to our market share gains. A good example of which is our online marketplace or US Foods Direct, which saw sales increase of four-fold year-on-year. Moving to the second pillar of optimizing gross margins. This is where we had the greatest success, with gross profit per case, the highest it has been since 2016. Contributing to this were our continued efforts to optimize our portfolio of customers. We drove a 110 basis point increase in private brand penetration compared to the same quarter a year ago and we continued to successfully pass on inflation to both contract and non-contract customers. The third pillar, operational efficiency, is where we are intensely focused. On selling and administrative expenses, we fully realize the cost saves we put in place in August 2020 aside from reinvestments in our sales force. Distribution cost per case has been significantly impacted by industry-wide staffing and turnover challenges and higher than historical wage increases that every company has faced. Our goal over time is to completely offset the headwinds on distribution cost per case through a combination of gross margin optimization and productivity initiatives. Over the last three months, as a result of our efforts, we've seen turnover improve and we've reduced the time to full productivity for new selectors, which ultimately will result in lower costs. And lastly, we made changes to strengthen our leadership in almost one-third of our distribution centers. The biggest foundational change we made was to our operating model, reducing the number of regions to four and creating operations and commercial excellence teams dedicated to driving standardization more effectively and more quickly than before. We are already seeing the results, as illustrated by our 15% reduction in assortment last year. I will now turn to our 2024 long-range plan, a plan that has been developed over the course of last year. The plan is expected to increase EBITDA to $1.7 billion in 2024, a $650 million increase over 2021 and $250 million over 2019 pro forma. This increase comes from a combination of volume growth and EBITDA margin expansion. The initiatives you see here represent the most significant ones and our combination of programs that are successfully created shareholder value in the past with some new initiatives, which we've been piloting this year. I will introduce each of the pillars and ask my colleagues to elaborate on some of the newer ones. Starting with profitable market share, which we expect to account for roughly 40% of the EBITDA growth. Profitable growth starts by offering reliable, consistent service and consistent quality on fresh. Our customer research indicates that no broad liner does this consistently well, which is why we see this as a big opportunity. Reliable service and quality then enables us to engage customers on those differentiated solutions that truly set us apart and have fueled our consistent market share gains heading into the pandemic. And last but not least, our omnichannel offering consisting of CHEF STORE and US Foods Direct both of which have enormous growth potential that we are investing in. After opening two stores in 2021, we are set to accelerate our store opening program having secured the real estate to open four to six stores in 2022. Turning next to the pillar of gross margin, which we expect to generate around 40% of the EBITDA growth. Optimizing gross margin is an area in which we have excelled over the years, generating 83 basis point increase, excluding acquisitions and the full years leading to COVID through some of the programs that you see here. I'm now going to call on Andrew Iacobucci to highlight - to give you a highlight or two from each of the market share and gross margin pillars. Andrew was appointed Chief Commercial Officer in April 2021. He joined as Chief Merchant in 2017 and is responsible for a significant portion of the gross margin expansion over that period. Andrew, over to you.\nAndrew Iacobucci: Thanks Pietro and good morning all. As Pietro mentioned, the commercial roadmap is focused on driving profitable market share growth and margin expansion and I'll highlight a few of the medium-term areas of focus under these pillars. The first under profitable market share is fresh leadership, which means taking advantage of an opportunity we see to stake out a clear leadership position in COP and produce among our broadline peers. By leveraging the sourcing scale and expertise in a Amerifresh and Ameristar, we are driving high-single digit improvements to cost of goods along with consistently high quality product and innovative assortment. In mid-2021, we launched FRESH CHECK, which is a 27 point produce inspection program that has yielded a double-digit improvement in product - produce performance in our pilot markets. Both COP and produce drive significant incrementality and customer loyalty. Customer research review of the inconsistent produce quality is the number one reason that customers choose to source from multiple suppliers and delivering high quality fresh is equally important to distributor selection in the first place. The second area of focus is strategic vendor management which entails strengthening our key vendor partnerships to ensure we're delivering best-in-class service and cost of goods. In a world of inflation, more and more opportunities have emerged for us to improve our cost position and we plan to pursue those by leveraging our scale, all the while balancing the lead to take advantage of newly formed regional or smaller player relationships that have flourished in today's supply constrained environment. Scale is a key lever for US Foods, which when combined with the right supplier value proposition creates sizable cost of goods opportunities. Strategic vendor management is a proven process for us with consistent meaningful year-over-year improvement over the past several years and our recent learnings have only increased this momentum as evidenced by mid-single digit COGS improvement in recent negotiations. The last focus area I'd like to mention is margin enhancement through next-generation pricing. We've recently announced a partnership with Zilliant, a market leading pricing platform that allows us to be more responsive to market changes by dynamically optimizing prices based on over a dozen different inputs to drive margin or volume as appropriate. This will significantly enhance our agility and will pave the way for continued margin and share of wallet opportunities. Development and integration with our existing systems could go underway with a multi-market pilot plan for the second half of 2022. Pietro back to you.\nPietro Satriano: Thanks Andrew. I will now move to the third pillar of operational efficiency. Over the years, we have done a lot of good work on reducing selling and administrative expenses, which represent about a third of our operating expenses. But we also recognize that operations remains a big opportunity, and one on which we are intensely focused. Our opportunity is to reduce operating costs by bringing a greater standardization and process discipline in the short-term while exploring opportunities for automation over the longer-term. That is why we hired Bill Hancock, our Chief Supply Chain Officer. Bill joined in November of 2020 and brings deep experience in all aspects of operations from warehousing, to last mile delivery, to automation. Since joining, Bill has assembled a terrific team bringing talent from a number of best-in-class companies, logistics and warehouse automation. Bill?\nBill Hancock: Thanks Pietro. Building off a strong exit from 2021, our supply chain team has narrowed our focus to a set of critical initiatives that will deliver continued growth and higher profitability in 2022 and beyond. I'll highlight two of those areas. First, is our work on the foundation of our operations, which focuses on providing our teams the best training and technology available to provide a reliable service platform and reduce cost. We've reduced our trainee to trainer ratio for new associates and we've launched a network-wide driver training program to create their own pipeline of CDL drivers. We're also providing all supply chain leaders more advanced leadership training to accelerate the productivity ramp up with the high number of new associates. In 2021, we've resumed the rollout of new scanning technology for our warehouse teams. This new technology drives faster onboarding for new associates and has helped us capture up to a 5% productivity gain and reduce mispicks by 80%. The full network deployment of this technology is on pace to be completed by the close of the second quarter of this year. We've also fully deployed new proof of delivery devices for our drivers that has shortened driver training time and improved delivery scan rates by 130 basis points in support of more accurate invoicing. And while still early in our planning, this foundational work directly supports the build out of our warehouse automation in supply chain technology roadmap. The second highlight is the work behind our routing transformation. The initial phase of this work has focused on optimizing our current routing with pilot markets realizing a 6% improvement in cases per mile, while driving on-time delivery performance close to 90%. The next phase of this work will upgrade our routing technology enabling US Foods to offer dynamic delivery windows and real-time visibility to a customer order, both of which improved service and further reduced miles and cost. We're excited about the early results, these initiatives have delivered and we expect results to improve further over time. Lastly, I want to take an opportunity to thank our frontline associates for their tireless work and dedication for taking care of each other and our customers. We truly have the best team in the industry, and we are fully committed to helping all of our associates be successful. With that, I'll turn it back to Pietro.\nPietro Satriano: Thanks Bill. As you can see Bill brings tremendous focus, experience and leadership to our operations. I will now turn the call over to Dirk to discuss our results for the fourth quarter and the year as well as to provide more color on the long-range plan, I just covered. Dirk, over to you.\nDirk Locascio: Thank you, Pietro and good morning. I'll give a brief recap on 2021 and then discuss our financial outlook for 2022 and 2024 and I'll start on Page 6. Fourth quarter financial results were in line with our expectations. Our Q4 and fiscal year 2021 results were significant improvement over prior year and we ended the year with a solid foundation for further growth. Q4 net sales were $7.6 billion, which was an increase of 32% over the prior year and you'll likely recall that Q4 2020 had an extra week, which increased that period sales approximately 700 basis points. The 32% growth excludes the extra week. Total case growth increased 13% and 21% for independent restaurants. We produced very strong gross profit dollar growth again this quarter, with our highest gross profit per case of the year as our team very effectively managed inflation and optimized pricing more broadly. This caps a strong year as fiscal 2021 GP per case was the highest we've had since becoming a public company. Supply chain challenges continue through Q4 similar to others in our industry. Despite these challenges, we remain fully staffed in almost all markets and are continuing to build staffing for expected volume growth acceleration this year. We remain focused on increasing productivity of those hired in recent months. As Bill noted, we've seen improvement in productivity during Q4 and expect further improvements in 2022, reaching 2019 productivity levels around midyear. Our supply chain cost was higher in Q4 than Q3, mainly due to more associates earning sign on a retention bonuses, inflation, hiring and preparation for continued volume increases and retaining additional staff as a bit of an insurance policy. We successfully refinanced $2.7 billion of debt in 2021, taking advantage of attractive market conditions to further strengthen our balance sheet by extending tenure and replacing more of our secured floating-rate debt with unsecured fixed rate debt. And finally, we significantly improved our debt leverage this year with a three turn reduction and leveraged to 4.6 times at year-end. On Slide 7, as I mentioned, Q4 net sales increased 32% over 2020, and within sales, volume grew 13% excluding the extra week in 2020; food inflation was 14.4% and the remainder was related to sales mix. Our independent restaurant volume increased 20% excluding the extra week and we saw acceleration earlier in the quarter before Omicron impacts which bodes well for 2022. Q4 ends a year of significant sales and volume improvement over 2020. Full year total volume was up 19% and independent volume of 30%, each excluding the extra week in 2020. Adjusted EBITDA was $262 million for the quarter, a 51% increase over the prior year, we estimate the extra week in Q4 of 2020 increased EBITDA by $8 million, so excluding the extra week, adjusted EBITDA for Q4 increased 58% over prior year. Q4 adjusted EBITDA as a percent of sales increased to 3.4%. For the full year, our adjusted EBITDA increased 65% and EBITDA margin increased 70 basis points compared to 2020. We did experienced limited impact from Omicron in December and the more significant impact is in Q1 2022 which we think will be temporary. The Q4 P&L outcome was largely in line with our expectations, no real surprises in the way the quarter played out. Adjusted diluted EPS for Q4 was $0.38 and full year $1.55 per share, each up significantly over the prior year. And lastly, specific to Food Group, most of the integration was completed by the end of 2021. We have the last system conversion plan for this coming weekend and we are on track and confident to achieve the $65 million in synergies. Future discussions of Food Group will be incorporated into our discussions of the overall business. Operating cash flow for the fiscal year was $419 million, similar to prior year. In 2021 working capital was $300 million plus use of cash, as a result of receivables growth due to the significant growth in sales. While 2020 had the benefit of approximately $200 million working capital reduction due to lower sales. Our business has historically generated a significant amount of operating cash flow and we expect to grow that cash flow with EBITDA over time. And as I've already highlighted, we further strengthened our balance sheet as we decreased our leverage in fiscal 2021 to 4.6 times and we are well on our way toward our target net leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3 times. Turning to 2022, we expect continued increases in volume and earnings through the execution of our strategic initiatives to grow market share, increased gross margins and improved operational efficiencies. One point to call out is you will hear me talk about a higher 2022 adjusted diluted EPS range than we initially included in our press release earlier this morning. The numbers I'm talking about are correct and the press release has been updated to reflect these numbers. We expect to grow volume at 1.5 times the market for restaurants and grow at market for the remaining customer types. We expect to deliver to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of adjusted EBITDA and $1.95 to $2.25 adjusted diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2022. Omicron appears to be largely in the rearview mirror, however, it has had a meaningful impact on volume and supply chain costs in Q1 and likely to a more limited extent in Q2. We also plan to continue to temporarily carry additional supply chain headcount to ensure adequate staffing and service levels in the event of another impact from COVID. Our outlook range reflects these Omicron related costs and impacts, which we estimate at $80 million to $90 million. Going forward, we are optimistic about the continued rapid recovery of our business post on Omicron. If the U.S. does not have another significant COVID wave, we expect to be at the higher end of the earnings range, the lower end of the range takes into account the possibility of another similar wave. Specific to Q1 2022 and the Omicron impact, we are experiencing reduced volume and incremental supply chain costs. We've seen volume improve the last couple of weeks and are very encouraged it will continue to improve through Q1. Client appears to mostly be driven by customer staffing challenges and believe that the end customer demand will be robust as Omicron subsides. Historically, our Q1 EBITDA is lower than other quarters of the year at approximately 20% of our annual EBITDA dollars. With most of the Omicron impact expected in Q1, we expect Q1 EBITDA to be a lower percent of our full year EBITDA than normal this year. Assuming there's not another significant wave and macro volume improvement occurs, especially in healthcare and hospitality, we expect volume to return to 2019 levels sometime in half two. In 2022, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins to improve over fiscal 2021, along with continued strong gross profit per case and increased operational efficiencies. We continue to expect supply chain productivity to return to 2019 levels midyear and surpass by year-end. We're focused on returning our adjusted EBITDA margin to pre-COVID levels and increasing it further in the coming years. Prior to the pandemic, we grew EBITDA margins 90 basis points or 25% improvement from 2015 to 2019 and expect to build upon that track record. We're also providing additional guidance on interest expense and CapEx, cash CapEx. As we significantly increased earnings in 2022, we expect to further reduce debt and as a result, be near 3.5 times leverage by year-end. As Pietro said, we're executing a multiyear plan to deliver significant earnings growth from the combination of profitable volume growth and margin expansion. As we look further ahead to 2024, we expect to continue growing at 1.5 times the market for restaurants and at market for other customer types. We expect adjusted EBITDA to grow at roughly - grow to roughly $1.5 billion in 2023 and then reach approximately $1.7 billion in 2024 as a result of executing our balanced plan. We will likely be near or at 2019 EBITDA margins in 2023 and then exceed in 2024 as we return to an expectation of EBITDA margin improvement each year. Adjusted diluted EPS is estimated to be approximately $3.40 in 2024. CapEx is estimated at 1.3% to 1.4% of sales. With respect to leverage, we plan to reach our target leverage range of 2.5 times to 3 times in 2023 and remain in that range. As we approach the range, we will further evaluate return of capital options, such as share repurchases. Our focus is on executing the plan to achieve these 2024 targets. However, beyond 2024, we would likely expect a 6% to 7% adjusted EBITDA growth algorithm. I like to reiterate the relative contributions of the various pillars of our strategy as they contribute to our expected EBITDA growth. While we won't be breaking down the quantified impact of each initiative, we have provided impacts for each bucket of the plan which reflect the combined contribution of initiatives that Pietro, Andrew and Bill discussed. We expect to generate nearly $650 million of adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2024 compared to 2021. We expect the contributions of our increased earnings to be significant, for each of these pillars. Volume is expected to contribute an estimated $290 million, gross margin expansion approximately $325 million and OpEx efficiency approximately $235 million, which is incremental to the $130 million of fixed cost reductions completed in 2020. Then we have annual OpEx cost inflation that we must mitigate through productivity and gross margin increases. OpEx inflation is estimated to total about $210 million over the three years. Pietro, Andrew and Bill covered the key drivers in each pillar, so I won't repeat them. We successfully grew independent restaurants at approximately 2x the market rate and increased gross margin per case more than OpEx per case driving operating leverage gains over multiple years pre-pandemic, so we know how to do this well. Our new operating model gives us line of sight through initiatives already underway to improve execution on cost reduction. And as you've heard, we are especially focused on supply chain where we have new leadership with strong capabilities. We are confident in our ability to deliver strong adjusted EBITDA growth via continued share gains, further gross margin improvement and a more intense focus on operational efficiency. These increased earnings will produce strong and growing cash flows, which we can then prudently allocate to reinvest in the business, reduce leverage, return capital to shareholders and opportunistically pursue tuck-in M&A. We estimate this will lead to adjusted diluted EPS of approximately $3.40 per share, which is more than a 40% increase over FY 2019. Pietro back to you.\nPietro Satriano: Thanks Dirk. I hope you all share in our excitement in our long-range plan and what the future holds for US Foods. Our plan is bold, achievable and it builds on a very strong foundation. The progress we have made, the initiatives currently underway and our talented and dedicated team of leaders and frontline associates give me great confidence that we will deliver on the plan we outlined and create significant value for our shareholders. We will now open the call for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJohn Glass: Thanks, good morning. Thanks for all the details. One way to look at your business I think some have framed is looking - comparing your business to your largest competitor Cisco and thinking about the gap in margins that you have and your desire to think to close a part of that maybe not all but maybe 75% of it. Can you talk about how you put that in the context of your plan for '24, it doesn't seem like you can close that entire gap but do you see that as a feasible opportunity over time? And I've got a follow-up, please. Thanks.\nDirk Locascio: Sure. Thank you, John. Good morning and good question. So our job, first of all and what we're focused on is executing our plan which generates as you heard us talk about meaningful value based on a combination of margin expansion of volume growth. We're not going to speculate specifically and how much for the progress of things that are outside of our control i.e., others, peers, but this plan does include additional margin expansion on top of what we've done in recent years. And I can say, we expected the plan to generate over $600 million and 40% higher adjusted diluted EPS in 2019 and we're confident we'll deliver value through the combination of this volume growth and margin expansion.\nJohn Glass: And if I could follow-up and forgive me if this is wrong, but I think your CapEx, as a percentage of sales, in your target is higher than it has been historically, is that right and does this plan I guess more broadly require more capital spending to improve operational efficiencies and warehouse and fleet et cetera?\nDirk Locascio: So the range - so when you get to 2024, it's a little bit higher than it was, say in 2019. And so very similar I think to the point of maybe a tenth and that contemplates some modest increase potentially for some - beginning up some warehouse automation et cetera, but it is not an extremely heavy capital-intensive plan out there other than again some limited areas. So we expect to continue to generate strong cash flows.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim. Your line is open.\nJohn Heinbockel: So two things. Let me start with - you didn't give - you obviously talked about 1.5 times the market, you didn't give a specific revenue targets, but do you think 4% to 5% is that a fair growth rate beyond the recovery by '23-'24? And when I think about the 290, right, and incremental margin, what's the fair incremental margin on whether it's 4%, 5%, 6%, is it a high-single digit or is that too high on revenue growth?\nDirk Locascio: Morning John, this is Dirk. Good question, I think that - so the reason we stayed away from specific numbers is that's more feasible and don't want to be accurate during a more stable period, in a period of recovery like this. Really what our focus is relative to what the market does and it's really growing with especially our key target customers of the restaurants, and within there, especially the independents, meaningfully faster as we have done. And then at least that market with the target customer type. So although we haven't given a specific number, that really is - it's kind of indexed to how Technomic is calling for the outlook and would expect again meaningful growth on that. So no it's not a specific number, but that's how we thought about why we're focused on relative to the market and others.\nJohn Heinbockel: Yes. And maybe a follow-up on that and then turning to my last question. Again when you think about it look at that 290, right. And I know it depends, right, if it's drop size, the margin is higher, if it's new account wins, it's lower. But just as a thought process, how do you guys think about incremental margin on new business that obviously has to be greater than the 3.5% that you set out today? And then lastly the 325 of gross profit, right, if you broke that down, I think procurement and mix is probably the two biggest components, is that heavily skewed to procurement, is it maybe two-thirds procurement and one-third mix or what's the biggest bucket in the gross profit dollar improvement?\nDirk Locascio: Sure. So on the volume growth, we look at your point - we do look at new volume higher than our overall EBITDA margins, it really is dependent on the specific customer types, as you remember, our independents were the most profitable on healthcare and hospitality. But the chain business that we brought on has been meaningfully more profitable than that we've had in the past which has allowed us to be more opportunistic with our growth there. So we do expect it to be higher than our overall EBITDA number. With respect to your gross margin, you're right, procurement is a meaningful part that is within there. I think the other two things that I would call out and talk about that at least one of them Andrew talked about is pricing and customer profitability optimization. So some of it is from the tool that he talked about, some of it comes from the success that we are have and expect to continue to have with lower margin, large customer improvements. And then the third piece is around logistics. So our inbound logistics, optimizing that's another form of cost of goods, but it's about optimizing our inbound cost of goods and that is a key focus areas for us as well. So those are the key largest pieces of it.\nOperator: Your next question is from Peter Saleh from BTIG. Your line is open.\nPeter Saleh: Great, thank you. In 2021, you guys had about a 15% reduction in your assortment or the SKU rationalization. Just curious if you elaborate a little bit on, is that part of the plan going forward in '22, '23 and '24 to get to your EBITDA targets, do you anticipate reducing the SKU counts even further or that the most we're going to see at 15%?\nPietro Satriano: So we do anticipate further reduction in the assortment over the course of time and that helps in a number of ways, that helps provide better service to the customers by reducing the volatility that you see typically in the slower moving part of the tail and it also helps streamline operations, which helps contribute to improved distribution cost per case.\nPeter Saleh: Are there any targets on that in terms of should we expect you guys to be 30% lower or 25% or anything that we can hang our head on?\nPietro Satriano: Yes. We - obviously, we have our internal targets, but we're not prepared to discuss them on this call.\nPeter Saleh: Understood, okay. And just lastly for me, is the private label expansion also part of this strategy, I mean, what do you expect to be in 2024 in terms of the private label mix versus where we are today?\nPietro Satriano: Maybe I'll pass that to Andrew. He is really driven the EB growth of the last few years. So Andrew, how would you answer that.\nAndrew Iacobucci: Yes. Thanks for the question, Peter. I think we have a tremendous focus on growing our EB penetration, it's something we made great progress on pre-COVID and supply interruptions sort of stalled our progress, but it's great to see in Q4 resumption of pretty strong year-over-year growth and we anticipate that continuing to be an important part of our strategy over the next three years and beyond.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Brian Mullan from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrian Mullan: Okay, thank you. Just want to confirm, did you say adjusted EBITDA of about $1.5 billion in '23, I think I heard that so. Just if yes, using the high end of the 2022 guide it would imply you expect adjusted EBITDA growth of about 15% in '23 followed by another 13% or 14% again in '24. So I think expecting outsized EBITDA growth next year when you're lapping over what is still a COVID impact environment right now. I think people can get their arms around that. But as far as '24, could you just speak to what will be the biggest driver of that outsized growth that you expect to take place that following year between volumes, gross profit, OpEx efficiency is one item the most important or do you have outsized confidence in as you look out to '24?\nDirk Locascio: Thank you. A good question and yes you're correct, the $1.5 billion is what I noted for 2023. And I think that, to your point, the '23 have a lot of recovery, it still occurs whether it be the rebound from the - as you heard me talk about the meaningful amount of Omicron impact this year as well as healthcare and hospitality recovery, which is likely not fully back to normal this year. I think as we get further through that, we see more of the initiatives take hold across gross margin around the fresh accelerators of volume that Andrew talked about in the supply chain improvements there. So there's not a single thing that I would call out as opposed to continued execution and feeling good about our ability to deliver the $1.7 billion.\nBrian Mullan: Okay, thank you. And then just a follow-up question on just balance sheet, capital allocation as it relates to the guide, you expect net leverage to get back in the 2.5 to 3 turns range in '23. It appears like you expect it to stay in that range for '24 as well. So if that's right, I'm wondering if there are any share repurchases contemplated and then adjusted EPS guide of $3.40 in 2024 if net leverage is flat from '23 to '24, I'm just curious what the plan is for the free cash flow?\nDirk Locascio: Sure. Good question. You're right, so we're happy to be - expect to be in that range next year and then stay there. As I said, we'll explore other returns similar to we've talked about in the past, more likely, starting with share repurchases as we get closer to the range, we'll do that work. For assumptions here, we've assumed some levels of repurchases beginning and look forward to hearing more from us as we get closer to that range.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Kelly Bania from BMO Capital. Your line is open.\nKelly Bania: Thanks for taking our questions and for all the color. Wanted to just ask about the fiscal '24 plan, the $1.7 billion EBITDA target. I guess what would you consider the biggest risk from an internal execution standpoint to achieving that, obviously aside from external factors, COVID and variants and so forth?\nPietro Satriano: Yes. I think you've - good morning, Kelly. The main risks that we anticipate are more external and macro focused, whether it's new variance or economic conditions from an internal execution perspective, we feel very confident in our ability to execute. In part because of some of the things we've mentioned, we're in some ways a bit of a different company from three or four years ago, thanks to having prototypes some of these initiatives and the results we see, the impact of the operating model that I talked about and some of the talent that we've brought into the company.\nKelly Bania: Okay. And just another follow-up, I think I heard the algorithm beyond fiscal '24, 6% to 7% adjusted EBITDA growth. And just was curious, I believe the 2018 Analyst Day outlined 9% to 11% path. So just what are the big factors that lead to that being lower to the kind of prior algorithm?\nDirk Locascio: Sure. Good morning, Kelly. Appreciate the question. So I think in the prior Investor Day that was more focused on the near-term and some of the opportunities there. Really the intent, since our focus right now is on executing this plan through 2024, which you've heard us say multiple times, we're excited and expect a significant value creation from it. The 2024, you're right, the 6% to 7% was really to give people a sense and post that we will obviously refine it as we get closer to there, but really to indicate more that we do expect meaningful growth to continue as we get beyond 2024.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is open.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great, thank you. Two questions, one just from a top line perspective, the market share gains you talked about 1.5 times the industry for the pure play restaurant industry. I was wondering obviously after moving target, how do you arrive at a target like that maybe what's the outperformance been in past years that assuming in the M&A maybe what do you assume the industry is growing anything to at least on a more normalized period what is the assumption that this 1.5 times against?\nPietro Satriano: Sure. Good morning, Jeffrey. We - it's a blend of what we expect on the independent restaurant and the national chain side. If you go back to the four years leading to COVID, we pretty consistently performed at twice the market from an independent restaurant perspective and so the 1.5 is in part based on that experience. And on the restaurant side, as we've talked about, we've had really good success. So on the chain side of the restaurant business, we've had really good success over the last couple of years. And when we look at our pipeline, we expect that to continue probably on the lower side of the 1.5, which is how we get to that blend.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Got you. And then the fiscal '24 EBITDA, you gave those three big pillars to drive that incremental gain over the next three years. I was wondering, if maybe you could provide some color on the sequencing of that, maybe what you see is the biggest near-term opportunity versus what you think is going to take be more of a back-end story kind of how you see those buckets of $200 million to $300 million each playing out over the next few years? Thank you.\nDirk Locascio: Thank you. Good morning. I think when we think of it, really all three of the buckets we think of as a pretty steady stream. And I say that because a number of things that you heard, Andrew and Bill each talk about an example, maybe I'll build on those. So the example on whether it's routing for example, there is a shorter-term impact and then there's a longer-term impact that's enabled by additional technology and process. Pricing has it similar with some of the things we're doing around pricing and customer optimization now, and then that's enabled further by the enhanced pricing tool that is an upgrade over the one that we've had in place for a number of years. So as we look ahead, really each of those, there isn't a hockey stick or extremely different phasing as opposed to we expect incremental value to come out of all of them over the three years.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Joshua Long from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nJoshua Long: Great, thank you. Encouraged to hear about the private brand growth. Curious if you might be able to give us an actual base of our mix or however you're thinking about it and in terms of where you're are down with private brand, I think earlier, I heard you say something along the lines of 110 basis points of growth, but just curious with the actual mix of that segment of the business was?\nDirk Locascio: So we were at about 34% of sales from private brand for this year, which we do include that in our 10-K. And I think that what I'll just build on what Pietro talked about earlier is that is an area that is both with smaller, with the independents as well as the national customers, an area of focus for us and a value driver in our plan for the next three years. If you remember, we grew, call it, 70 to 100 basis points in the multiple years leading up to it. We've talked about that we don't see a ceiling of a lot of opportunities so that remains an area of focus for us. And especially in this timeframe with the inflation because it tends to be a double win from a customer perspective, it's a better value, and for us, it is higher margin.\nJoshua Long: Great, thank you for that. And maybe on that inflation point, curious if you've seen any sort of abatement here of late or just kind of what your latest take is on the inflationary environment. And then as you've gone through your pricing work with consumers and laid out your tool. Any sort of push back or commentary in terms of just how your end consumers are being able to manage the inflationary environments as well?\nPietro Satriano: So I'll start with the consumer side and then turn it over to Dirk in terms of what we expect. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've been very successful in terms of passing on inflation both to non-contract and contract customers. I think the general environment has made it possible to have conversations in off cycle that we normally wouldn't have. And you've seen that those increases reflected in menu prices as dine-out or take-out. One of the things that perhaps a little bit different than historically is when we look at inflation in our channel relative to inflation in the grocery channel, it's been roughly the same. In fact, over the last few months, inflation in the grocery channel has been even higher than inflation in our channel. So we're not disadvantaged from that position, consumers FTE they may change a little bit the mix of what the based on inflation, but the two channels have kind of stayed consistent with each other. Dirk, do you want to talk about the expectations going forward.\nDirk Locascio: Sure. Thanks, good morning. I think when - so my crystal ball is probably going to be just as accurate as anybody else's since we're not quite sure exactly how it plays out. A couple of things I will tell you from the data points as we look at it is, the year-over-year inflation as we go back over the past few quarters, sequential inflation quarter-to-quarter has slowed each of the quarters, which is we think as a positive toward hopefully price stabilization. We would expect inflation to remain higher here in 2022 with likely some incremental inflation here in the earlier part of the year and additional stabilization as we get further into the year. I think the thing that's hard to predict for anybody is it then just stagnated and stay at that higher level or do you see any kind of reduction in that going forward.\nJoshua Long: Great, that's helpful. Thank you. And then when we think about the labor front as well, excited to hear about some of the initiatives you have outlined on the labor front to support these longer-term targets. But curious if you could provide a little bit more color there and just in terms of what you're seeing how the pipeline maybe on the driver or the warehouse side is shaping up and any sort of other initiatives that are embedded to make sure you have the human capital side to support these targets that you've outlined today?\nPietro Satriano: Yes, I think that, sorry, go ahead, Dirk.\nDirk Locascio: As you said, maybe I'll start and then hand it over to Bill for any insights on the driver pipeline. But ultimately, as you heard Bill talk about, we will continue to be staffed in the fourth quarter and we didn't use a lot of temporary resources but even further reduce that in the fourth quarter. So very optimistic on the progress that we've been seeing there. But Bill can comment more specifically on drivers. I think when we talk about inflation and sort of the wage inflation, we talked a lot about this last year and transitory has been a word that has been used in a lot of different ways. I think the way we talk from Q3 was the higher level of inflation, some of the temporary, some of it permanents, we'd likely transitory in the sense that we didn't think and don't think that becomes the new norm as opposed to some higher inflation and then we return to more normal levels. So what we had estimated on top of the normal $50 million or so of inflation that we see for supply chain and given here is an additional $40 million to $60 million annual impact with a combination of wage increases and signing and retention bonuses. We had indicated that we expect most of that to be permanent, our outlook on the range and on the ratio doesn't really - hasn't changed since then. What I'll tell you though is, when we talked about an expectation for covering most if not all of that through margin improvements with lower profitability customers. Our confidence is stronger than ever that we're able to do that as we've continued to see good progress. Bill, anything you want to add on or would you add on driver on warehouse staffing.\nBill Hancock: Yes, couple of key points, I would add. I would say like most supply chains, we've found ourselves behind in the first quarter of '21 on driver and warehouse staffing. We put a lot of very intentional work into how we recruit, how we hire, how we train intentional investments and sign on bonuses, wage adjustments to make sure that we're competitive and we saw the kind of the return on that work, which like Dirk said, we've come into 2022 fully staffed. Specific to drivers, we don't expect the shortage of drivers to go away anytime soon which is why we stood up our driver training program, but we can take an existing warehouse worker or somebody off the street and put them through a fully funded driver training program and create our own CDL pipeline. We're going to stay really close to that. Like I said, we expect continued volatility on the labor front and we're going to make sure we're prepared to staff our business.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Lauren Silberman from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nLauren Silberman: Hi, thank you guys. So just the first, I believe you implied pro forma 2019 EBITDA was $1.45 billion. Can I confirm that's what you're saying?\nDirk Locascio: Good morning, Laura. Yes that's correct. When we talk about pro forma, it's been in the context of how we've talked about it with you other analyst/investors that contemplates the synergies, inflation, new business wins et cetera and that's what we've then estimate it at.\nLauren Silberman: Okay. So looking at 2023 EBITDA of $1.5 billion, which is slow recovery of volume plus the $180 million in cost savings and then understanding some of the incremental investments that you guys have talked about. Can you walk us through the difference between the 2019 pro forma $1.5 billion and the 2023 $1.5 billion? Just trying to wrap my head around what some of those dynamics are?\nDirk Locascio: Thank you. It's many of the same elements we've talked about it. The combination of realizing a number of the synergies from the transactions, it is incremental with volume recovery, it is some of the wins with national sales, it is multiple years of cost inflation, it is the cost savings that you've mentioned. So really is all those things there and that's the way I think the way you maybe started is the way I would think about it as it's maybe not getting all the way back in the exact same way, but it's basically back to where the business was and sort of the platform for growth there beyond.\nLauren Silberman: Okay, got it. On the gross margin piece, I understand there's some noise with the actual gross margin percentage given the inflation and how that the numbers work. But can you talk about what's embedded in your gross margin percentage expectation for - if you expect to get back to 2019, I think 17.8%?\nDirk Locascio: Sure happy to do that. I think that when we look ahead, we know what's harder to predict is in the period of inflation that we're in what happens exactly on that and that really drives as you just alluded to what, how gross margins versus OpEx as a percent of sales play out, it doesn't change EBITDA impact. So I'd rather stay away from that, specifically what I will say though is, specific to our - when we look at our plan for 2024, what we expect to do is to get EBITDA margins sort of at or near 2019 levels in 2023 and then exceed those EBITDA margin levels in 2024 through the number of initiatives around operating efficiency as well as gross margin expansion.\nLauren Silberman: Okay, thanks. And then just my last question, can you give us an update on the business mix for 2021 across the different channels?\nDirk Locascio: Sure happy too, and I'm going to actually...\nMelissa Napier: Lauren, it's Melissa Napier. Is that - do you mind if that's something that we can follow-up on with you afterwards. We still have a lot of people in our queue that we want to get through.\nLauren Silberman: Sure.\nMelissa Napier: Okay.\nDirk Locascio: Thanks Lauren.\nLauren Silberman: Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nEdward Kelly: Yes. Hi everybody, good morning. Firstly, I just wanted to ask about the 2022 outlook, the $1.25 billion of EBITDA which obviously has been already talked about where it's below 2019 pro forma levels, but there is a lot of optimism around sort of like spring-summer period, you've obviously talked about share gains. I'm just kind of curious as to why volumes wouldn't get back to 2018 levels earlier than maybe the back half? And then from a cost perspective, how much of like unusual costs are still sitting in this 2022 guidance number just really trying to bridge to like the '22 number being below the '19 number, value amount that it is still?\nDirk Locascio: Sure Ed. Good morning, good question. I think that couple of things I would highlight, one is really that when we, to your point, with that 1.2 to 1.3 as I commented that, absent another COVID wave like Omicron, we would expect to be at the higher end of that range. And so I think that and within that we've embedded roughly $80 million to $90 million of impact from Omicron, so that gives you a jumping point from where sort of that range is plus the additional amount. So we aren't going to talk today about specific amounts that we've embedded in there, but I think it is not an insignificant amount in the first half of the year especially as we're still working to get productivity back to 2019 similar to a number of our peers. I think that the thing that we are expecting is we expect steady improvements in our EBITDA versus 2019 as the year goes on and expect to make meaningful progress. And I think what you see from there is if we expect which we are roughly $1.5 billion of EBITDA next year, that means a healthy exit rate for this year.\nPietro Satriano: Dirk can I add a little bit in terms of some of the points I had made in terms of volume and supply chain and why the ramp that perhaps is not what you would have expected. So talk about volume first, so we're in very good place from a restaurant perspective, hospitality and healthcare as we said in the past, we do expect volume to recover, but the timing is a bit uncertain, right, I mean healthcare has flat-lined a little bit driven by senior living. We expect demographic trends are extremely favorable, but it will take time for healthcare to recover. And with hospitality, similarly, we've seen a recovery on the leisure side of things, there's other parts of hospitality that have not yet recovered and will take some time. So that's a little bit of the volume story. On the operational expense side primarily in distribution. As Bill mentioned, the percent of workers in our buildings, and you've heard this from others in the industry is abnormally high and it just takes time to get those new associates to the level of productivity that then drives meaningfully lower cost per case. And those two factors in addition to the Q1 Omicron impact that Dirk referred too, what is driving perhaps a ramp that is not one you might have - one might have modeled or expected.\nEdward Kelly: Okay. And then just a follow-up Pietro for you, can you maybe just take a step back for us and talk about some of the strategic adjustments that we're making to the business. So there's been talk maybe about the CLO in the press, obviously there has been a pressure, could use some more supply chain management muscle. Strategically right, are you making any adjustments to things that you plan to do [technical difficulty] pressure can create to rethink, right. So I'm just kind of curious what's changing on that front?\nPietro Satriano: Sure. And maybe what I'll do add is add a little bit of color to the three things I talked about earlier that are really increase our level of confidence in the plan, and I said to Kelly earlier, reduce the execution risk. So the first is this operating model, historically, when we drove an initiative, things might get regionalized or customized in a way that kind of slow things down and what these operations and commercial excellence teams have set inside Bill and Andrew's area is they drive best practices, and for example, we have, I call them, the assortments are Brett Wilson and that's all he does and he works with the field to put that in place. And so we've seen progress on those initiatives and standardization unlike what we've seen before. So that operating model is really critical, that's been extremely well received by the field. So that's number one. Talent, so you've heard from Bill today, Bill has on his team new logistics person, new continuous improvement person, new technology person comes from Amazon. So the people, the new folks on my team have brought with them some really good talent and that's going to change the trajectory. And then the third is having more of an agile approach when we launched these initiatives, making sure we prototype and iterate, get customer feedback, that's embedded in the operating model and that's something else that is we're going to adopt. And all three of those changes the talent, the op model and the agile approach is, we really put in place early in 2021 and based on reflection of our results leading to COVID what we could do to improve our results from there.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Mark Carden from UBS. Your line is open.\nMark Carden: Thanks a lot for taking my questions. Building on some of the prior questions from the 1.5x growth on the restaurants. We're seeing really all the major players anticipating pretty considerable levels of growth on that front. Are you expecting your share gains to come primarily from smaller distributors with fewer resources? Are you seeing these players facing more pressure given the latest COVID wave or would you expect some of the gains that's come from some larger players as well? Thanks.\nPietro Satriano: So thanks for the question. Maybe I'll pass it on to Andrew who is again responsible for driving our commercial initiatives on the local side of the business and the emphasis on kind of new versus existing customers. Andrew?\nAndrew Iacobucci: Yes, thanks. Thanks Pietro and thanks Mark for the question. Yes, as Pietro says, we really have a balanced approach to growing our case growth across not only obviously significant new customers but also improving our penetration of existing. And both are equally important as is preventing churn within our existing customer base. So all three of those things in balance are going to be the ways in which we go after the business, and our focus is really on delivering customer value more than specifically targeting one competitor or another as we look to drive that business forward.\nMark Carden: And then can you remind us of where online penetration stands today. As we hopefully emerge from the pandemic, do you think there is still much room to grow penetration in the near- to intermediate-term or are you just getting closer to maturity on the proportion of your business that can - you can do digitally just given your head start on that front? Thanks.\nPietro Satriano: Yes. So we're at 80% today and we still see opportunity to grow that. In fact, we are working on our next release for our digital platform, which is being piloted right now and been very well received. And as I talked about further supplementing that is our marketplace, which helps creates an added reason to go to our digital platform.\nOperator: Your next question is from Alex Slagle from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nAlex Slagle: Want to follow up on some of the previous comments around the growth expectations relative to the market. I think we kind of know the reasons, but I mean those other non-restaurant segment kind of what makes it so hard to outpace the market there and what are some of the opportunities to maybe see some better share gains in those categories?\nDirk Locascio: Good question. I think that when we - maybe I'll focus primarily on when you talk about the non-restaurants and healthcare and hospitality which are our target customer types, because there are a number of things that show up in the marketplace that are not our focus. So with healthcare and hospitality, we have a strong presence there, we have a differentiated offering with people. So our expectation there is to grow a little bit above the market in those spaces where it's our focus area and other areas like local school, so K through 12 is an area where it has added complexity, they tend to not be as profitable et cetera and we would expect to grow below the market there. So the way to think about it is even though it's at market, it's an expectation of above market and are more attractive target customer types and below market and those that are less attractive in order to optimize the value that we generate.\nAlex Slagle: Makes sense. And on the new national business, how much of this $1 billion that you gain or won in '20 and '21, how much of that comes online in '22 in terms of the magnitude, I know you hadn't really had the staffing all in place so maybe that held it back some in '21?\nDirk Locascio: Not a lot of it. Most of it has been in some through '20 or '21. The other thing on the national I guess that I would just add in is that the thing that we're excited about is our pipeline on these attractive national customers is just as strong for this time of year as it's been the last two years. And so when we talk about just attractively adding in especially healthcare hospitality chains. We're bullish about our ability to continue to attract net new customers.\nAlex Slagle: And just a quick clarification on the '24 guide that assumes accretive tuck-in M&A, is there a magnitude of accretion baked into about $3.40 EPS target?\nDirk Locascio: It does not assume tuck-in M&A. So this is an all-organic plan and just because we've talked about being more opportunistic, what we decided to focus on was the organic and the way we would deploy our cash. And in those cases, if we have the right tuck-ins that come in, they would be incremental.\nOperator: We have time for two more questions. Your next question is from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJohn Ivankoe: I was wondering if some of the conversations with restaurants may have shifted to more value-added products that would allow them to reduce the use of labor further in their own operations or whether using exclusive brands or whether using manufacturer brands, if that is an opportunity that you have, I guess specifically now and whether an opportunity like that would fit into some of the SKU or assortment reductions that you've discussed?\nPietro Satriano: Good morning, John. Yes, so one of the major thrust of our school program has been on labor saving products, we believe that with the resources that support those the salespeople and the restaurant operations consultants is some that truly distinguishes us versus our competitors in the industry and one that has been really welcomed by our customers.\nJohn Ivankoe: And in terms of exiting - in terms of reduction in the overall assortment that you plan to offer. I know you've quoted some percent there?\nPietro Satriano: Yes so, as I said earlier, John, really good success this year probably better than a number of years combined leading into this year and a lot of that credit goes to the operating model we put in place. We have goals to further optimize the assortment focusing on the duplication that exists within a DC or some of the harder to manage tail items with the lower value customers where we don't necessarily get the return from them and that we can build strong on the supply chain side harder. Again not ready to disclose any specific goals but definitely meaningful reduction as part of our playbook going forward.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jake Bartlett from Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nJake Bartlett: Thanks for taking the questions and sneaking me in here. My first was on really the trends what we might think of transitory costs in 2021. We've heard from others as well and there's over time, there's maybe temporary staffing costs, there's bonuses that I think probably [technical difficulty]\nOperator: Jake you cut out. [Operator Instructions] Your line is open, Mr. Bartlett.\nJake Bartlett: Great. Sorry I'm not sure what happened there. The question is on the transitory costs that I would have thought would be in 2021 and others have talked about significant costs around over time, the bonuses you talked about, but do you see any kind of something that wouldn't recur or maybe temporary staffing agencies using those, but where is that reflected in the spreads and looking at the bridge from 2021 to '24 EBITDA. Would that be captured in OpEx efficiencies as I just don't see kind of a bar there what I might expect as you kind of lap some of those kind of one-time costs?\nDirk Locascio: Sure. Good question, Jake. I think that - so yes, it is in the OpEx efficiency line there. I think when you think about our transitory temporary type of costs as our peers have talked about it. The level that we incurred in the fourth quarter is not dissimilar to theirs, call them in the neighborhood of $40 million, maybe $50 million. So very similar and that comes from whether it's temporary staffing, the additional training hours, the signing and retention bonuses, all those kinds of things as you would think about in there and that we would expect as you called out to go away, as we continue to get our individuals that have been on more productive and staffed up to a more normal level as we go ahead.\nJake Bartlett: Great, thanks. My next question is about the gross profit per case. Obviously very strong I think you saw this in 2016, it seems like that's been driven in part by just supply chain disruption driving really strong pricing power for you and your peers, but how sustainable is that? I'm thinking about, I mean that could be a risk given especially if we see some deflation from product cost, but how confident are you that what looks to become an outsized gross profit per case you really can continue long-term?\nDirk Locascio: We do think that gross profits do stay stronger over the longer-term than they were historically in part because of meaningful portion of this inflation is likely to stay, but also labor costs are different than they were a few years back. So as you pointed out, it's hard to say exactly the amount as we see what plays out with inflation, deflation. But I think over time we do expect through the processes, the margin improvements we've had from individual customers et cetera that we expect gross profit to remain stronger and TBD on exactly where it lands and the same I think would be the case for the broader industry.\nJake Bartlett: Great. And then my last question is just on the customer segments, and looking at a chart on the Page 16, looking at those lines and as I eyeball it, looks like kind of all other which I believe in Foods chain restaurants a big chunk of it really is negative - reversing of wrapping a negative and it really accelerated sharply on a two-year basis. One, it seems like maybe those numbers are kind of not adjusted for the operating week in the fourth quarter '21 and are in '20, but just if you could talk about the trajectory of that big slice of the customer base, really what's happening there. I would have thought that some of the gains that the $1 billion in new business would have come in that customer type as well kind of help each other to grow cases there?\nDirk Locascio: That would be - so you're right, that would include some of the chain and that would help that. The other thing that, again as that I would call out is, school volumes have continued to remain lower than they were before. I think the other thing is it does cloud that as you go through 2020 into really the middle of 2021 is some of the retail support business that we and others picked up. And in our case, we picked up, and most of that had temporary in the sense was gone by the end of 2020, we did have some portion that remained kind of in through the earlier part of Q3 and that is fully gone now. Those are the main reasons for it.\nOperator: I would like to turn the call back to Pietro Satriano.\nPietro Satriano: So thanks everyone for tuning in. Appreciate all the questions. Hopefully, you have the same level of excitement and energy and a better level of understanding about our plans. Again apologies for the delay earlier today, and we look forward to continuing our conversations.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dirk Locascio",
            "content": "Thank you, Pietro and good morning. I'll give a brief recap on 2021 and then discuss our financial outlook for 2022 and 2024 and I'll start on Page 6. Fourth quarter financial results were in line with our expectations. Our Q4 and fiscal year 2021 results were significant improvement over prior year and we ended the year with a solid foundation for further growth. Q4 net sales were $7.6 billion, which was an increase of 32% over the prior year and you'll likely recall that Q4 2020 had an extra week, which increased that period sales approximately 700 basis points. The 32% growth excludes the extra week. Total case growth increased 13% and 21% for independent restaurants. We produced very strong gross profit dollar growth again this quarter, with our highest gross profit per case of the year as our team very effectively managed inflation and optimized pricing more broadly. This caps a strong year as fiscal 2021 GP per case was the highest we've had since becoming a public company. Supply chain challenges continue through Q4 similar to others in our industry. Despite these challenges, we remain fully staffed in almost all markets and are continuing to build staffing for expected volume growth acceleration this year. We remain focused on increasing productivity of those hired in recent months. As Bill noted, we've seen improvement in productivity during Q4 and expect further improvements in 2022, reaching 2019 productivity levels around midyear. Our supply chain cost was higher in Q4 than Q3, mainly due to more associates earning sign on a retention bonuses, inflation, hiring and preparation for continued volume increases and retaining additional staff as a bit of an insurance policy. We successfully refinanced $2.7 billion of debt in 2021, taking advantage of attractive market conditions to further strengthen our balance sheet by extending tenure and replacing more of our secured floating-rate debt with unsecured fixed rate debt. And finally, we significantly improved our debt leverage this year with a three turn reduction and leveraged to 4.6 times at year-end. On Slide 7, as I mentioned, Q4 net sales increased 32% over 2020, and within sales, volume grew 13% excluding the extra week in 2020; food inflation was 14.4% and the remainder was related to sales mix. Our independent restaurant volume increased 20% excluding the extra week and we saw acceleration earlier in the quarter before Omicron impacts which bodes well for 2022. Q4 ends a year of significant sales and volume improvement over 2020. Full year total volume was up 19% and independent volume of 30%, each excluding the extra week in 2020. Adjusted EBITDA was $262 million for the quarter, a 51% increase over the prior year, we estimate the extra week in Q4 of 2020 increased EBITDA by $8 million, so excluding the extra week, adjusted EBITDA for Q4 increased 58% over prior year. Q4 adjusted EBITDA as a percent of sales increased to 3.4%. For the full year, our adjusted EBITDA increased 65% and EBITDA margin increased 70 basis points compared to 2020. We did experienced limited impact from Omicron in December and the more significant impact is in Q1 2022 which we think will be temporary. The Q4 P&L outcome was largely in line with our expectations, no real surprises in the way the quarter played out. Adjusted diluted EPS for Q4 was $0.38 and full year $1.55 per share, each up significantly over the prior year. And lastly, specific to Food Group, most of the integration was completed by the end of 2021. We have the last system conversion plan for this coming weekend and we are on track and confident to achieve the $65 million in synergies. Future discussions of Food Group will be incorporated into our discussions of the overall business. Operating cash flow for the fiscal year was $419 million, similar to prior year. In 2021 working capital was $300 million plus use of cash, as a result of receivables growth due to the significant growth in sales. While 2020 had the benefit of approximately $200 million working capital reduction due to lower sales. Our business has historically generated a significant amount of operating cash flow and we expect to grow that cash flow with EBITDA over time. And as I've already highlighted, we further strengthened our balance sheet as we decreased our leverage in fiscal 2021 to 4.6 times and we are well on our way toward our target net leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3 times. Turning to 2022, we expect continued increases in volume and earnings through the execution of our strategic initiatives to grow market share, increased gross margins and improved operational efficiencies. One point to call out is you will hear me talk about a higher 2022 adjusted diluted EPS range than we initially included in our press release earlier this morning. The numbers I'm talking about are correct and the press release has been updated to reflect these numbers. We expect to grow volume at 1.5 times the market for restaurants and grow at market for the remaining customer types. We expect to deliver to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of adjusted EBITDA and $1.95 to $2.25 adjusted diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2022. Omicron appears to be largely in the rearview mirror, however, it has had a meaningful impact on volume and supply chain costs in Q1 and likely to a more limited extent in Q2. We also plan to continue to temporarily carry additional supply chain headcount to ensure adequate staffing and service levels in the event of another impact from COVID. Our outlook range reflects these Omicron related costs and impacts, which we estimate at $80 million to $90 million. Going forward, we are optimistic about the continued rapid recovery of our business post on Omicron. If the U.S. does not have another significant COVID wave, we expect to be at the higher end of the earnings range, the lower end of the range takes into account the possibility of another similar wave. Specific to Q1 2022 and the Omicron impact, we are experiencing reduced volume and incremental supply chain costs. We've seen volume improve the last couple of weeks and are very encouraged it will continue to improve through Q1. Client appears to mostly be driven by customer staffing challenges and believe that the end customer demand will be robust as Omicron subsides. Historically, our Q1 EBITDA is lower than other quarters of the year at approximately 20% of our annual EBITDA dollars. With most of the Omicron impact expected in Q1, we expect Q1 EBITDA to be a lower percent of our full year EBITDA than normal this year. Assuming there's not another significant wave and macro volume improvement occurs, especially in healthcare and hospitality, we expect volume to return to 2019 levels sometime in half two. In 2022, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins to improve over fiscal 2021, along with continued strong gross profit per case and increased operational efficiencies. We continue to expect supply chain productivity to return to 2019 levels midyear and surpass by year-end. We're focused on returning our adjusted EBITDA margin to pre-COVID levels and increasing it further in the coming years. Prior to the pandemic, we grew EBITDA margins 90 basis points or 25% improvement from 2015 to 2019 and expect to build upon that track record. We're also providing additional guidance on interest expense and CapEx, cash CapEx. As we significantly increased earnings in 2022, we expect to further reduce debt and as a result, be near 3.5 times leverage by year-end. As Pietro said, we're executing a multiyear plan to deliver significant earnings growth from the combination of profitable volume growth and margin expansion. As we look further ahead to 2024, we expect to continue growing at 1.5 times the market for restaurants and at market for other customer types. We expect adjusted EBITDA to grow at roughly - grow to roughly $1.5 billion in 2023 and then reach approximately $1.7 billion in 2024 as a result of executing our balanced plan. We will likely be near or at 2019 EBITDA margins in 2023 and then exceed in 2024 as we return to an expectation of EBITDA margin improvement each year. Adjusted diluted EPS is estimated to be approximately $3.40 in 2024. CapEx is estimated at 1.3% to 1.4% of sales. With respect to leverage, we plan to reach our target leverage range of 2.5 times to 3 times in 2023 and remain in that range. As we approach the range, we will further evaluate return of capital options, such as share repurchases. Our focus is on executing the plan to achieve these 2024 targets. However, beyond 2024, we would likely expect a 6% to 7% adjusted EBITDA growth algorithm. I like to reiterate the relative contributions of the various pillars of our strategy as they contribute to our expected EBITDA growth. While we won't be breaking down the quantified impact of each initiative, we have provided impacts for each bucket of the plan which reflect the combined contribution of initiatives that Pietro, Andrew and Bill discussed. We expect to generate nearly $650 million of adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2024 compared to 2021. We expect the contributions of our increased earnings to be significant, for each of these pillars. Volume is expected to contribute an estimated $290 million, gross margin expansion approximately $325 million and OpEx efficiency approximately $235 million, which is incremental to the $130 million of fixed cost reductions completed in 2020. Then we have annual OpEx cost inflation that we must mitigate through productivity and gross margin increases. OpEx inflation is estimated to total about $210 million over the three years. Pietro, Andrew and Bill covered the key drivers in each pillar, so I won't repeat them. We successfully grew independent restaurants at approximately 2x the market rate and increased gross margin per case more than OpEx per case driving operating leverage gains over multiple years pre-pandemic, so we know how to do this well. Our new operating model gives us line of sight through initiatives already underway to improve execution on cost reduction. And as you've heard, we are especially focused on supply chain where we have new leadership with strong capabilities. We are confident in our ability to deliver strong adjusted EBITDA growth via continued share gains, further gross margin improvement and a more intense focus on operational efficiency. These increased earnings will produce strong and growing cash flows, which we can then prudently allocate to reinvest in the business, reduce leverage, return capital to shareholders and opportunistically pursue tuck-in M&A. We estimate this will lead to adjusted diluted EPS of approximately $3.40 per share, which is more than a 40% increase over FY 2019. Pietro back to you. Sure. Thank you, John. Good morning and good question. So our job, first of all and what we're focused on is executing our plan which generates as you heard us talk about meaningful value based on a combination of margin expansion of volume growth. We're not going to speculate specifically and how much for the progress of things that are outside of our control i.e., others, peers, but this plan does include additional margin expansion on top of what we've done in recent years. And I can say, we expected the plan to generate over $600 million and 40% higher adjusted diluted EPS in 2019 and we're confident we'll deliver value through the combination of this volume growth and margin expansion. So the range - so when you get to 2024, it's a little bit higher than it was, say in 2019. And so very similar I think to the point of maybe a tenth and that contemplates some modest increase potentially for some - beginning up some warehouse automation et cetera, but it is not an extremely heavy capital-intensive plan out there other than again some limited areas. So we expect to continue to generate strong cash flows. Morning John, this is Dirk. Good question, I think that - so the reason we stayed away from specific numbers is that's more feasible and don't want to be accurate during a more stable period, in a period of recovery like this. Really what our focus is relative to what the market does and it's really growing with especially our key target customers of the restaurants, and within there, especially the independents, meaningfully faster as we have done. And then at least that market with the target customer type. So although we haven't given a specific number, that really is - it's kind of indexed to how Technomic is calling for the outlook and would expect again meaningful growth on that. So no it's not a specific number, but that's how we thought about why we're focused on relative to the market and others. Sure. So on the volume growth, we look at your point - we do look at new volume higher than our overall EBITDA margins, it really is dependent on the specific customer types, as you remember, our independents were the most profitable on healthcare and hospitality. But the chain business that we brought on has been meaningfully more profitable than that we've had in the past which has allowed us to be more opportunistic with our growth there. So we do expect it to be higher than our overall EBITDA number. With respect to your gross margin, you're right, procurement is a meaningful part that is within there. I think the other two things that I would call out and talk about that at least one of them Andrew talked about is pricing and customer profitability optimization. So some of it is from the tool that he talked about, some of it comes from the success that we are have and expect to continue to have with lower margin, large customer improvements. And then the third piece is around logistics. So our inbound logistics, optimizing that's another form of cost of goods, but it's about optimizing our inbound cost of goods and that is a key focus areas for us as well. So those are the key largest pieces of it. Thank you. A good question and yes you're correct, the $1.5 billion is what I noted for 2023. And I think that, to your point, the '23 have a lot of recovery, it still occurs whether it be the rebound from the - as you heard me talk about the meaningful amount of Omicron impact this year as well as healthcare and hospitality recovery, which is likely not fully back to normal this year. I think as we get further through that, we see more of the initiatives take hold across gross margin around the fresh accelerators of volume that Andrew talked about in the supply chain improvements there. So there's not a single thing that I would call out as opposed to continued execution and feeling good about our ability to deliver the $1.7 billion. Sure. Good question. You're right, so we're happy to be - expect to be in that range next year and then stay there. As I said, we'll explore other returns similar to we've talked about in the past, more likely, starting with share repurchases as we get closer to the range, we'll do that work. For assumptions here, we've assumed some levels of repurchases beginning and look forward to hearing more from us as we get closer to that range. Sure. Good morning, Kelly. Appreciate the question. So I think in the prior Investor Day that was more focused on the near-term and some of the opportunities there. Really the intent, since our focus right now is on executing this plan through 2024, which you've heard us say multiple times, we're excited and expect a significant value creation from it. The 2024, you're right, the 6% to 7% was really to give people a sense and post that we will obviously refine it as we get closer to there, but really to indicate more that we do expect meaningful growth to continue as we get beyond 2024. Thank you. Good morning. I think when we think of it, really all three of the buckets we think of as a pretty steady stream. And I say that because a number of things that you heard, Andrew and Bill each talk about an example, maybe I'll build on those. So the example on whether it's routing for example, there is a shorter-term impact and then there's a longer-term impact that's enabled by additional technology and process. Pricing has it similar with some of the things we're doing around pricing and customer optimization now, and then that's enabled further by the enhanced pricing tool that is an upgrade over the one that we've had in place for a number of years. So as we look ahead, really each of those, there isn't a hockey stick or extremely different phasing as opposed to we expect incremental value to come out of all of them over the three years. So we were at about 34% of sales from private brand for this year, which we do include that in our 10-K. And I think that what I'll just build on what Pietro talked about earlier is that is an area that is both with smaller, with the independents as well as the national customers, an area of focus for us and a value driver in our plan for the next three years. If you remember, we grew, call it, 70 to 100 basis points in the multiple years leading up to it. We've talked about that we don't see a ceiling of a lot of opportunities so that remains an area of focus for us. And especially in this timeframe with the inflation because it tends to be a double win from a customer perspective, it's a better value, and for us, it is higher margin. Sure. Thanks, good morning. I think when - so my crystal ball is probably going to be just as accurate as anybody else's since we're not quite sure exactly how it plays out. A couple of things I will tell you from the data points as we look at it is, the year-over-year inflation as we go back over the past few quarters, sequential inflation quarter-to-quarter has slowed each of the quarters, which is we think as a positive toward hopefully price stabilization. We would expect inflation to remain higher here in 2022 with likely some incremental inflation here in the earlier part of the year and additional stabilization as we get further into the year. I think the thing that's hard to predict for anybody is it then just stagnated and stay at that higher level or do you see any kind of reduction in that going forward. As you said, maybe I'll start and then hand it over to Bill for any insights on the driver pipeline. But ultimately, as you heard Bill talk about, we will continue to be staffed in the fourth quarter and we didn't use a lot of temporary resources but even further reduce that in the fourth quarter. So very optimistic on the progress that we've been seeing there. But Bill can comment more specifically on drivers. I think when we talk about inflation and sort of the wage inflation, we talked a lot about this last year and transitory has been a word that has been used in a lot of different ways. I think the way we talk from Q3 was the higher level of inflation, some of the temporary, some of it permanents, we'd likely transitory in the sense that we didn't think and don't think that becomes the new norm as opposed to some higher inflation and then we return to more normal levels. So what we had estimated on top of the normal $50 million or so of inflation that we see for supply chain and given here is an additional $40 million to $60 million annual impact with a combination of wage increases and signing and retention bonuses. We had indicated that we expect most of that to be permanent, our outlook on the range and on the ratio doesn't really - hasn't changed since then. What I'll tell you though is, when we talked about an expectation for covering most if not all of that through margin improvements with lower profitability customers. Our confidence is stronger than ever that we're able to do that as we've continued to see good progress. Bill, anything you want to add on or would you add on driver on warehouse staffing. Good morning, Laura. Yes that's correct. When we talk about pro forma, it's been in the context of how we've talked about it with you other analyst/investors that contemplates the synergies, inflation, new business wins et cetera and that's what we've then estimate it at. Thank you. It's many of the same elements we've talked about it. The combination of realizing a number of the synergies from the transactions, it is incremental with volume recovery, it is some of the wins with national sales, it is multiple years of cost inflation, it is the cost savings that you've mentioned. So really is all those things there and that's the way I think the way you maybe started is the way I would think about it as it's maybe not getting all the way back in the exact same way, but it's basically back to where the business was and sort of the platform for growth there beyond. Sure happy to do that. I think that when we look ahead, we know what's harder to predict is in the period of inflation that we're in what happens exactly on that and that really drives as you just alluded to what, how gross margins versus OpEx as a percent of sales play out, it doesn't change EBITDA impact. So I'd rather stay away from that, specifically what I will say though is, specific to our - when we look at our plan for 2024, what we expect to do is to get EBITDA margins sort of at or near 2019 levels in 2023 and then exceed those EBITDA margin levels in 2024 through the number of initiatives around operating efficiency as well as gross margin expansion. Sure happy too, and I'm going to actually... Thanks Lauren. Sure Ed. Good morning, good question. I think that couple of things I would highlight, one is really that when we, to your point, with that 1.2 to 1.3 as I commented that, absent another COVID wave like Omicron, we would expect to be at the higher end of that range. And so I think that and within that we've embedded roughly $80 million to $90 million of impact from Omicron, so that gives you a jumping point from where sort of that range is plus the additional amount. So we aren't going to talk today about specific amounts that we've embedded in there, but I think it is not an insignificant amount in the first half of the year especially as we're still working to get productivity back to 2019 similar to a number of our peers. I think that the thing that we are expecting is we expect steady improvements in our EBITDA versus 2019 as the year goes on and expect to make meaningful progress. And I think what you see from there is if we expect which we are roughly $1.5 billion of EBITDA next year, that means a healthy exit rate for this year. Good question. I think that when we - maybe I'll focus primarily on when you talk about the non-restaurants and healthcare and hospitality which are our target customer types, because there are a number of things that show up in the marketplace that are not our focus. So with healthcare and hospitality, we have a strong presence there, we have a differentiated offering with people. So our expectation there is to grow a little bit above the market in those spaces where it's our focus area and other areas like local school, so K through 12 is an area where it has added complexity, they tend to not be as profitable et cetera and we would expect to grow below the market there. So the way to think about it is even though it's at market, it's an expectation of above market and are more attractive target customer types and below market and those that are less attractive in order to optimize the value that we generate. Not a lot of it. Most of it has been in some through '20 or '21. The other thing on the national I guess that I would just add in is that the thing that we're excited about is our pipeline on these attractive national customers is just as strong for this time of year as it's been the last two years. And so when we talk about just attractively adding in especially healthcare hospitality chains. We're bullish about our ability to continue to attract net new customers. It does not assume tuck-in M&A. So this is an all-organic plan and just because we've talked about being more opportunistic, what we decided to focus on was the organic and the way we would deploy our cash. And in those cases, if we have the right tuck-ins that come in, they would be incremental. Sure. Good question, Jake. I think that - so yes, it is in the OpEx efficiency line there. I think when you think about our transitory temporary type of costs as our peers have talked about it. The level that we incurred in the fourth quarter is not dissimilar to theirs, call them in the neighborhood of $40 million, maybe $50 million. So very similar and that comes from whether it's temporary staffing, the additional training hours, the signing and retention bonuses, all those kinds of things as you would think about in there and that we would expect as you called out to go away, as we continue to get our individuals that have been on more productive and staffed up to a more normal level as we go ahead. We do think that gross profits do stay stronger over the longer-term than they were historically in part because of meaningful portion of this inflation is likely to stay, but also labor costs are different than they were a few years back. So as you pointed out, it's hard to say exactly the amount as we see what plays out with inflation, deflation. But I think over time we do expect through the processes, the margin improvements we've had from individual customers et cetera that we expect gross profit to remain stronger and TBD on exactly where it lands and the same I think would be the case for the broader industry. That would be - so you're right, that would include some of the chain and that would help that. The other thing that, again as that I would call out is, school volumes have continued to remain lower than they were before. I think the other thing is it does cloud that as you go through 2020 into really the middle of 2021 is some of the retail support business that we and others picked up. And in our case, we picked up, and most of that had temporary in the sense was gone by the end of 2020, we did have some portion that remained kind of in through the earlier part of Q3 and that is fully gone now. Those are the main reasons for it."

            "name": "Andrew Iacobucci",
            "content": "Thanks Pietro and good morning all. As Pietro mentioned, the commercial roadmap is focused on driving profitable market share growth and margin expansion and I'll highlight a few of the medium-term areas of focus under these pillars. The first under profitable market share is fresh leadership, which means taking advantage of an opportunity we see to stake out a clear leadership position in COP and produce among our broadline peers. By leveraging the sourcing scale and expertise in a Amerifresh and Ameristar, we are driving high-single digit improvements to cost of goods along with consistently high quality product and innovative assortment. In mid-2021, we launched FRESH CHECK, which is a 27 point produce inspection program that has yielded a double-digit improvement in product - produce performance in our pilot markets. Both COP and produce drive significant incrementality and customer loyalty. Customer research review of the inconsistent produce quality is the number one reason that customers choose to source from multiple suppliers and delivering high quality fresh is equally important to distributor selection in the first place. The second area of focus is strategic vendor management which entails strengthening our key vendor partnerships to ensure we're delivering best-in-class service and cost of goods. In a world of inflation, more and more opportunities have emerged for us to improve our cost position and we plan to pursue those by leveraging our scale, all the while balancing the lead to take advantage of newly formed regional or smaller player relationships that have flourished in today's supply constrained environment. Scale is a key lever for US Foods, which when combined with the right supplier value proposition creates sizable cost of goods opportunities. Strategic vendor management is a proven process for us with consistent meaningful year-over-year improvement over the past several years and our recent learnings have only increased this momentum as evidenced by mid-single digit COGS improvement in recent negotiations. The last focus area I'd like to mention is margin enhancement through next-generation pricing. We've recently announced a partnership with Zilliant, a market leading pricing platform that allows us to be more responsive to market changes by dynamically optimizing prices based on over a dozen different inputs to drive margin or volume as appropriate. This will significantly enhance our agility and will pave the way for continued margin and share of wallet opportunities. Development and integration with our existing systems could go underway with a multi-market pilot plan for the second half of 2022. Pietro back to you. Yes. Thanks for the question, Peter. I think we have a tremendous focus on growing our EB penetration, it's something we made great progress on pre-COVID and supply interruptions sort of stalled our progress, but it's great to see in Q4 resumption of pretty strong year-over-year growth and we anticipate that continuing to be an important part of our strategy over the next three years and beyond. Yes, thanks. Thanks Pietro and thanks Mark for the question. Yes, as Pietro says, we really have a balanced approach to growing our case growth across not only obviously significant new customers but also improving our penetration of existing. And both are equally important as is preventing churn within our existing customer base. So all three of those things in balance are going to be the ways in which we go after the business, and our focus is really on delivering customer value more than specifically targeting one competitor or another as we look to drive that business forward."

            "name": "Pietro Satriano",
            "content": "Thanks Melissa. Good morning, everyone, and apologies as well for the delay. Especially on a day where we've got so much to cover, so let's get into it. As you heard us say on the last call, our plans to drive continued value creation are centered on delivering against three financial outcomes, profitably grow share, expand gross margin and drive operational efficiency. In 2021, we made solid progress against those outcomes in the face of continued headwinds impacting the industry and our results in the fourth quarter clearly demonstrates the impact of these efforts. Today, we will present our long-range plan against those same financial outcomes. The plan covers the period from 2022 to 2024 and is anchored on the following strategy, setting ourselves apart on reliable service and fresh quality, continuing to offer differentiated solutions that help our customers make it, be it innovative products, digital commerce, expert resources and the only true omnichannel offering in our industry. And lastly, bringing an intense focus on cost reduction and operational efficiencies. Joining me for that discussion will be Andrew Iacobucci, Chief Commercial Officer and Bill Hancock Chief Supply Chain Officer. The Board and I have a high degree of confidence that our plan will deliver against the targets we are sharing today. So let me go to the takeaways for today's call, which are summarized on Slide 2. First, fourth quarter results were in line with the expectations that we outlined on our third quarter call. Strong execution resulted in a 58% increase and adjusted EBITDA compared to fourth quarter 2020. Second, throughout 2021, we continue to take actions that solidify the foundation of the business and put in place a new operating model that underpins our recent performance and gives us great confidence in our ability to grow EBITDA from here. And third, we are presenting a long-range plan that generates $1.7 billion in adjusted EBITDA in 2024. This plan reflects a combination of initiatives that are underway and the continued recovery of our industry. Let's move to Slide 3 with a brief review of our 2021 highlights. Starting with the first pillar of profitable market share gains, which increased across all target customer types. The biggest increase came in nationally managed business, which includes healthcare, hospitality and national and regional chains. The team has won approximately $1 billion in new business over the last two years, net of optimizing lower margin business. On the independent restaurant side, we also saw year-on-year market share gains. Contributing to our share gains was a solid service foundation. Based on monthly research with 4,000 customers, our net promoter score on service indicate that we are faring same or better than our major competitors. Our differentiated offerings and continued enhancements to our digital strategy also contributed to our market share gains. A good example of which is our online marketplace or US Foods Direct, which saw sales increase of four-fold year-on-year. Moving to the second pillar of optimizing gross margins. This is where we had the greatest success, with gross profit per case, the highest it has been since 2016. Contributing to this were our continued efforts to optimize our portfolio of customers. We drove a 110 basis point increase in private brand penetration compared to the same quarter a year ago and we continued to successfully pass on inflation to both contract and non-contract customers. The third pillar, operational efficiency, is where we are intensely focused. On selling and administrative expenses, we fully realize the cost saves we put in place in August 2020 aside from reinvestments in our sales force. Distribution cost per case has been significantly impacted by industry-wide staffing and turnover challenges and higher than historical wage increases that every company has faced. Our goal over time is to completely offset the headwinds on distribution cost per case through a combination of gross margin optimization and productivity initiatives. Over the last three months, as a result of our efforts, we've seen turnover improve and we've reduced the time to full productivity for new selectors, which ultimately will result in lower costs. And lastly, we made changes to strengthen our leadership in almost one-third of our distribution centers. The biggest foundational change we made was to our operating model, reducing the number of regions to four and creating operations and commercial excellence teams dedicated to driving standardization more effectively and more quickly than before. We are already seeing the results, as illustrated by our 15% reduction in assortment last year. I will now turn to our 2024 long-range plan, a plan that has been developed over the course of last year. The plan is expected to increase EBITDA to $1.7 billion in 2024, a $650 million increase over 2021 and $250 million over 2019 pro forma. This increase comes from a combination of volume growth and EBITDA margin expansion. The initiatives you see here represent the most significant ones and our combination of programs that are successfully created shareholder value in the past with some new initiatives, which we've been piloting this year. I will introduce each of the pillars and ask my colleagues to elaborate on some of the newer ones. Starting with profitable market share, which we expect to account for roughly 40% of the EBITDA growth. Profitable growth starts by offering reliable, consistent service and consistent quality on fresh. Our customer research indicates that no broad liner does this consistently well, which is why we see this as a big opportunity. Reliable service and quality then enables us to engage customers on those differentiated solutions that truly set us apart and have fueled our consistent market share gains heading into the pandemic. And last but not least, our omnichannel offering consisting of CHEF STORE and US Foods Direct both of which have enormous growth potential that we are investing in. After opening two stores in 2021, we are set to accelerate our store opening program having secured the real estate to open four to six stores in 2022. Turning next to the pillar of gross margin, which we expect to generate around 40% of the EBITDA growth. Optimizing gross margin is an area in which we have excelled over the years, generating 83 basis point increase, excluding acquisitions and the full years leading to COVID through some of the programs that you see here. I'm now going to call on Andrew Iacobucci to highlight - to give you a highlight or two from each of the market share and gross margin pillars. Andrew was appointed Chief Commercial Officer in April 2021. He joined as Chief Merchant in 2017 and is responsible for a significant portion of the gross margin expansion over that period. Andrew, over to you. Thanks Andrew. I will now move to the third pillar of operational efficiency. Over the years, we have done a lot of good work on reducing selling and administrative expenses, which represent about a third of our operating expenses. But we also recognize that operations remains a big opportunity, and one on which we are intensely focused. Our opportunity is to reduce operating costs by bringing a greater standardization and process discipline in the short-term while exploring opportunities for automation over the longer-term. That is why we hired Bill Hancock, our Chief Supply Chain Officer. Bill joined in November of 2020 and brings deep experience in all aspects of operations from warehousing, to last mile delivery, to automation. Since joining, Bill has assembled a terrific team bringing talent from a number of best-in-class companies, logistics and warehouse automation. Bill? Thanks Bill. As you can see Bill brings tremendous focus, experience and leadership to our operations. I will now turn the call over to Dirk to discuss our results for the fourth quarter and the year as well as to provide more color on the long-range plan, I just covered. Dirk, over to you. Thanks Dirk. I hope you all share in our excitement in our long-range plan and what the future holds for US Foods. Our plan is bold, achievable and it builds on a very strong foundation. The progress we have made, the initiatives currently underway and our talented and dedicated team of leaders and frontline associates give me great confidence that we will deliver on the plan we outlined and create significant value for our shareholders. We will now open the call for Q&A. So we do anticipate further reduction in the assortment over the course of time and that helps in a number of ways, that helps provide better service to the customers by reducing the volatility that you see typically in the slower moving part of the tail and it also helps streamline operations, which helps contribute to improved distribution cost per case. Yes. We - obviously, we have our internal targets, but we're not prepared to discuss them on this call. Maybe I'll pass that to Andrew. He is really driven the EB growth of the last few years. So Andrew, how would you answer that. Yes. I think you've - good morning, Kelly. The main risks that we anticipate are more external and macro focused, whether it's new variance or economic conditions from an internal execution perspective, we feel very confident in our ability to execute. In part because of some of the things we've mentioned, we're in some ways a bit of a different company from three or four years ago, thanks to having prototypes some of these initiatives and the results we see, the impact of the operating model that I talked about and some of the talent that we've brought into the company. Sure. Good morning, Jeffrey. We - it's a blend of what we expect on the independent restaurant and the national chain side. If you go back to the four years leading to COVID, we pretty consistently performed at twice the market from an independent restaurant perspective and so the 1.5 is in part based on that experience. And on the restaurant side, as we've talked about, we've had really good success. So on the chain side of the restaurant business, we've had really good success over the last couple of years. And when we look at our pipeline, we expect that to continue probably on the lower side of the 1.5, which is how we get to that blend. So I'll start with the consumer side and then turn it over to Dirk in terms of what we expect. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've been very successful in terms of passing on inflation both to non-contract and contract customers. I think the general environment has made it possible to have conversations in off cycle that we normally wouldn't have. And you've seen that those increases reflected in menu prices as dine-out or take-out. One of the things that perhaps a little bit different than historically is when we look at inflation in our channel relative to inflation in the grocery channel, it's been roughly the same. In fact, over the last few months, inflation in the grocery channel has been even higher than inflation in our channel. So we're not disadvantaged from that position, consumers FTE they may change a little bit the mix of what the based on inflation, but the two channels have kind of stayed consistent with each other. Dirk, do you want to talk about the expectations going forward. Yes, I think that, sorry, go ahead, Dirk. Dirk can I add a little bit in terms of some of the points I had made in terms of volume and supply chain and why the ramp that perhaps is not what you would have expected. So talk about volume first, so we're in very good place from a restaurant perspective, hospitality and healthcare as we said in the past, we do expect volume to recover, but the timing is a bit uncertain, right, I mean healthcare has flat-lined a little bit driven by senior living. We expect demographic trends are extremely favorable, but it will take time for healthcare to recover. And with hospitality, similarly, we've seen a recovery on the leisure side of things, there's other parts of hospitality that have not yet recovered and will take some time. So that's a little bit of the volume story. On the operational expense side primarily in distribution. As Bill mentioned, the percent of workers in our buildings, and you've heard this from others in the industry is abnormally high and it just takes time to get those new associates to the level of productivity that then drives meaningfully lower cost per case. And those two factors in addition to the Q1 Omicron impact that Dirk referred too, what is driving perhaps a ramp that is not one you might have - one might have modeled or expected. Sure. And maybe what I'll do add is add a little bit of color to the three things I talked about earlier that are really increase our level of confidence in the plan, and I said to Kelly earlier, reduce the execution risk. So the first is this operating model, historically, when we drove an initiative, things might get regionalized or customized in a way that kind of slow things down and what these operations and commercial excellence teams have set inside Bill and Andrew's area is they drive best practices, and for example, we have, I call them, the assortments are Brett Wilson and that's all he does and he works with the field to put that in place. And so we've seen progress on those initiatives and standardization unlike what we've seen before. So that operating model is really critical, that's been extremely well received by the field. So that's number one. Talent, so you've heard from Bill today, Bill has on his team new logistics person, new continuous improvement person, new technology person comes from Amazon. So the people, the new folks on my team have brought with them some really good talent and that's going to change the trajectory. And then the third is having more of an agile approach when we launched these initiatives, making sure we prototype and iterate, get customer feedback, that's embedded in the operating model and that's something else that is we're going to adopt. And all three of those changes the talent, the op model and the agile approach is, we really put in place early in 2021 and based on reflection of our results leading to COVID what we could do to improve our results from there. So thanks for the question. Maybe I'll pass it on to Andrew who is again responsible for driving our commercial initiatives on the local side of the business and the emphasis on kind of new versus existing customers. Andrew? Yes. So we're at 80% today and we still see opportunity to grow that. In fact, we are working on our next release for our digital platform, which is being piloted right now and been very well received. And as I talked about further supplementing that is our marketplace, which helps creates an added reason to go to our digital platform. Good morning, John. Yes, so one of the major thrust of our school program has been on labor saving products, we believe that with the resources that support those the salespeople and the restaurant operations consultants is some that truly distinguishes us versus our competitors in the industry and one that has been really welcomed by our customers. Yes so, as I said earlier, John, really good success this year probably better than a number of years combined leading into this year and a lot of that credit goes to the operating model we put in place. We have goals to further optimize the assortment focusing on the duplication that exists within a DC or some of the harder to manage tail items with the lower value customers where we don't necessarily get the return from them and that we can build strong on the supply chain side harder. Again not ready to disclose any specific goals but definitely meaningful reduction as part of our playbook going forward. So thanks everyone for tuning in. Appreciate all the questions. Hopefully, you have the same level of excitement and energy and a better level of understanding about our plans. Again apologies for the delay earlier today, and we look forward to continuing our conversations."

            "content": "Thanks Pietro. Building off a strong exit from 2021, our supply chain team has narrowed our focus to a set of critical initiatives that will deliver continued growth and higher profitability in 2022 and beyond. I'll highlight two of those areas. First, is our work on the foundation of our operations, which focuses on providing our teams the best training and technology available to provide a reliable service platform and reduce cost. We've reduced our trainee to trainer ratio for new associates and we've launched a network-wide driver training program to create their own pipeline of CDL drivers. We're also providing all supply chain leaders more advanced leadership training to accelerate the productivity ramp up with the high number of new associates. In 2021, we've resumed the rollout of new scanning technology for our warehouse teams. This new technology drives faster onboarding for new associates and has helped us capture up to a 5% productivity gain and reduce mispicks by 80%. The full network deployment of this technology is on pace to be completed by the close of the second quarter of this year. We've also fully deployed new proof of delivery devices for our drivers that has shortened driver training time and improved delivery scan rates by 130 basis points in support of more accurate invoicing. And while still early in our planning, this foundational work directly supports the build out of our warehouse automation in supply chain technology roadmap. The second highlight is the work behind our routing transformation. The initial phase of this work has focused on optimizing our current routing with pilot markets realizing a 6% improvement in cases per mile, while driving on-time delivery performance close to 90%. The next phase of this work will upgrade our routing technology enabling US Foods to offer dynamic delivery windows and real-time visibility to a customer order, both of which improved service and further reduced miles and cost. We're excited about the early results, these initiatives have delivered and we expect results to improve further over time. Lastly, I want to take an opportunity to thank our frontline associates for their tireless work and dedication for taking care of each other and our customers. We truly have the best team in the industry, and we are fully committed to helping all of our associates be successful. With that, I'll turn it back to Pietro. Yes, couple of key points, I would add. I would say like most supply chains, we've found ourselves behind in the first quarter of '21 on driver and warehouse staffing. We put a lot of very intentional work into how we recruit, how we hire, how we train intentional investments and sign on bonuses, wage adjustments to make sure that we're competitive and we saw the kind of the return on that work, which like Dirk said, we've come into 2022 fully staffed. Specific to drivers, we don't expect the shortage of drivers to go away anytime soon which is why we stood up our driver training program, but we can take an existing warehouse worker or somebody off the street and put them through a fully funded driver training program and create our own CDL pipeline. We're going to stay really close to that. Like I said, we expect continued volatility on the labor front and we're going to make sure we're prepared to staff our business."

Volume for the quarter was up 18% over prior year and 6% below 2019 as the industry continued to recover. EBITDA margins were up slightly as we continue to successfully manage through both higher-than-normal product and labor inflation. This performance resulted in strong cash generation, which contributed to further deleverage from the prior quarter. Since the industry is demonstrating that it is well on its way to recovery, we are shifting our discussions and our goals to be more in line with our pre -pandemic strategy.  First, to profitably grow market share with our Great Food Made Easy differentiation. Second, to optimize gross profit margins. And third, to execute with an intense focus on operational efficiency. But first, let me start, as I usually do, with a brief update on the industry on slide 3. Industry foot traffic at restaurants in the third quarter was largely in line with the prior quarter despite the surge in COVID cases due to Delta. This underscores our view that industry demand is resilient, and that demand for eating out or taking out at restaurants is largely past COVID. In fact, as seen by the chart on the right, Technomic is now calling for the entire industry to recover to pre-pandemic levels across restaurants and other customer types alike by 2024.  Based on our own current trends, we are confident that US Foods will recover ahead of the industry with our volume returning to 2019 levels some time in 2022. This reaffirms our continued ability to gain market share. Now let me turn to our volumes on slide 4. Restaurant volume for the third quarter was generally in line with the second quarter, and a slight dip in growth rate that you see in the third quarter is attributable to COVID-related staffing challenges in a handful of markets. If not for these challenges, we believe we would have achieved higher volume and market share gains, gains that are fueled by our differentiated Great Food Made Easy platform. October volumes to restaurants are trending slightly higher than the third quarter. Hospitality volume continues to recover, while volume to healthcare was flat for the reasons that I mentioned on our last call. Some lingering restrictions on visitors has hurt food consumption in hospitals, while Senior Living has yet to recover to pre-pandemic occupancy rates. We think recovery in Senior Living is simply a matter of time, given the favorable demographics of an aging population.  Lastly, we continue to have great success finding larger multi-geography customers across healthcare, hospitality, and chains. For the two years combining 2020 and 2021, we are on track to add $1 billion in net incremental business across these three customer types, some of whom will onboard in 2022. This $1 billion is net of any exits over the last 2 years, including strategic access as we continue to optimize our portfolio. The single most important reason cited by these large customers for switching to US Foods continues to be our service model, which makes it easier and simpler for customers to do business with us.  I will now update you on the elements of our strategy starting on Page 4 -- sorry, Page 5, with how Great Food Made Easy will continue to drive market share gains with target customers. Recall that Great Food Made Easy consists of 3 elements: Innovative products, industry-leading technology, and a selling and service model based on a team of experts that support our sellers, what we call team-based selling. Let's start with innovative products. We had yet another successful Scoop launch, featuring labor-saving products that are highly relevant to customers in this tight labor market.  This was the tenth anniversary of Scoop, and since then we have launched 540 exclusive, innovative products, of which 80% are still sold somewhere in our network, a remarkable stick rate. Also of note, on the product side during the quarter, we rolled out Tender by Design, an innovative and proprietary beef program that we inherited with the acquisition of Food Group. In the sub-category that we launched, we saw a 300-basis-point increase in market share, and we expect further market share gains as we expand the lineup. Turning to technology for the second element of Great Food Made Easy platform.  We continue to expand our leadership position with frequent releases of enhancements, including a recent update that provides customers with real-time inventory visibility during the ordering process, which is critical in this environment of supply volatility. Recent third-party research with customers reaffirmed our lead in technology in our industry with customers rating the US Foods mobile app significantly better with a Net Promoter Score several times higher than the competition.  Representative quotes from the survey include, easier to navigate, most logical setup, and able to show all breadth of products and ways to save money. Lastly, on the third element of our differentiation platform, our team of experts. Fast Company named US Foods one of the 95 brands that matter in recognition of the seminars, playbooks, and expertise that we delivered to customers to help them navigate the pandemic. Having now just covered how Great Food Made Easy is driving EBITDA growth and market share gains, I'm turning to page 6 to cover the second and third elements of our strategy that is optimizing gross profit margins and driving operational efficiency. Let's start with our efforts to optimize gross profit.  As Dirk will cover shortly, gross profit per case for the quarter was the highest it has been in recent years. Despite some headwinds from unfavorable customer and product mix, considering to this expansion in gross profit has been: First, our ability to manage and pass-through inflation; second, continued growth in private label brands; and third, the continued optimization of terms and customers in our portfolio. For the quarter, private label as a percent of total sales in our legacy US Foods broadline business was 36.6%, which represents almost 140-basis-point increase compared to Q3 of 2019.  And we still see plenty of opportunity for further growth in private label penetration, which will further expand gross profit margins. We also continue to optimize our portfolio of customers, negotiating better terms, bringing on new, more profitable business, but were warranted exiting customers at the low-end of the profitability range. For new business in healthcare, hospitality, and national chains that I referred to and that we brought on this year is coming in at margins that are 3 times higher than the existing base. Still on page 6, I want to update you on the third and last element of our strategy, an intense focus on operational efficiency. In supply chain, while the challenging labor environment persists, we have made significant progress in our hiring, and our headcount for drivers and selectors as now above 2019 and close to our staffing targets. The resulting high penetration of new warehouse and driver associates, not surprisingly, was a headwind to productivity in the quarter. But we do expect to return to 2019 productivity levels by mid-2022, as the tenure of the workforce returns to more normal levels.  In addition, we continue to make progress on our supply chain efficiency roadmap. Since the beginning of the year, we have reduced assortment by 15%, which not only contributes to higher service levels for customers but also to higher productivity in the warehouse. With staffing now in a better position, we have resumed the deployment of our new picking technology, which we started in 2019, and we now expect to complete that by the middle of 2022. This technology has demonstrated to improve productivity, especially of new associates, as well as service to customers.  And lastly, we have resumed the roll out of more efficient receiving methods, which we had also paused. On the delivery side, with greater stability on the customer ordering front, we can now put greater focus on continuing to optimize routing. Taken together, these efficiency initiatives will help bring distribution expense closer to historical levels. Lastly, on the sales and administrative side, we still expect to retain 2/3 of the $180 million in fixed cost savings that we announced last year, with most of the investment -- of the reinvestment showing up as an expansion in our sales force, which will drive market share.  We're very pleased with the level of sales talent we are attracting. Our tools, our unique products, and our culture make us a very attractive choice for sellers. I will now move to slide 7. For a quick update on the Smart Foodservice and SGA Food Group acquisitions, which are both performing at or above expectations. We call that, the rationale for the Smart Foodservice acquisition was two-fold: 1. The opportunity to expand our presence in the Cash & Carry market, which is growing at roughly twice the delivery market with higher margins. On that front, we continue to secure real estate for expansion into new geographies, and 2.  The revenue synergies that, come from existing customers in existing markets. The fact that, same-store sales at our nearly 80 Chef's Stores, open at least 1 year, are ahead of 2019 levels provides some support for that thesis. And on the synergy front, we are beginning to see reductions in cost of goods and improvements in private label penetration. Lastly, we expect 2021 EBITDA for our Cash & Carry business to exceed 2019. Turning now to Food Group. Recall at the rationale for that acquisition was to complete our footprint in the important and growing Pacific Northwest region.  It was note, we recently won a significant national customer due to our strong presence in the Pacific Northwest, which was the result of this acquisition. We have now completed 6 warehouse system conversions and all have gone fairly smoothly. We expect to have 7 warehouses completed by year-end and all complete by early '22 with the continued progress on integration, Synergy capture remains on track.  And by the end of 2021, we will have captured approximately $40 million of the projected $65 million in Synergies. And as I mentioned earlier, we are now starting to see some of the revenue benefits across the entire US Foods Network from centers plate capabilities that came with this acquisition. I will now like to turn the call over to Dirk to discuss our third quarter results and our outlook. Dirk.\nDirk Locascio: Thank you, Pietro. And good morning, everyone. I will start on Slide 9. Our third quarter financial results were in line with our expectations and demonstrate the strength of our business. Sales increased compared to Q2, our volume was in line with the prior quarter. As Kettner mentioned, a slight decrease in the third quarter restaurant volume growth versus 2019, is attributable to COVID related staffing challenges that impacted our industry and also impacted our business. Our Q3 trends was similar to traffic trends for various industry data sources and commentary from several restaurant chains.  During the third quarter, we also experienced additional food cost inflation, namely in protein categories such as, beef and pork. In addition, after seeing food cost inflation moderate in July, these costs accelerated again in August and September. Our team continued to do an excellent job of managing that inflation in effectively passing it through to the customers. This resulted in continued strong gross profit per case performance. In fact, even stronger than Q2 and as Pietro noted was the highest gross profit per case in recent years.  During the quarter, we successfully filled most of our open warehouse and transportation roles, and as Pietro said, also are close to hiring and staffing targets. We are focused on increasing the productivity of those hired in recent months. Our supply chain costs is expected to be high in Q4, given the large number of more recent new hires with significant improvement in costs by mid-2022 as productivity improves through training and experience. Inbound product supply from vendors also remains a challenge.  Strong gross profit is offsetting some of the labor cost headwinds that we and others in the industry continue to face. Our operating cash flow was strong for the quarter and we use that cash to further reduce our debt and leverage. We're focused on effectively managing through the challenging COVID environment and related supply chain labor and product availability challenges. At the same time, we're balancing that as we look to the future by continuing to enhance our digital platform, supply chain technology, and processes to our operating model and continuous improvement focus in line with our pre -pandemic strategy.  We saw improved restaurant volumes that October, which indicates there is strong underlying customer demand to accelerate our restaurant growth further, as we also continue to recovery back to 2019 levels in healthcare and hospitality. Moving to slide 10, net sales for the quarter were $7.9 billion up 35% from the third quarter of 2020. Food cost inflation for the quarter was 11.5%, driven by further inflation mainly in proteins. Adjusted gross profit for the quarter was $1.3 billion up 30% from the prior year.  And our adjusted gross margin decreased by 70 basis points as a result of the inflation and most of it being in proteins. We generated strong gross profit per case, again this quarter, as we continued to experience product cost inflation. As I mentioned last quarter, inflation benefits our gross profit dollars, while it's typically a headwind to gross margin rate. With over 11% year-over-year food cost inflation in the third quarter, primarily in commodity categories, our gross margin as a percent of sales was compressed, yet our gross profit per case, is the best we have seen in recent years.  That's ahead of 2019 and even stronger than Q2. We're pleased with our gross profit performance, again in Q3, especially given the freight headwinds impacting us and others in the industry. The actions we're taking on pricing, growing private label, and optimizing our customer mix are showing up in our results. As long as food cost inflation continues, we expect to manage through effectively to increase gross profit dollars. Adjusted operating expense in the third quarter was $988 million, up 28% versus the prior year. As a percent of sales, adjusted operating expense was 12.5%, down from 13.2% the prior year for an improvement of 70 basis points.  While food cost inflation is the headwind to our gross margin rate, it is a benefit to operating expense as a percent of sales. Just as a point of reference, our OpEx as a percent of sales is about 50 basis points lower than it was in the third quarter of 2019, largely due to the significant food cost inflation. We continue to experience additional supply chain labor inflation this year, largely as expected coming into Q3. During our last call, I mentioned that we expected additional labor inflation this year of about $20 million to $30 million, mostly in half too.  Above and beyond, the approximately $50 million of normal annual supply chain labor inflation we experienced. The $20 million to $30 million in half too or $40 million to $60 million annualized for ' 22 is still our best estimate of the incremental inflation. We continue to use hiring and retention bonuses, and have increased wages in additional markets during the quarter, driven by the broader market wage rates increasing in those markets. We now expect most of this year's incremental labor inflation to be permanent, and we expect the impact we are seeing to be comparable to others in and outside of the industry.  We continue to think that, inflation in future years, however, will revert to more normal levels. And thus, the higher inflation in the current year to be transitory. We do expect productivity to offset some of the incremental inflation. In this environment, we're also having success with margin increases on a number of customers and ultimately expect the margin increases to offset most of the incremental permanent labor inflation. We will continue to optimize customer terms to offset the labor inflation. On Slide 11, adjusted EBITDA was $291 million for the quarter, a 39% increase from the third quarter of 2020.  The P&L outcome was largely aligned with our expectations. Gross profit did outperform our expectations since we didn't initially plan for the level of additional food cost inflation in our outlook. And that was offset by higher OpEx from increased supply chain costs largely due to the productivity impact from the higher number of new hires and hire insurance costs. Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of sales was 3.7%. As I mentioned earlier, we are seeing improvements in case volume growth in October and expect the 2022 recovery in restaurant volume at select markets plus market shares will make -- market share gains will make up for the slower recovery in hospitality and healthcare volume. On volume, we're optimistic the October re-acceleration continues as COVID cases continue to decline.  As we look ahead to Q4, we expect the EBITDA drivers to be similar to Q3 with good gross profit as long as inflation continues and continued high supply chain costs. That said, we expect total EBITDA dollars at levels below Q3, largely because Q4 is typically a seasonally lower volume quarter until much lesser extent on higher supply chain costs due to the on-boarding of many supply-chain new hires and the impact of the signing bonuses and continued on-boarding of new sellers that we've talked about previously. Specific to volume, historically, we've sold roughly 6 to 7 million fewer absolute cases in Q4 than Q3.  And this year we also have an incremental negative volume impact of about 100 basis points in the quarter, if you're comparing to 2019 due to the way New Year's holiday falls on the calendar, which helps Q1 2022. The seasonally lower volume and holiday timing impact, is significant in terms of EBITDA impact when it comes to comparing Q4 EBITDA expectations to Q3. We and others in the industry, typically see an improvement in gross profit per case, due to the additional holiday business and related product mix. We aren't sure how much volume. We are the industry, we will see in Q4 from holiday gatherings, potentially impacting the significant benefit we can have on volume and gross profit rates.  So we're watching that closely. Likely to be better than 2020, but not back to the levels in 2019, meaning gross profit not likely to see quite the rate tick up this year that, we have historically experienced versus Q3. Just as a reminder, if you're comparing Q4 volume to 2020, also remember that 2020 had an extra week in the fourth quarter. Earlier, Pietro mentioned that our current best estimate continues to be a return to pro forma 2019 case volume level sometime in '22.  We also have our sights firmly on returning to 2019 pro forma adjusted EBITDA, and then growing from there based on M&A, synergies, top-line growth, including the $1 billion in net new customer [Indiscernible] as Pietro referenced, [Indiscernible] GP expansion and cost-savings. Finally, adjusted net income in the third quarter was a $119 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.48 compared to $0.19 in the prior year. Turning to slide 12, operating cash flow for the first 9 months of the year was $520 million compared to $533 million in the prior year. The prior year still had the benefit of working capital management actions we took when COVID set in and that had not fully unwound by the end of Q3.  Year-to-date operating cash flow in 2021 is in line with the pre-pandemic amounts through the first three quarters of 2018 and 2019, demonstrating we are effectively converting our EBITDA to operating cash. Our business generates a significant amount of operating cash flow each year and we expect to grow that cash flow with EBITDA. We'll use this cash to reinvest in our business and reduce total outstanding debt. In the third quarter, we proactively paid down an additional a $100 million of total debt. Incremental to our standard debt payments, and have reduced our net debt approximately $300 million in nearly three turns year-to-date.  Our leverage ratio decreased further in Q3 to 4.8 times due to the net debt reduction and the significant improvement in adjusted EBITDA. Our target leverage ratio remains between 2.5 and 3 times, and we're well on our way towards that target. We expect to continue to make progress against the target via additional debt reduction in increased EBITDA. To close, we are focused on the continued recovery of our business. However, as Pietro said at the outset, since the industry has demonstrated its well on his way to recovery, we're shifting much more of our focus back to our pre-pandemic strategy: 1. To profitably grow market share with our differentiated and Great Food Made Easy, 2. To smartly optimize our customer margins and mix, and 3. To bring an intense focus to operational efficiency.  We expect this focus will lead to our volume recovering well ahead of the Technomic outlook and further improving our gross profit OpEx, resulting in healthy earnings growth and a strong capital structure. We will continue to use the strong cash flow to invest in our business and reduce debt, as we look to 2022 and beyond. We're optimistic on our ability to profitably grow our business and deliver value for our shareholders. Operator, at this time, we can now open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thanks you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Edward Kelly. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nEdward Kelly: Yeah. Hi. Good morning, guys. So, profit per case, this quarter was obviously very good. Case growth was a little bit lighter than what we and I think probably others expected. I was just hoping you could talk a bit about the cadence of case growth during the quarter versus kind of where June was? Maybe give a little bit color by customer type, including independents, and then talk about the staffing challenges and the impact that that had, and is it possible to quantify sort of like what amount of volume is being left on the table by that to give us a better sense as to where the business really should be run rating right now?\nDirk Locascio: Sure, Ed. Good morning. This is Dirk. I'll start with that. So ultimately through the quarter, if you look at the way Q2 continued, actually our \u2013 and then into Q3, our cadence is not that dissimilar than what you've probably seen from industry traffic data sources and a number of the chains where June was the strongest, and then July, similar, and then some softening in August and early September, and then really some pick up toward the end of September, and then that's continued into October.  So ultimately, that's similar across a number of our -- sort of -- especially around the restaurants and hospitality. But really, what we're seeing is almost all of our sort of -- I'll call it slowing of the volume recovery, is around staffing challenges in certain of our markets. And really, the end demand perspective, or any impacts on end demand from Delta variant appears to be pretty insignificant. So, from that perspective, as COVID cases decline, our staffing continues to improve. We're optimistic that, the re-acceleration we're seeing in October continues through the balance of the year and then of course into 2022. So that's positive as we look ahead.\nEdward Kelly: And is there any way to quantify the staffing component impact?\nDirk Locascio: So, we're not going to comment on a specific impact of foregone volume. But I will tell you though is, it doesn't -- what we're seeing in our markets is that, the customer demand and consumer demand appears to be there, the challenges we've had don't appear to be that dissimilar to others, and we are seeing in markets where we\u2019re -- where our staffing and where lower COVID staffing challenges that we saw during the quarter, we have a number of our markets growing in double digits. So, we're confident that as we get further through this and past this, there's plenty of business out there and that we can meaningfully accelerate our growth rate.\nEdward Kelly: Great. Thank you.\nDirk Locascio: Thanks, Ed.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rahul Gretta Poly (ph). Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just going back to slide 6, this initiative sounds familiar. What is an evolution or enhancement of an existing project versus what are the new projects with their own paybacks embedded within these initiatives, and also wanted to check if these projects require investment before return or can improvement and be expected without incremental near-term investment in these initiatives?\nPietro Satriano: This is Pietro. So a number of -- in distribution, the leverage you're going to go after in terms of warehouse productivity, delivery productivity are levers that we continue to push on and continue to improve on, which is why probably there's a certain amount of familiarity to what we talked about. However, what I would call out is, especially on some dimensions, the assortment rationalization, some really good progress compared to historical norms. In terms of your question about investment, the 1 or 2 technology that I talked about in terms of picking technology really are very modest investment and the payback is pretty immediate.\nQ - : I understand.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Silberman. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nLauren Silberman: Thanks for the question. Just on gross profit per case up year-over-year and sequentially, you guys called out inflation private label and optimization in terms and mix. So how are you thinking about the sustainability of gross profit per case from here, just thinking into 2022 as perhaps you see some inflation come down for customer mix shift? And then I understand your commentary on the uncertainty around the holiday performance. Would you expect fourth quarter gross profit per case to be at least as high as 3Q?\nDirk Locascio: Hi, Lauren, thanks for the questions. I think that's -- we do believe that the higher gross profits is sustainable, TBD and the exact same -- or the exact level to your point based on what happens with inflation, but we think the combination of the things and also just even the environment that we're in and with the higher labor cost challenges all contribute to stronger gross profitability \u2013 to maintain stronger gross profit per case.  So we're confident in our ability to maintain a higher level there even though it may move around a little bit from quarter-to-quarter. And I think you've seen over the years even leading up to the pandemic, we were successful in expanding gross profit and expanding our operating leverage as we improved our EBITDA margins. I think specific to the fourth quarter, I\u2019m not going to speculate any exact amount.  I think the -- with holiday timings, I guess the way I would suggest thinking about it is, in the holiday product mix, etc., whatever it shapes out to be is really a Q4 2021 and doesn't change how we think about and probably how the industry thinks about the recovery into 2022 and beyond. I think the positive is, it seems like from what we and others are preparing, it seems there probably will be more activity, so that's an encouraging sign from a demand and people getting out more. I think that all bodes well for the continued recovery into 2022.\nLauren Silberman: Great. And then, it just looks like sales per case was up a bit more than gross profit per case this quarter. Anything you can share about the dynamics there and what's driving that?\nDirk Locascio: That's really more around the categories in which the inflation came in. So just because in the third quarter a lot of it came from proteins and as -- if I remember from what I talked about in the past is more of those categories tend to be a fixed markup per case or per pound. So, you don't necessarily get gross profit to go up quite at the same level as sales, so there's nothing that I would call out that's fundamentally different.\nLauren Silberman: Great. Thanks so much.\nDirk Locascio: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Carden. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nMark Carden: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. So on the inflation front, is there a point at which you would typically become concerned that, elevated inflation could start leading to demand destruction? Do you see this being much of a risk and that, if inflation just hit a certain point for a certain period of time that, customers basically shift more their spend food at home? Thanks.\nPietro Satriano: So -- this is Pietro, so we haven't seen that. I mean, as you've seen from the industry data and our own data, consumer demand continues to be very healthy. The increase in digital ordering and take-out has helped demand with food away from home. I think there's a couple of other data point, I would point to that, that lead us to believe that, from an outlook perspective, we're confident that the sector is very healthy. 1. Is if you look at the growth in food away from home relative to food away -- food at home, continues to close the gap and the expectation by one of the industry analysts is that the lines will cross sometime in 2022. I believe early 2023, in terms of more dollars being spent away from home than at home. And then third thing, if you look at inflation between food the way at home -- food away from home and food at home, the GAAP has really narrowed over the last several quarters. So the inflation we're seeing, especially in the proteins as their commented on it, is inflation that's being seen in both food away from home and food at home. And I think if there's any substitution that happens, that it will happen within the sector, or perhaps less with the expensive proteins and more towards some of the less expensive proteins. So we feel pretty good about the outlook.\nMark Carden: Great. And then from an optimization standpoint, have you guys have to call many incremental independent locations while optimizing your trucking routes throughout the last quarter? Thanks.\nPietro Satriano: Do you mind repeating the question? Was it about adding --\nMark Carden: Sure.\nPietro Satriano: -- independent locations?\nMark Carden: Yes, just in terms of have you guys -- with some of the hiring challenges in the driver front, have you guys had to call many independent locations just to optimize your trucking routes throughout the last quarter?\nPietro Satriano: I understand. Okay. So that's what I was referring to, in a handful of markets, we had to rationalize the amount of demand we were able to serve that was sometimes due to driver shortage, sometimes due to selectors. And I think as I mentioned, it was less about the storage and we had a number of facilities, unfortunate disproportionately large facilities, where COVID just went through the facility and we had a 1 or 2 weeks setback in terms of our ability to serve those customers. But by the way, we also benefited from that in other markets where it happened to other competitors. And when we look at those other markets, we had some pretty good increases in market share.\nMark Carden: Great. It's very helpful clarity, and best of luck.\nPietro Satriano: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nicole Miller. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nNicole Miller: Thank you. Good morning. I might have understood on the 4Q. I think you said, EBITDA commentary about down sequentially. So before I ask some long with it question, the restaurants traditionally, have a better 4Q and I don't see that historically in your numbers, so did I misunderstand that?\nDirk Locascio: No, you did not. And that's -- in our business, historically back to pre-pandemic, just Q1 and Q4 absolute volume, is lower for us than Q2 and Q3. And I think that's the thing that's -- and some of the outlooks that, people have considered them, it's looking new at more as restaurants as opposed to our industry and our business has historically worked.\nNicole Miller: And you talked about like 6% to 7% sequentially, seasonally on that absolute volumes, and there was 1 other item. Can you address that 1 other item, I was trying to understand if that was more one-time or not? And then does this translate all the way down to EBITDA then being lower in the fourth quarter than the third quarter?\nDirk Locascio: Yes. So my comment was -- I'll start with that we do expect -- we expect the drivers to perform very similar to Q3, but we do expect Q4 EBITDA to be below Q3, not because of the change in the core business, but because of the seasonal labor we're buying. So if I go to the volume piece of it, yes. So in Q4, I gave as a reference, typically we sell 6 to 7 million fewer cases in Q4 than Q3. And then the other thing on top of it this year, if you're comparing, say at 2019 is, New Year's and Christmas both fall in that last week of 2021. So it has a negative -- additional negative impact of about a 100 basis points in the fourth quarter of this year that, will then help in Q1 of next year. So again --\nNicole Miller: Okay.\nDirk Locascio: that is timing. And even the downturn in volume is really again, it's just seasonal, not a change in the actual business outlook.\nNicole Miller: And then on the sales leverage or I guess, I shouldn't call it that. But I guess, on the sales or just the business in total returning to normal at some point mid-2022. To the degree that you talked about that being a function of labor, where are you hiring from? I'm thinking about if it's in industry, is this a productivity unlock of learning your new enhanced technologies, or are you hiring outside of the industry and it's just teaching the basics around your process and procedures?\nPietro Satriano: Just to clarify, Nicole. When we talk about 2022, we are talking about the volume outlook. And that's a function of hospitality still being 2/3 of what was in 2019, but you see the continued growth. Healthcare being around 10% of that below 2019 and some of the occupancy rates returning back to prior levels and Senior Living. That's what we refer to in terms of 2022. In terms of the part of your question, I think we're in terms of where labor is coming from. So as you know, selectors and drivers are very different occupations. Drivers, commercial license, these are experienced drivers and there has been a headwind in terms of driver supply going back to before the pandemic.  And so what we're doing there is really aggressively recruiting. And as well, we've credit programs were by our selectors can train to become drivers and that's a great path upwards and retention vehicle. Selectors, it's different. They most often come from other warehouse environments, not necessarily in food distribution, but they come from other warehouse environments. And there the -- ours is a very fast-paced, high-volume environment [Indiscernible] And so it's training them on the method in our warehouses, in our industry that might be different from where they come from, but at least they have a sense of what their environment they'll be working in. Hopefully that answers your question.\nNicole Miller: It does. Thank you for that. Appreciate it.\nPietro Satriano: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. I have two questions. The first one from a top-line perspective and then second on the inflation side of things. But from a sales perspective, I think you mentioned Technomic suggesting the industry would get back to 19 sales levels by '24, which does seem overly conservative. I know you mentioned you'd achieve that by '22. I'm just wondering, as you think about it relative to your forecast, relative to Technomic?  I'm just wondering, whether you would prioritize the biggest benefit being further penetrating existing accounts or is it the net new business you are adding entirely, or maybe is there some expectation for M&A opportunity, or I'm not sure if that's even an option for you near term with the elevated leverage? We're just trying to prioritize why you believe yours will recover faster than the broader industry in terms of the different buckets available to you?\nPietro Satriano: Thanks. I think at part is, because that's where we've seen so far. Jeffrey, we've seen our restaurant business recovered more quickly than the broader industry. So it's based in large part on the evidence so far in our market share gains. And again, as I said, that the two sectors that have still the most opting for recovery around healthcare and hospitality, but we're very optimistic about that. In terms of the type of business or where the growth will come from, I think it's really around the right business.  Whether it's existing customers where we can grow share of wallet or new business, it's around business that, has a right to get fit with our footprint, a good fit in terms of the SKUs we cover, and part of the work we've done over the last 3 to months in terms of optimizing the portfolio that I referred to, and that's been a combination of renegotiating terms as Dirk referred to [Indiscernible] some customers where we couldn't find the right fit. It's really about growing in a healthy fashion and in a way that expands margins, both in terms of absolute dollars from growth and expands the EBITDA margins.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Understood. And then to follow-up is more on the inflation side of things. I know you mentioned that the margin percentages are down, but more importantly, the dollars are up. I'm just wondering a lot of investors see the Foodservice distribution category is a good place to be in a hyperinflation environment because it does seem like the messages that you're able to pass along pretty much all the inflation to customers.  Just wondering whether your confidence is still high in the ability to continue to pass through. Or maybe there's some concern as the inflation now approaches, or is now in the low double-digits. So just wondering whether you are still confident being able to pass it along or maybe you can share your expectation for inflation in the fourth quarter, thoughts going into '22 relative to that 11% plus that we just saw in the third quarter. Thank you.\nDirk Locascio: Sure. Hi, Jeff, it's Dirk I'll take that. I think that ultimately, we are confident our ability to pass it through, as you've seen now for two quarters in a row, our processes and our customer base in the way contracts are setup, set us up well for that. So pleased with the performance across these, and I think we expect as long as inflation continues, that we'll continue to operate effectively and passing it through. I think your point is so what we did see is we saw inflation, or are seeing inflation moderate a little bit into October. But just as I said on the last quarter call, we saw that in July.  So at this point, we're going to continue to watch what happens. And Pietro made reference earlier, but operators are -- they're very thoughtful, they're creative, and can go with different options as to how they think about if you have higher inflation in certain categories to be able to manage their food costs. And that's where our differentiated model also can help with them from a sales and service perspective. I think as you go into '22, it's harder to know exactly what happens.  Our focus is, like I said, helping operators manage through it, and at the same time, making sure that we have our processes running well, so that, we can pass it through. I think as you've seen with your opening comment and how it's an ability to pass through, that is one of the advantages that our business has, that lot of others don't is on food cost inflation. It is a pretty direct pass-through on -- in our case, about 70% of our customer base, and that's one of the key enablers of such strong gross profit in Q2 and then again in Q3. With Q3 being a lot of the highest we've seen or the highest we've seen in recent years.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Got it. And the idea that, you said, you are seeing some moderation in commodity inflation in the fourth quarter. Thinking about it from a year-over-year perspective, you would therefore think the third quarter might have been the high point than we would see inflation on a year-over-year basis subside in the fourth-quarter if trends were to continue like this? Or is there something unusual in the [Indiscernible] last year that might still have the inflation percentage actually be higher in the fourth quarter versus that 11% you saw in the third.\nDirk Locascio: I don't know that it's subsides, I just using October as a data points. It indicates that what we saw in the month is not a lot of incremental growth above where the third quarter exited. So I think it's hard to know and like others, we'll continue to watch as we go to the fourth quarter.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Understood. Thank you.\nDirk Locascio: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Glass. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJohn Glass: Thanks very much. Just going back to your comments about going back to business as usual, the pre - COVID, and you talked about optimizing customer mix, and then you talked about those two initiatives in the warehouse [Indiscernible] receiving and picking and packing. Can you -- is there a way to quantify what you think those can do from a savings perspective? Or in the case of the gross -- is the customer mix? What have you already started to realize in gross margins, as you've shed maybe unprofitable customers? Is there a way to think about how that could benefit the margin structure in the business?\nDirk Locascio: We haven't specifically and don't expect right now, to have to quantify the specific impacts of these. However, a few things that I can share is, a number of these things are the pieces that are helping and driving. Ultimately, what we're trying to balance each year is that, top-line growth. That also margin expansion, which just go back a reference from 2015 to 2019. So leading up in the pandemic, we expand our EBITDA margins by about 90 basis points. So it's really pushing each of these levers.  From a customer mix perspective, although we are seeing some negatives in a certain healthcare and hospitality is still being down some, the improvements in the net new business wins that Pietro talked about in the higher-margin there and some of the pricing actions and the types of customers we're serving on the local customers have had a meaningful positive impact on our margins and ultimately on our EBITDA for the last few quarters.  So we expect to continue to move on those, I think on the other pieces that Pietro had on the page there, it's a private label as we continue to focus on growth there, that's almost twice as profitable as manufacturers brands. So that is an opportunity that we've made significant progress in recent years and we would expect to continue to because we have a lot of opportunities still that remains there.  And then from the supply chain perspective that we're kind of midstream on a number of those things. Rational -- assortment rationalization is a great one because it helps simplify our operation. And in this environment of product availability challenges with vendors, actually a better experience for customers as well. It's a good win-win, and we're to continue to strike this balance in order to improve or grow our EBITDA.\nJohn Glass: Okay. Thank you. And just 1 follow-up. You cited inefficiency of new workers coming on, and so that's going to still take time to work through. Is there a way to quantify it? Like what percentage of your sales force or your drivers are new today versus what they were new -- what the regular percentage of new employees are like in pre-pandemic, just so we understand that that that opportunity and challenge?\nDirk Locascio: Sure. So we haven't broken out the specific percentages now or historically. It is meaningfully more, because of that sheer amount of hiring we've done in recent months. To tell you as you think about ramp up. So warehouse and selectors contend to be in the neighborhood of 3 to 6 months until they get closer to that level. Drivers can take a little bit longer, but as Pietro said, since we are at the level of staffing and that we were in 2019 and our focus remains at a few select markets, we feel that, we're well-positioned really to work on reducing our supply chain costs, improving the productivity, as we move ahead to mid-2022. Also, most importantly, being able to continue to serve more profitable customers and continue to grow EBITDA.\nJohn Glass: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJohn Heinbockel: We'll start with a more strategic question and then I have another. When you think about the supply chain opportunity. So how aggressively can you get it that and I'm thinking also balancing top-line market share potential. You don't want to go too fast and impact the customer experience. May we talk about balancing that, how quickly you can go at it? And then in sizing it right, you may not give us an exact number, but I think about the proactive cost outs a year ago. Is the ultimate supply-chain opportunity in that ballpark eventually or is it much smaller?\nPietro Satriano: So I'll start and maybe Dirk can chime in. Look, we think we have great opportunity in terms of both operational effectiveness and efficiency. And we think the addition of John Heinbockel and John Tennyson (ph) as CI over the last 9 months will help us get at that opportunity in aggressive fashion. I don't know that there need to be trade-offs, John, between the customer experience. The example I talked about in the prepared remarks is the level of assortment. What happens with you build your assortment too broadly. While on the surface that may look like helping driving sales that necessitates greater inventory.  The tail typically is harder to forecast and so you end up with a lower customer service experience. So we believe that the opportunity for a better serving our customers and getting out the operational efficiency, and effectiveness actually go hand in hand together. And I could give you 4 other examples in addition to the assortment ones. The work we did last year and prior to that, when we consolidated the single-site area divisions into multi-site areas, those were all on the administrative side.  Whereas what we're talking about on the fixed cost side, what we're talking about now in terms of opportunity, is primarily on variable costs in terms of operations. And as Dirk mentioned, part of it is just the natural evolution we have an equal number of drivers and selectors who are new. And so there will be some natural productivity benefit. And then on top of that, we layer on some of the initiatives that we've talked about historically, some of them are new, and some we have to pause during COVID, putting new technology in place, picking perspective when you're short staffed could make things worse. So that's why now we feel given our way back to 2019 levels, we feel that we're in a good position to resume some of that work that we were talking pre-pandemic.\nJohn Heinbockel: Okay. The -- is there a to size the ultimate supply chain opportunity? And does it rise to the level of the cost as you did last year or no?\nPietro Satriano: It's significant material. But it's -- we're not prepared at this position at this point to size it. But stay tuned.\nJohn Heinbockel: Alright. Okay. And then lastly, what are you seeing with lines per stop and pieces per stop? Maybe --\nPietro Satriano: Good news on those\nJohn Heinbockel: Yes. Go ahead.\nPietro Satriano: I'm sorry, John. Yes. So good news. We're seeing both lines per stop increased and we're also seeing cases per line increase. And as I've said, historically, the lines per stop or a good proxy for our ability to gain share of wallet, and the cases per line are a good proxy for customer or operator demand. And we've seen both of them go up over the last few months, which I think is a function of both us, the quality of the new customers we're bringing on and as well continue to optimize our portfolio of existing customers.\nJohn Heinbockel: Okay. Thank you.\nPietro Satriano: [Indiscernible]\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Slagle. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nAlex Slagle: Thanks. Good morning. You mentioned some freight pressures, just wondering if you can comment on the magnitude of that headwind in the third quarter, and how you're seeing this evolve into the fourth quarter in ' 22? And then within that, anything different about how you hear managing these headwinds versus what you've done in the past? And maybe the portion of inbound freight where you're using third-party on the stock market? Any color there would be great.\nDirk Locascio: Sure, Alex. Good morning. So freights continues to be a headwind, not that different than recent quarters, and it's really largely driven by just tightness in the overall freight market. So when you ask about impact, so it's meaningful but less than the impact of just the overall, I'll call it separate supply chain labor and its impact on volume even though a lot of the logistics is largely -- it's all labor challenge. What I will tell you is we learned a lot back in 2018 when the freight market really tightened up. We put a number of plays in place there. We've executed against those in 2021 and it's been challenging, especially in this part of the business because those freight costs have continued to increase so it's not a steady target you're working against.  So we've made significant progress and are closing sort of some of the, call it headwind, as the year has gone on, and we continue to work through those and feel like we'll be very well-positioned as we get to a more steady environment through there, both from a cost perspective, but also from a service perspective. We're balancing both of them. So we want to make sure it's about getting that product, whether it's some of it we pick up with our own trucks, some of it we contract with third-parties.  And in this environment, we've really leaned out a lot of the strength for the third-parties with the partners that we have out there, that we're trying to make sure we're getting our loads picked up and into our facilities on time. So it's probably -- based on what you read out there, it's not something that's going away imminently, but it continues well into ' 22, And we can't control the end of it. The thing we can control is making sure we're getting our product and continue to make progress on the P&L side of it as we work through this. And that will continue to be our focus.\nAlex Slagle: It's helpful and I had a follow-up just on the inflation. Is that -- when the product starts to drop, is there some ability to capture incremental margin as there's probably short lag and when the contracts reprice and perhaps the timing of the re-pricing with the non-contracted customers.\nDirk Locascio: Yes, there is, there is a little bit when it's on the decline. I think the thing over time, our industry and our business, we like kind of slow and steady inflation could does help grow gross profit dollars. But yes, in a period of call it volatility are up and down, it does create some opportunities to -- to take -- to take some pricing. During this environment, it's really trying to strike that balance again of pricing fairly to our customers. And just managing for the against the tight supply backdrop that we're we're all experiencing.\nAlex Slagle: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nPeter Saleh: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to come back to the conversation around reduced assortment. I think that was mentioned a several times on the call. Are you actively reducing assortment and SKUs? And and if so, how early are they -- are you in the process? Should we expect more reduction in the fourth quarter into ' 22, or as sales come back to 2019 levels, do you expect that the assortment comes back into the warehouses? And I have a follow-up.\nPietro Satriano: So assortment is one of those things that, like customer optimization or certain optimization is ongoing. And we put up, particularly push this year and part of that was prompted by the supply volatility we experienced part was prompted by the opportunity from an operational efficiency perspective. But that's an ongoing opportunity that never ends. I think you said, you had a follow-up, Peter, as I remember.\nMelissa Napier: Yes. The other question would be, just on the assortment reductions so far, have you seen any sort of sales impact to-date? Or -- and do you expect anything going forward?\nPietro Satriano: We have not -- typically what we go after from a store and perspective is either the duplication in the middle of that curve or some of the tail. And we work closely with our salespeople. We work closely with our customers in terms of identifying those opportunities. So we have not seen any impact from that work from a sales perspective.\nPeter Saleh: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nKelly Bania: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. Good morning. Wanted to just ask a little bit about the hospitality segment and correct me if I'm wrong, but it looks like it came in at Q3, pretty similar to where you had-exited the second quarter. I think down about maybe 29% or 30% and pretty stable to that. So just curious how that compared to your internal expectations. what kind of cadence or pace of recovery you're expecting from here, and how you're benchmarking the performance of that segment. And then just also what kind of seasonality, if any, there is expected in that segment as we look into Q4?\nPietro Satriano: I'm looking at the chart here on Page 4, and it does show continued progress on hospitality segment parks 2019. We'll continue to see that some of the factors that need to work themselves out. I believe I mentioned on last call, so we have some customers who have some very large parks. They are staffing challenged just like other customers and manufacturers. And so that is limiting the amount of guest that they can accommodate so that's one. There has been less travel in-bound into the U.S. Now there has been more domestic travel, but how those [Indiscernible] is hard to tell. Then I think we've mentioned this as well the return to office or the lack of business travel, which seems to be picking up as also been one of the factors that have held us customers coming back.  But we see all 3 overtime coming back to pre-pandemic levels and we see that yellow line continuing to get back to pre-pandemic levels. And as well, too the other thing too, I think I mentioned last time is we've had now that, the hospitality segment is opening up and people are willing to talk about business opportunities and working with us as opposed to other distributors. We think, any potential shortfall that, exist from an industry perspective is, if even if there is one, we will more than make up with our pipeline and our ability to gain share in this setting.\nOperator: We have a follow-up question from Edward Kelly. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nEdward Kelly: Hey, guys. Thanks for letting me back in. I wanted to ask about the added cost associated with labor, which you've talked about now, I think it's 40 to 60 annually. That's what you think will be a more permanent cost. How's visibility on that? I mean, obviously the anxiety out there on the investor side is just sort of the labor front and the level of inflation that's out there and the impact that it had. What you've got your labor force where you need it to be. Do you feel visibility on that number is now good?\nDirk Locascio: Thanks Ed. Good question. So yes, we do feel like the visibility is quite good. And that was really one of the things that we're taking feedback from various others last quarter where people were, as you can imagine, sizing, could this be a $10 million issue could this be $100 million or as you try to put some context around it. And although we don't know exactly where it lands on, we think that that is a very good range. And I think the other thing that we're continuing to gain confidence is the success we're having in margin improvements with customers.  And so, again, we don't know any of that amount, depending on where and what lands as permanent. But we do expect that, most if not all of that permanent increase or higher level of inflation in the current year that, we will be able to offset with customer margins through the things we've already negotiated and are starting in those that will -- we expected to go to progress on in 2022. So from an overall earnings power of the business, as we get through this next year, we don't think that, it's a permanent inhibitor as opposed to something that's more temporary or transitory over this next year.\nEdward Kelly: And just to, I'm trying to bridge to OpEx per case in ' 22, is the best way to do that versus '19 would be to take $50 million in annual labor inflation, add the $40 million to $60 million, but then subtract some. You have the savings of $130 million like subtract some of that savings and that gets me to an OpEx per case number versus 19 or are there other things that I would need to do there?\nDirk Locascio: Yes. I think that you've got the big pieces. You're right, inflation as well as the normal inflation and plus the incremental inflation, you'll continue to have some higher cost on top of that next year as we get back to 2019 level of productivity through this first half of the year, as Pietro talked about. And then you're right, we do expect to drive some incremental productivity through the things that Pietro referenced along with some initiatives that we have underway. I think those are the main things. Out of 130, there is a little bit of that, that is in distribution fixed. But those cost reductions, 130 is really more about fixed cost, not the variable distribution which should be driver selectors, etc. So I would attribute very little of the 130 to that as opposed to the pieces that I just talked about.\nEdward Kelly: And then just last question for you on the contract side. I mean, obviously it takes time to pass through higher -- things like higher labor costs. But at the same time, the industry is in a situation today, right? Where it's just hard to get product. Is that helping you at all in like, accelerating what would be, let's call it normal pass-through?\nDirk Locascio: Maybe, I'll separate it into 2. So there's the normal pass-through that, happens automatically for food cost inflation. That is pretty quick as you probably remember from prior comments, I made that, can happen when contracts reset weekly to monthly-ish, so pretty quick. And then on the non-contract again, because of the product supply issues, those pass - throughs are happening quite quickly. On the labor side, what we are doing and have been doing is, actively engaging with a number of our customers to really try to discuss with them the opportunities to improve margins and in this labor environment, it's resulting in some very constructive discussions.  Because it's not a different conversation or in almost all cases, not different than than what they are experiencing. And so we've had good success with close to half of that 40-ish $1 million number that, we've already reached agreement on, that either is in place or what will be going in place over the coming months. So just for context, good progress and expect to continue through there, and that's what gives us the confidence that we'll be able to mitigate most, if not all, of this year's incremental inflation through pricing.\nEdward Kelly: Great. Thank you.\nDirk Locascio: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Pietro Satriano for closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir.\nPietro Satriano: Thank you. So I'd like to close by thanking our 26,000 associates who amidst what is still a difficult environment, have continued to do a phenomenal job of serving our customers and generating the results that we discuss today. Our three-pronged strategy of possibly growing market share by leveraging Great Food Made Easy, 2. Optimizing gross margins and 3. bringing a relentless focus to operational efficiency continues to show progress. And that is the result of the great work by our management team and all our associates. Thank you for joining us today and have a great week.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dirk Locascio",
            "content": "Thank you, Pietro. And good morning, everyone. I will start on Slide 9. Our third quarter financial results were in line with our expectations and demonstrate the strength of our business. Sales increased compared to Q2, our volume was in line with the prior quarter. As Kettner mentioned, a slight decrease in the third quarter restaurant volume growth versus 2019, is attributable to COVID related staffing challenges that impacted our industry and also impacted our business. Our Q3 trends was similar to traffic trends for various industry data sources and commentary from several restaurant chains.  During the third quarter, we also experienced additional food cost inflation, namely in protein categories such as, beef and pork. In addition, after seeing food cost inflation moderate in July, these costs accelerated again in August and September. Our team continued to do an excellent job of managing that inflation in effectively passing it through to the customers. This resulted in continued strong gross profit per case performance. In fact, even stronger than Q2 and as Pietro noted was the highest gross profit per case in recent years.  During the quarter, we successfully filled most of our open warehouse and transportation roles, and as Pietro said, also are close to hiring and staffing targets. We are focused on increasing the productivity of those hired in recent months. Our supply chain costs is expected to be high in Q4, given the large number of more recent new hires with significant improvement in costs by mid-2022 as productivity improves through training and experience. Inbound product supply from vendors also remains a challenge.  Strong gross profit is offsetting some of the labor cost headwinds that we and others in the industry continue to face. Our operating cash flow was strong for the quarter and we use that cash to further reduce our debt and leverage. We're focused on effectively managing through the challenging COVID environment and related supply chain labor and product availability challenges. At the same time, we're balancing that as we look to the future by continuing to enhance our digital platform, supply chain technology, and processes to our operating model and continuous improvement focus in line with our pre -pandemic strategy.  We saw improved restaurant volumes that October, which indicates there is strong underlying customer demand to accelerate our restaurant growth further, as we also continue to recovery back to 2019 levels in healthcare and hospitality. Moving to slide 10, net sales for the quarter were $7.9 billion up 35% from the third quarter of 2020. Food cost inflation for the quarter was 11.5%, driven by further inflation mainly in proteins. Adjusted gross profit for the quarter was $1.3 billion up 30% from the prior year.  And our adjusted gross margin decreased by 70 basis points as a result of the inflation and most of it being in proteins. We generated strong gross profit per case, again this quarter, as we continued to experience product cost inflation. As I mentioned last quarter, inflation benefits our gross profit dollars, while it's typically a headwind to gross margin rate. With over 11% year-over-year food cost inflation in the third quarter, primarily in commodity categories, our gross margin as a percent of sales was compressed, yet our gross profit per case, is the best we have seen in recent years.  That's ahead of 2019 and even stronger than Q2. We're pleased with our gross profit performance, again in Q3, especially given the freight headwinds impacting us and others in the industry. The actions we're taking on pricing, growing private label, and optimizing our customer mix are showing up in our results. As long as food cost inflation continues, we expect to manage through effectively to increase gross profit dollars. Adjusted operating expense in the third quarter was $988 million, up 28% versus the prior year. As a percent of sales, adjusted operating expense was 12.5%, down from 13.2% the prior year for an improvement of 70 basis points.  While food cost inflation is the headwind to our gross margin rate, it is a benefit to operating expense as a percent of sales. Just as a point of reference, our OpEx as a percent of sales is about 50 basis points lower than it was in the third quarter of 2019, largely due to the significant food cost inflation. We continue to experience additional supply chain labor inflation this year, largely as expected coming into Q3. During our last call, I mentioned that we expected additional labor inflation this year of about $20 million to $30 million, mostly in half too.  Above and beyond, the approximately $50 million of normal annual supply chain labor inflation we experienced. The $20 million to $30 million in half too or $40 million to $60 million annualized for ' 22 is still our best estimate of the incremental inflation. We continue to use hiring and retention bonuses, and have increased wages in additional markets during the quarter, driven by the broader market wage rates increasing in those markets. We now expect most of this year's incremental labor inflation to be permanent, and we expect the impact we are seeing to be comparable to others in and outside of the industry.  We continue to think that, inflation in future years, however, will revert to more normal levels. And thus, the higher inflation in the current year to be transitory. We do expect productivity to offset some of the incremental inflation. In this environment, we're also having success with margin increases on a number of customers and ultimately expect the margin increases to offset most of the incremental permanent labor inflation. We will continue to optimize customer terms to offset the labor inflation. On Slide 11, adjusted EBITDA was $291 million for the quarter, a 39% increase from the third quarter of 2020.  The P&L outcome was largely aligned with our expectations. Gross profit did outperform our expectations since we didn't initially plan for the level of additional food cost inflation in our outlook. And that was offset by higher OpEx from increased supply chain costs largely due to the productivity impact from the higher number of new hires and hire insurance costs. Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of sales was 3.7%. As I mentioned earlier, we are seeing improvements in case volume growth in October and expect the 2022 recovery in restaurant volume at select markets plus market shares will make -- market share gains will make up for the slower recovery in hospitality and healthcare volume. On volume, we're optimistic the October re-acceleration continues as COVID cases continue to decline.  As we look ahead to Q4, we expect the EBITDA drivers to be similar to Q3 with good gross profit as long as inflation continues and continued high supply chain costs. That said, we expect total EBITDA dollars at levels below Q3, largely because Q4 is typically a seasonally lower volume quarter until much lesser extent on higher supply chain costs due to the on-boarding of many supply-chain new hires and the impact of the signing bonuses and continued on-boarding of new sellers that we've talked about previously. Specific to volume, historically, we've sold roughly 6 to 7 million fewer absolute cases in Q4 than Q3.  And this year we also have an incremental negative volume impact of about 100 basis points in the quarter, if you're comparing to 2019 due to the way New Year's holiday falls on the calendar, which helps Q1 2022. The seasonally lower volume and holiday timing impact, is significant in terms of EBITDA impact when it comes to comparing Q4 EBITDA expectations to Q3. We and others in the industry, typically see an improvement in gross profit per case, due to the additional holiday business and related product mix. We aren't sure how much volume. We are the industry, we will see in Q4 from holiday gatherings, potentially impacting the significant benefit we can have on volume and gross profit rates.  So we're watching that closely. Likely to be better than 2020, but not back to the levels in 2019, meaning gross profit not likely to see quite the rate tick up this year that, we have historically experienced versus Q3. Just as a reminder, if you're comparing Q4 volume to 2020, also remember that 2020 had an extra week in the fourth quarter. Earlier, Pietro mentioned that our current best estimate continues to be a return to pro forma 2019 case volume level sometime in '22.  We also have our sights firmly on returning to 2019 pro forma adjusted EBITDA, and then growing from there based on M&A, synergies, top-line growth, including the $1 billion in net new customer [Indiscernible] as Pietro referenced, [Indiscernible] GP expansion and cost-savings. Finally, adjusted net income in the third quarter was a $119 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.48 compared to $0.19 in the prior year. Turning to slide 12, operating cash flow for the first 9 months of the year was $520 million compared to $533 million in the prior year. The prior year still had the benefit of working capital management actions we took when COVID set in and that had not fully unwound by the end of Q3.  Year-to-date operating cash flow in 2021 is in line with the pre-pandemic amounts through the first three quarters of 2018 and 2019, demonstrating we are effectively converting our EBITDA to operating cash. Our business generates a significant amount of operating cash flow each year and we expect to grow that cash flow with EBITDA. We'll use this cash to reinvest in our business and reduce total outstanding debt. In the third quarter, we proactively paid down an additional a $100 million of total debt. Incremental to our standard debt payments, and have reduced our net debt approximately $300 million in nearly three turns year-to-date.  Our leverage ratio decreased further in Q3 to 4.8 times due to the net debt reduction and the significant improvement in adjusted EBITDA. Our target leverage ratio remains between 2.5 and 3 times, and we're well on our way towards that target. We expect to continue to make progress against the target via additional debt reduction in increased EBITDA. To close, we are focused on the continued recovery of our business. However, as Pietro said at the outset, since the industry has demonstrated its well on his way to recovery, we're shifting much more of our focus back to our pre-pandemic strategy: 1. To profitably grow market share with our differentiated and Great Food Made Easy, 2. To smartly optimize our customer margins and mix, and 3. To bring an intense focus to operational efficiency.  We expect this focus will lead to our volume recovering well ahead of the Technomic outlook and further improving our gross profit OpEx, resulting in healthy earnings growth and a strong capital structure. We will continue to use the strong cash flow to invest in our business and reduce debt, as we look to 2022 and beyond. We're optimistic on our ability to profitably grow our business and deliver value for our shareholders. Operator, at this time, we can now open the call for questions. Sure, Ed. Good morning. This is Dirk. I'll start with that. So ultimately through the quarter, if you look at the way Q2 continued, actually our \u2013 and then into Q3, our cadence is not that dissimilar than what you've probably seen from industry traffic data sources and a number of the chains where June was the strongest, and then July, similar, and then some softening in August and early September, and then really some pick up toward the end of September, and then that's continued into October.  So ultimately, that's similar across a number of our -- sort of -- especially around the restaurants and hospitality. But really, what we're seeing is almost all of our sort of -- I'll call it slowing of the volume recovery, is around staffing challenges in certain of our markets. And really, the end demand perspective, or any impacts on end demand from Delta variant appears to be pretty insignificant. So, from that perspective, as COVID cases decline, our staffing continues to improve. We're optimistic that, the re-acceleration we're seeing in October continues through the balance of the year and then of course into 2022. So that's positive as we look ahead. So, we're not going to comment on a specific impact of foregone volume. But I will tell you though is, it doesn't -- what we're seeing in our markets is that, the customer demand and consumer demand appears to be there, the challenges we've had don't appear to be that dissimilar to others, and we are seeing in markets where we're -- where our staffing and where lower COVID staffing challenges that we saw during the quarter, we have a number of our markets growing in double digits. So, we're confident that as we get further through this and past this, there's plenty of business out there and that we can meaningfully accelerate our growth rate. Thanks, Ed. Hi, Lauren, thanks for the questions. I think that's -- we do believe that the higher gross profits is sustainable, TBD and the exact same -- or the exact level to your point based on what happens with inflation, but we think the combination of the things and also just even the environment that we're in and with the higher labor cost challenges all contribute to stronger gross profitability \u2013 to maintain stronger gross profit per case.  So we're confident in our ability to maintain a higher level there even though it may move around a little bit from quarter-to-quarter. And I think you've seen over the years even leading up to the pandemic, we were successful in expanding gross profit and expanding our operating leverage as we improved our EBITDA margins. I think specific to the fourth quarter, I'm not going to speculate any exact amount.  I think the -- with holiday timings, I guess the way I would suggest thinking about it is, in the holiday product mix, etc., whatever it shapes out to be is really a Q4 2021 and doesn't change how we think about and probably how the industry thinks about the recovery into 2022 and beyond. I think the positive is, it seems like from what we and others are preparing, it seems there probably will be more activity, so that's an encouraging sign from a demand and people getting out more. I think that all bodes well for the continued recovery into 2022. That's really more around the categories in which the inflation came in. So just because in the third quarter a lot of it came from proteins and as -- if I remember from what I talked about in the past is more of those categories tend to be a fixed markup per case or per pound. So, you don't necessarily get gross profit to go up quite at the same level as sales, so there's nothing that I would call out that's fundamentally different. Thanks. No, you did not. And that's -- in our business, historically back to pre-pandemic, just Q1 and Q4 absolute volume, is lower for us than Q2 and Q3. And I think that's the thing that's -- and some of the outlooks that, people have considered them, it's looking new at more as restaurants as opposed to our industry and our business has historically worked. Yes. So my comment was -- I'll start with that we do expect -- we expect the drivers to perform very similar to Q3, but we do expect Q4 EBITDA to be below Q3, not because of the change in the core business, but because of the seasonal labor we're buying. So if I go to the volume piece of it, yes. So in Q4, I gave as a reference, typically we sell 6 to 7 million fewer cases in Q4 than Q3. And then the other thing on top of it this year, if you're comparing, say at 2019 is, New Year's and Christmas both fall in that last week of 2021. So it has a negative -- additional negative impact of about a 100 basis points in the fourth quarter of this year that, will then help in Q1 of next year. So again -- that is timing. And even the downturn in volume is really again, it's just seasonal, not a change in the actual business outlook. Sure. Hi, Jeff, it's Dirk I'll take that. I think that ultimately, we are confident our ability to pass it through, as you've seen now for two quarters in a row, our processes and our customer base in the way contracts are setup, set us up well for that. So pleased with the performance across these, and I think we expect as long as inflation continues, that we'll continue to operate effectively and passing it through. I think your point is so what we did see is we saw inflation, or are seeing inflation moderate a little bit into October. But just as I said on the last quarter call, we saw that in July.  So at this point, we're going to continue to watch what happens. And Pietro made reference earlier, but operators are -- they're very thoughtful, they're creative, and can go with different options as to how they think about if you have higher inflation in certain categories to be able to manage their food costs. And that's where our differentiated model also can help with them from a sales and service perspective. I think as you go into '22, it's harder to know exactly what happens.  Our focus is, like I said, helping operators manage through it, and at the same time, making sure that we have our processes running well, so that, we can pass it through. I think as you've seen with your opening comment and how it's an ability to pass through, that is one of the advantages that our business has, that lot of others don't is on food cost inflation. It is a pretty direct pass-through on -- in our case, about 70% of our customer base, and that's one of the key enablers of such strong gross profit in Q2 and then again in Q3. With Q3 being a lot of the highest we've seen or the highest we've seen in recent years. I don't know that it's subsides, I just using October as a data points. It indicates that what we saw in the month is not a lot of incremental growth above where the third quarter exited. So I think it's hard to know and like others, we'll continue to watch as we go to the fourth quarter. Thanks, Jeff. We haven't specifically and don't expect right now, to have to quantify the specific impacts of these. However, a few things that I can share is, a number of these things are the pieces that are helping and driving. Ultimately, what we're trying to balance each year is that, top-line growth. That also margin expansion, which just go back a reference from 2015 to 2019. So leading up in the pandemic, we expand our EBITDA margins by about 90 basis points. So it's really pushing each of these levers.  From a customer mix perspective, although we are seeing some negatives in a certain healthcare and hospitality is still being down some, the improvements in the net new business wins that Pietro talked about in the higher-margin there and some of the pricing actions and the types of customers we're serving on the local customers have had a meaningful positive impact on our margins and ultimately on our EBITDA for the last few quarters.  So we expect to continue to move on those, I think on the other pieces that Pietro had on the page there, it's a private label as we continue to focus on growth there, that's almost twice as profitable as manufacturers brands. So that is an opportunity that we've made significant progress in recent years and we would expect to continue to because we have a lot of opportunities still that remains there.  And then from the supply chain perspective that we're kind of midstream on a number of those things. Rational -- assortment rationalization is a great one because it helps simplify our operation. And in this environment of product availability challenges with vendors, actually a better experience for customers as well. It's a good win-win, and we're to continue to strike this balance in order to improve or grow our EBITDA. Sure. So we haven't broken out the specific percentages now or historically. It is meaningfully more, because of that sheer amount of hiring we've done in recent months. To tell you as you think about ramp up. So warehouse and selectors contend to be in the neighborhood of 3 to 6 months until they get closer to that level. Drivers can take a little bit longer, but as Pietro said, since we are at the level of staffing and that we were in 2019 and our focus remains at a few select markets, we feel that, we're well-positioned really to work on reducing our supply chain costs, improving the productivity, as we move ahead to mid-2022. Also, most importantly, being able to continue to serve more profitable customers and continue to grow EBITDA. Sure, Alex. Good morning. So freights continues to be a headwind, not that different than recent quarters, and it's really largely driven by just tightness in the overall freight market. So when you ask about impact, so it's meaningful but less than the impact of just the overall, I'll call it separate supply chain labor and its impact on volume even though a lot of the logistics is largely -- it's all labor challenge. What I will tell you is we learned a lot back in 2018 when the freight market really tightened up. We put a number of plays in place there. We've executed against those in 2021 and it's been challenging, especially in this part of the business because those freight costs have continued to increase so it's not a steady target you're working against.  So we've made significant progress and are closing sort of some of the, call it headwind, as the year has gone on, and we continue to work through those and feel like we'll be very well-positioned as we get to a more steady environment through there, both from a cost perspective, but also from a service perspective. We're balancing both of them. So we want to make sure it's about getting that product, whether it's some of it we pick up with our own trucks, some of it we contract with third-parties.  And in this environment, we've really leaned out a lot of the strength for the third-parties with the partners that we have out there, that we're trying to make sure we're getting our loads picked up and into our facilities on time. So it's probably -- based on what you read out there, it's not something that's going away imminently, but it continues well into ' 22, And we can't control the end of it. The thing we can control is making sure we're getting our product and continue to make progress on the P&L side of it as we work through this. And that will continue to be our focus. Yes, there is, there is a little bit when it's on the decline. I think the thing over time, our industry and our business, we like kind of slow and steady inflation could does help grow gross profit dollars. But yes, in a period of call it volatility are up and down, it does create some opportunities to -- to take -- to take some pricing. During this environment, it's really trying to strike that balance again of pricing fairly to our customers. And just managing for the against the tight supply backdrop that we're we're all experiencing. Thanks Ed. Good question. So yes, we do feel like the visibility is quite good. And that was really one of the things that we're taking feedback from various others last quarter where people were, as you can imagine, sizing, could this be a $10 million issue could this be $100 million or as you try to put some context around it. And although we don't know exactly where it lands on, we think that that is a very good range. And I think the other thing that we're continuing to gain confidence is the success we're having in margin improvements with customers.  And so, again, we don't know any of that amount, depending on where and what lands as permanent. But we do expect that, most if not all of that permanent increase or higher level of inflation in the current year that, we will be able to offset with customer margins through the things we've already negotiated and are starting in those that will -- we expected to go to progress on in 2022. So from an overall earnings power of the business, as we get through this next year, we don't think that, it's a permanent inhibitor as opposed to something that's more temporary or transitory over this next year. Yes. I think that you've got the big pieces. You're right, inflation as well as the normal inflation and plus the incremental inflation, you'll continue to have some higher cost on top of that next year as we get back to 2019 level of productivity through this first half of the year, as Pietro talked about. And then you're right, we do expect to drive some incremental productivity through the things that Pietro referenced along with some initiatives that we have underway. I think those are the main things. Out of 130, there is a little bit of that, that is in distribution fixed. But those cost reductions, 130 is really more about fixed cost, not the variable distribution which should be driver selectors, etc. So I would attribute very little of the 130 to that as opposed to the pieces that I just talked about. Maybe, I'll separate it into 2. So there's the normal pass-through that, happens automatically for food cost inflation. That is pretty quick as you probably remember from prior comments, I made that, can happen when contracts reset weekly to monthly-ish, so pretty quick. And then on the non-contract again, because of the product supply issues, those pass - throughs are happening quite quickly. On the labor side, what we are doing and have been doing is, actively engaging with a number of our customers to really try to discuss with them the opportunities to improve margins and in this labor environment, it's resulting in some very constructive discussions.  Because it's not a different conversation or in almost all cases, not different than than what they are experiencing. And so we've had good success with close to half of that 40-ish $1 million number that, we've already reached agreement on, that either is in place or what will be going in place over the coming months. So just for context, good progress and expect to continue through there, and that's what gives us the confidence that we'll be able to mitigate most, if not all, of this year's incremental inflation through pricing. All right. Thank you."

            "name": "Pietro Satriano",
            "content": "Thank you, Melissa. Good morning, everyone. Third quarter results were in line with expectations. Volume for the quarter was up 18% over prior year and 6% below 2019 as the industry continued to recover. EBITDA margins were up slightly as we continue to successfully manage through both higher-than-normal product and labor inflation. This performance resulted in strong cash generation, which contributed to further deleverage from the prior quarter. Since the industry is demonstrating that it is well on its way to recovery, we are shifting our discussions and our goals to be more in line with our pre -pandemic strategy.  First, to profitably grow market share with our Great Food Made Easy differentiation. Second, to optimize gross profit margins. And third, to execute with an intense focus on operational efficiency. But first, let me start, as I usually do, with a brief update on the industry on slide 3. Industry foot traffic at restaurants in the third quarter was largely in line with the prior quarter despite the surge in COVID cases due to Delta. This underscores our view that industry demand is resilient, and that demand for eating out or taking out at restaurants is largely past COVID. In fact, as seen by the chart on the right, Technomic is now calling for the entire industry to recover to pre-pandemic levels across restaurants and other customer types alike by 2024.  Based on our own current trends, we are confident that US Foods will recover ahead of the industry with our volume returning to 2019 levels some time in 2022. This reaffirms our continued ability to gain market share. Now let me turn to our volumes on slide 4. Restaurant volume for the third quarter was generally in line with the second quarter, and a slight dip in growth rate that you see in the third quarter is attributable to COVID-related staffing challenges in a handful of markets. If not for these challenges, we believe we would have achieved higher volume and market share gains, gains that are fueled by our differentiated Great Food Made Easy platform. October volumes to restaurants are trending slightly higher than the third quarter. Hospitality volume continues to recover, while volume to healthcare was flat for the reasons that I mentioned on our last call. Some lingering restrictions on visitors has hurt food consumption in hospitals, while Senior Living has yet to recover to pre-pandemic occupancy rates. We think recovery in Senior Living is simply a matter of time, given the favorable demographics of an aging population.  Lastly, we continue to have great success finding larger multi-geography customers across healthcare, hospitality, and chains. For the two years combining 2020 and 2021, we are on track to add $1 billion in net incremental business across these three customer types, some of whom will onboard in 2022. This $1 billion is net of any exits over the last 2 years, including strategic access as we continue to optimize our portfolio. The single most important reason cited by these large customers for switching to US Foods continues to be our service model, which makes it easier and simpler for customers to do business with us.  I will now update you on the elements of our strategy starting on Page 4 -- sorry, Page 5, with how Great Food Made Easy will continue to drive market share gains with target customers. Recall that Great Food Made Easy consists of 3 elements: Innovative products, industry-leading technology, and a selling and service model based on a team of experts that support our sellers, what we call team-based selling. Let's start with innovative products. We had yet another successful Scoop launch, featuring labor-saving products that are highly relevant to customers in this tight labor market.  This was the tenth anniversary of Scoop, and since then we have launched 540 exclusive, innovative products, of which 80% are still sold somewhere in our network, a remarkable stick rate. Also of note, on the product side during the quarter, we rolled out Tender by Design, an innovative and proprietary beef program that we inherited with the acquisition of Food Group. In the sub-category that we launched, we saw a 300-basis-point increase in market share, and we expect further market share gains as we expand the lineup. Turning to technology for the second element of Great Food Made Easy platform.  We continue to expand our leadership position with frequent releases of enhancements, including a recent update that provides customers with real-time inventory visibility during the ordering process, which is critical in this environment of supply volatility. Recent third-party research with customers reaffirmed our lead in technology in our industry with customers rating the US Foods mobile app significantly better with a Net Promoter Score several times higher than the competition.  Representative quotes from the survey include, easier to navigate, most logical setup, and able to show all breadth of products and ways to save money. Lastly, on the third element of our differentiation platform, our team of experts. Fast Company named US Foods one of the 95 brands that matter in recognition of the seminars, playbooks, and expertise that we delivered to customers to help them navigate the pandemic. Having now just covered how Great Food Made Easy is driving EBITDA growth and market share gains, I'm turning to page 6 to cover the second and third elements of our strategy that is optimizing gross profit margins and driving operational efficiency. Let's start with our efforts to optimize gross profit.  As Dirk will cover shortly, gross profit per case for the quarter was the highest it has been in recent years. Despite some headwinds from unfavorable customer and product mix, considering to this expansion in gross profit has been: First, our ability to manage and pass-through inflation; second, continued growth in private label brands; and third, the continued optimization of terms and customers in our portfolio. For the quarter, private label as a percent of total sales in our legacy US Foods broadline business was 36.6%, which represents almost 140-basis-point increase compared to Q3 of 2019.  And we still see plenty of opportunity for further growth in private label penetration, which will further expand gross profit margins. We also continue to optimize our portfolio of customers, negotiating better terms, bringing on new, more profitable business, but were warranted exiting customers at the low-end of the profitability range. For new business in healthcare, hospitality, and national chains that I referred to and that we brought on this year is coming in at margins that are 3 times higher than the existing base. Still on page 6, I want to update you on the third and last element of our strategy, an intense focus on operational efficiency. In supply chain, while the challenging labor environment persists, we have made significant progress in our hiring, and our headcount for drivers and selectors as now above 2019 and close to our staffing targets. The resulting high penetration of new warehouse and driver associates, not surprisingly, was a headwind to productivity in the quarter. But we do expect to return to 2019 productivity levels by mid-2022, as the tenure of the workforce returns to more normal levels.  In addition, we continue to make progress on our supply chain efficiency roadmap. Since the beginning of the year, we have reduced assortment by 15%, which not only contributes to higher service levels for customers but also to higher productivity in the warehouse. With staffing now in a better position, we have resumed the deployment of our new picking technology, which we started in 2019, and we now expect to complete that by the middle of 2022. This technology has demonstrated to improve productivity, especially of new associates, as well as service to customers.  And lastly, we have resumed the roll out of more efficient receiving methods, which we had also paused. On the delivery side, with greater stability on the customer ordering front, we can now put greater focus on continuing to optimize routing. Taken together, these efficiency initiatives will help bring distribution expense closer to historical levels. Lastly, on the sales and administrative side, we still expect to retain 2/3 of the $180 million in fixed cost savings that we announced last year, with most of the investment -- of the reinvestment showing up as an expansion in our sales force, which will drive market share.  We're very pleased with the level of sales talent we are attracting. Our tools, our unique products, and our culture make us a very attractive choice for sellers. I will now move to slide 7. For a quick update on the Smart Foodservice and SGA Food Group acquisitions, which are both performing at or above expectations. We call that, the rationale for the Smart Foodservice acquisition was two-fold: 1. The opportunity to expand our presence in the Cash & Carry market, which is growing at roughly twice the delivery market with higher margins. On that front, we continue to secure real estate for expansion into new geographies, and 2.  The revenue synergies that, come from existing customers in existing markets. The fact that, same-store sales at our nearly 80 Chef's Stores, open at least 1 year, are ahead of 2019 levels provides some support for that thesis. And on the synergy front, we are beginning to see reductions in cost of goods and improvements in private label penetration. Lastly, we expect 2021 EBITDA for our Cash & Carry business to exceed 2019. Turning now to Food Group. Recall at the rationale for that acquisition was to complete our footprint in the important and growing Pacific Northwest region.  It was note, we recently won a significant national customer due to our strong presence in the Pacific Northwest, which was the result of this acquisition. We have now completed 6 warehouse system conversions and all have gone fairly smoothly. We expect to have 7 warehouses completed by year-end and all complete by early '22 with the continued progress on integration, Synergy capture remains on track.  And by the end of 2021, we will have captured approximately $40 million of the projected $65 million in Synergies. And as I mentioned earlier, we are now starting to see some of the revenue benefits across the entire US Foods Network from centers plate capabilities that came with this acquisition. I will now like to turn the call over to Dirk to discuss our third quarter results and our outlook. Dirk. This is Pietro. So a number of -- in distribution, the leverage you're going to go after in terms of warehouse productivity, delivery productivity are levers that we continue to push on and continue to improve on, which is why probably there's a certain amount of familiarity to what we talked about. However, what I would call out is, especially on some dimensions, the assortment rationalization, some really good progress compared to historical norms. In terms of your question about investment, the 1 or 2 technology that I talked about in terms of picking technology really are very modest investment and the payback is pretty immediate. So -- this is Pietro, so we haven't seen that. I mean, as you've seen from the industry data and our own data, consumer demand continues to be very healthy. The increase in digital ordering and take-out has helped demand with food away from home. I think there's a couple of other data point, I would point to that, that lead us to believe that, from an outlook perspective, we're confident that the sector is very healthy. 1. Is if you look at the growth in food away from home relative to food away -- food at home, continues to close the gap and the expectation by one of the industry analysts is that the lines will cross sometime in 2022. I believe early 2023, in terms of more dollars being spent away from home than at home. And then third thing, if you look at inflation between food the way at home -- food away from home and food at home, the GAAP has really narrowed over the last several quarters. So the inflation we're seeing, especially in the proteins as their commented on it, is inflation that's being seen in both food away from home and food at home. And I think if there's any substitution that happens, that it will happen within the sector, or perhaps less with the expensive proteins and more towards some of the less expensive proteins. So we feel pretty good about the outlook. Do you mind repeating the question? Was it about adding -- -- independent locations? I understand. Okay. So that's what I was referring to, in a handful of markets, we had to rationalize the amount of demand we were able to serve that was sometimes due to driver shortage, sometimes due to selectors. And I think as I mentioned, it was less about the storage and we had a number of facilities, unfortunate disproportionately large facilities, where COVID just went through the facility and we had a 1 or 2 weeks setback in terms of our ability to serve those customers. But by the way, we also benefited from that in other markets where it happened to other competitors. And when we look at those other markets, we had some pretty good increases in market share. Thanks. Just to clarify, Nicole. When we talk about 2022, we are talking about the volume outlook. And that's a function of hospitality still being 2/3 of what was in 2019, but you see the continued growth. Healthcare being around 10% of that below 2019 and some of the occupancy rates returning back to prior levels and Senior Living. That's what we refer to in terms of 2022. In terms of the part of your question, I think we're in terms of where labor is coming from. So as you know, selectors and drivers are very different occupations. Drivers, commercial license, these are experienced drivers and there has been a headwind in terms of driver supply going back to before the pandemic.  And so what we're doing there is really aggressively recruiting. And as well, we've credit programs were by our selectors can train to become drivers and that's a great path upwards and retention vehicle. Selectors, it's different. They most often come from other warehouse environments, not necessarily in food distribution, but they come from other warehouse environments. And there the -- ours is a very fast-paced, high-volume environment [Indiscernible] And so it's training them on the method in our warehouses, in our industry that might be different from where they come from, but at least they have a sense of what their environment they'll be working in. Hopefully that answers your question. Sure. Thanks. I think at part is, because that's where we've seen so far. Jeffrey, we've seen our restaurant business recovered more quickly than the broader industry. So it's based in large part on the evidence so far in our market share gains. And again, as I said, that the two sectors that have still the most opting for recovery around healthcare and hospitality, but we're very optimistic about that. In terms of the type of business or where the growth will come from, I think it's really around the right business.  Whether it's existing customers where we can grow share of wallet or new business, it's around business that, has a right to get fit with our footprint, a good fit in terms of the SKUs we cover, and part of the work we've done over the last 3 to months in terms of optimizing the portfolio that I referred to, and that's been a combination of renegotiating terms as Dirk referred to [Indiscernible] some customers where we couldn't find the right fit. It's really about growing in a healthy fashion and in a way that expands margins, both in terms of absolute dollars from growth and expands the EBITDA margins. So I'll start and maybe Dirk can chime in. Look, we think we have great opportunity in terms of both operational effectiveness and efficiency. And we think the addition of John Heinbockel and John Tennyson (ph) as CI over the last 9 months will help us get at that opportunity in aggressive fashion. I don't know that there need to be trade-offs, John, between the customer experience. The example I talked about in the prepared remarks is the level of assortment. What happens with you build your assortment too broadly. While on the surface that may look like helping driving sales that necessitates greater inventory.  The tail typically is harder to forecast and so you end up with a lower customer service experience. So we believe that the opportunity for a better serving our customers and getting out the operational efficiency, and effectiveness actually go hand in hand together. And I could give you 4 other examples in addition to the assortment ones. The work we did last year and prior to that, when we consolidated the single-site area divisions into multi-site areas, those were all on the administrative side.  Whereas what we're talking about on the fixed cost side, what we're talking about now in terms of opportunity, is primarily on variable costs in terms of operations. And as Dirk mentioned, part of it is just the natural evolution we have an equal number of drivers and selectors who are new. And so there will be some natural productivity benefit. And then on top of that, we layer on some of the initiatives that we've talked about historically, some of them are new, and some we have to pause during COVID, putting new technology in place, picking perspective when you're short staffed could make things worse. So that's why now we feel given our way back to 2019 levels, we feel that we're in a good position to resume some of that work that we were talking pre-pandemic. It's significant material. But it's -- we're not prepared at this position at this point to size it. But stay tuned. Good news on those I'm sorry, John. Yes. So good news. We're seeing both lines per stop increased and we're also seeing cases per line increase. And as I've said, historically, the lines per stop or a good proxy for our ability to gain share of wallet, and the cases per line are a good proxy for customer or operator demand. And we've seen both of them go up over the last few months, which I think is a function of both us, the quality of the new customers we're bringing on and as well continue to optimize our portfolio of existing customers. [Indiscernible] So assortment is one of those things that, like customer optimization or certain optimization is ongoing. And we put up, particularly push this year and part of that was prompted by the supply volatility we experienced part was prompted by the opportunity from an operational efficiency perspective. But that's an ongoing opportunity that never ends. I think you said, you had a follow-up, Peter, as I remember. We have not -- typically what we go after from a store and perspective is either the duplication in the middle of that curve or some of the tail. And we work closely with our salespeople. We work closely with our customers in terms of identifying those opportunities. So we have not seen any impact from that work from a sales perspective. I'm looking at the chart here on Page 4, and it does show continued progress on hospitality segment parks 2019. We'll continue to see that some of the factors that need to work themselves out. I believe I mentioned on last call, so we have some customers who have some very large parks. They are staffing challenged just like other customers and manufacturers. And so that is limiting the amount of guest that they can accommodate so that's one. There has been less travel in-bound into the U.S. Now there has been more domestic travel, but how those [Indiscernible] is hard to tell. Then I think we've mentioned this as well the return to office or the lack of business travel, which seems to be picking up as also been one of the factors that have held us customers coming back.  But we see all 3 overtime coming back to pre-pandemic levels and we see that yellow line continuing to get back to pre-pandemic levels. And as well, too the other thing too, I think I mentioned last time is we've had now that, the hospitality segment is opening up and people are willing to talk about business opportunities and working with us as opposed to other distributors. We think, any potential shortfall that, exist from an industry perspective is, if even if there is one, we will more than make up with our pipeline and our ability to gain share in this setting. Thank you. So I'd like to close by thanking our 26,000 associates who amidst what is still a difficult environment, have continued to do a phenomenal job of serving our customers and generating the results that we discuss today. Our three-pronged strategy of possibly growing market share by leveraging Great Food Made Easy, 2. Optimizing gross margins and 3. bringing a relentless focus to operational efficiency continues to show progress. And that is the result of the great work by our management team and all our associates. Thank you for joining us today and have a great week."

After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ms. Melissa Napier. Please go ahead.\nMelissa Napier: Thank you, Angelica. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our US Foods second quarter earnings call. Pietro Satriano, our CEO; and Dirk Locascio, our CFO will provide an overview of our results for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2021. We\u2019ll take your questions after our prepared remarks conclude. Please provide your name, your firm and limit yourself to one question. During today\u2019s call and unless otherwise stated, we\u2019re comparing our second quarter results and first half results to the same period in fiscal year 2020. References to organic financial results during today\u2019s call exclude the contributions from Smart Foodservice through April 23, 2021 as the acquisition closed on April 24. Our earnings release issued earlier this morning and today\u2019s presentation slides can be accessed on the Investor Relations page of our website. In addition to historical information, certain statements made during today\u2019s call are considered forward-looking statements. Please review the risk factors in our 2020 Form 10-K for those potential factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in those statements. And lastly, during today\u2019s call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. All reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the schedules on our earnings press release as well as in the appendices to the presentation slides posted on our website. And I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Pietro.\nPietro Satriano: Thank you, Melissa. Good morning, everyone and welcome. So during today's call, we are going to cover three main themes just like last time. First, the industry recovery that we spoke of on our last call continues to progress. Restaurants are welcoming customers back into their establishment as restrictions have been lifted across the country and US Foods continues to participate in this recovery in a meaningful fashion. Second, a great food made easy differentiated platform is helping to drive market share gains with both small and large customers. And third, our financial results are continuing to recover to pre-pandemic levels. Our improved results are being driven by a recovery in case volumes, improved margins and the performance of our recent acquisitions. So let's begin on slide three, restaurants are recovering at a rapid pace as evidenced by the foot traffic at food-away-from-home establishment shown in the chart on the left. The traffic for the industry has continued to increase over the last several months and is very close to returning to pre-pandemic levels. A nearly full recovery in foot traffic as occurred despite the fact that some markets across the US are still ramping up, which is shown by the chart on the right. This shows our own restaurant volumes for markets that have opened less than three months ago versus markets that have been opened six months or longer. Restaurants in markets have been opened the longest are showing growth rates in the high single digit range compared to 2019, while restaurants that are in markets have recently reopened are still down compared to 2019. We believe our view to be representative of what is happening in the country, which indicates that even with volume above 2019 levels, there's still some headroom for growth for restaurants. Moving to slide four, the benefit of markets reopening can be seen in the improvement and total case volume that we are experienced -- that we experienced during the second quarter. In the chart, you can see that restaurant continue to trend ahead of 2019 levels with both independence and chains ahead of 2019, by roughly comparable margin. We expect this to continue, support in part by the growth from the recently reopened markets that I just spoke about. Most of July was also in line with May and June, but we did see in the last two weeks, a tick down of about a 100 basis points, but it's too early to say whether that small change is due to the impact of the Delta variant. Moving to other customer types, the reopening and the related increase in travel is also benefiting our hospitality business, which is now running about at more than 70% of 2019 case volumes and a large improvement from the first quarter. Leisure travel has returned in a very meaningful way this summer and is driving a large part of the improvement. We expect this improvement in that customer type to continue as other customer types within hospitality catch up to leisure travel. First, even within leisure travel, some large parts are still operating below maximum capacity. Second, large conventions, which have in part returned, typically require considerable lead time of up to a year. And third as we've discussed before, there is a little bit of uncertainty about the future level of business travel. When we consider the impact of these trends, we expect hospitality to recover later in 2022. And when combined with our market share gains, we do expect our hospitality volume to return to pre-pandemic levels. Our healthcare business has remained steady throughout the pandemic. Different factors are impacting different customer types within healthcare. With senior living, for example, occupancy rates are still down in the mid to low single digits, but with aging demographics, we do expect demand from senior living facilities to recover over time. With acute care, some employees are still working from home and it is yet unclear where this was settled over time. So to hospitality, when we consider the above trends combined with our market share gains, we do expect healthcare to return to pre-pandemic levels as well, sometime later in 2022. So in summary, based on what we know today about trends within each customer type combined with our recent market share gains and our strong pipeline of new customers, our best estimate is that we will return to pro forma 2019 total case volume later in 2022. I am now on slide five. A Great Food Made Easy strategy is the primary reason that we win new customers. The Great Food piece of our differentiation strategy is anchored by Scoop, our product innovation platform. Given the labor challenges restaurant operators are facing the latest edition of Scoop features a number of labor saving products that are very much on trend, as well as the number of fresh Robin [ph]. We've also begun rolling out the food groups tender by design beef products to the Legacy US foods markets. Tender by design is a specialized process that produces high quality cut states with customers. The rollout has been met with rave reviews by customers. Our leading technology solutions and expert support are the backbone of the Made Easy part of our differentiation strategy. In past calls we've talked about our ghost kitchen playbook, which have played a big part in helping operators generate additional revenue. The following is a quote from an owner of an Italian restaurant outside Chicago, \"they use the ghost kitchen context to diversify to chicken wings. We survived the first 100 days of the shutdown, and I don't think we would have survived this one if we didn't have our ghost kitchen of bakedwings.com, it has literally been a lifesaver for us\". Most recently rocks [ph], a restaurant operations consultant have been focused on a series of webinars to help customers navigate the challenging labor environment, including topics such as payroll management and doing more with less staff. Thanks to the benefits of virtual technology we are able to leverage our best rocks and food fanatic chefs across a number of geographies and customers can easily schedule one-on-one conference and simply scan a QR code. Finally, on the topic of technology, I would like to welcome John Tonnison to the US Foods team. John was recently announced as our new Chief Information and Digital Officer. He brings extensive experience leading IT organizations in the distribution space, most notably, the last 10 years as CIO of one of the largest tech distribution companies globally. John's mandate is to continue to enhance our leading e-commerce platform while working with Phil Hancock, our Chief Supply Chain Officer to make our supply chain the most effective and efficient in our industry. Moving to Slide six, last quarter, we spoke about the challenging operating environment for customers distributors and manufacturers alike and while labor and product supply challenges continue to persist, our actions have helped mitigate these challenges. On the labor side, we have made good progress in hiring warehouse and transportation associates. We filled over a third and we reopen positions that we discussed last quarter, and we expect to continue to close this gap of hiring and retention incentives have contributed to improving the pipeline and to reducing churn. In addition, we do expect the labor market to continue to improve. In those states that have ended supplemental unemployment benefits, we have seen a dramatic increase in applicant rates. Lastly, in some select markets, we have made some hourly wage rate increases, especially for entry-level wages. Taken together, these incentives and wage adjustments are having a modest impact on the P&L, which Dirk will discuss shortly. On the product supply side, service levels from vendors are still well below 2019 as a result of manufacturers experiencing the same labor and freight challenges that we are. We are utilizing our scale, our relationships and alternative sourcing arrangements to help secure the product we need to effectively serve our customers. Our net promoter survey confirmed that we are fairing as well as, or better than our competitors on this front. Possibly moving to slide seven, both the Smart Food service and Food Group acquisition are performing at or above expectation. Beginning with cash and carry, same-store sales that are nearly chef [ph] stores open at least one year are ahead of 2019 levels. We call that part of the rationale for the Smart Food service acquisition is that the cash and carry market will roughly twice we deliver market with higher margins. As the reopening continues, we're seeing these pre-pandemic trends take shape again. We are bullish on the outlook for chef store and expect that 2021 EBITDA levels will exceed those of 2019. The other rationale for the Food Group acquisition was the long runway of growth that we see for chef store. We expect to have three new stores open in 2021, all in existing market. 2022 is when we should begin to expand our footprint ultimately doubling our store count, making chef store a meaningful part of our growth story. Turning to Food Group, with dining restrictions recently lifted in Food Group in the Pacific Northwest we are starting to see volume return to those markets. Combined with the introduction of our differentiated scoop, e-commerce and team-based selling we expect these markets to be poised for growth in the future. As you'll recall, we have completed four warehouse systems conversion and now expect to have the remaining systems conversions completed by early 2022. Synergy capture remains on track and we expect to fully achieve the previously announced $55 million of synergies in 2023. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we are extending Food Groups, tendered-by-design process to legacy food locations. In addition, we're also extending Food Group's fresh produce capabilities to the rest of our customer base. Both of these initiatives will bring synergies to the legacy of the Foods network by providing customers with one of the highest quality product offering in the industry in two very important categories center-of-the-plate employees. I'll now turn the call over to Dirk to discuss our second quarter results and full year financial outlook. Dirk?\nDirk Locascio: Thank you, Pietro and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide nine. Our second quarter financial results improved significantly compared to recent quarters driven by continued volume recovery and strong gross profit results. During the quarter, restrictions on restaurants were lifted and leisure travel increased as Pietro noted. This resulted in group case volume with both our restaurant and hospitality customers and contributed to the significant increase in our adjusted EBITDA. During the second quarter, we also experienced record food and cost inflation across a number of different categories. Our teams did an excellent job of managing that inflation and passing it through to customers. This resulted in very strong, gross profit dollar and per case performance, which also was a significant contributor to our increased second quarter EBITDA. As Pietro mentioned, the operating environment remains difficult, but manageable. We've had success filling many of open warehouse and driver roles, but we like many other companies still have work left to do in order to get the full staffing levels especially, as demand increases further. Inbound product supply from vendors also remains a challenge. We have the processes and the tools in place to manage through these challenges and focuse on minimizing the impact on our customers. However, we do expect these headwinds to persist at least through the end of 2021. Moving to Slide 10, net sales for the quarter were $7.7 billion up 68% from the second quarter of 2020. Food cost inflation for the quarter was 8.2% driven by product shortages and disruptions in the supply chain. We experienced inflation in almost every major product category with the largest increases in poultry, pork and disposables. Adjusted gross profit for the quarter was $1.3 billion up 73% from prior year and our aggressive growth adjusted gross margin improved by 50 basis points. Adjusted gross profit dollars increased faster than net sales despite the high food cost inflation highlighting our very strong gross profit per case performance in the quarter. As a recall, inflation benefits, our gross profit dollars while it is typically a headwind to gross margin rate. As I just mentioned, we had over 8% food cost inflation in the second quarter with much of it in commodity categories. This means our gross margin as a percent of sales is compressed yet our gross profit per case is by far the best we've had since COVID began and in fact, those ahead of 2019 second quarter on our Legacy US food business. This high level of inflation and our ability to effectively manage it increased our second quarter gross profit by approximately $25 million and as inflation moderates, or if we see deflation, we don't expect this gain to continue in Q3 or Q4. We're very pleased with our gross profit performance in second quarter, especially given the freight headwinds, which we expect to continue at least through 2021. Adjusted operating expenses in the second quarter were $940 million up 46% versus the prior year. As a percent of sales, adjusted operating expense was 12.3% down from 14.2% in the prior year. While food cost inflation is headwind to our gross margin rate, it is a benefit to our operating expense as a percent of sales. Just as a point of reference, our OpEx as a percent of sales for our legacy US Foods business is about 60 basis points lower or better than it was in the second quarter of 2019, largely due to the significant food cost inflation I just spoke of. Pietro mentioned earlier that we are seeing additional supply chain labor inflation this year, primarily related to signing and retention policies. The additional inflation this year is about $20 million to $30 million and is above and beyond the approximately $50 million with normal annual supply chain labor inflation we experienced. As the labor market normalizes we anticipate not needing to use these bonuses to the same extent and therefore expect most of these costs to be transitory. We increased the use of these bonuses during the second quarter and as a result, didn't have the full run rate in our second quarter numbers. We have made a lot of good progress hiring warehouse and driver associates, however, are still in the process of filling open positions as our business continues to recover. On slide 11, adjusted EBITDA was $332 million for the quarter, a very strong rebound from the second quarter of 2020. Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of sales was 4.3%. Earlier, as Pietro mentioned, our current best estimate is to return to pro forma 2019 case volume levels later in 2022. We also expect to return to 2019 pro forma adjusted EBITDA expect that to be later than the return of case volume. During 2022, we expect the recovery in restaurant volume plus market share gains will make up for the slower recovery in the hospitality and healthcare volume. While our category gross profit rates are well on their way to recovery, we expect the logistics headwinds to continue into 2022. For distribution costs, the two years of wage inflation, plus the temporary incentives and potentially some higher wage inflation that will require additional productivity and customer margin improvements to offset. For fixed costs, we still expect the $130 million of permanent cost reductions completed in 2020 to flow through to the bottom line. As Pietro said, the integration of Food Group are on track, including expected synergies. Overall, we are very confident about achieving performance 2019 EBITDA levels, but the continued uncertainty with respect to freight labor markets makes the specific timing less certain. We know the actions we have and continue to take will result in us being a stronger company going forward than we were pre-pandemic. Finally, on this page, adjusted net income in the second quarter was $146 million and adjusted diluted. EPS was $0.58 compared to a loss in the prior year. We are now reflecting the additional shares from the preferred equity transaction in our adjusted diluted earnings per share calculation. With these shares reflected, our outstanding adjusted diluted share count is approximately 250 million shares. I am now on Slide 12, operating cash flow for the first six months of the year was $250 million. In the first half of 2020, we had a significant benefit to operating cash flow from working capital. This was a result of reduced inventory levels and extended accounts payables days during the early stages of the pandemic. In the first half of 2021, working capital has been largely neutral for operating cash flow. Our business generates a significant amount of operating cash flow each year as evidenced by the $250 million we generated in the first half of this year, despite our business being in a recovery phase. We will use this cash to reinvest in our business and reduce our total outstanding debt. In the second quarter, we proactively paid down $200 million in total debt in addition to our standard debt repayments. Our leverage ratio dropped by more than two turns due to the paydown and significant adjusted EBITDA improvement. Our target leverage ratio remains between 2.5 and 3 times, and we expect to continue to make progress against this target over the balance of this year, the additional debt reduction and increased EBITDA. We had a very strong second quarter and are focused on the continued recovery of our business. Looking ahead, we expect both Q3 and Q4 EBITDA dollars to be below Q2 as a result of not repeating the approximately $25 million of inflation benefit from Q2, as well as the increased OpEx related to the full run rate of supply chain sign on a retention bonuses put in place during the second quarter and the impact of our continued reinvestment in sales resources as we discussed previously. Our industry is rapidly recovering, and we are participating in that recovery in a meaningful way. Our volume is recovering well. Our gross profit is strong and we are focused on effectively managing the supply chain challenges we and the industry are facing and our acquisition performance is on track resulting in improved results and we're using the cash flow generated to invest in our business and reduce that. Finally, the actions we took during the pandemic have positioned us to continue to gain share with both large and small customers. Operator, at this time, we can now open the call for questions.\nOperator: Yes, sir. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alex Slagle from Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nAlex Slagle: Thanks. Good morning. Just a question and thinking about some of the incremental headwinds from the accelerated hiring and retention efforts, it sounds like you expect these headbands to continue for a few more quarters. At what point do you think the acceleration in these costs are the peaks and move toward a more moderated case with the cost increases?\nDirk Locascio: Good morning. This is Dirk, I'll take that. It's hard to know exactly, but to your point, I would expect just based on some of the early evidence that we've seen in states that have ended unemployment and as we continue to make good progress in hiring that, as you get toward the end of the year, we should be quite a ways there. So it's hard to know exactly there, but at this point, best estimate would be, as we get towards the end of the year into 2022, you begin to see that moderate and begin to return to a more normal environment. What I will tell you though, is in this environment, some of the labor challenges in supply challenges, vendor, it's also been a really good opportunity for us to engage in discussions with a number of our customers about margin and just other operational factors to improve our ability to serve them. So overall, really partnering with our customers as well as trying to manage through this as best we can.\nAlex Slagle: Sounds good. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh. Your line is now open.\nPeter Saleh: Great. Thank you very much. I believe last quarter you guys were talking about the labor shortage, and I think you had mentioned you were about a thousand drivers and selectors short of where you'd like to be. Can you guys give us an update on where you are today in terms of getting up against that goal?\nPietro Satriano: Yeah, this is Pietro. So we, as I mentioned in my comments, we've covered over a third of that gap and that gap to just to clarify as well to what we anticipate as we move in the future not necessarily the gap today. So we're making really good progress. What I would say is we've really wrapped up the hiring machine for selectors and drivers. We're hiring exactly the right number that we are looking for. The challenge right now is just reducing the churn rate, as I'm sure you've seen in the process, rates are at an all time high and so part of the measures we're putting in place are really aimed at reducing the churn. So we can continue to close the gap and talk about.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nicole Miller from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nNicole Miller: Thank you. Good morning. Also on labor inflation my question is, why just yourself specifically, or the industry at large, do you feel like it's transitory. The total cost might not come in the form of bonus, but why does someone who wants to net that make less. I'm just curious of what circumstance would you see where it's just a total benefit conversation and you try to make it whole going forward in that way. And then at what level would you pass it on? The answer to the first question on the call having engaging the customer would lead me to believe that perhaps that's happening now. Thank you.\nPietro Satriano: Yeah. I'll start and I'll start with the second part of your question. So, as you mentioned, and as Derek mentioned, we have been passing on some of the inflation that we have seen certainly on the product side, but also where possible on the labor side. In terms of your question as to why it's transitory, I think there's a school of thought that is shared by many that the labor supply and imbalance is in itself transitory like with the speed of the recovery, probably faster than many expected. We've seen the demand for labor go up fast and the supply. The partial evidence for that is what I noted in those markets where supplemental unemployment benefits have ended. The hiring pipeline is several times better than it is in those markets where supplemental benefits are still in effect. And so those are some of the reasons why we believe these are transitory in nature.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nEdward Kelly: Yeah. Hi guys. Good morning. Hey, Dirk, I wanted to get back to what you, the color that you gave around EBITDA for Q3 and Q4. And what I was hoping that you would do is maybe just a little bit more color to sort of bridge, like the 3.32 of this quarter to the expectation you gave some numbers. But I think we're annualized, but I'm not sure maybe some of them were quarterly. And I don't think you talked about a number around sales resources. So maybe just help us bridge how we think about the back half and I also am not sure what you're assuming for volume within that what you're assuming for inflation. So just any color that would be helpful.\nDirk Locascio: Sure Ed. Happy to. So it's -- the reason was we wanted to provide the additional insight that I did is really because in the second quarter we really benefited from the strong inflation and as you see our ability to pass that through with really with gross profit per case being above 2019. And I think the important takeaway on that one is our second quarter results were strong with or without this additional inflation benefits. And so the thing we wanted to call out with the $25 million is that as the piece, that for the quarter alone helped that we given that there's not an expectation for many the industry and outlets for continued inflation as and even some modest deflation. So, I think that $25 million we stay sort of more modest or kind of flattish on inflation is the piece that we would not expect to repeat in Q3 or Q4. I think that if you look at the sales resources, we haven't talked about specific amounts. We've continued to hire kind of second quarter, third quarter fourth quarter. So I think you probably can get close up there with an estimate there on the impacts per quarter, as we continue to ramp up. We're well on our way there from an adding resources, and then in supply chain that $22 million to $30 million is largely what we expect in year this year with a portion of it in the second quarter, and then the rest of it through the balance of this year and most of that being in a form of these retention and sign-on bonuses that I've talked about. From a volume perspective, we do expect volume putting aside any impact that delta may have, but looking at the trajectory that the business was on, we expect volume recovery to continue there. So there's nothing that I was attending or that we are calling out that's what I would say, derailing the strong recovery, as opposed as just some things to keep in mind that are not as recurrent. So hopefully that helps.\nEdward Kelly: Okay. And then I wanted to ask you about sales growth versus case growth. There was a, 14.5% gap in inflation, but the rest was mix. What's driving that mix and is there incrementality within that mix? It's actually positive the gross profit dollars. So maybe we should be thinking about sort of case growth plus that and how does that look going forward as well?\nDirk Locascio: Sure. So the mix to your point, it can be a category or types of products, people buying as well as customer types. So I'll use the example with restaurants recovering faster than say healthcare hospitality. That's been a net positive when you look at sales. So there's not as direct of a math correlation that you can do from sort of the sales percentage of that mix versus gross profit. However, the thing to take away is with the strong performance, especially as you're looking at the independence and such, there is some benefit in our gross profit. And so that's part of the reason that what even with our strategy in recent years of growing these more attractive customer types. So as independents grow faster than the broader business, they are more accreative and so that helps the overall business. So on that one, I think that the mix, it has been positive. It's going to be more influenced by some of the external factors as healthcare hospitality and such continue to recovery, and depending on the pace of that, but overall gross profit dollars and rate good trajectory and we feel good about the pace of that recovery.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nJohn Glass: Thanks. Good morning. You mentioned that freight in labor is going to stick around, so you may need some additional productivity. I think that's what I heard. Do you have line of sight, is there actually work going on now to increase the productivity that you've already experienced? The $130 net million more than that? And if so, where does that come from? Can you just talk about if you're looking for new areas to save it? And specifically just on the cost of inflation, just as a quick follow up, are you actually seeing the rate of inflation beginning to come down is your expectation that will, but it hasn't yet. Just, we understand kind of where you are exiting the quarter in July on inflation.\nDirk Locascio: Sure. You've packed a lot of that question. So, I'll start with the second one because that's the quicker. So we have seen the rate of inflation slow. We're still seeing some modest inflation in some categories, but then seeing the meaningful deflation in other categories that are netting out closer to zero. So it's last kind four, six weeks. So, that is sort of the assumption is sort of how than more what we've been seeing more, more recently there. As far as your question on productivity, so, yes. I'll just remind, I put out there that the number that we sort of incur in a normal year on inflation in the supply chain, and we typically in a given year, we'll focus on mitigating as much of that as we can through productivity and as you can expect. So we do have some things that are underway in supply chain in particular, however, not near at the pace that we would have in a normal year. And as you can probably appreciate we and others in the industry are directing a lot more energy to running the business and really providing as good of an experience for the customer as we can during this challenging time. So therefore it leaves a little bit less time to focus on productivity. So you do end up with a slowing of sorts there, but we do still have some things going and feel confident in our ability to ramp that up faster under our new Hancock's leadership as we move ahead. Hopefully that helps.\nPietro Satriano: And just to add Derek, the 130 you were referring to in terms of fixed costs, no change to that, as Dirk said the productivity initiatives that Dirk was just referring to an answer on the variable side of things, whereas he said that the focus on customers and the onboarding of a large number of new associates has slowed down the productivity that we typically see on the variable side.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi, thank you. That the question is in the context of your gross profit dollar per case ahead of the second quarter of '19. Obviously, the dollar per any market share battles that are going out there. That some distributors, given obviously profitability recovery across the space, are perhaps using these gross profit dollars to gain share whether to existing customers or new customers and whether you think that's actually an opportunity over time for you to use GP dollars per case to drive case volume. Thanks.\nPietro Satriano: Maybe I'll start because we're really talking about market share and volume. So we've continued to make market share gains John. But I think we and others, and you've probably read about this, those markets are gains have probably been held back a little bit by the challenging labor staffing and document, just the desire to make sure that we serve customers in the way that is what they expect has probably held us back a little in terms of making even more aggressive market share gain in the last couple months and when I say, I mean, probably everyone.\nDirk Locascio: The team is always looking at it. It's balancing volume and margin. And so, driving those share gains smartly, and there are categories that from time to time we will choose to invest in that we think are accretive to the overall basket. So as you summarized well, it's about driving more gross profit dollars ultimately to the bottom line. And that's what we're really trying to balance and in this period made progress in gaining market share with small and large customers and very good, gross profit results at the same time.\nOperator: John Heinbockel from Guggenheim. Your line is now open.\nJohn Heinbockel: I want to start with where do you guys think your capacity is now? And with volume recovering, is this a good time to think about accelerating the calling of less profitable accounts? How and are you doing that?\nPietro Satriano: So, so it depends how you measure it John. I think what the capacity that's been talked a lot about is, again, as I mentioned in the question capacity as you're drawn to staffing. So if you're short drivers, there's only so many trucks that has hampered our ability to grow more than we have. But we still see us making, we still see we've made market share gains. And so as that kind of stabilized, and as we continue to close the gap, we believe we have the opportunity to continue to gain market share. We've had in a very small number of instances -- done some optimization in terms of resetting terms with customers. In that handful of cases, probably there's been a little bit of press on that. You can see that impacting us and the results have been diminimous when you look at volume growth versus 2019.\nJohn Heinbockel: And then maybe secondly, right. So I know you were investing in sales. I thought the number was $50 million, but were you sort of in the, you fill the third of the open positions, were you on the sales there's left to go, right? You said that's kind of out in the future. So it doesn't sound like that that's a front loaded investment, right. That, that may stretch out into next year is that fair?\nDirk Locascio: I'll take that, on the sales. So we're, as I mentioned with that what we haven't talked about a specific number, we're good way through that journey as well, and making progress and expected to get to that full investment run rate this year yet later in the year. I think from a supply chain perspective, we would expect to get to that kind of full staffing level yet in 2021, obviously, the market will dictate, but the thing to remember probably all the way back to our fourth quarter pause, I was talking about that or third quarter call last year is just the thing that we want to make sure is we're continuing to press hard on staffing, especially given that the challenging market that's out there and knowing that our businesses recovering and we continue to have the customer wins and share gains. So do expect to get to that level of staffing at some point later in 2021. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania from BMO Capital. Your line is now open.\nKelly Bania: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. Just had a quick one and the comment that sounds like it's maybe moderating a little bit, I'm just curious if there's an opportunity to kind of pass those smaller costs on at a more slower rate and maybe capture some margin as cost moderate or if that's happening across the industry, or if you have any opportunity to do that, just given where some of the elevated supply chain costs are.\nDirk Locascio: Hi Kelly. This is Dirk. Yes. So there is some moderate opportunity to do that, but that ends up being relatively short in timeframe because of you remember us talking about a large portion of our contract resets, which can be from weekly to monthly generally speaking. So a little bit of opportunity. The reason that I wanted to call out in the second quarter was just the combination of the inflation plus product shortages, etcetera, really combined with our processes tools enabled us to have really outsized gross profit gains, very pleased with that, and just highlighting that all of that was really strong and the quarter was strong with or without that we wouldn't expect that level of gain to continue going forward.\nKelly Bania: Got it. That's helpful. And just another one in terms of gross margin, we were kind of estimating gross margins about maybe a 100 basis points below pro forma levels with the acquisition positions, is that accurate? And can you help us maybe think about just the factors that get back to that kind of full gross margin?\nDirk Locascio: Kelly, do you mind clarifying what you're saying an estimated a 100 for the current quarter or\u2026\nKelly Bania: Yeah, just the 15.5, we were thinking that's kind of about a 100 basis points below, the kind of full pro forma estimate for the total company, just curious, what are the factor, how far below is gross margin today relative to kind of full potential and what are the factors that get that back over time?\nDirk Locascio: Thank you for clarifying. So the thing that makes it a little harder to talk about specific just with the outsize inflation we've had and the amount of a commodity is it actually, it makes gross margin look worse than it really is because with a lot of this inflation being in these categories that have fixed cost mark ups, or where you are passing it along and they look like there's compression, even though you're making more per case. What I will tell you is if you look at -- so we would expect gross margin to largely return this 2019 levels over time is even though the level of inflation gain, does it continue inflation as is I think you know does benefit us over time. So that's helpful. The customer and product mix headwinds, we talked about continue to improve as case volume returns. So we expect that to return and then logistics or freight the other big piece that, as we look at it, we've made some progress there but what expect also just as they return to a more normalized environment for that to reverse at or close to 2019. So at this point, there's not anything that gets in the way of us getting back to and then growing from the 2019 gross profit per case. I think the thing on gross margin, even just to put it further into context, but I'll say it, if you stripped out the impact of inflation on sales is outsized actually even gross margin would be above for the second quarter above 2019. So it's a harder question to answer right now, giving the inflation we're seeing, but feel very good about gross profits dollar and per case growth over time as to gross margin, I think that the last thing to remember is any impact that it has negative on gross margin has an equal positive impact on OpEx. So it is a really, really a net impact on adjusted EBITDA. And as you saw, we improved that in the quarter as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Silberman from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nLauren Silberman: Thank you. So industry supply challenges in shortages, well-documented you spoke to them, are you seeing customers stockpiling inventory, just given concerns on the supply chain and a related question to that? I think you noted a 100 basis points ticked down in restaurant case volume over the last two weeks of July. Do you think that stockpiling has anything to do with it, or do you see it more related to underlying deceleration a bit?\nDirk Locascio: I don't believe there's stockpiling happening. There's just enough inventory to be stocked pies. I think I can sure recall one way or the other in terms of what I think there's a chance that may be related to delta, but I haven't seen restrictions go up and maybe a small percentage of consumers who are, here's what we do know whenever we've had a wave of COVID and this is I think a fourth one, and two things tend to bounce back even better than they were that way then more quickly.\nLauren Silberman: Great. Thanks. And if I could just do a follow up on the inflationary commentary, you had a pretty big life over reserve adjustment at the impact to adjusted gross profit dollars, or I guess, gross margin in future quarters, if at all.\nDirk Locascio: So you're right. I think the as you saw, I think in my 12 years here, I don't recall a LIFO charge in a quarter being anywhere near where it was, and it really is directly related to the same thing because the sheer amount of inflation that we had in the period just because of the way LIFO works is you're still valuing that inventory at the, sort of end type of cost. It just, it results in a charge. And so what I think you would, I don't think I would correlate that any more to sort of from an adjusted gross margin, gross profit, etcetera, it is they're sort of different inventory methods. So when you think about that, I focus on the inflation is a positive to. In LIFO, what will happen is if we see inflation moderates it's stays pretty neutral. If you start to see some deflation, it's a likely -- you would start to see some form of offsetting a credit to that in the second quarter -- sorry, second after the year.\nOperator: Our next comes from the line of [indiscernible] from UBS. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the questions. How has the competitive environment shaking out as the recovery has ramped up? Have you see any smaller distributors, finally start to go out of business, give them much flexibility on inventory and fluctuations in demand. And have you've seen any meaningful wallet share increases in your independent customers? Thanks.\nPietro Satriano: So the competitive environment has, I would say, been pretty stable in terms of the number of competitors. Again, the recovery happen as quickly as it did over the course of the last year, I that's helped a lot of smaller competitors. When we look at our net promoter score, there's clearly some are more challenged than others with respect to being on time or fulfilling the orders that customers have. In terms of can you remind me of the other part of your question if you don't mind?\nUnidentified Analyst: Just in terms of any meaningful wall chart increases.\nPietro Satriano: Yeah. So we are seeing so our cases per line are up about 7% on prior year, which is quite good. I think that's probably a combination of things. It's a combination of probably smaller share gains as well as the recovery losses theme lines per customer go up a little bit with independence, which is probably a good proxy for wallet share gains, otherwise restaurants continue to expand their menus and that going on. So same overall story, as I would say, as well as results driven by combination patient recovery and our market share games.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. That's really helpful. And just one quick follow-up, there's been some news that unemployment benefits are less likely remain pass September 06. Could you see that happening?\nPietro Satriano: It's hard to question. I think we've really focused on, I think what we've seen in tablets that are decades in the making of consumers really well, embedded and entrenched and the combination of digital ordering the vaccine has allowed these tablets to re-establish themselves. So I think there may be some potential over the long term, so some home to continue to increase share at the expense through that home, just as we've seen over the course of time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Thank you very much. One follow-up clarification and then a question. Just want to clarify Derek I know you mentioned the third quarter date that it was strong to start July, but slipped a 100 basis points last couple of weeks, but I think you mentioned the second half of the year, the volume recovery is going to continue, which I guess would imply the 100 base point pullback as maybe as a blip, just trying to understand what the common themes are maybe that you've seen out of those recent pullback, whether it's by market or what would give you the confidence that it's not something more sustainable, I guess, and then a follow up.\nDirk Locascio: Pietro a general noted, is in a little bit of decline. And I think the way to bridge those two comments is, if there's an impact from delta or such that's one, it's harder to know. So if you kind of put that aside, and I think on that one, in fact, from delta that I come back to as a Pietro said, is we've seen this in multiple waves as even though we could have a shorter term impact, the demand is there, and we would expect the recovery to be right back on track, even if there's a bit of a delay. I think overall, just the demand externally seems to continue to be there. We have seen consistently in the markets, that chart that we included here that as reopening occurs, we're seeing a continued demand increases in improvement, and you still have a number of markets that have only reopened in the last three months or so now closer to full capacity. And we would expect those that the demand in those markets to continue to increase. So I think from our perspective overall, expect you think of independence as an example, expect that to continue to strengthen as that demand gets there more and more markets and overall, again, no matter if there's a short-term impact with delta or not expect that it's really just timing and not whether the demand is there and the return is there that strong demand we expect to be there and the growth to continue.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Understood. Then the final question was I guess, Pietro if I look back a year, and like there was excitement among the distributors on a couple of fronts, one just for the penetrating existing accounts coming out of this crisis. And it seems like you've achieved that with, I think you said your cases per line up seven, but obviously adding new accounts who might shift to a larger distributor just for comfort. So I'm just wondering to the start of the COVID in terms of the ability to continue to add new accounts and maybe add growth by M&A or whether you shy away from the latter in the short term, thank you?\nPietro Satriano: So in terms of new accounts, I think where we've really demonstrated that is with the large accounts that we've talked to in the part of the call about a billion dollars of new business over the course of, since the pandemic started and we expect to continue to add to that level or customer side and that accounts, the temporary staffing challenges we've seen have held us back a little bit in terms of being able to grow market share a little bit more the way we would have liked, or as aggressively as we would've liked. In terms of the third part of your question, and M&A, you're right. That's been one of the things that perhaps didn't pan out exactly as we would have expected in terms of sort of the consolidation of third distress. I think I owe that to what should we back to the speed of the recovery, which has been good for the industry, but there have been some select markets where we've seen some distress competitors and really taken advantage of that in terms of hiring their sales force and they're going after new customers. So we've kind of found a different way to take advantage of perhaps slightly less distress situation than you'd envision in the beginning.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly. Your line is now open from Wells Fargo.\nEdward Kelly: Hey guys, thanks for letting me back in here. A couple of things for you, I guess first, I just want to go back to commodity inflation and the expectation of, I guess, no inflation in the back half of the year. I am just kind of curious, really the question is sort of how's that possible because it does seem like everywhere else, you'd CPG vendors, etcetera. Everyone's talking about inflation. I'm just kind of curious what we're missing here?\nDirk Locascio: So at the way that I would think about it is continued inflation because if that continued in place and that drove the incremental gains. And I think that when you, if you look at it, we don't have additional inflation. You still on a year-over-year basis, you will see inflation show up, but it's incremental that sort of drives the kind of outside -- drove the outside gains in the second quarter. I think that what we've seen so far in the last few months is sorry, last few weeks is you see some of your commodity categories. So the center of the plate as good examples where they had a lot of inflation in the second quarter began to show some deflation in more recent weeks and that you have set up some modest inflation continuing and a few other grocery and other categories. So I think that's the piece that, we'll kind of wait and see, but maybe that's how to bridge the difference between what maybe some of their comments are and how I talked about it in the context of how it's increased our Q2 earnings.\nEdward Kelly: So year-over-year, still some inflation, which should by the way benefit gross profit dollars. But to the extent that we saw that in Q2, that's not likely to continue at that rate.\nDirk Locascio: Correct. And that's why we wanted to conduct third quarter and fourth quarter as opposed to close to that outside gain in the quarter and like I said, with or without that game we're very pleased with the strong improvement we saw in the quarter versus Q1.\nEdward Kelly: Okay, excellent. That makes sense. And then just one last one for you, because you did sort of mention on the call, post COVID profitability and my question here is that I kind of calculate pre COVID pro forma EBITDA at around $1.3 billion, $4 billion or so. Is that your cost saves, the synergies from the two deals, which combined is probably a little bit more than a couple $100 million. So we're kind of at like $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion and if there's underlying in eighborhood of like $17 million, $20 million. But there is, share gain. There is -- is there any reason to think that when sort of like all is said and done, and I'm not trying to nail you down on a date or a year, but when all is sort of said and done, and the business is back to normal, that you wouldn't?\nDirk Locascio: And I think you're thinking about all the right elements to your point, that gets to that $1.3 ish billion in grows from there. I think that sometimes people don't focus on is just that cost inflation that we incur in a given year. So I think when you factor that the other people that talked about just with all of the onboarding of new associates in the current market, just a little slower productivity than we would normally have in a period, but we don't think there's a reason that we don't continue to get back to that in a 1.3 ish number and then grow from there after the higher numbers that you were talking about. You have pieces that you're thinking about how you've been captured in inflation as well.\nEdward Kelly: Okay. And just the last thing for you. So, when we go back to like this 1% increase in driver, again, I think it was probably $17 million, maybe $20 million. To offset that, your EBIT margin pre COVID forget about incrementally the EBITD margin, but just regular EBIT margin. That's only about a 1.5% of case growth over '19 levels. So there are offsets even to underlying wage inflation, if we are optimistic that the business will be higher from the numbers, right.\nDirk Locascio: You're, definitely in the right neighborhood. And I think that the way you're thinking about it, it's sort of, it's good logic. And I think, the thing I'll come back to on that is just when you think about any incremental inflation, I think the key message to take away is and I think it was, Lauren had asked that earlier as well, but it's that -- it's hard to know if all the pieces that we think on labor inflation are transitory.\nEdward Kelly: If you do get to some portion of it that remains permanent as conversations with a lot of customers. And so it's an environment that customers are understanding they want, we're trying to be very good partners with them. They want to be good partners with us. And in some of those cases, it's really, if they were discussing with them about either changes in the way operations that we serve them, or in a number of cases some level of economics improvement in order to mitigate or offset portions of this. So it's not that we don't have any levers. We actually think there are some good opportunities for us to offsets.\nOperator: I will now turn the call back to Mr. Pietro Satriano for the closing remarks.\nPietro Satriano: Thank you, maybe a couple of takeaway since we spent a lot of time talking about the P&L, look a very good quarter, volume was strong and you see a path to full recovery on the volume side. Margins inflation, as Derek said on the really nice spot. Well our challenge is to a variable distribution costs that we believe we have a handle on them. And acquisitions are performing well and we're paying down debt. So I think overall, a very good news story. I'll close by thanking our 26,000 of results we've covered today. Thanks to all for tuning in.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dirk Locascio",
            "content": "Thank you, Pietro and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide nine. Our second quarter financial results improved significantly compared to recent quarters driven by continued volume recovery and strong gross profit results. During the quarter, restrictions on restaurants were lifted and leisure travel increased as Pietro noted. This resulted in group case volume with both our restaurant and hospitality customers and contributed to the significant increase in our adjusted EBITDA. During the second quarter, we also experienced record food and cost inflation across a number of different categories. Our teams did an excellent job of managing that inflation and passing it through to customers. This resulted in very strong, gross profit dollar and per case performance, which also was a significant contributor to our increased second quarter EBITDA. As Pietro mentioned, the operating environment remains difficult, but manageable. We've had success filling many of open warehouse and driver roles, but we like many other companies still have work left to do in order to get the full staffing levels especially, as demand increases further. Inbound product supply from vendors also remains a challenge. We have the processes and the tools in place to manage through these challenges and focuse on minimizing the impact on our customers. However, we do expect these headwinds to persist at least through the end of 2021. Moving to Slide 10, net sales for the quarter were $7.7 billion up 68% from the second quarter of 2020. Food cost inflation for the quarter was 8.2% driven by product shortages and disruptions in the supply chain. We experienced inflation in almost every major product category with the largest increases in poultry, pork and disposables. Adjusted gross profit for the quarter was $1.3 billion up 73% from prior year and our aggressive growth adjusted gross margin improved by 50 basis points. Adjusted gross profit dollars increased faster than net sales despite the high food cost inflation highlighting our very strong gross profit per case performance in the quarter. As a recall, inflation benefits, our gross profit dollars while it is typically a headwind to gross margin rate. As I just mentioned, we had over 8% food cost inflation in the second quarter with much of it in commodity categories. This means our gross margin as a percent of sales is compressed yet our gross profit per case is by far the best we've had since COVID began and in fact, those ahead of 2019 second quarter on our Legacy US food business. This high level of inflation and our ability to effectively manage it increased our second quarter gross profit by approximately $25 million and as inflation moderates, or if we see deflation, we don't expect this gain to continue in Q3 or Q4. We're very pleased with our gross profit performance in second quarter, especially given the freight headwinds, which we expect to continue at least through 2021. Adjusted operating expenses in the second quarter were $940 million up 46% versus the prior year. As a percent of sales, adjusted operating expense was 12.3% down from 14.2% in the prior year. While food cost inflation is headwind to our gross margin rate, it is a benefit to our operating expense as a percent of sales. Just as a point of reference, our OpEx as a percent of sales for our legacy US Foods business is about 60 basis points lower or better than it was in the second quarter of 2019, largely due to the significant food cost inflation I just spoke of. Pietro mentioned earlier that we are seeing additional supply chain labor inflation this year, primarily related to signing and retention policies. The additional inflation this year is about $20 million to $30 million and is above and beyond the approximately $50 million with normal annual supply chain labor inflation we experienced. As the labor market normalizes we anticipate not needing to use these bonuses to the same extent and therefore expect most of these costs to be transitory. We increased the use of these bonuses during the second quarter and as a result, didn't have the full run rate in our second quarter numbers. We have made a lot of good progress hiring warehouse and driver associates, however, are still in the process of filling open positions as our business continues to recover. On slide 11, adjusted EBITDA was $332 million for the quarter, a very strong rebound from the second quarter of 2020. Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of sales was 4.3%. Earlier, as Pietro mentioned, our current best estimate is to return to pro forma 2019 case volume levels later in 2022. We also expect to return to 2019 pro forma adjusted EBITDA expect that to be later than the return of case volume. During 2022, we expect the recovery in restaurant volume plus market share gains will make up for the slower recovery in the hospitality and healthcare volume. While our category gross profit rates are well on their way to recovery, we expect the logistics headwinds to continue into 2022. For distribution costs, the two years of wage inflation, plus the temporary incentives and potentially some higher wage inflation that will require additional productivity and customer margin improvements to offset. For fixed costs, we still expect the $130 million of permanent cost reductions completed in 2020 to flow through to the bottom line. As Pietro said, the integration of Food Group are on track, including expected synergies. Overall, we are very confident about achieving performance 2019 EBITDA levels, but the continued uncertainty with respect to freight labor markets makes the specific timing less certain. We know the actions we have and continue to take will result in us being a stronger company going forward than we were pre-pandemic. Finally, on this page, adjusted net income in the second quarter was $146 million and adjusted diluted. EPS was $0.58 compared to a loss in the prior year. We are now reflecting the additional shares from the preferred equity transaction in our adjusted diluted earnings per share calculation. With these shares reflected, our outstanding adjusted diluted share count is approximately 250 million shares. I am now on Slide 12, operating cash flow for the first six months of the year was $250 million. In the first half of 2020, we had a significant benefit to operating cash flow from working capital. This was a result of reduced inventory levels and extended accounts payables days during the early stages of the pandemic. In the first half of 2021, working capital has been largely neutral for operating cash flow. Our business generates a significant amount of operating cash flow each year as evidenced by the $250 million we generated in the first half of this year, despite our business being in a recovery phase. We will use this cash to reinvest in our business and reduce our total outstanding debt. In the second quarter, we proactively paid down $200 million in total debt in addition to our standard debt repayments. Our leverage ratio dropped by more than two turns due to the paydown and significant adjusted EBITDA improvement. Our target leverage ratio remains between 2.5 and 3 times, and we expect to continue to make progress against this target over the balance of this year, the additional debt reduction and increased EBITDA. We had a very strong second quarter and are focused on the continued recovery of our business. Looking ahead, we expect both Q3 and Q4 EBITDA dollars to be below Q2 as a result of not repeating the approximately $25 million of inflation benefit from Q2, as well as the increased OpEx related to the full run rate of supply chain sign on a retention bonuses put in place during the second quarter and the impact of our continued reinvestment in sales resources as we discussed previously. Our industry is rapidly recovering, and we are participating in that recovery in a meaningful way. Our volume is recovering well. Our gross profit is strong and we are focused on effectively managing the supply chain challenges we and the industry are facing and our acquisition performance is on track resulting in improved results and we're using the cash flow generated to invest in our business and reduce that. Finally, the actions we took during the pandemic have positioned us to continue to gain share with both large and small customers. Operator, at this time, we can now open the call for questions. Good morning. This is Dirk, I'll take that. It's hard to know exactly, but to your point, I would expect just based on some of the early evidence that we've seen in states that have ended unemployment and as we continue to make good progress in hiring that, as you get toward the end of the year, we should be quite a ways there. So it's hard to know exactly there, but at this point, best estimate would be, as we get towards the end of the year into 2022, you begin to see that moderate and begin to return to a more normal environment. What I will tell you though, is in this environment, some of the labor challenges in supply challenges, vendor, it's also been a really good opportunity for us to engage in discussions with a number of our customers about margin and just other operational factors to improve our ability to serve them. So overall, really partnering with our customers as well as trying to manage through this as best we can. Sure Ed. Happy to. So it's -- the reason was we wanted to provide the additional insight that I did is really because in the second quarter we really benefited from the strong inflation and as you see our ability to pass that through with really with gross profit per case being above 2019. And I think the important takeaway on that one is our second quarter results were strong with or without this additional inflation benefits. And so the thing we wanted to call out with the $25 million is that as the piece, that for the quarter alone helped that we given that there's not an expectation for many the industry and outlets for continued inflation as and even some modest deflation. So, I think that $25 million we stay sort of more modest or kind of flattish on inflation is the piece that we would not expect to repeat in Q3 or Q4. I think that if you look at the sales resources, we haven't talked about specific amounts. We've continued to hire kind of second quarter, third quarter fourth quarter. So I think you probably can get close up there with an estimate there on the impacts per quarter, as we continue to ramp up. We're well on our way there from an adding resources, and then in supply chain that $22 million to $30 million is largely what we expect in year this year with a portion of it in the second quarter, and then the rest of it through the balance of this year and most of that being in a form of these retention and sign-on bonuses that I've talked about. From a volume perspective, we do expect volume putting aside any impact that delta may have, but looking at the trajectory that the business was on, we expect volume recovery to continue there. So there's nothing that I was attending or that we are calling out that's what I would say, derailing the strong recovery, as opposed as just some things to keep in mind that are not as recurrent. So hopefully that helps. Sure. So the mix to your point, it can be a category or types of products, people buying as well as customer types. So I'll use the example with restaurants recovering faster than say healthcare hospitality. That's been a net positive when you look at sales. So there's not as direct of a math correlation that you can do from sort of the sales percentage of that mix versus gross profit. However, the thing to take away is with the strong performance, especially as you're looking at the independence and such, there is some benefit in our gross profit. And so that's part of the reason that what even with our strategy in recent years of growing these more attractive customer types. So as independents grow faster than the broader business, they are more accreative and so that helps the overall business. So on that one, I think that the mix, it has been positive. It's going to be more influenced by some of the external factors as healthcare hospitality and such continue to recovery, and depending on the pace of that, but overall gross profit dollars and rate good trajectory and we feel good about the pace of that recovery. Sure. You've packed a lot of that question. So, I'll start with the second one because that's the quicker. So we have seen the rate of inflation slow. We're still seeing some modest inflation in some categories, but then seeing the meaningful deflation in other categories that are netting out closer to zero. So it's last kind four, six weeks. So, that is sort of the assumption is sort of how than more what we've been seeing more, more recently there. As far as your question on productivity, so, yes. I'll just remind, I put out there that the number that we sort of incur in a normal year on inflation in the supply chain, and we typically in a given year, we'll focus on mitigating as much of that as we can through productivity and as you can expect. So we do have some things that are underway in supply chain in particular, however, not near at the pace that we would have in a normal year. And as you can probably appreciate we and others in the industry are directing a lot more energy to running the business and really providing as good of an experience for the customer as we can during this challenging time. So therefore it leaves a little bit less time to focus on productivity. So you do end up with a slowing of sorts there, but we do still have some things going and feel confident in our ability to ramp that up faster under our new Hancock's leadership as we move ahead. Hopefully that helps. The team is always looking at it. It's balancing volume and margin. And so, driving those share gains smartly, and there are categories that from time to time we will choose to invest in that we think are accretive to the overall basket. So as you summarized well, it's about driving more gross profit dollars ultimately to the bottom line. And that's what we're really trying to balance and in this period made progress in gaining market share with small and large customers and very good, gross profit results at the same time. I'll take that, on the sales. So we're, as I mentioned with that what we haven't talked about a specific number, we're good way through that journey as well, and making progress and expected to get to that full investment run rate this year yet later in the year. I think from a supply chain perspective, we would expect to get to that kind of full staffing level yet in 2021, obviously, the market will dictate, but the thing to remember probably all the way back to our fourth quarter pause, I was talking about that or third quarter call last year is just the thing that we want to make sure is we're continuing to press hard on staffing, especially given that the challenging market that's out there and knowing that our businesses recovering and we continue to have the customer wins and share gains. So do expect to get to that level of staffing at some point later in 2021. Hi Kelly. This is Dirk. Yes. So there is some moderate opportunity to do that, but that ends up being relatively short in timeframe because of you remember us talking about a large portion of our contract resets, which can be from weekly to monthly generally speaking. So a little bit of opportunity. The reason that I wanted to call out in the second quarter was just the combination of the inflation plus product shortages, etcetera, really combined with our processes tools enabled us to have really outsized gross profit gains, very pleased with that, and just highlighting that all of that was really strong and the quarter was strong with or without that we wouldn't expect that level of gain to continue going forward. Kelly, do you mind clarifying what you're saying an estimated a 100 for the current quarter or... Thank you for clarifying. So the thing that makes it a little harder to talk about specific just with the outsize inflation we've had and the amount of a commodity is it actually, it makes gross margin look worse than it really is because with a lot of this inflation being in these categories that have fixed cost mark ups, or where you are passing it along and they look like there's compression, even though you're making more per case. What I will tell you is if you look at -- so we would expect gross margin to largely return this 2019 levels over time is even though the level of inflation gain, does it continue inflation as is I think you know does benefit us over time. So that's helpful. The customer and product mix headwinds, we talked about continue to improve as case volume returns. So we expect that to return and then logistics or freight the other big piece that, as we look at it, we've made some progress there but what expect also just as they return to a more normalized environment for that to reverse at or close to 2019. So at this point, there's not anything that gets in the way of us getting back to and then growing from the 2019 gross profit per case. I think the thing on gross margin, even just to put it further into context, but I'll say it, if you stripped out the impact of inflation on sales is outsized actually even gross margin would be above for the second quarter above 2019. So it's a harder question to answer right now, giving the inflation we're seeing, but feel very good about gross profits dollar and per case growth over time as to gross margin, I think that the last thing to remember is any impact that it has negative on gross margin has an equal positive impact on OpEx. So it is a really, really a net impact on adjusted EBITDA. And as you saw, we improved that in the quarter as well. I don't believe there's stockpiling happening. There's just enough inventory to be stocked pies. I think I can sure recall one way or the other in terms of what I think there's a chance that may be related to delta, but I haven't seen restrictions go up and maybe a small percentage of consumers who are, here's what we do know whenever we've had a wave of COVID and this is I think a fourth one, and two things tend to bounce back even better than they were that way then more quickly. So you're right. I think the as you saw, I think in my 12 years here, I don't recall a LIFO charge in a quarter being anywhere near where it was, and it really is directly related to the same thing because the sheer amount of inflation that we had in the period just because of the way LIFO works is you're still valuing that inventory at the, sort of end type of cost. It just, it results in a charge. And so what I think you would, I don't think I would correlate that any more to sort of from an adjusted gross margin, gross profit, etcetera, it is they're sort of different inventory methods. So when you think about that, I focus on the inflation is a positive to. In LIFO, what will happen is if we see inflation moderates it's stays pretty neutral. If you start to see some deflation, it's a likely -- you would start to see some form of offsetting a credit to that in the second quarter -- sorry, second after the year. Pietro a general noted, is in a little bit of decline. And I think the way to bridge those two comments is, if there's an impact from delta or such that's one, it's harder to know. So if you kind of put that aside, and I think on that one, in fact, from delta that I come back to as a Pietro said, is we've seen this in multiple waves as even though we could have a shorter term impact, the demand is there, and we would expect the recovery to be right back on track, even if there's a bit of a delay. I think overall, just the demand externally seems to continue to be there. We have seen consistently in the markets, that chart that we included here that as reopening occurs, we're seeing a continued demand increases in improvement, and you still have a number of markets that have only reopened in the last three months or so now closer to full capacity. And we would expect those that the demand in those markets to continue to increase. So I think from our perspective overall, expect you think of independence as an example, expect that to continue to strengthen as that demand gets there more and more markets and overall, again, no matter if there's a short-term impact with delta or not expect that it's really just timing and not whether the demand is there and the return is there that strong demand we expect to be there and the growth to continue. So at the way that I would think about it is continued inflation because if that continued in place and that drove the incremental gains. And I think that when you, if you look at it, we don't have additional inflation. You still on a year-over-year basis, you will see inflation show up, but it's incremental that sort of drives the kind of outside -- drove the outside gains in the second quarter. I think that what we've seen so far in the last few months is sorry, last few weeks is you see some of your commodity categories. So the center of the plate as good examples where they had a lot of inflation in the second quarter began to show some deflation in more recent weeks and that you have set up some modest inflation continuing and a few other grocery and other categories. So I think that's the piece that, we'll kind of wait and see, but maybe that's how to bridge the difference between what maybe some of their comments are and how I talked about it in the context of how it's increased our Q2 earnings. Correct. And that's why we wanted to conduct third quarter and fourth quarter as opposed to close to that outside gain in the quarter and like I said, with or without that game we're very pleased with the strong improvement we saw in the quarter versus Q1. And I think you're thinking about all the right elements to your point, that gets to that $1.3 ish billion in grows from there. I think that sometimes people don't focus on is just that cost inflation that we incur in a given year. So I think when you factor that the other people that talked about just with all of the onboarding of new associates in the current market, just a little slower productivity than we would normally have in a period, but we don't think there's a reason that we don't continue to get back to that in a 1.3 ish number and then grow from there after the higher numbers that you were talking about. You have pieces that you're thinking about how you've been captured in inflation as well. You're, definitely in the right neighborhood. And I think that the way you're thinking about it, it's sort of, it's good logic. And I think, the thing I'll come back to on that is just when you think about any incremental inflation, I think the key message to take away is and I think it was, Lauren had asked that earlier as well, but it's that -- it's hard to know if all the pieces that we think on labor inflation are transitory."

            "name": "Pietro Satriano",
            "content": "Thank you, Melissa. Good morning, everyone and welcome. So during today's call, we are going to cover three main themes just like last time. First, the industry recovery that we spoke of on our last call continues to progress. Restaurants are welcoming customers back into their establishment as restrictions have been lifted across the country and US Foods continues to participate in this recovery in a meaningful fashion. Second, a great food made easy differentiated platform is helping to drive market share gains with both small and large customers. And third, our financial results are continuing to recover to pre-pandemic levels. Our improved results are being driven by a recovery in case volumes, improved margins and the performance of our recent acquisitions. So let's begin on slide three, restaurants are recovering at a rapid pace as evidenced by the foot traffic at food-away-from-home establishment shown in the chart on the left. The traffic for the industry has continued to increase over the last several months and is very close to returning to pre-pandemic levels. A nearly full recovery in foot traffic as occurred despite the fact that some markets across the US are still ramping up, which is shown by the chart on the right. This shows our own restaurant volumes for markets that have opened less than three months ago versus markets that have been opened six months or longer. Restaurants in markets have been opened the longest are showing growth rates in the high single digit range compared to 2019, while restaurants that are in markets have recently reopened are still down compared to 2019. We believe our view to be representative of what is happening in the country, which indicates that even with volume above 2019 levels, there's still some headroom for growth for restaurants. Moving to slide four, the benefit of markets reopening can be seen in the improvement and total case volume that we are experienced -- that we experienced during the second quarter. In the chart, you can see that restaurant continue to trend ahead of 2019 levels with both independence and chains ahead of 2019, by roughly comparable margin. We expect this to continue, support in part by the growth from the recently reopened markets that I just spoke about. Most of July was also in line with May and June, but we did see in the last two weeks, a tick down of about a 100 basis points, but it's too early to say whether that small change is due to the impact of the Delta variant. Moving to other customer types, the reopening and the related increase in travel is also benefiting our hospitality business, which is now running about at more than 70% of 2019 case volumes and a large improvement from the first quarter. Leisure travel has returned in a very meaningful way this summer and is driving a large part of the improvement. We expect this improvement in that customer type to continue as other customer types within hospitality catch up to leisure travel. First, even within leisure travel, some large parts are still operating below maximum capacity. Second, large conventions, which have in part returned, typically require considerable lead time of up to a year. And third as we've discussed before, there is a little bit of uncertainty about the future level of business travel. When we consider the impact of these trends, we expect hospitality to recover later in 2022. And when combined with our market share gains, we do expect our hospitality volume to return to pre-pandemic levels. Our healthcare business has remained steady throughout the pandemic. Different factors are impacting different customer types within healthcare. With senior living, for example, occupancy rates are still down in the mid to low single digits, but with aging demographics, we do expect demand from senior living facilities to recover over time. With acute care, some employees are still working from home and it is yet unclear where this was settled over time. So to hospitality, when we consider the above trends combined with our market share gains, we do expect healthcare to return to pre-pandemic levels as well, sometime later in 2022. So in summary, based on what we know today about trends within each customer type combined with our recent market share gains and our strong pipeline of new customers, our best estimate is that we will return to pro forma 2019 total case volume later in 2022. I am now on slide five. A Great Food Made Easy strategy is the primary reason that we win new customers. The Great Food piece of our differentiation strategy is anchored by Scoop, our product innovation platform. Given the labor challenges restaurant operators are facing the latest edition of Scoop features a number of labor saving products that are very much on trend, as well as the number of fresh Robin [ph]. We've also begun rolling out the food groups tender by design beef products to the Legacy US foods markets. Tender by design is a specialized process that produces high quality cut states with customers. The rollout has been met with rave reviews by customers. Our leading technology solutions and expert support are the backbone of the Made Easy part of our differentiation strategy. In past calls we've talked about our ghost kitchen playbook, which have played a big part in helping operators generate additional revenue. The following is a quote from an owner of an Italian restaurant outside Chicago, \"they use the ghost kitchen context to diversify to chicken wings. We survived the first 100 days of the shutdown, and I don't think we would have survived this one if we didn't have our ghost kitchen of bakedwings.com, it has literally been a lifesaver for us\". Most recently rocks [ph], a restaurant operations consultant have been focused on a series of webinars to help customers navigate the challenging labor environment, including topics such as payroll management and doing more with less staff. Thanks to the benefits of virtual technology we are able to leverage our best rocks and food fanatic chefs across a number of geographies and customers can easily schedule one-on-one conference and simply scan a QR code. Finally, on the topic of technology, I would like to welcome John Tonnison to the US Foods team. John was recently announced as our new Chief Information and Digital Officer. He brings extensive experience leading IT organizations in the distribution space, most notably, the last 10 years as CIO of one of the largest tech distribution companies globally. John's mandate is to continue to enhance our leading e-commerce platform while working with Phil Hancock, our Chief Supply Chain Officer to make our supply chain the most effective and efficient in our industry. Moving to Slide six, last quarter, we spoke about the challenging operating environment for customers distributors and manufacturers alike and while labor and product supply challenges continue to persist, our actions have helped mitigate these challenges. On the labor side, we have made good progress in hiring warehouse and transportation associates. We filled over a third and we reopen positions that we discussed last quarter, and we expect to continue to close this gap of hiring and retention incentives have contributed to improving the pipeline and to reducing churn. In addition, we do expect the labor market to continue to improve. In those states that have ended supplemental unemployment benefits, we have seen a dramatic increase in applicant rates. Lastly, in some select markets, we have made some hourly wage rate increases, especially for entry-level wages. Taken together, these incentives and wage adjustments are having a modest impact on the P&L, which Dirk will discuss shortly. On the product supply side, service levels from vendors are still well below 2019 as a result of manufacturers experiencing the same labor and freight challenges that we are. We are utilizing our scale, our relationships and alternative sourcing arrangements to help secure the product we need to effectively serve our customers. Our net promoter survey confirmed that we are fairing as well as, or better than our competitors on this front. Possibly moving to slide seven, both the Smart Food service and Food Group acquisition are performing at or above expectation. Beginning with cash and carry, same-store sales that are nearly chef [ph] stores open at least one year are ahead of 2019 levels. We call that part of the rationale for the Smart Food service acquisition is that the cash and carry market will roughly twice we deliver market with higher margins. As the reopening continues, we're seeing these pre-pandemic trends take shape again. We are bullish on the outlook for chef store and expect that 2021 EBITDA levels will exceed those of 2019. The other rationale for the Food Group acquisition was the long runway of growth that we see for chef store. We expect to have three new stores open in 2021, all in existing market. 2022 is when we should begin to expand our footprint ultimately doubling our store count, making chef store a meaningful part of our growth story. Turning to Food Group, with dining restrictions recently lifted in Food Group in the Pacific Northwest we are starting to see volume return to those markets. Combined with the introduction of our differentiated scoop, e-commerce and team-based selling we expect these markets to be poised for growth in the future. As you'll recall, we have completed four warehouse systems conversion and now expect to have the remaining systems conversions completed by early 2022. Synergy capture remains on track and we expect to fully achieve the previously announced $55 million of synergies in 2023. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we are extending Food Groups, tendered-by-design process to legacy food locations. In addition, we're also extending Food Group's fresh produce capabilities to the rest of our customer base. Both of these initiatives will bring synergies to the legacy of the Foods network by providing customers with one of the highest quality product offering in the industry in two very important categories center-of-the-plate employees. I'll now turn the call over to Dirk to discuss our second quarter results and full year financial outlook. Dirk? Yeah, this is Pietro. So we, as I mentioned in my comments, we've covered over a third of that gap and that gap to just to clarify as well to what we anticipate as we move in the future not necessarily the gap today. So we're making really good progress. What I would say is we've really wrapped up the hiring machine for selectors and drivers. We're hiring exactly the right number that we are looking for. The challenge right now is just reducing the churn rate, as I'm sure you've seen in the process, rates are at an all time high and so part of the measures we're putting in place are really aimed at reducing the churn. So we can continue to close the gap and talk about. Yeah. I'll start and I'll start with the second part of your question. So, as you mentioned, and as Derek mentioned, we have been passing on some of the inflation that we have seen certainly on the product side, but also where possible on the labor side. In terms of your question as to why it's transitory, I think there's a school of thought that is shared by many that the labor supply and imbalance is in itself transitory like with the speed of the recovery, probably faster than many expected. We've seen the demand for labor go up fast and the supply. The partial evidence for that is what I noted in those markets where supplemental unemployment benefits have ended. The hiring pipeline is several times better than it is in those markets where supplemental benefits are still in effect. And so those are some of the reasons why we believe these are transitory in nature. And just to add Derek, the 130 you were referring to in terms of fixed costs, no change to that, as Dirk said the productivity initiatives that Dirk was just referring to an answer on the variable side of things, whereas he said that the focus on customers and the onboarding of a large number of new associates has slowed down the productivity that we typically see on the variable side. Maybe I'll start because we're really talking about market share and volume. So we've continued to make market share gains John. But I think we and others, and you've probably read about this, those markets are gains have probably been held back a little bit by the challenging labor staffing and document, just the desire to make sure that we serve customers in the way that is what they expect has probably held us back a little in terms of making even more aggressive market share gain in the last couple months and when I say, I mean, probably everyone. So, so it depends how you measure it John. I think what the capacity that's been talked a lot about is, again, as I mentioned in the question capacity as you're drawn to staffing. So if you're short drivers, there's only so many trucks that has hampered our ability to grow more than we have. But we still see us making, we still see we've made market share gains. And so as that kind of stabilized, and as we continue to close the gap, we believe we have the opportunity to continue to gain market share. We've had in a very small number of instances -- done some optimization in terms of resetting terms with customers. In that handful of cases, probably there's been a little bit of press on that. You can see that impacting us and the results have been diminimous when you look at volume growth versus 2019. So the competitive environment has, I would say, been pretty stable in terms of the number of competitors. Again, the recovery happen as quickly as it did over the course of the last year, I that's helped a lot of smaller competitors. When we look at our net promoter score, there's clearly some are more challenged than others with respect to being on time or fulfilling the orders that customers have. In terms of can you remind me of the other part of your question if you don't mind? Yeah. So we are seeing so our cases per line are up about 7% on prior year, which is quite good. I think that's probably a combination of things. It's a combination of probably smaller share gains as well as the recovery losses theme lines per customer go up a little bit with independence, which is probably a good proxy for wallet share gains, otherwise restaurants continue to expand their menus and that going on. So same overall story, as I would say, as well as results driven by combination patient recovery and our market share games. It's hard to question. I think we've really focused on, I think what we've seen in tablets that are decades in the making of consumers really well, embedded and entrenched and the combination of digital ordering the vaccine has allowed these tablets to re-establish themselves. So I think there may be some potential over the long term, so some home to continue to increase share at the expense through that home, just as we've seen over the course of time. So in terms of new accounts, I think where we've really demonstrated that is with the large accounts that we've talked to in the part of the call about a billion dollars of new business over the course of, since the pandemic started and we expect to continue to add to that level or customer side and that accounts, the temporary staffing challenges we've seen have held us back a little bit in terms of being able to grow market share a little bit more the way we would have liked, or as aggressively as we would've liked. In terms of the third part of your question, and M&A, you're right. That's been one of the things that perhaps didn't pan out exactly as we would have expected in terms of sort of the consolidation of third distress. I think I owe that to what should we back to the speed of the recovery, which has been good for the industry, but there have been some select markets where we've seen some distress competitors and really taken advantage of that in terms of hiring their sales force and they're going after new customers. So we've kind of found a different way to take advantage of perhaps slightly less distress situation than you'd envision in the beginning. Thank you, maybe a couple of takeaway since we spent a lot of time talking about the P&L, look a very good quarter, volume was strong and you see a path to full recovery on the volume side. Margins inflation, as Derek said on the really nice spot. Well our challenge is to a variable distribution costs that we believe we have a handle on them. And acquisitions are performing well and we're paying down debt. So I think overall, a very good news story. I'll close by thanking our 26,000 of results we've covered today. Thanks to all for tuning in."

After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Ms. Melissa Napier. Ma\u2019am, the floor is yours.\nMelissa Napier: Thank you, Laurence. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Today, we have Pietro Satriano, our CEO; and Dirk Locascio, our CFO on the call. Pietro and Dirk will provide an overview of our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. We\u2019ll take your questions after our prepared remarks conclude. Please provide your name, your firm and limit yourself to one question. During today\u2019s call and unless otherwise stated, we\u2019re comparing our first quarter results to the same period in fiscal year 2020. References to organic financial results during today\u2019s call exclude contributions from Smart Foodservice, which we acquired in April of 2020. Our earnings release issued earlier this morning and today\u2019s presentation slides can be accessed on the Investor Relations page of our website. In addition to historical information, certain statements made during today\u2019s call are considered forward-looking statements.

All reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the schedules on our earnings press release as well as in the appendices to the presentation slides posted on our website. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Pietro to get us started.\nPietro Satriano: Thanks, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. Today, we\u2019re going to focus on the recovery, the recovery which has been extremely good news for our industry, the recovery that has also called in our associates to work harder than they had before. So, I do want to take this opportunity to recognize our 26,000 associates, whose tireless commitment to serving our customers over the last several months has truly been second to none. In this call, we\u2019re going to cover three themes which are outlined on page two. First, our industry continues to recover and we are participating in that recovery in a meaningful way. During the last few months, we have seen a steady increase in volume and restaurant traffic, as in-person dying restrictions continue to be lifted. The recovery that we have seen over the last few months and our rebound in sales from markets that are mostly open, gives us the confidence that the industry will fully recover to, if not exceed 2019 case volume levels. Second, our scale and differentiated strategy is driving market share gains across most customer types as our technology, innovative products and team of industry specialists have provided customers with the necessary resources and tools to thrive in the current environment. And third, as case volumes have begun to recover, we have seen our financial results strengthen. We expect our financial results to continue to improve as the recovery continues. But, the same recovery that is driving volume gains is also driving tightness in labor for customers, distributors and manufacturers alike. We believe, however, that this tightness to be transitory and to ease in the latter part of the year. Moving to slide 3, the foodservice industry is experiencing a recovery as in-person dining restrictions ease around the country, plus COVID-19 vaccine distribution becomes more widespread. The chart on the left shows that traffic at restaurants recently exceeded traffic at grocery and convenience stores, and is very close to returning to pre-pandemic levels. The recovery has been driven not only by easing restrictions, but as importantly, by consumer sentiment. As shown by the chart on the right, consumers are becoming increasingly more comfortable eating out. A trend we expect to continue as vaccination rates increase and COVID cases continue to decline. And last, even if dining out continues to recover, we expect some of the increases in off-premise buying to become permanent, which augurs well for food-away-from-home to continue to gain share from food at many. On slide 4, you can see how the recovery trends that I just spoke about have impacted our case volumes for each of our main customer types compared to fiscal year 2019. Since the beginning of 2021, we have seen a steady increase in monthly case volume with our restaurant and hospitality customers. This is highlighted by restaurant case volume exceeding the quarter with volume levels that were above 2019. While the recovery -- while the industry recovers, certainly part of the story behind our recovering volumes, we are also gaining market share. First, let\u2019s talk about restaurants. Chain volume for March in April was ahead of 2019. And for independents, volume for March was flat to 2019 and above 2019 for April, and a positive trend has continued. The Mother\u2019s Day week that we just concluded on Saturday had the highest shipments to independent restaurants for legacy business of any Mother\u2019s Day week in five years with a 6% jump over 2019 Mother\u2019s Day week. Here, we know that consumable upsides still exist. In markets where local jurisdictions allow more than 50% seating, volume is well ahead 2019. This includes much of the south and southeast and a few other geographies. In markets where even less than 50% or less than 25% seating is allowed, like the northwest, volume is well below 2019. So, as restrictions get lifted everywhere as vaccination rates continue to increase and as consumer sentiment continues to improve, we expect that all markets to move into positive territory. Hospitality: The hotel portion of our hospitality business is recovering as leisure travel returns and occupancy rates recover, with occupancy rates now being only 500 basis points below a year ago. We expect this trend to continue. Consumer surveys highlight that travel, next to dining at restaurants, is one of the top things that consumers are looking forward to doing. Our portfolio of hotel customers leans more towards the leisure side of the industry, positioning us to take advantage of the increase in leisure travel that is expected as the economy reopens. Our health care case volumes continue to remain steady in the negative 10% range, which is where it has trended for the better part of the last year. Restrictions on visitors at hospitals are just starting to be lifted, and hospital cafeterias are just beginning to reopen. We also expect that occupancy rates of senior living facilities, which have declined over the past year, will start to normalize as vaccination rates increase. Both of these factors, plus recent wins in the health care area, will indicate that health care case volume will ultimately return to pre-COVID levels, if not higher. For nationally managed customers, which remember includes national chain, health care and hospitality, you will remember that in 2020, we added $800 million of new customer wins, which is driving some of the increases we are seeing. In the first quarter of 2021, we added $200 million of new customer wins, and our pipeline for the balance of the year is very healthy. Lastly, and for national chains specifically, the contribution margin at which we are signing new customers is well above the average for that portfolio and above the margins associated with recent wins. Turning to page 5. As I\u2019ve discussed, an important factor behind growing case volumes has been the recovery of our industry. But an equally, if not more important factor, has been our market share gains across most customer types. The driver of our market share gains continues to be a Great Food Made Easy strategy, which aims to help customers succeed by taking advantage of our leading technology, our innovative products and our team of experts that support our sellers. Let me give a few examples of how our core programs and our strategy have evolved to meet changing customer needs and contribute to recent market share gains. First, on the technology front. Recent research and comments from new customers indicate that our technology still performs -- our technology platform still leads the industry. For example, for larger customer wins, like the $1 billion of wins in the last five quarters, we track the main reason why customer switches to US Foods. In many cases, the determining factor is a combination of our technology and our service model. We see that especially with health care and large chains where technology makes it easier to manage menus and control costs across multiple locations. Similarly, for independent restaurants, we continue to enhance the functionality to make our technology even easier to use. Some recent enhancements include mobile pay functionality and the ability for customers to see our inventory in real-time. This visibility provides real value to customers especially at a time when the industry is experiencing some volatility on the part of manufacturers. Second, on the product innovation side. I mentioned on our last call how COVID has resulted in a shift in the products that customers rely on the most. The three big trends that we observe are off-premise dining, the need to mitigate labor challenges and products that promote well-being, which includes plant-based products. Our Spring Scoop, which launched in February, featured products exclusive to US Foods but addressed all three of these operator needs. As a result, we saw a trial of these innovative products in line with historical norms, which we know contributes to increased retention and market share gains. Our upcoming Summer Scoop will similarly feature products that take labor out of the kitchen, especially ingredients or components that require intense preparation. These labor-saving products enable restaurants to maintain interesting options on their menu and continue to add innovation to their menus. We\u2019re also expanding our range of products that support the continued growth in off-premise dining, such as tamper evident packaging and grab-and-go products. Note that our 2020 corporate social responsibility report was published two weeks ago. This is a comprehensive review of our progress in our three pillars of people, product and planet, of which our line of 900 Serve Good sustainable products is an important component. The report is available on our website, which I encourage you to visit to learn more about our... The third and final part of our Great Food Made Easy strategy is our dedicated team of industry experts that are available to help customers run their business more effectively. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have had a dedicated team of restaurant operation consultants helping customers access CARES and Restaurant Revitalization Act funding. Starting with our first webinar in April 2020, the team has held weekly webinars and conducted over 7,500 one-on-one consultations to help customers understand and navigate available funding options. We estimate that our team has assisted customers in accessing over $1.5 billion in funding since COVID began. And as early as mid-February, this team was conducting webinars on helping customers be prepared to access the Restaurant Revitalization Fund even before the legislation was signed into law. These efforts are truly making a difference to customers. As illustrated by this email we received from a restaurant owner in St. Louis, which I\u2019d like to read to you now. \"The information you supply is a game-changer. My payroll company said they found $300,000 between both my businesses. I\u2019m not sure how to thank you. You are literally changing people\u2019s lives.\" This is what we mean by \u201cwe help you make it\u201d. Now moving to slide 6. Another key part of our strategy has been the acquisitions of Food Group and Smart Foodservice. The Food Group acquisition allowed us to dramatically improve our distribution footprint in the Northwest, giving us a presence in this growing part of the country and making us more attractive to regional and national customers. The acquisition of Smart Foodservice enabled us to scale our entry into the cash-and-carry channel, a more profitable and faster-growing channel in the foodservice industry. Not only does this channel provide a more attractive growth and margin profile and enables growth and share of wallet with our existing delivered customers while extending our reach to target customers we weren\u2019t previously serving. Let\u2019s spend a few minutes talking about the progress we have made on the integration of Food Group and the future growth opportunities cash and carry presents. Starting with Food Group. The warehouse systems conversions are progressing well. Since we last spoke, we have completed two additional conversions, Portola 4, [ph] and we are on pace to have all of the Food Group warehouses converted to US Foods operating system in the second half of this year, in line with our original plan. If you recall, completing the warehouse system conversion is a key enabler to unlocking the $65 million of annual run rate synergies. In 2020, we made good progress on synergy capture, especially on the product side. And we remain on track to capture the full $65 million synergies by 2023 with 80% captured by the end of 2022. We\u2019ve also begun to expand Food Group capabilities around meat and produce to the rest of the US Foods network. And we are excited about the enhanced product offering this will bring to customers around the country. The Smart Foodservice business continues to outperform our delivered business as it has throughout the pandemic. Same-store sales for April are ahead of 2019 as restaurant demand continues to recover, and we continue to benefit from some direct-to-consumer sales, sales that we are getting without modifying our business model. On our last call, I mentioned that we would be rebranding all Smart Foodservice locations to the US Foods CHEF\u2019STORE brand. I\u2019m pleased to report that the rebranding effort is now complete and customers have responded well. With the rebranding complete, we have begun to fully leverage the power combining these two channels by offering both, sellers and customers, incentives to shop the two channels. As a result, we are seeing delivered customers increase their purchases from CHEF\u2019STORE with minimal impact on the delivered business. This multichannel offering is an advantage that no other competitor has access to. Lastly, the conversion to the CHEF\u2019STORE brand will help facilitate our expansion into new geographic markets in which US Foods has an established presence. Having covered the first two themes of our presentation, first, the continued and expected recovery of our industry; and second, how our scale and differentiation strategy is contributing to driving market share gains, I want to spend just a couple of minutes talking about the current operating environment that I referred to in my opening comments, after which, I will turn the call over to Dirk. As I\u2019m sure you are all too familiar, all elements of the value chain are facing labor shortages. We here have restaurants having to close one day a week to give their staff a break. In some markets, hiring drivers and selectors is taking longer than expected. And lastly, some manufacturers are having trouble meeting the growth in demand. We believe that there are a number of factors contributing to this environment, including workers who have temporary left labor force, extended unemployment and the remarkable but as yet incomplete progress on the vaccine front. We believe that all these factors will sort themselves out over the next two to three quarters. In the meantime, we are working hard to mitigate these factors, so as to meet increasing demand on the part of our customers. First, we have added significant inventory, a 25% increase in days on hand and on order, as well as working very closely with manufacturers. And second, we are making use of onetime sign-on referral and retention bonuses to avoid embedding these wage pressures into our cost structure. Lastly, we are pleased with how the recent changes to our operating model have helped mitigate some of the supplier and labor pressures the industry is experiencing. You will remember that, by reducing the number of regions to 4, we freed up some resources, which then shifted to centers of excellence, whose aim is to quickly develop and deploy best practices across the country and which has helped us in this environment. I will now turn the call over to Dirk for a discussion of our first quarter financial results and how we have positioned the business for earnings growth.\nDirk Locascio: Thank you, Pietro, and good morning. I\u2019ll begin on slide 9, where I\u2019ll cover a few highlights for the quarter. As Pietro referenced earlier, case volume improved as the first quarter progressed, especially with our restaurant and hospitality customers. This resulted in a corresponding improvement in adjusted EBITDA as we moved through the quarter. These volume trends have continued in the early part of the second quarter as the recovery continues to take shape. When comparing last month\u2019s restaurant volume and trends compared to April of 2019, independent cases trended modestly ahead while chain cases were well into positive territory. Gross profit per case for the first quarter of 2021 was below Q1 of 2020. However, the recent improvement in case volume has driven an improvement in gross profit per case as our customer and product mix has started to return to pre-COVID levels. Our gross profit per case improved over the course of the first quarter as volume and mix improved. We saw higher product cost inflation in Q1 2021 than we did in prior quarters, which is negatively impacting our gross margin as a percent of sales. Much of the 2.7% product cost inflation we saw in the first quarter was in center-of-the-plate categories that may persist in coming quarters. If you recall, center-of-the-plate items such as beef and poultry, and some customer contracts are typically priced with a fixed fee per case markup. So, when we have higher inflation, gross margin as a percent of sales can compress for these product categories and customers, even if we are making the same amount of gross profit dollars in each case we sell. Comparing to Q1 of 2019 for a moment, our gross profit per case was negatively impacted by higher freight costs as well as the continued, albeit improved, negative mix impact already noted. As our case volume of corresponding mix continued to improve, we expect the gross profit per case will also continue to improve. And when we compare our gross profit per case to 2019, the gap for the first quarter was the smallest it has been since COVID began. Looking ahead, we expect to see continued headwinds in gross profit per case from the tight freight market and expect mix to improve as case volume improves. Although we expect the higher freight cost to be transitory, we do think they will remain a challenge for the next two to three quarters. On OpEx, over the last few quarters, I\u2019ve spoken about the $180 million of fixed cost savings that we enacted in 2020. These cost savings are contributing to our results, and we are beginning to see the fixed cost leverage return as case volume recovers. We\u2019ve begun thoughtfully reinvesting some of the 2020 savings back into the business to further enable sales growth and earnings improvement. We\u2019re reinvesting approximately $50 million, primarily to support growth in both, our local and national selling organizations as well as within some key areas such as supply chain to further improve our results and customer experience. This equates to roughly two-thirds of the $180 million ultimately flowing through as permanent cost savings. Slide 10 shows our net sales, adjusted gross profit and our adjusted operating expense results for Q1 of 2021 and 2020. Net sales dollars for the quarter were down slightly compared to the first quarter of 2020. And you\u2019ll recall that only the last three weeks of the first quarter of 2020 were heavily impacted by the rapid onset of COVID-19 and the business closures across the country. Our adjusted gross profit dollars for the first quarter declined 2.7%. And our adjusted gross margin was down 30 basis points compared to prior year. Freight costs, customer product mix and higher product cost inflations were headwinds to adjusted gross margin in the quarter compared to Q1 of 2020. We do expect case volume improvements with independent restaurants, health care and hospitality to have a positive impact on our adjusted gross margin going forward. Adjusted operating expenses in the first quarter decreased 2.6% in dollars and improved 30 basis points as a percent of sales. The improvement in adjusted operating expense as a percent of sales is largely due to the cost savings initiatives we\u2019ve put in place over the past year and the sales inflation impact. On a dollar basis, the reduction in cost is primarily due to lower volume and the cost savings initiatives, partially offset by approximately $25 million higher bonus expense in Q1 2021 than Q1 2020. The first quarter of 2020 had a negligible amount of bonus expense. The lower fixed cost base that we operate from today will continue to benefit us as case volume returns, with a larger percentage of gross profit dollars flowing through to the bottom line. We do expect that supply chain cost inflation will be transitory OpEx, but will be a headwind through 2021. We expect the cost increases to be transitory until the workforce increases and the hiring demand from the recovery subsides, likely later in the year. On slide 11, adjusted EBITDA was $172 million, adjusted net income was $27 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.12 for the first quarter. As I mentioned earlier, adjusted EBITDA improved as we moved through the quarter and the second quarter has started out very similar to how the first quarter finished. We remained in a GAAP net loss position for the first quarter and as a result are not reflecting the additional shares from the preferred equity transaction in our adjusted diluted EPS number for the quarter. We do expect to return to positive GAAP net income in the near future and will reflect the additional shares at that time. And as Melissa noted at the beginning, reconciliations of our adjusted numbers are included in the press release and the appendix of the presentation. Just to wrap up, moving to slide 12. Share gains, cost savings initiatives and the operating model changes have and will continue to improve our effectiveness and our results. These, combined with the leverage from volume returning, have positioned us to take advantage of the recovery and drive earnings growth well into the future. Share gains with both large and small customers since the recovery began last summer have strengthened the top line, and we continue to pursue profitable new business and believe that our differentiated strategy and scale give us an advantage over many of the distributors in our industry. As I mentioned earlier, we do expect some transitory headwinds related to freight and supply chain labor over the next two to three quarters. Our business has historically produced strong operating and free cash flow. As the recovery continues, we expect to return to generating a healthy level of free cash flow. And this cash will be used to reinvest in the business and reduce our outstanding debt balance. In April, we used cash on hand to pay down $150 million of outstanding debt, and we\u2019ll continue to make debt paydowns as the recovery unfolds further through 2021. We still expect to operate the business at a 2.5 to 3 times leverage ratio through a combination of improved EBITDA and debt paydown. Pietro said at the beginning, the recovery is underway. And our second quarter case volume is off to a good start. At this time, it\u2019s hard to forecast the precise timing of the recovery as it may not necessarily progress in a linear manner, but we do see restaurant demand improving as more markets remove restrictions and as warmer weather allows for more outdoor dining in additional parts of the country. As a result, we expect continued improvement in Q2 adjusted EBITDA compared to Q1. Over the last 30 years, customers have shown a consistent preference for eating away from home, and we expect this trend to continue. We\u2019re confident about the future of U.S. Foods and the industry. Operator, at this time, we can now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kelly Bania from BMO Capital.\nKelly Bania: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. Wondering, first, just on the comments on freight, if you can help just -- help us understand the magnitude of the headwinds, how much you\u2019re using third-party freight on the spot market versus contract and just how we should think about modeling that over the next couple of quarters.\nDirk Locascio: Sure, Kelly. Good morning. This is Dirk. I\u2019ll take that. And so, although we haven\u2019t talked about the specific breakouts, we do manage -- a large portion of our freight is kind of relatively split between, where a vendor delivers it using their carrier and where we arrange for delivery either with one of our trucks or contracting directly with third parties. We do use spot rates. In a normal environment, it\u2019s relatively small. When we use third parties, we do try to contract with them. And then, it can be using a little more as you have more volatile environments like we\u2019re in now. What I would say is this. So, our teams are not standing still. They\u2019re working closely with vendors on opportunities where we can continue to work with them to try to increase their freight allowances to look at our -- within our own four walls, on optimizing our freight network. And it is -- it remains a challenge. It\u2019s not -- a little different, but kind of the same idea as 2018. But what we have seen in cycles over the years is that, when you have this tightness that additional capacity does tend to come into the market over time. And so we\u2019re working in the short term to try to mitigate it. At the same time, if we see capacity coming back later in the year, we think that will help as well. So, remains a challenge, but not something that we expect to be sort of a permanent impact within the industry or our business for the longer term.\nKelly Bania: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And just a follow-up, maybe just a little bit more color on the decision to reinvest some of the cost savings. I think it was $50 million back into the business. Just a little more color on that thought process and what you expect to get out of that reinvestment.\nDirk Locascio: Sure. So, from the very beginning, we\u2019ve said that we expect to reinvest a meaningful portion of that, and we\u2019ve talked about how we expect the majority of the savings to remain permanent. And so today, it\u2019s providing a little more specificity. And so, the reason that we\u2019ve progressed in recent months and moving ahead on those things is really a few things. One is we see more opportunity in recent months for market share gains than we did pre COVID. And we really want to take advantage of that, especially in some markets, so have begun that reinvestments on the local side and then on the national side, as well as we see the demand in the pipeline. We\u2019ve also onboarded a fair amount of business in order to support that effectively. And then, to a lesser extent, it does remain an opportunity really to continue to upgrade some talent in some cases. The new hires are typically not the same individuals, but really is to continue to support growth and accelerate share gains as we move ahead.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass: Dirk, maybe just go maybe broader and talk about the costs you\u2019ve incurred that you would view as unusual this quarter. So, you mentioned freight. Undoubtedly, there\u2019s some hiring costs. You talked about some onetime bonuses. What are the unusual, or what do you view as kind of onetime? And as you exited the quarter, are those costs still accelerating on that as to say should we expect greater cost pressures in the next couple of quarters, or is the first quarter kind of representative of where you\u2019re running now and you would expect to until this sort of unwinds later in the year.\nDirk Locascio: Sure. Good questions. I think that a couple of things I would highlight. So freight, as you pointed out, that\u2019s really been embedded for the last quarter or so, and I think will continue in similar magnitude for at least the next few quarters. On the gross margin, sort of mix continues to be a bit of a headwind, although as I mentioned, continues to improve as volume comes back on that. I think, from an OpEx perspective, so the main unusual things, there\u2019s not anything necessarily large that I would call out as unusual. There\u2019s always some incremental costs from small amounts from some of the storms in February and such. But, the things around labor that you\u2019re getting at, when we and others talked about hiring in advance, because the recovery happened so fast, that was less of an impact in the quarter. And so, therefore, some of the retention and hiring, we\u2019re seeing a little bit of it in the quarter. We\u2019ll see some continued ramp-up over the next couple of quarters as we continue to hire additional individuals to support the recovery. So, a little bit higher cost, but again, expect most of those to be transitory through the balance of 2021.\nJohn Glass: And if I could just follow up, you talked about some favorable contract rates in categories versus prior. Is there pricing power in this industry? I understand independents, you might -- since things are running hot in the economy and restaurants raising prices, are you able to pass on maybe price increases greater than inflation? And when you now contract, are you getting a bit more wiggle room on pricing or is that just not the case?\nDirk Locascio: Sure. So, I\u2019ll maybe break it into local and our larger national contract customers. And so, on the local side, so with the inflation, to your point, the combination normally in an inflationary environment, you can see some compression when that inflation happens for the -- immediately, and then it gets passed through. In this environment, you have the combination of the inflation with some supply challenges in different categories across the industry and not just us. So, our teams, our commercial teams, pricing teams have worked very, very closely and have done a really nice job through here of really taking -- sort of managing that very well to be able to pass through that inflation and gain a little bit of pricing as we\u2019ve gone through there, but again, trying to price very fairly to our customers. On the national side, we\u2019ve continued this journey over the last few years where our national sales team has done a really nice job of really all the new business that we\u2019re bringing in is higher margin than typical in those and continue to take advantage of the tighter pricing environment that we remain in. So, it definitely is on those customers a much stronger pricing environment than it was a few years ago. And depending on how certain things play out in the environment today, that may continue even to a greater extent. But, I think that\u2019s where Pietro made the comment earlier. So, we try to be priced fairly to our customers. But at the same time, there are things that are different. And we work with our customers on things like our service model, our technology, et cetera, that we don\u2019t necessarily have to be the cheapest, if it\u2019s adding the most value to them in the environment we\u2019re in and that balance that really helps both of us win.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim.\nJohn Heinbockel: Let me start with -- can you give us a sense of -- if you think -- if you look at drop size, average drop size now that we\u2019re starting to cycle COVID, lines per customer, volume per line when you sort of look at the productivity of the business. So, what are you seeing with regard to those? And is drop size up nicely from maybe where it was a year -- well, certainly a year ago, but pre-COVID?\nPietro Satriano: Yes. I\u2019ll take that. So, drop size is up above what it was a year ago, John. That\u2019s probably a combination of recovery on the part of demand and also market share gains and consolidation. It\u2019s hard to tell how much is from each, but we are definitely in March we saw higher drop sizes compared to a year ago.\nJohn Heinbockel: Okay. And then, maybe take a longer-term view, right? So, if you look back, so pro forma for the acquisitions, right, I think EBITDA was $1.4 billion, give or take. Between synergies and proactive cost reduction, that\u2019s $200 million or so. When you look at where the business can be in three to five years, A is, do you think it\u2019s substantially greater than where you were pro forma? And then, from a margin perspective, right, can this business be 50 to 100 basis points more profitable than it was pro forma, in part drop size going up as well? Just -- I know it\u2019s a long time out there. But conceptually, where do you think this business ends up?\nDirk Locascio: So, maybe I\u2019ll start, and then Pietro, if you want to add in anything. I think -- so John, to your point, I think you\u2019re thinking about it in the right way. So, we do think that the business is on a good trajectory now of getting back to that pro forma. And then, we think that\u2019s, to your point, some of the -- between the synergy realization, the other cost saves as well as the new business wins, really positions the business to grow EBITDA dollars from that base to get to that stronger and higher number over time, and kind of continued EBITDA dollar growth as we\u2019ve done in recent years. I think, from a margin perspective, as you\u2019ve seen us pretty consistently do over the last four or five years, we really try to balance. It\u2019s focusing on growing EBITDA dollars because that\u2019s ultimately we take to the bank, but really taking advantage of those opportunities where you can create higher margins overall from whether it\u2019s drop sizes, continued logistics optimizations, private brands, customer mix, all those kinds of things. And so, we do think that continues to give us opportunity for margin improvement on rate as we move ahead. So, really both, dollars and rate opportunities remain out there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Slagle from Jefferies.\nAlex Slagle: Just following up on that last question, maybe tightening the timeframe a little bit, just want to get a feel for the sales volumes needed in the current environment versus 2019 levels to get back to a, say, 4%-plus adjusted EBITDA margin level, just knowing you have been staffing up and investing ahead of the curve, and we\u2019re dealing with the tight labor market and freight. Just any color here or commentary on recent EBITDA margin run rate exiting the quarter would be helpful.\nDirk Locascio: Sure. So, I think that we\u2019re going to stay away from a specific number because, as some of our peers have talked about, just the exact recovery and mix of business as it comes back and have some impacts on there. But, what I will tell you is, just to kind of build on my last answer is, as we get sales volumes truly back to where they were in 2019, we expect that our business should be bigger because of the wins we\u2019ve had. And we think that that should drive incremental dollars. I think that the other -- the thing that\u2019s a little harder to tell in the short term was some of the freight challenges that, again, are more transitory. So, if you assume some of those normalize as we get into, say, 2022 and such, we think that as that business and the core truly recovers, that we get back to that pro forma number and grow from there. So, I know it\u2019s not as specific as you wanted, but it\u2019s really again because of -- not knowing as an industry exactly how things recover. But, we do firmly believe that the business is stronger and can generate more EBITDA on similar sales because of the different actions we\u2019ve taken and the strong -- and then, grow from there with the strong customer wins that we\u2019ve had over this past year or so.\nAlex Slagle: No, that makes sense. On the independent case growth, just wanted to dive deeper behind the drivers behind the strong rebound. Is anything specific that stands out? And I guess, just some thoughts on the potential for further acceleration ahead, I mean as, I guess, the broader supply chain issues likely create an even wider gap between the haves and have-nots and food service distribution, I guess, some of the stronger inventory positions and able to make deliveries might fare better than those that are a little bit more constrained?\nPietro Satriano: Yes. So, we -- look, I think the best sign is the fact that April volumes were above 2019, and that\u2019s despite the fact that there\u2019s still a considerable number of markets, probably around a third, around the country that are still at 50% occupancy or maybe even below that. So, as those markets recover, we see more upside in terms of when our ability to gain market share. You\u2019ve hit on some of the things that -- our scale, which allows us -- our balance sheet, which allows us to provide better service. We look at our net promoter scores in terms of us versus our competitors who are doing well on that front. So reducing opportunity in terms of independents to come from both the recovery in some parts of the country as well as continuing to gain share.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Silberman from Credit Suisse.\nLauren Silberman: Another question on the independents side, really nice recovery with the case growth trend positive in April. Can you help us better understand the dynamics between new customer acquisition, expansion of wallet share and comp, I guess, declines in the case volume? And then, perhaps, are you willing to share what percentage of independent customers you\u2019re serving today relative to pre-COVID?\nPietro Satriano: Dirk...\nDirk Locascio: Sure. I\u2019ll start and maybe you can add on. So, I think from -- overall for us -- so, our customer counts on the restaurants are still down a little bit compared to 2019. But, each month that\u2019s going by, it continues to get better. And that\u2019s the combination of as more markets and more of our existing customers reopen as well as the net new customers that our sellers are continuing to bring on board. So we\u2019re feeling good about the trajectory of that\u2019s going. And then, Pietro mentioned we\u2019ve seen some nice basket size increases from customers and really looking to continue to build on that and hold some of those gains. So, overall, both in the right direction. There\u2019s always things you can do to continue to improve. And so, those are the things that we\u2019re focusing on as well. And Lauren, would you mind just repeating your last part of the question versus -- about something versus 2019?\nLauren Silberman: Yes. I was just -- I think you had answered it, but I was -- the two kind of parts were understanding the dynamics between what\u2019s driving the independent case growth? And then, second to that, what percent of independent customers you\u2019re serving today versus pre-COVID.\nDirk Locascio: Okay.\nLauren Silberman: And just as we think about that business in 2022, 2023, how do you envision the business mix to evolve, if at all, given some of your national wins and independent customer wins as well?\nDirk Locascio: It\u2019s harder to tell exactly in 2022 for some of the same reasons that I talked about earlier of not knowing exactly at what pace hospitality or other recovers. But, I think that over the longer term, as you -- that view, we would expect the business to be similar for the shorter term, some of the wins you hadn\u2019t changed. That\u2019s probably a little bit higher. But, as you can see, our independents are recovering and are growing pretty quickly. And so, in that case, that\u2019s at the high end of the margin spectrum. So, that helps over time. So, over the longer term, our focus on the target customers is really unchanged with growing at 2x the market on independents, growing at market in health care and hospitality and then being very opportunistic on chain and other, and in this case, with chain over this past year or two been opportunistic. And as I\u2019ve said a few different times, it\u2019s not been about just bringing cases through the door for us. They have to be profitable cases. And the national sales team has done a really nice job of optimizing for that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo.\nEdward Kelly: I\u2019m kind of curious on capacity. Can you just talk about where you currently stand from a capacity standpoint, given the challenges you mentioned on the labor side and the inventory side? You\u2019ve had the best quarter-over-quarter improvement case growth-wise relative to your peers here. But, I\u2019m just kind of curious as to how you\u2019re positioned for the coming months. And do you think that there is some constraint around capacity or whether you\u2019ll be able to navigate that?\nPietro Satriano: Okay. So, the capacity really is on two fronts. I think that you referred to, one is drivers and selectors. And now, we are looking to extend capacity. We\u2019re short about -- particularly about 1,000 drivers and selectors across the network from where we\u2019d like to be as the recovery continues. And as I mentioned, we\u2019re looking really hard to -- every week, we cut that number down to a number of factors, not just on the monetary side, said too what other things we\u2019re doing to attract selectors and drivers, I think one of our peers said. These are good jobs. They pay well, they pay good benefits. We\u2019re just having to ramp up the hiring machine more quickly and more than we have in the past. As we\u2019ve said, recoveries happened really quickly. On the inventory side, I think we are working with our vendors to make sure we have the right inventory, reserve committed to us. Where we have excess capacity in our network, we\u2019re taking advantage of that. And so, from an inventory perspective, we\u2019re doing all the right things, as Dirk said, right, to really serve our existing customers and continue to add customers that are very profitable and accretive to our P&L.\nEdward Kelly: Okay. And then, just a follow-up for -- maybe for Dirk, I guess. How are you guys going to be presenting the convertible preferred? So, it looks like the dividend came out of the $0.12 this quarter. I\u2019m just kind of curious because I -- hopefully, we\u2019re all going to model this correctly now going forward. But, how are you going to be presenting adjusted EPS as it relates to the converts? Thank you.\nDirk Locascio: Sure, Ed. Yes. As you noted, we did make a change this quarter to show it adjusted diluted for net income, not net income available to common, sort of to be a little bit clearer on that. And also, -- so that would be sort of -- hopefully, we\u2019re not in a position of a GAAP net loss much longer. But, while we have that, this would be the way we would show it. What will happen, as soon as we return to GAAP net income, so likely in the coming quarters, is you would not include the dividend, instead it would show the roughly 25 million shares in your diluted share count in order to get to a diluted share base. And if you guys have further questions, you can ask Scott and Melissa. But, hopefully that helps.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh from BTIG.\nPeter Saleh: Great. I want to come back to your comments on the increases in off-premise dining, which you guys believe will be -- become more permanent. Can you just give us a sense on what gives you that confidence to see that those sales remain permanent? And is there any difference between chains able to retain those versus independents, or is it kind of broad-based across the segments?\nPietro Satriano: Sure. So, look, there was a real spike in off-premise dining during the early part of COVID. I think what I was trying to say was some good portion of that incremental business will stick. I don\u2019t know about all of it sticks. It\u2019s hard to tell at this stage. But, the assertion is based on talking to customers and also talking to our partners. As you know, we have a good relationship with ChowNow, which helps enable off-premise dining. And based on what they\u2019ve shared with us, it does look like some of that will definitely stick.\nPeter Saleh: Great. And if I could just ask on your customers using your technology, I think you said it\u2019s one of the top reasons why customers will switch and use your mobile pay and real-time inventory, which I think could be a real benefit to them. Can you give us a sense on how much of your customer base today is utilizing this technology and with the opportunity still ahead? And how does that compare to 2019 levels?\nPietro Satriano: Sure. So, the -- just to clarify, the point I was making in terms of where we track reason for switching, that was with the large customer wins, and that was a combination of the technology and the service model, which is one point of contact, consistent offering across all our network. We don\u2019t have to negotiate with a different OpCo for promotions. So I was referring to that part of it. We have historically talked about our e-commerce penetration as being indicative of our technology advantage with respect to smaller local customers. And that -- I believe that penetration is at or above what it was 2019 with local customers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Two questions. One, just on the margins. I think, you mentioned that the new business you\u2019re acquiring, I guess, now $1 billion over the past five quarters, is with margins well above the portfolio and maybe prior wins. I\u2019m just wondering if you can offer more context on that, maybe what the margin upside is versus the historical, or whether or not you think you\u2019re able to sustain those higher margin levels with further wins going forward. And then, I have one follow-up.\nPietro Satriano: Sure. So just to clarify, the -- so the $1 billion is large customer wins, which includes chains, health care and hospitality. I think, I specified the more attractive margin profile is coming on the chain side. And that is really a function of the more favorable demand/supply environment than a few years ago that Dirk referred to. And, we don\u2019t anticipate that changing in the foreseeable future.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Okay. And then, just the follow-up, as you think about the distribution category and consolidation, I\u2019m just wondering whether you see yourselves or others pursuing more aggressive M&A, or whether specific to yourself, you might be constrained near term? Obviously, your leverage levels are well above your target. And I know in the past you\u2019ve talked about outsized valuations, perhaps desired by potential acquirees or whether or not you\u2019re seeing you have your own ongoing integration of your most recent acquisitions that might slow you down, whether any of those reasons would lead you to maybe just prefer to win accounts rather than actually acquiring smaller peers, whether you want to answer that for US Foods specifically or whether you think there would be consolidation through M&A for the broader category? Any thoughts would be great. Thank you.\nDirk Locascio: Sure. So, I think, I\u2019ll take that one. I think, for us, our top priority for the near term on the M&A perspective, as I commented before, is really about successfully integrating the two very strategic acquisitions that we have done for -- one for the channel and one for geography and really getting Food Group and Smart, both really well-embedded and growing within our core business. After those, for us, the near-term focus is -- after integrating those is really about delevering. I would expect over time that we would continue to see some tuck-in acquisitions, but that\u2019s really more where I would expect it to be like we\u2019ve done in the past, which is much, much smaller here and there. But again, I think right now, it\u2019s a tougher time for the whole industry because of valuations and valuation disconnects and the few smaller transactions that have gotten done or more kind of private equity type of transactions there. So, over time, again, I would expect us and others to probably continue to do some acquisitions, but you probably may not see as much large scale for across the industry as you would have in the past.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nicole Miller from Piper Sandler.\nNicole Miller: In thinking about the industry more or less being at 2019 levels, if you could just speak very broadly about the industry getting back to that 50-50 split it was at between grocery, eating at home and then restaurants eating out. If we keep pace here, is this more like a 6 to 12-month catch-up, a 12- to 24-month catch-up? And is there any reason your -- the industry that you sell into can\u2019t get back, I think, it\u2019s over like $100 billion in sales to even that out?\nPietro Satriano: So, Nicole, thanks for the question. I think, as Dirk has mentioned, we feel very confident talking about where things net out. The timing is a little harder, right? Again, we\u2019ve seen just how quickly the recovery has happened in the last month or two for a number of reasons. So, I think, the charts we showed on the traffic, which is the best day we can get at this point, between food-at-home and food-away-from-home, show that the trend is back to where we were. I think the -- however much of the off-premise dining stacks will help add to the level of food-away-from-home that we saw in the past. We\u2019re at 2019 levels, despite some markets like the northwest being still fairly handicapped in terms of restrictions. So, I think we can be confident about getting back to or above those levels. The timing and trajectory of that is really harder to say.\nNicole Miller: Could you talk a little bit -- last question. Could you talk a little bit about the cuisine categories that are improving? Which ones are improving the most? And, is there anything that\u2019s not keeping pace?\nPietro Satriano: So, everything is improving. In the early days of pandemic, we saw the more resilient customer menu types were around Mexican and Italian and QSR. I think of late we\u2019ve seen pretty much everything come back where in those markets that have few restrictions. And I think that\u2019s why we feel good about the health of the industry, right? It\u2019s independents, chains, different menu types, all kind of coming back is what we\u2019re seeing at this point.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JP Morgan.\nJohn Ivankoe: You\u2019re not the only large company that, at least on paper, has basically financed the increase in receivables and inventories with payables. Again, I know that\u2019s not what you\u2019re doing directly, but that\u2019s what the balance sheet shows. Can you comment as to whether that is unique to the largest foodservice distributors or whether that\u2019s also being seen or realized as a benefit to the regional and smaller operators, if there\u2019s a way for you to know that. Because obviously, working capital buildup was one of the things that we had talked about before as maybe an advantage that the larger distributors would have in the smaller ones wouldn\u2019t. And I have a follow-up as well.\nDirk Locascio: Sure. Good morning, John. So, as you pointed out, so I think, of the three of us saw payables increases. And at least in our case, it\u2019s not because of anything we\u2019re doing different, as opposed to just the natural timing of purchases in there. So, I would expect the inventory build to normalize a little more as we get a little -- the next couple of quarters. And then, similar with the AP, to normalize as well. I think from a -- so there\u2019s not anything, I guess, from a terms that I would call that I would think would be different from a larger and smaller. What I would say, though, is, I mean, you just pay for that inventory. And while you\u2019re carrying it, it will have an impact in the nearer term still on cash. And so, I think that\u2019s where it does advantage someone like us with the scale and the balance sheet strength we have of financing that incremental inventory. And then at the same time, as the industry is growing, your receivables are growing. So, just the natural build that happens to your point around that, that I think that is where as we continue to see where other smaller distributors will be challenged as we go through there because it is a cash and working capital investment. Because as we work through both the recovery plus the supply side challenges that they\u2019re happening. And as they\u2019re potentially less likely to make -- be able to make some of those investments to mitigate some of the supply challenges, I mean, those are opportunities for us to target those customers and really achieve additional growth from there as well.\nJohn Ivankoe: Thank you. And then, secondly, I would think one of the \"easier\" ways for you to win customers from distributors would be to get salespeople and drivers from those distributors. I mean, is that practical? I mean, is that something that you\u2019re seeing, or are there non-competes or other things that make it basically you go out and you get other people\u2019s best employees in more sticky proposition?\nPietro Satriano: We definitely see that. Now that we\u2019ve -- as Dirk said, we invest a portion of the cost saves in terms of expanding our sales force. I speak to a new class of sales force every month. And there\u2019s definitely a portion that comes from other competitors. And they\u2019re attracted to US Foods by the things that have made us attractive in the past as well, our culture, our technology, our products, our theme-based selling, all this kind of give them the ability to earn more income than they might in other places. And so, that definitely is an opportunity that we\u2019ve taken advantage of.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jenna Giannelli from Goldman Sachs.\nJenna Giannelli: I just had a question. You spoke about just the technology being such a point of differentiation in helping you gain market share. Should we expect any incremental investment here that\u2019s kind of needed or required to keep that industry-leading position? Basically, is there anything else that you\u2019d like to do or need to do? And then, just any color on the allocation of CapEx dollars as we think about 2021 and any investment? Thanks so much.\nDirk Locascio: Sure. Good morning. So, out of the $50 million, a small portion of that is some incremental investment for digital, what I\u2019d say is on that one. I mean that\u2019s an area where year in, year out, we\u2019ve continued to invest in there to be able to add more capability and serve our customers better. So, there\u2019s not a step change, so to speak, that we need over time. But again, we are investing a little bit extra there. I think, as we think through -- and that would be more on the, call it, the OpEx or P&L side. As we think through capital, not anything big or different that I would call out on our capital for this year. One of the things that I\u2019ve talked about prior is you will see more cash CapEx in the current year because we\u2019re spending less on fleet this year than in past and more on facilities. And that ebbs and flows from year-to-year. Sort of our all-in number, when you go together, isn\u2019t all that different, again because we -- other than the pause last year, one of the things we try to do is consistently make sure we\u2019re investing in the business to be able to support the growth across buildings, IT, tech and fleet.\nJenna Giannelli: That\u2019s super helpful. And then, just one bigger picture question, if I can. Just on the market share gains, can you give us a sense of who you think you\u2019re most gaining that share from? Is it from other large players or some of the smaller, more fragmented players? And then, when you think about the go-forward in your mind, the potential size of the portion of the pie that could be up for grabs, really how meaningful could further market share gains be? And that\u2019s all for me. Thank you.\nPietro Satriano: Okay. Look, to be honest, it\u2019s hard to tell where the gains are coming from. We don\u2019t have access to that sort of data when we talk to the field. Really, it comes from all places, small and large competitors. It really depends on the local environment and how various players are doing in terms of service and who the makeup of the players is. In terms of the longer-term outlook that you asked about, overall, we\u2019re a 10ish share player and we got a touch below that. So, we see lots of opportunity to grow share over time, given our position. We\u2019re the number two player, but still essential player and it\u2019s still a very fragmented industry. So, we see lots of opportunity to gain share over time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Karru Martinson from Jefferies.\nKarru Martinson: I just wanted to touch on the rise of ghost kitchens and how you guys are penetrated in that? And talk is that that will continue as we recover. Folks tend to like the economics on that. Just wanted to see where you\u2019re positioned there and what the focus is on that side of the market.\nPietro Satriano: Sure. So ghost kitchens, we benefit as a distributor. We benefit from rise of ghost kitchens, the same way we do commissaries or caterers because they still have to purchase their bulk food from somewhere. And I believe in past calls we\u2019ve talked about our ghost kitchen playbook that I think we were one of the first ones to come out with. And that\u2019s definitely helped existing customers operate out of -- get better leverage out of their existing real estate or acquire lower-cost real estate to access new customers. Our ghost kitchen playbook has some analytics built in, some menus built in for different menu types. And we\u2019ve had a lot of interest in participation on the part of customers in terms of ghost kitchens.\nOperator: There are no more phone questions. I\u2019ll turn back the call over to Mr. Pietro Satriano for closing comments.\nPietro Satriano: Thanks, operator. If we could, brief with comments. Look, I hope that just to go back to a few takeaways that you can see after this call, the three takeaways that I talked about at the outset. The industry recovery is well underway, and we are participating in this recovering in a very meaningful way. Second, our scale and differentiation is driving the market share gains that we have talked about. And third, the continued strengthening of our financial results as the industry continues to recover. I do, again, want to take the opportunity to thank all our associates to really continue to go above and beyond to serve our customers in this environment. We look forward to speaking with everyone on our next earnings call in August. Thanks for tuning in today, and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dirk Locascio",
            "content": "Thank you, Pietro, and good morning. I'll begin on slide 9, where I'll cover a few highlights for the quarter. As Pietro referenced earlier, case volume improved as the first quarter progressed, especially with our restaurant and hospitality customers. This resulted in a corresponding improvement in adjusted EBITDA as we moved through the quarter. These volume trends have continued in the early part of the second quarter as the recovery continues to take shape. When comparing last month's restaurant volume and trends compared to April of 2019, independent cases trended modestly ahead while chain cases were well into positive territory. Gross profit per case for the first quarter of 2021 was below Q1 of 2020. However, the recent improvement in case volume has driven an improvement in gross profit per case as our customer and product mix has started to return to pre-COVID levels. Our gross profit per case improved over the course of the first quarter as volume and mix improved. We saw higher product cost inflation in Q1 2021 than we did in prior quarters, which is negatively impacting our gross margin as a percent of sales. Much of the 2.7% product cost inflation we saw in the first quarter was in center-of-the-plate categories that may persist in coming quarters. If you recall, center-of-the-plate items such as beef and poultry, and some customer contracts are typically priced with a fixed fee per case markup. So, when we have higher inflation, gross margin as a percent of sales can compress for these product categories and customers, even if we are making the same amount of gross profit dollars in each case we sell. Comparing to Q1 of 2019 for a moment, our gross profit per case was negatively impacted by higher freight costs as well as the continued, albeit improved, negative mix impact already noted. As our case volume of corresponding mix continued to improve, we expect the gross profit per case will also continue to improve. And when we compare our gross profit per case to 2019, the gap for the first quarter was the smallest it has been since COVID began. Looking ahead, we expect to see continued headwinds in gross profit per case from the tight freight market and expect mix to improve as case volume improves. Although we expect the higher freight cost to be transitory, we do think they will remain a challenge for the next two to three quarters. On OpEx, over the last few quarters, I've spoken about the $180 million of fixed cost savings that we enacted in 2020. These cost savings are contributing to our results, and we are beginning to see the fixed cost leverage return as case volume recovers. We've begun thoughtfully reinvesting some of the 2020 savings back into the business to further enable sales growth and earnings improvement. We're reinvesting approximately $50 million, primarily to support growth in both, our local and national selling organizations as well as within some key areas such as supply chain to further improve our results and customer experience. This equates to roughly two-thirds of the $180 million ultimately flowing through as permanent cost savings. Slide 10 shows our net sales, adjusted gross profit and our adjusted operating expense results for Q1 of 2021 and 2020. Net sales dollars for the quarter were down slightly compared to the first quarter of 2020. And you'll recall that only the last three weeks of the first quarter of 2020 were heavily impacted by the rapid onset of COVID-19 and the business closures across the country. Our adjusted gross profit dollars for the first quarter declined 2.7%. And our adjusted gross margin was down 30 basis points compared to prior year. Freight costs, customer product mix and higher product cost inflations were headwinds to adjusted gross margin in the quarter compared to Q1 of 2020. We do expect case volume improvements with independent restaurants, health care and hospitality to have a positive impact on our adjusted gross margin going forward. Adjusted operating expenses in the first quarter decreased 2.6% in dollars and improved 30 basis points as a percent of sales. The improvement in adjusted operating expense as a percent of sales is largely due to the cost savings initiatives we've put in place over the past year and the sales inflation impact. On a dollar basis, the reduction in cost is primarily due to lower volume and the cost savings initiatives, partially offset by approximately $25 million higher bonus expense in Q1 2021 than Q1 2020. The first quarter of 2020 had a negligible amount of bonus expense. The lower fixed cost base that we operate from today will continue to benefit us as case volume returns, with a larger percentage of gross profit dollars flowing through to the bottom line. We do expect that supply chain cost inflation will be transitory OpEx, but will be a headwind through 2021. We expect the cost increases to be transitory until the workforce increases and the hiring demand from the recovery subsides, likely later in the year. On slide 11, adjusted EBITDA was $172 million, adjusted net income was $27 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.12 for the first quarter. As I mentioned earlier, adjusted EBITDA improved as we moved through the quarter and the second quarter has started out very similar to how the first quarter finished. We remained in a GAAP net loss position for the first quarter and as a result are not reflecting the additional shares from the preferred equity transaction in our adjusted diluted EPS number for the quarter. We do expect to return to positive GAAP net income in the near future and will reflect the additional shares at that time. And as Melissa noted at the beginning, reconciliations of our adjusted numbers are included in the press release and the appendix of the presentation. Just to wrap up, moving to slide 12. Share gains, cost savings initiatives and the operating model changes have and will continue to improve our effectiveness and our results. These, combined with the leverage from volume returning, have positioned us to take advantage of the recovery and drive earnings growth well into the future. Share gains with both large and small customers since the recovery began last summer have strengthened the top line, and we continue to pursue profitable new business and believe that our differentiated strategy and scale give us an advantage over many of the distributors in our industry. As I mentioned earlier, we do expect some transitory headwinds related to freight and supply chain labor over the next two to three quarters. Our business has historically produced strong operating and free cash flow. As the recovery continues, we expect to return to generating a healthy level of free cash flow. And this cash will be used to reinvest in the business and reduce our outstanding debt balance. In April, we used cash on hand to pay down $150 million of outstanding debt, and we'll continue to make debt paydowns as the recovery unfolds further through 2021. We still expect to operate the business at a 2.5 to 3 times leverage ratio through a combination of improved EBITDA and debt paydown. Pietro said at the beginning, the recovery is underway. And our second quarter case volume is off to a good start. At this time, it's hard to forecast the precise timing of the recovery as it may not necessarily progress in a linear manner, but we do see restaurant demand improving as more markets remove restrictions and as warmer weather allows for more outdoor dining in additional parts of the country. As a result, we expect continued improvement in Q2 adjusted EBITDA compared to Q1. Over the last 30 years, customers have shown a consistent preference for eating away from home, and we expect this trend to continue. We're confident about the future of U.S. Foods and the industry. Operator, at this time, we can now open the call for questions. Sure, Kelly. Good morning. This is Dirk. I'll take that. And so, although we haven't talked about the specific breakouts, we do manage -- a large portion of our freight is kind of relatively split between, where a vendor delivers it using their carrier and where we arrange for delivery either with one of our trucks or contracting directly with third parties. We do use spot rates. In a normal environment, it's relatively small. When we use third parties, we do try to contract with them. And then, it can be using a little more as you have more volatile environments like we're in now. What I would say is this. So, our teams are not standing still. They're working closely with vendors on opportunities where we can continue to work with them to try to increase their freight allowances to look at our -- within our own four walls, on optimizing our freight network. And it is -- it remains a challenge. It's not -- a little different, but kind of the same idea as 2018. But what we have seen in cycles over the years is that, when you have this tightness that additional capacity does tend to come into the market over time. And so we're working in the short term to try to mitigate it. At the same time, if we see capacity coming back later in the year, we think that will help as well. So, remains a challenge, but not something that we expect to be sort of a permanent impact within the industry or our business for the longer term. Sure. So, from the very beginning, we've said that we expect to reinvest a meaningful portion of that, and we've talked about how we expect the majority of the savings to remain permanent. And so today, it's providing a little more specificity. And so, the reason that we've progressed in recent months and moving ahead on those things is really a few things. One is we see more opportunity in recent months for market share gains than we did pre COVID. And we really want to take advantage of that, especially in some markets, so have begun that reinvestments on the local side and then on the national side, as well as we see the demand in the pipeline. We've also onboarded a fair amount of business in order to support that effectively. And then, to a lesser extent, it does remain an opportunity really to continue to upgrade some talent in some cases. The new hires are typically not the same individuals, but really is to continue to support growth and accelerate share gains as we move ahead. Sure. Good questions. I think that a couple of things I would highlight. So freight, as you pointed out, that's really been embedded for the last quarter or so, and I think will continue in similar magnitude for at least the next few quarters. On the gross margin, sort of mix continues to be a bit of a headwind, although as I mentioned, continues to improve as volume comes back on that. I think, from an OpEx perspective, so the main unusual things, there's not anything necessarily large that I would call out as unusual. There's always some incremental costs from small amounts from some of the storms in February and such. But, the things around labor that you're getting at, when we and others talked about hiring in advance, because the recovery happened so fast, that was less of an impact in the quarter. And so, therefore, some of the retention and hiring, we're seeing a little bit of it in the quarter. We'll see some continued ramp-up over the next couple of quarters as we continue to hire additional individuals to support the recovery. So, a little bit higher cost, but again, expect most of those to be transitory through the balance of 2021. Sure. So, I'll maybe break it into local and our larger national contract customers. And so, on the local side, so with the inflation, to your point, the combination normally in an inflationary environment, you can see some compression when that inflation happens for the -- immediately, and then it gets passed through. In this environment, you have the combination of the inflation with some supply challenges in different categories across the industry and not just us. So, our teams, our commercial teams, pricing teams have worked very, very closely and have done a really nice job through here of really taking -- sort of managing that very well to be able to pass through that inflation and gain a little bit of pricing as we've gone through there, but again, trying to price very fairly to our customers. On the national side, we've continued this journey over the last few years where our national sales team has done a really nice job of really all the new business that we're bringing in is higher margin than typical in those and continue to take advantage of the tighter pricing environment that we remain in. So, it definitely is on those customers a much stronger pricing environment than it was a few years ago. And depending on how certain things play out in the environment today, that may continue even to a greater extent. But, I think that's where Pietro made the comment earlier. So, we try to be priced fairly to our customers. But at the same time, there are things that are different. And we work with our customers on things like our service model, our technology, et cetera, that we don't necessarily have to be the cheapest, if it's adding the most value to them in the environment we're in and that balance that really helps both of us win. So, maybe I'll start, and then Pietro, if you want to add in anything. I think -- so John, to your point, I think you're thinking about it in the right way. So, we do think that the business is on a good trajectory now of getting back to that pro forma. And then, we think that's, to your point, some of the -- between the synergy realization, the other cost saves as well as the new business wins, really positions the business to grow EBITDA dollars from that base to get to that stronger and higher number over time, and kind of continued EBITDA dollar growth as we've done in recent years. I think, from a margin perspective, as you've seen us pretty consistently do over the last four or five years, we really try to balance. It's focusing on growing EBITDA dollars because that's ultimately we take to the bank, but really taking advantage of those opportunities where you can create higher margins overall from whether it's drop sizes, continued logistics optimizations, private brands, customer mix, all those kinds of things. And so, we do think that continues to give us opportunity for margin improvement on rate as we move ahead. So, really both, dollars and rate opportunities remain out there. Sure. So, I think that we're going to stay away from a specific number because, as some of our peers have talked about, just the exact recovery and mix of business as it comes back and have some impacts on there. But, what I will tell you is, just to kind of build on my last answer is, as we get sales volumes truly back to where they were in 2019, we expect that our business should be bigger because of the wins we've had. And we think that that should drive incremental dollars. I think that the other -- the thing that's a little harder to tell in the short term was some of the freight challenges that, again, are more transitory. So, if you assume some of those normalize as we get into, say, 2022 and such, we think that as that business and the core truly recovers, that we get back to that pro forma number and grow from there. So, I know it's not as specific as you wanted, but it's really again because of -- not knowing as an industry exactly how things recover. But, we do firmly believe that the business is stronger and can generate more EBITDA on similar sales because of the different actions we've taken and the strong -- and then, grow from there with the strong customer wins that we've had over this past year or so. Sure. I'll start and maybe you can add on. So, I think from -- overall for us -- so, our customer counts on the restaurants are still down a little bit compared to 2019. But, each month that's going by, it continues to get better. And that's the combination of as more markets and more of our existing customers reopen as well as the net new customers that our sellers are continuing to bring on board. So we're feeling good about the trajectory of that's going. And then, Pietro mentioned we've seen some nice basket size increases from customers and really looking to continue to build on that and hold some of those gains. So, overall, both in the right direction. There's always things you can do to continue to improve. And so, those are the things that we're focusing on as well. And Lauren, would you mind just repeating your last part of the question versus -- about something versus 2019? Okay. It's harder to tell exactly in 2022 for some of the same reasons that I talked about earlier of not knowing exactly at what pace hospitality or other recovers. But, I think that over the longer term, as you -- that view, we would expect the business to be similar for the shorter term, some of the wins you hadn't changed. That's probably a little bit higher. But, as you can see, our independents are recovering and are growing pretty quickly. And so, in that case, that's at the high end of the margin spectrum. So, that helps over time. So, over the longer term, our focus on the target customers is really unchanged with growing at 2x the market on independents, growing at market in health care and hospitality and then being very opportunistic on chain and other, and in this case, with chain over this past year or two been opportunistic. And as I've said a few different times, it's not been about just bringing cases through the door for us. They have to be profitable cases. And the national sales team has done a really nice job of optimizing for that. Sure, Ed. Yes. As you noted, we did make a change this quarter to show it adjusted diluted for net income, not net income available to common, sort of to be a little bit clearer on that. And also, -- so that would be sort of -- hopefully, we're not in a position of a GAAP net loss much longer. But, while we have that, this would be the way we would show it. What will happen, as soon as we return to GAAP net income, so likely in the coming quarters, is you would not include the dividend, instead it would show the roughly 25 million shares in your diluted share count in order to get to a diluted share base. And if you guys have further questions, you can ask Scott and Melissa. But, hopefully that helps. Sure. So, I think, I'll take that one. I think, for us, our top priority for the near term on the M&A perspective, as I commented before, is really about successfully integrating the two very strategic acquisitions that we have done for -- one for the channel and one for geography and really getting Food Group and Smart, both really well-embedded and growing within our core business. After those, for us, the near-term focus is -- after integrating those is really about delevering. I would expect over time that we would continue to see some tuck-in acquisitions, but that's really more where I would expect it to be like we've done in the past, which is much, much smaller here and there. But again, I think right now, it's a tougher time for the whole industry because of valuations and valuation disconnects and the few smaller transactions that have gotten done or more kind of private equity type of transactions there. So, over time, again, I would expect us and others to probably continue to do some acquisitions, but you probably may not see as much large scale for across the industry as you would have in the past. Sure. Good morning, John. So, as you pointed out, so I think, of the three of us saw payables increases. And at least in our case, it's not because of anything we're doing different, as opposed to just the natural timing of purchases in there. So, I would expect the inventory build to normalize a little more as we get a little -- the next couple of quarters. And then, similar with the AP, to normalize as well. I think from a -- so there's not anything, I guess, from a terms that I would call that I would think would be different from a larger and smaller. What I would say, though, is, I mean, you just pay for that inventory. And while you're carrying it, it will have an impact in the nearer term still on cash. And so, I think that's where it does advantage someone like us with the scale and the balance sheet strength we have of financing that incremental inventory. And then at the same time, as the industry is growing, your receivables are growing. So, just the natural build that happens to your point around that, that I think that is where as we continue to see where other smaller distributors will be challenged as we go through there because it is a cash and working capital investment. Because as we work through both the recovery plus the supply side challenges that they're happening. And as they're potentially less likely to make -- be able to make some of those investments to mitigate some of the supply challenges, I mean, those are opportunities for us to target those customers and really achieve additional growth from there as well. Sure. Good morning. So, out of the $50 million, a small portion of that is some incremental investment for digital, what I'd say is on that one. I mean that's an area where year in, year out, we've continued to invest in there to be able to add more capability and serve our customers better. So, there's not a step change, so to speak, that we need over time. But again, we are investing a little bit extra there. I think, as we think through -- and that would be more on the, call it, the OpEx or P&L side. As we think through capital, not anything big or different that I would call out on our capital for this year. One of the things that I've talked about prior is you will see more cash CapEx in the current year because we're spending less on fleet this year than in past and more on facilities. And that ebbs and flows from year-to-year. Sort of our all-in number, when you go together, isn't all that different, again because we -- other than the pause last year, one of the things we try to do is consistently make sure we're investing in the business to be able to support the growth across buildings, IT, tech and fleet."

            "name": "Pietro Satriano",
            "content": "Thanks, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. Today, we're going to focus on the recovery, the recovery which has been extremely good news for our industry, the recovery that has also called in our associates to work harder than they had before. So, I do want to take this opportunity to recognize our 26,000 associates, whose tireless commitment to serving our customers over the last several months has truly been second to none. In this call, we're going to cover three themes which are outlined on page two. First, our industry continues to recover and we are participating in that recovery in a meaningful way. During the last few months, we have seen a steady increase in volume and restaurant traffic, as in-person dying restrictions continue to be lifted. The recovery that we have seen over the last few months and our rebound in sales from markets that are mostly open, gives us the confidence that the industry will fully recover to, if not exceed 2019 case volume levels. Second, our scale and differentiated strategy is driving market share gains across most customer types as our technology, innovative products and team of industry specialists have provided customers with the necessary resources and tools to thrive in the current environment. And third, as case volumes have begun to recover, we have seen our financial results strengthen. We expect our financial results to continue to improve as the recovery continues. But, the same recovery that is driving volume gains is also driving tightness in labor for customers, distributors and manufacturers alike. We believe, however, that this tightness to be transitory and to ease in the latter part of the year. Moving to slide 3, the foodservice industry is experiencing a recovery as in-person dining restrictions ease around the country, plus COVID-19 vaccine distribution becomes more widespread. The chart on the left shows that traffic at restaurants recently exceeded traffic at grocery and convenience stores, and is very close to returning to pre-pandemic levels. The recovery has been driven not only by easing restrictions, but as importantly, by consumer sentiment. As shown by the chart on the right, consumers are becoming increasingly more comfortable eating out. A trend we expect to continue as vaccination rates increase and COVID cases continue to decline. And last, even if dining out continues to recover, we expect some of the increases in off-premise buying to become permanent, which augurs well for food-away-from-home to continue to gain share from food at many. On slide 4, you can see how the recovery trends that I just spoke about have impacted our case volumes for each of our main customer types compared to fiscal year 2019. Since the beginning of 2021, we have seen a steady increase in monthly case volume with our restaurant and hospitality customers. This is highlighted by restaurant case volume exceeding the quarter with volume levels that were above 2019. While the recovery -- while the industry recovers, certainly part of the story behind our recovering volumes, we are also gaining market share. First, let's talk about restaurants. Chain volume for March in April was ahead of 2019. And for independents, volume for March was flat to 2019 and above 2019 for April, and a positive trend has continued. The Mother's Day week that we just concluded on Saturday had the highest shipments to independent restaurants for legacy business of any Mother's Day week in five years with a 6% jump over 2019 Mother's Day week. Here, we know that consumable upsides still exist. In markets where local jurisdictions allow more than 50% seating, volume is well ahead 2019. This includes much of the south and southeast and a few other geographies. In markets where even less than 50% or less than 25% seating is allowed, like the northwest, volume is well below 2019. So, as restrictions get lifted everywhere as vaccination rates continue to increase and as consumer sentiment continues to improve, we expect that all markets to move into positive territory. Hospitality: The hotel portion of our hospitality business is recovering as leisure travel returns and occupancy rates recover, with occupancy rates now being only 500 basis points below a year ago. We expect this trend to continue. Consumer surveys highlight that travel, next to dining at restaurants, is one of the top things that consumers are looking forward to doing. Our portfolio of hotel customers leans more towards the leisure side of the industry, positioning us to take advantage of the increase in leisure travel that is expected as the economy reopens. Our health care case volumes continue to remain steady in the negative 10% range, which is where it has trended for the better part of the last year. Restrictions on visitors at hospitals are just starting to be lifted, and hospital cafeterias are just beginning to reopen. We also expect that occupancy rates of senior living facilities, which have declined over the past year, will start to normalize as vaccination rates increase. Both of these factors, plus recent wins in the health care area, will indicate that health care case volume will ultimately return to pre-COVID levels, if not higher. For nationally managed customers, which remember includes national chain, health care and hospitality, you will remember that in 2020, we added $800 million of new customer wins, which is driving some of the increases we are seeing. In the first quarter of 2021, we added $200 million of new customer wins, and our pipeline for the balance of the year is very healthy. Lastly, and for national chains specifically, the contribution margin at which we are signing new customers is well above the average for that portfolio and above the margins associated with recent wins. Turning to page 5. As I've discussed, an important factor behind growing case volumes has been the recovery of our industry. But an equally, if not more important factor, has been our market share gains across most customer types. The driver of our market share gains continues to be a Great Food Made Easy strategy, which aims to help customers succeed by taking advantage of our leading technology, our innovative products and our team of experts that support our sellers. Let me give a few examples of how our core programs and our strategy have evolved to meet changing customer needs and contribute to recent market share gains. First, on the technology front. Recent research and comments from new customers indicate that our technology still performs -- our technology platform still leads the industry. For example, for larger customer wins, like the $1 billion of wins in the last five quarters, we track the main reason why customer switches to US Foods. In many cases, the determining factor is a combination of our technology and our service model. We see that especially with health care and large chains where technology makes it easier to manage menus and control costs across multiple locations. Similarly, for independent restaurants, we continue to enhance the functionality to make our technology even easier to use. Some recent enhancements include mobile pay functionality and the ability for customers to see our inventory in real-time. This visibility provides real value to customers especially at a time when the industry is experiencing some volatility on the part of manufacturers. Second, on the product innovation side. I mentioned on our last call how COVID has resulted in a shift in the products that customers rely on the most. The three big trends that we observe are off-premise dining, the need to mitigate labor challenges and products that promote well-being, which includes plant-based products. Our Spring Scoop, which launched in February, featured products exclusive to US Foods but addressed all three of these operator needs. As a result, we saw a trial of these innovative products in line with historical norms, which we know contributes to increased retention and market share gains. Our upcoming Summer Scoop will similarly feature products that take labor out of the kitchen, especially ingredients or components that require intense preparation. These labor-saving products enable restaurants to maintain interesting options on their menu and continue to add innovation to their menus. We're also expanding our range of products that support the continued growth in off-premise dining, such as tamper evident packaging and grab-and-go products. Note that our 2020 corporate social responsibility report was published two weeks ago. This is a comprehensive review of our progress in our three pillars of people, product and planet, of which our line of 900 Serve Good sustainable products is an important component. The report is available on our website, which I encourage you to visit to learn more about our... The third and final part of our Great Food Made Easy strategy is our dedicated team of industry experts that are available to help customers run their business more effectively. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have had a dedicated team of restaurant operation consultants helping customers access CARES and Restaurant Revitalization Act funding. Starting with our first webinar in April 2020, the team has held weekly webinars and conducted over 7,500 one-on-one consultations to help customers understand and navigate available funding options. We estimate that our team has assisted customers in accessing over $1.5 billion in funding since COVID began. And as early as mid-February, this team was conducting webinars on helping customers be prepared to access the Restaurant Revitalization Fund even before the legislation was signed into law. These efforts are truly making a difference to customers. As illustrated by this email we received from a restaurant owner in St. Louis, which I'd like to read to you now. \"The information you supply is a game-changer. My payroll company said they found $300,000 between both my businesses. I'm not sure how to thank you. You are literally changing people's lives.\" This is what we mean by \u201cwe help you make it\u201d. Now moving to slide 6. Another key part of our strategy has been the acquisitions of Food Group and Smart Foodservice. The Food Group acquisition allowed us to dramatically improve our distribution footprint in the Northwest, giving us a presence in this growing part of the country and making us more attractive to regional and national customers. The acquisition of Smart Foodservice enabled us to scale our entry into the cash-and-carry channel, a more profitable and faster-growing channel in the foodservice industry. Not only does this channel provide a more attractive growth and margin profile and enables growth and share of wallet with our existing delivered customers while extending our reach to target customers we weren't previously serving. Let's spend a few minutes talking about the progress we have made on the integration of Food Group and the future growth opportunities cash and carry presents. Starting with Food Group. The warehouse systems conversions are progressing well. Since we last spoke, we have completed two additional conversions, Portola 4, [ph] and we are on pace to have all of the Food Group warehouses converted to US Foods operating system in the second half of this year, in line with our original plan. If you recall, completing the warehouse system conversion is a key enabler to unlocking the $65 million of annual run rate synergies. In 2020, we made good progress on synergy capture, especially on the product side. And we remain on track to capture the full $65 million synergies by 2023 with 80% captured by the end of 2022. We've also begun to expand Food Group capabilities around meat and produce to the rest of the US Foods network. And we are excited about the enhanced product offering this will bring to customers around the country. The Smart Foodservice business continues to outperform our delivered business as it has throughout the pandemic. Same-store sales for April are ahead of 2019 as restaurant demand continues to recover, and we continue to benefit from some direct-to-consumer sales, sales that we are getting without modifying our business model. On our last call, I mentioned that we would be rebranding all Smart Foodservice locations to the US Foods CHEF'STORE brand. I'm pleased to report that the rebranding effort is now complete and customers have responded well. With the rebranding complete, we have begun to fully leverage the power combining these two channels by offering both, sellers and customers, incentives to shop the two channels. As a result, we are seeing delivered customers increase their purchases from CHEF'STORE with minimal impact on the delivered business. This multichannel offering is an advantage that no other competitor has access to. Lastly, the conversion to the CHEF'STORE brand will help facilitate our expansion into new geographic markets in which US Foods has an established presence. Having covered the first two themes of our presentation, first, the continued and expected recovery of our industry; and second, how our scale and differentiation strategy is contributing to driving market share gains, I want to spend just a couple of minutes talking about the current operating environment that I referred to in my opening comments, after which, I will turn the call over to Dirk. As I'm sure you are all too familiar, all elements of the value chain are facing labor shortages. We here have restaurants having to close one day a week to give their staff a break. In some markets, hiring drivers and selectors is taking longer than expected. And lastly, some manufacturers are having trouble meeting the growth in demand. We believe that there are a number of factors contributing to this environment, including workers who have temporary left labor force, extended unemployment and the remarkable but as yet incomplete progress on the vaccine front. We believe that all these factors will sort themselves out over the next two to three quarters. In the meantime, we are working hard to mitigate these factors, so as to meet increasing demand on the part of our customers. First, we have added significant inventory, a 25% increase in days on hand and on order, as well as working very closely with manufacturers. And second, we are making use of onetime sign-on referral and retention bonuses to avoid embedding these wage pressures into our cost structure. Lastly, we are pleased with how the recent changes to our operating model have helped mitigate some of the supplier and labor pressures the industry is experiencing. You will remember that, by reducing the number of regions to 4, we freed up some resources, which then shifted to centers of excellence, whose aim is to quickly develop and deploy best practices across the country and which has helped us in this environment. I will now turn the call over to Dirk for a discussion of our first quarter financial results and how we have positioned the business for earnings growth. Yes. I'll take that. So, drop size is up above what it was a year ago, John. That's probably a combination of recovery on the part of demand and also market share gains and consolidation. It's hard to tell how much is from each, but we are definitely in March we saw higher drop sizes compared to a year ago. Yes. So, we -- look, I think the best sign is the fact that April volumes were above 2019, and that's despite the fact that there's still a considerable number of markets, probably around a third, around the country that are still at 50% occupancy or maybe even below that. So, as those markets recover, we see more upside in terms of when our ability to gain market share. You've hit on some of the things that -- our scale, which allows us -- our balance sheet, which allows us to provide better service. We look at our net promoter scores in terms of us versus our competitors who are doing well on that front. So reducing opportunity in terms of independents to come from both the recovery in some parts of the country as well as continuing to gain share. Dirk... Okay. So, the capacity really is on two fronts. I think that you referred to, one is drivers and selectors. And now, we are looking to extend capacity. We're short about -- particularly about 1,000 drivers and selectors across the network from where we'd like to be as the recovery continues. And as I mentioned, we're looking really hard to -- every week, we cut that number down to a number of factors, not just on the monetary side, said too what other things we're doing to attract selectors and drivers, I think one of our peers said. These are good jobs. They pay well, they pay good benefits. We're just having to ramp up the hiring machine more quickly and more than we have in the past. As we've said, recoveries happened really quickly. On the inventory side, I think we are working with our vendors to make sure we have the right inventory, reserve committed to us. Where we have excess capacity in our network, we're taking advantage of that. And so, from an inventory perspective, we're doing all the right things, as Dirk said, right, to really serve our existing customers and continue to add customers that are very profitable and accretive to our P&L. Sure. So, look, there was a real spike in off-premise dining during the early part of COVID. I think what I was trying to say was some good portion of that incremental business will stick. I don't know about all of it sticks. It's hard to tell at this stage. But, the assertion is based on talking to customers and also talking to our partners. As you know, we have a good relationship with ChowNow, which helps enable off-premise dining. And based on what they've shared with us, it does look like some of that will definitely stick. Sure. So, the -- just to clarify, the point I was making in terms of where we track reason for switching, that was with the large customer wins, and that was a combination of the technology and the service model, which is one point of contact, consistent offering across all our network. We don't have to negotiate with a different OpCo for promotions. So I was referring to that part of it. We have historically talked about our e-commerce penetration as being indicative of our technology advantage with respect to smaller local customers. And that -- I believe that penetration is at or above what it was 2019 with local customers. Sure. So just to clarify, the -- so the $1 billion is large customer wins, which includes chains, health care and hospitality. I think, I specified the more attractive margin profile is coming on the chain side. And that is really a function of the more favorable demand/supply environment than a few years ago that Dirk referred to. And, we don't anticipate that changing in the foreseeable future. So, Nicole, thanks for the question. I think, as Dirk has mentioned, we feel very confident talking about where things net out. The timing is a little harder, right? Again, we've seen just how quickly the recovery has happened in the last month or two for a number of reasons. So, I think, the charts we showed on the traffic, which is the best day we can get at this point, between food-at-home and food-away-from-home, show that the trend is back to where we were. I think the -- however much of the off-premise dining stacks will help add to the level of food-away-from-home that we saw in the past. We're at 2019 levels, despite some markets like the northwest being still fairly handicapped in terms of restrictions. So, I think we can be confident about getting back to or above those levels. The timing and trajectory of that is really harder to say. So, everything is improving. In the early days of pandemic, we saw the more resilient customer menu types were around Mexican and Italian and QSR. I think of late we've seen pretty much everything come back where in those markets that have few restrictions. And I think that's why we feel good about the health of the industry, right? It's independents, chains, different menu types, all kind of coming back is what we're seeing at this point. We definitely see that. Now that we've -- as Dirk said, we invest a portion of the cost saves in terms of expanding our sales force. I speak to a new class of sales force every month. And there's definitely a portion that comes from other competitors. And they're attracted to US Foods by the things that have made us attractive in the past as well, our culture, our technology, our products, our theme-based selling, all this kind of give them the ability to earn more income than they might in other places. And so, that definitely is an opportunity that we've taken advantage of. Okay. Look, to be honest, it's hard to tell where the gains are coming from. We don't have access to that sort of data when we talk to the field. Really, it comes from all places, small and large competitors. It really depends on the local environment and how various players are doing in terms of service and who the makeup of the players is. In terms of the longer-term outlook that you asked about, overall, we're a 10ish share player and we got a touch below that. So, we see lots of opportunity to grow share over time, given our position. We're the number two player, but still essential player and it's still a very fragmented industry. So, we see lots of opportunity to gain share over time. Sure. So ghost kitchens, we benefit as a distributor. We benefit from rise of ghost kitchens, the same way we do commissaries or caterers because they still have to purchase their bulk food from somewhere. And I believe in past calls we've talked about our ghost kitchen playbook that I think we were one of the first ones to come out with. And that's definitely helped existing customers operate out of -- get better leverage out of their existing real estate or acquire lower-cost real estate to access new customers. Our ghost kitchen playbook has some analytics built in, some menus built in for different menu types. And we've had a lot of interest in participation on the part of customers in terms of ghost kitchens. Thanks, operator. If we could, brief with comments. Look, I hope that just to go back to a few takeaways that you can see after this call, the three takeaways that I talked about at the outset. The industry recovery is well underway, and we are participating in this recovering in a very meaningful way. Second, our scale and differentiation is driving the market share gains that we have talked about. And third, the continued strengthening of our financial results as the industry continues to recover. I do, again, want to take the opportunity to thank all our associates to really continue to go above and beyond to serve our customers in this environment. We look forward to speaking with everyone on our next earnings call in August. Thanks for tuning in today, and have a great day."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Adam Dabrowski, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. \nAdam Dabrowski: Thank you, Cheryl. Good morning everyone and welcome to US Foods fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2022 earnings call. Speaking on the call today, we have Dave Flitman, Chief Executive Officer; Andrew Iacobucci, Chief Transition Officer; and Dirk Locascio Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions after our prepared remarks conclude. Please provide your name, your firm, and limit yourself to one question. Our earnings release issued earlier this morning and today's presentation slides can be accessed on the Investor Relations page of our website. During today's call and unless otherwise stated, we're comparing our fourth quarter and full year results to the same period in fiscal year 2021. In addition to historical information, certain statements made during today's call are considered forward-looking statements. Please review the risk factors in our 2022 Form 10-K that will be filed later today for a detailed discussion of these potential factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in those statements. Lastly, during today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. All reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the schedules on our earnings press release as well as in the appendices of this presentation slides posted on our website that we are not providing reconciliations to forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures as indicated therein. Thank you for your interest in US Foods, and I\u2019ll now turn over the call to Dave.\nDave Flitman: Thanks Adam. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I am thrilled to be here as the new CEO of US Foods. I joined this great company because of its strong reputation, significant future growth opportunity, strong culture and talented team of 29,000 associates. I look forward to working with our team to build upon our accomplishments from last year in executing our long-range plan. Since I joined in early January, I've spent much of my first month touring our distribution centers in six of our larger markets across the country, listening to customers and associates and diving deep to understand the US Foods business more thoroughly. While on the road, I met some talented and dedicated associates, many of them long-term veterans at US Foods. In Oklahoma City, for example, I met Randy Koller who's been a delivery driver for our company for more than 29 years. Randy expects excellence and teams up to lead our safety backing courses and is a popular driver trainer. He's so good that he's been named a local driver of the year four times. His customers constantly rave about his professionalism and the extra mile with, which he goes to serve them, which I was able to witness firsthand while riding with him on a seven-hour delivery route. Associates like Randy are one of the many reasons I am proud to be part of this great company. I also look forward to meeting many of our investors and analysts soon. I plan to spend my first three months, formulating my views about our strengths and opportunities in further detail, after which I expect to begin sharing more specific thoughts. That said I'm certainly starting to form some early opinions and perspectives at the six-week point. One early and important conclusion I've drawn is that US Foods long-range plan and the pillars within it are broadly the right areas of focus to ensure success. I would expect that any changes I will have in the near-term would be adjustments aimed at accelerating execution versus any wholesale overhaul of the plan. Earnings growth from a combination of margin expansion and profitable volume growth outlined in our long-range plan is a good mix. The team has made great progress this past year. However, much opportunity remains especially in supply chain. I expect that my more than 35 years of experience in distribution businesses across multiple industries will position me very well for the incredible opportunity to lead US Foods and to help build upon and accelerate the tremendous progress the company has made this past year. Let me share some key highlights of that progress on page 4. First our team has been intensely focused on executing the US Foods long-range plan and it is shown in our results each quarter. Throughout 2022, we grew profitable share, further optimized gross margins and improved operational efficiencies. We drove market share gains in each of our target customer types. We expanded gross margins with significant and durable gains in gross profit per case, while managing through a very challenging operating environment where US Foods and the broader industry face supply chain staffing and turnover challenges. While the progress we made against our operating efficiency pillar is somewhat masked by a challenging macro environment, we have advanced critical initiatives in a number of areas which Andrew and Dirk will highlight shortly. Second, we drove continued growth throughout the year, thanks to the great work of our associates. Our fourth quarter results clearly demonstrate strong execution with adjusted EBITDA increasing 34%, attributable to a combination of accelerating year-over-year case growth and continued margin expansion. Our progress in 2022 gives me immense confidence, in our trajectory. Lastly, we remain focused on creating value for shareholders and allocating our capital prudently by continuing to invest in the business, reducing leverage to our target range, returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program and opportunistically pursuing accretive tuck-in acquisitions. Andrew will walk through some of these progress points in more detail. Before I turn the call over to him, I want to thank him for stepping in as Interim CEO last year for his leadership to get the business on a strong trajectory heading into 2023, and for the support he's providing me, as I onboard. A mark of a great company is its ability to deliver on its commitments. Essentially doing what you say you're going to do. US Foods did exactly that in the first year of our long-range plan. We finished 2022 with a strong fourth quarter, building on our achievements in the first three quarters and exceeding the high-end of our adjusted EBITDA guidance, for 2022. My expectation is that we will continue to build upon that momentum, in 2023. With that, let me turn the call over to Andrew to share a bit more, on our progress.\nAndrew Iacobucci: Thanks Dave. And let me say how terrific it is to have Dave on board. My colleagues on the executive leadership team and I, look forward to working with him, as we continue to build on our strong results in 2022. Now, turning to page 5, I'll walk through our fourth quarter highlights. We delivered strong financial results again this quarter, capping off the year with strong market share growth and margin expansion and in-turn significant earnings growth in a challenging macro environment. Net sales for the fourth quarter grew 11%, compared to the same period in 2021. Year-over-year volume growth strengthened from Q3 to Q4, which we see as a positive for US Foods and our customers as their recovery continues. Adjusted EBITDA grew 34% for the quarter representing an, acceleration from our Q3 growth rate despite essentially zero sequential inflation in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA margins also increased 70 basis points from the prior year, as we gained further operating leverage. I cannot thank our associates enough, for their incredible work to drive progress against our long-range plan. A year ago we set out to deliver $1.3 billion in adjusted EBITDA in 2022 and we exceeded the high-end of our guidance, thanks to their dedication. Turning to our customer experience, we continue to gain share in target customer types via our differentiation strategy and customer focus. We further leveraged our omnichannel capabilities for profitable growth by CHEF'STORE, Pronto and US Foods Direct in addition, to continuing to strengthen our core digital customer platform by expanding customer usage of MOX\u0113. We also made progress on our supply chain operations in the fourth quarter. The positive trends we saw in Q3 turnover continued in Q4, with driver turnover nearing pre-COVID levels and warehouse turnover showing sustained improvement. We aren't yet where we want to be, but we are encouraged by the continued progress and strong evidence that the actions we are taking are yielding results. As mentioned on our Q3 call we piloted flexible employee scheduling and seven-day delivery in one of our key markets. The results to-date have exceeded our expectations with significant reductions in turnover, positive employee feedback and improved safety results. We are continuing the pilot at that location and are adding two additional locations in Q1. Assuming we replicate these outcomes in these additional markets, we expect to significantly expand the flexible scheduling portion of this initiative in 2023. As we have done in the past few quarters, we continue to strengthen our inbound logistics capabilities, resulting in further improved financial results and third-party partner collaboration. This work is well ahead of plan and a significant contributor to our strong results in 2022. We continue to improve our capital structure and prudently allocate capital during the fourth quarter. Each of these actions reinforce our commitment to being responsible stewards of shareholder value, which Dirk will discuss in more detail shortly. Turning to page six, we are pleased with the significant progress we have made against all three pillars of our long-range plan. Starting with our first pillar, profitable market share growth. We exceeded our volume goals relative to the market for the full year 2022. In fact, we outperformed the market by nearly 150 basis points as our restaurant volumes, excluding our targeted exits, increased by approximately 1%, while the latest survey from our third-party provider showed a market decline of roughly 0.5%. Specifically within restaurants, our independent case growth was 4.3%, while the third-party estimates that the market declined by 1.2%. Our focus on growing with the right customers is yielding sizable benefits by allowing us to serve those customers more effectively and create longer-term relationships. This focus on our target customer types grows EBITDA dollars and expands our margins. We opened six CHEF'STORES in 2022 and are working to increase the number of openings to at least eight in 2023, which means we will have a robust network of nearly 100 CHEF'STORES by the end of the year. We are quite pleased with our market share gains in 2022 and expect further share gains in 2023 as we leverage our differentiated sales support strategy our industry-leading MOX\u0113 platform and our omnichannel options, as well as other sales growth initiatives. Moving to the margin optimization pillar, we implemented a number of initiatives to improve gross profit per case regardless of market conditions. Those achieved excellent results in 2022. Our three key focus areas are the same I talked about last quarter and have been significant contributors to our results on the year. First, our team very effectively managed significant inflation earlier in the year and some commodity deflation later in the year through our established pricing and procurement processes. We also optimized margins with a number of customers to better reflect the increasingly challenging cost environment facing our industry. Second, we achieved our stretch goal of collaborating with vendors representing approximately 40% of our spend to improve our cost of goods and anticipate an additional 20% of spend to be addressed in 2023. And third, our inbound logistics team focused intensively all year on working with vendors to ensure improved process and economics aligned with the market. We also achieved $70 million of total synergies in 2022 related to our Food Group acquisition, which is above our previously stated $65 million target. These initiatives along with a number of others together delivered the strong gross profit per case we saw in 2022 and we expect to build further on that performance in 2023. We made progress on operational efficiencies despite a very challenging macro environment. Our routing optimization resulted in significant miles reduction and drove cases per mile well above 2019 levels, despite case volume being lower than 2019. Our work on retention and employee engagement also yielded benefits as we saw continued improvement in turnover and consequently productivity in the second half. We further improved productivity through a combination of network-wide initiatives and targeted optimization efforts in select markets with the greatest opportunities. US Foods is advancing critical initiatives that drive our long-range plan and we'll execute against all three pillars with a goal of further enhancing the customer experience and our operational foundation as well as continuing to build on our progress into 2023 and beyond. We've made significant progress throughout 2022. And while we are pleased with our progress, it's important to acknowledge that much opportunity remains here and we expect to build on our second half momentum in 2023. Now, I'd like to hand it over to Dirk to go over our financial performance in more detail. \nDirk Locascio: Thanks Andrew and good morning everyone. Let's turn to page eight. We are extremely pleased with what we accomplished during the fourth quarter and in fiscal 2022 and how that is translating into our financial results. In the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA grew 34% from the prior year to $350 million. In addition to strong EBITDA dollars, our adjusted EBITDA per case remained strong and was consistent with Q4 of 2019. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 45% over the prior year fourth quarter to $0.55. Net sales were $8.5 billion in the fourth quarter, an increase of 11% over the prior year. Total case volume increased 2.6% from the prior year and food cost inflation was approximately 8%. Independent case growth was nearly 6% over the prior year. We continued our strong gross profit growth from the fourth quarter -- through the fourth quarter, which we're quite pleased with as there was essentially no sequential inflation in the quarter. Our adjusted gross profit dollars increased 16% from the prior year and as a result, we generated strong adjusted gross profit per case. OpEx remained elevated. However, we saw continued improvement in turnover during the quarter signifying further improvement from Q3 results. The improved turnover and impacts from our other initiatives drove increased productivity in the fourth quarter. We still see significant opportunity in our supply chain operations. For the full year 2022, net sales were $34 billion. This is an increase of 15% with a volume increase of 2% and cost inflation of 13%. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.3 billion, an increase of more than $250 million, a 24% increase over the prior year and above our full year guidance due to a strong fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin also expanded 20 basis points over the prior year and our adjusted EBITDA per case was above 2019. Adjusted diluted EPS was $2.14 per share, an increase of 38%. We made good progress against all pillars of our plan in 2022 and we are excited about what we can achieve in 2023. Let's look at volume on Page 9. Independent cases increased 6% over the prior year in Q4, which is an acceleration from the 3% we reported last quarter. Hospitality grew 19% and healthcare grew 6%, offset by 6% lower chain volume. Our chain decline was largely driven this quarter by the strategic exit of a small number of less profitable and more complex customers, consistent with what we shared in Q3. So far in 2023, we are continuing to see volume improvement over the prior year and have not seen signs of softening demand. Year-over-year case growth across almost all customer types was stronger in Q4 than Q3. Additionally, we delivered share gains in target customer types again this quarter. Our keen focus on profitably growing these customer types and opportunistically growing other customer types is resulting in profitable growth, strong gross profit and EBITDA margin expansion. For the full year, we exceeded our goal of growing case volume excluding strategic exits by 1.5x the market for restaurants and 1x for all other. I will focus for a moment on growth relative to 2019. Fourth quarter independent case growth was nearly 5% above 2019. We still have embedded COVID recovery tailwinds, as health care cases were 4% below Q4 of 2019 and hospitality was 11% below 2019. For all other, the decline was related primarily to the strategic exits discussed. As we move into 2023, we will no longer compare results against 2019. Moving to Page 10. We made continued progress in the fourth quarter to further strengthen our capital structure and reduce leverage. We reduced our net leverage compared to both the end of fiscal 2021 and third quarter 2022. Our net leverage ratio was 3.5x at the end of the fourth quarter in line with our guidance, which was a 1.1 turn reduction from a year ago and a two turns reduction from Q3 of this year. During the fourth quarter, we prepaid an additional $200 million of term loan, which means in fiscal 2022, we reduced net debt by approximately $220 million. Leverage reduction remains a focus area of our capital allocation strategy. I am happy with the progress we've made this past year to further strengthen our capital structure and deliver on our priority of leverage reduction. At the same time, we announced US Foods' first share repurchase program for $500 million and repurchased $31 million of shares in the fourth quarter of 2022 and January 2023. Turning now to our guidance for 2023. We expect continued increases in volume and earnings through the execution of the three pillars of our long-range plan, to grow market share, expand margins and improve operational efficiencies. We expect to grow volume at 1.5 times the market for restaurants and grow at market for the remaining customer types. We also expect to deliver $1.45 billion to $1.51 billion of adjusted EBITDA and $2.45 to $2.65 adjusted diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2023. The higher end of the EBITDA range assumes continued solid macro demand improvement, while the lower end assumes a mild volume slowdown in the second half. We also expect continued EBITDA margin expansion in 2023 as we increased gross profit per case above 2022 and achieve more OpEx efficiency through improved turnover and initiatives. We're also providing guidance on interest expense and total CapEx. As we continue to significantly increase earnings and reduce total debt in 2023, we expect net debt to be below three times leverage by year-end, inclusive of any share repurchases. In summary US Foods made very strong progress, against our long-range plan during 2022 in terms of advancing capabilities, achieving record adjusted EBITDA and strengthening our capital structure and capital allocation. Every one of us at US Foods is squarely focused on building on the momentum we created in 2022, and our progress to date is in large part thanks to these efforts. 2022 was just the beginning. We are focused on creating a best-in-class experience for our customers and associates and generating significant value creation for our shareholders. With that, I'll pass it back to Dave for his closing remarks.\nDave Flitman: Thanks, Dirk. In closing, I couldn't be more excited to be here, and I look forward to significantly building on the progress our team has made against the company's long-range plan. Our strategy is working and we will remain focused on driving profitable share gains expanding gross margins and improving operational efficiencies to accelerate our progress in the year ahead. We are winning. I am proud of the work our associates have done to accomplish the results we achieved in 2022, and expect we will continue to build on that great work in 2023 to serve our customers better and position the company to deliver compounded shareholder value over the long term. With that, Cheryl, please open up the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJohn Heinbockel: So let me start guys with maybe more strategic question. I think the independent case growth this quarter was the best since 2018, right? So if I think about that maybe address capacity in the warehouses, how much you're running up against capacity in certain places capacity with the sales force, right? I think is there a need to invest in either one right to grow at the rate that you want to grow at the next couple of years?\nDirk Locascio: Good morning, John, this is Dirk. I'll start and then Andrew may add in. But I think, just to start with, your question on the capacity one of the things and the reason our focus really a reason our focus is on independent health care and hospitality is actually from a capacity, we can get much more capacity out of our buildings, because you have customers that are largely using the same SKUs you already have in your warehouse. And so from that perspective, we don't see any issues there. Now that's part of with other customer types why we continue to opportunistically grow. We want to make sure that we're putting the right customers in our warehouses. And then when the right time is there, we will continue to add capacity. We opened sort of a facility this year in Sacramento California, and in New Orleans. But again, we're going to be really smart with that capital. And I think, as far as sales, we have continued and will continue to add sellers. Andrew, do you want to?\nAndrew Iacobucci: Yeah. A couple of things on that, John. On the sales front, we absolutely plan to continue to expand our sales force. They are an incredibly important part of the relationship with the customer. We will really be focusing on areas of particularly strong growth as opportunities to perhaps even double down on that expansion. But I should also mention, one of the things that we've been very happy with was the way in which we've been able to leverage team-based selling and those -- the specialists of rocks food-fanatic chefs that are present in every market have been an important part of our growth trajectory and we will continue to both leverage those and expand those as appropriate.\nDave Flitman: Yes. And this is Dave. I'll just piggyback on to what Andrew said. I've had the opportunity to witness that team-based selling approach in several of our markets with our food-fanatic chefs and our restaurant operations consultants. I believe that is a real differentiator for us as Andrew said, and we'll continue to invest in that.\nJohn Heinbockel: And then maybe as a follow-up for Dirk, right? I know you talked about the 1.5 times the market. But maybe some color on when you think about top line maybe more granularly, right? And case growth versus where you exited the fourth quarter inflation thoughts for 2023, right? Do you think inflation and case growth are equal contributors in 2023? Just sort of some color trying to bridge the top line to the EBITDA guide.\nDirk Locascio: Sure. So we think that more comes -- so you have the wrap of inflation. But I think we expect more continued growth to come from case volume and we expect pretty healthy case volume across our target customer types and then again opportunistically from some of the other types. We think as Andrew touched upon, the momentum we have coming out of 2022, we think sets us up really well for good growth with the right customer types and continuing to gain share as we did last year. So we feel good about that. I think from an inflation perspective, as you saw this quarter sort of on a year-over-year, it continues to work its way down. In the fourth quarter, we actually saw some sequential deflation. We're seeing a center of the plate have some deflation. Grocery still showing some modest inflation sequentially quarter-to-quarter and that's remaining quite sticky. So I think that's -- we're not counting on a lot of inflation over the course of next year and really, I'll kind of come back to what I've talked a lot about this past year is, we're really focusing on what we can control, which is taking share and really the other initiatives that are driving our overall top line in the right customers.\nJohn Heinbockel: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. And congrats to Dave on the new position, and Andrew, great job during the transition.\nDave Flitman: Thanks a lot.\nAndrew Iacobucci: Thanks, Jeff.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Sure. I had one question and then one follow-up. The question, Dave, I guess is on the market share gain opportunity. We hear a lot about opportunities to further penetrate existing accounts, adding new accounts. And as you mentioned, maybe further tuck-in M&A. Just wondering from your seat and your perspective and background like how would you prioritize the focus going forward among those three opportunities, or do you see even further opportunities beyond that in terms of specifically gaining market share relative to large and small peers? And then I had one follow-up.\nDave Flitman: Sure. And I would just highlight that the team sequentially through the back half of last year continued to gain market share. As we said in our prepared remarks, we have really good momentum. Our team is focused in, particularly in those three customer segments that we spoke about, the independent restaurants, hospitality and healthcare. And I've seen laser focus, as I've visited in the field, really good momentum. I think we have -- and I would just highlight that's profitable volume growth. And I think we have the right focus in those segments. So I think there's tremendous opportunity for organic case growth. To your question around M&A this is still a very highly fragmented industry. And we will through the course of time look opportunistically for tuck-ins that will either give us a continued advantage in certain geographies or perhaps add product or something to our portfolio but we'll be opportunistic about that going forward. But I'm incredibly excited about our ability to continue to grow organically.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Understood. And then just to follow-up. I think you mentioned in your commentary around 2023 guidance. EBITDA margins continue to expand, which I think has been a key area of focus for investors, as Dave, I'm sure you've already probably heard. And I know US Foods is often compared to your largest peers. I'm just wondering what do you think is a realistic target whether it's short or long-term in terms of specifically EBITDA margins where they could go to healthy levels versus what would you say is just unrealistic? Just trying to get a gauge just because it's been such a popular topic of conversation over the past number of years? Thank you.\nDave Flitman: Yes I appreciate the question. It's early days for me. I'm six weeks in. I've got a good sense of the focus that we have. I think it's in the right areas. I'll tell you 100%. Our team is focused on this and focused on accelerating the results in our business. There's a lot of differences between us and our competitors in terms of the P&L and how that's constructed and all that, but our focus is continuing to expand those margins in a way that makes sense for us and provides the efficiency that we need for our customers. And as excited as I am about the momentum, you also heard me say that there's tremendous upside opportunity in this business everywhere I look, we talked about growth already, productivity and efficiency. We've got good momentum but there's tremendous upside to go and our team is laser-focused on it. I would expect continued expansion of profitability through the course of time.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you.\nDave Flitman: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Mark Carden of UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMark Carden: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. And Dave congrats on the new position. So to start and I know it's still early. But joining on to US Foods, it's an organization that's structured in a bit of a more centralized fashion relative to performance. So I'd love to get your take on some of the opportunities and challenges you see with building and implementing strategies just given the difference in backdrop. \nDave Flitman: Yes. I mean you're right to point that out in the difference. But I'm not really hung up on any particular organization structure. I think ultimately our success comes down to people and having the right processes in place and executing extremely well. Our team is clearly focused on that. Obviously, I'm making assessments on things like people and organization structure and all that sort of stuff and I'll have more to say about that in time. But as I highlighted, I don't expect any wholesale changes. I think we've got the right focus and really good momentum. You start playing around with organization structure, you tend to do a lot of internal navel-gazing and lose a lot of efficiencies and get distracted. I don't sense any need to do that here. We've got great momentum. We're going to continue to build on that.\nMark Carden: That's great. And then on the solid independent case growth during the quarter, just curious about some of the cadence. One of your largest competitors saw some labor disruptions early in the quarter for service some underground noise just in terms of the consistency did you see bumps in some months relative to others? Your overall take that would be great.\nAndrew Iacobucci: Yes. Thanks for the question Mark. It's Andrew. I think we were pretty much in line with what we expected the quarter played out pretty much exactly as we had anticipated with continued momentum, particularly in independent restaurants. We saw a little bit of bumpiness in terms of the way the holidays fell this past year. But other than that I wouldn't say there was anything there that was of any concern. And indeed, we've continued to see really strong momentum coming into the New Year, where we're at or slightly above our forecast in January. So we really feel good about the stability of that. We've been paying very close attention obviously to that case line to just look for signs of softness. And so far we've really not seen that.\nMark Carden: Great. Thanks so much. Good luck, guys.\nDave Flitman: Thank you, Mark.\nOperator: Your next question is from Alex Slagle of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAlex Slagle: Hey, thanks. Welcome, Dave. And congrats, Andrew, Dirk and team for all the success in recent quarters, moving things forward. I just wanted to ask about CHEF'STORE and you added new locations in 2022 and accelerating it in 2023. I just wondered if you could offer some additional perspective on how that's performing. Just kind of curious with the same-store sales look like relative to 2019? And if you're still seeing the synergistic customer gains as it rolls out to additional markets and allowing you to really leverage the power of combining those two channels and where you see that heading over the future.\nAndrew Iacobucci: Yes. Thanks for the question, Alex. It's Andrew. We feel very good about CHEF'STORE's progress, as we've continued to integrate. The acquisition system integration is basically nearing completion now which will really put us in a great position to drive the growth of that part of our business. In terms of new store openings and how they've sort of played out in terms of our model of driving that top line synergy between broadline and the stores, they're playing out exactly as we had anticipated. We have a great team in place that is busily working through a way to significantly accelerate our rate of store builds. And they've also made some really good progress around time to break even in those new store openings both of which will stand us in very good stead as we look to roll those out more quickly across the business. So generally, I think we're feeling quite good about delivering the synergies that we had planned to, and also feeling good about the continued rollout as we talked about this year, trying to accelerate from six last year to eight or even more this year. \nAlex Slagle: I just want to follow up on the inbound freight income. It's been a really nice tailwind in recent quarters, and it's all the work you've done optimizing the vendor allowances and carriers. Kind of curious, how much this benefit in the fourth quarter and kind of what relative to what you've seen in previous quarters and to the degree, you think there's still room here to go and most of the low-hanging fruits maybe then picked at this point? \nDirk Locascio: Sure. Good morning, this is Dirk. Benefit in Q4 was pretty similar to what we saw in Q3, so not a whole lot different than I would call out. I think that the one thing in addition to, the strong vendor collaboration, that team has done a really nice job is staying very close to the market and making sure that as market rates are going up and down that we're adjusting our sort of third-party cost, being active at that, they're ahead of or in line with. The team continues to do that this year. So I would expect that, a lot of the bigger gain is there and it's already embedded in our P&L. But with that said, there remains opportunity to continue to convert some cases to us managing them, whether it's our own trucks picking them up or ranging there. So a lot of the benefit there, but still some opportunity ahead and expect a lot of those gains to be pretty durable. \nAlex Slagle: Great. Thank you \nDirk Locascio: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question is from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nJohn Ivankoe: Hi. Thank you very much. There are comments made just about significant supply chain opportunities. And obviously supply chain is kind of what drives your entire company, so that's a very big category. A lot of the conversation has been around inbound freight and your ability to manage that much better. But I was wondering, if we could just get a little bit more insight whether it's at the warehouse level or the driver level, your SKU assortment whatever that may be I mean, what major buckets that you see Dave, as you come into the company of opportunities of making it a more efficient business. Thanks.\nDave Flitman: Yes, absolutely, John. I appreciate that. Look, we -- as you've heard on the call, we made a lot of progress in supply chain. But as I highlighted in my comments, I see that as a huge opportunity to continue to drive efficiency and productivity for the company. As I think about excellence in supply chain, we need to have predictable on-time performance at the lowest possible cost and that's clearly, what the company is aimed at driving. We owe that to ourselves, we owe it to our customers and we certainly owe it to our shareholders, to be as efficient as we possibly can be.  And as I think about the work that's going on I guess, I would put it in four kind of key buckets. You've heard a lot about most of that this morning. This pilot that we've had in the Southeast, the seven-day delivery and flexible scheduling, has tremendous potential to help us continue to drive efficiency and reduce turnover across the company. In fact, I'll just give you one little anecdotal story, when I was visiting that market. I had the opportunity to have some town -- not town halls, but little roundtables with drivers and selectors. In the selector roundtable I had, I just started asking them what they thought about the flex scheduling that we had. And we had an 11-year warehouse veteran, has been working days, who opted to take a weekend schedule. And so I said, well, why would you do that? You're one of the more senior folks in the warehouse. He said, \"Look my wife, has a catering business, she needs help during the week and this gives me the chance to lean in and help her and do what we need to do and balance my career and help my wife out on the personal front\". So, I think we are scratching the surface, as something here that will also help our employees and associates as well as drive efficiency for the company. The second one, we've talked about it here is inbound logistics. We still have a lot of opportunity in that area great momentum strong focus in the company. And then, there's really two others, I think in supply chain that will pay dividends long term. One is, process optimization, standardizing our approach being consistent across the company and how we think about anything from onboarding to training warehouse associates, and how we do our work through the course of the evening. Then the final one, I'll point to is some future opportunities in supply chain, not the least of which is -- and you've heard about this the routing software going to a leading platform that will execute throughout the course of this year, will also pay some long-term benefits. So, I think there's some near-term things. There are certainly some long-term opportunities for the company. I'm excited about the momentum, but tremendous upside here on --\nJohn Ivankoe: Thank you.\nDave Flitman: Sure. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Kelly Bania of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nKelly Bania: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our questions.\nDave Flitman: Good morning.\nKelly Bania: Good morning. I just want to go back to the guidance and the outlook for the year. I appreciate the color on the expected growth relative to the market. But I guess I was just curious if you're willing to comment at all on a specific case growth range embedded in the guidance. We were kind of thinking low single-digit, but if you can just help us maybe think about the broad strokes in terms of the different customer types between independent health care hospitality and all other, as well as I think there was a comment that the low end of the guidance assumes a slowdown in the second half. Can you help us understand the magnitude of what you might be embedding in terms of the potential softness there in the second half? \nDirk Locascio: Sure. Hi Kelly, this is Dirk. I think when we think about the guidance for the year similar to last year we always will look internally how we compare to the market. But just since there still is some macro uncertainty out there that's really why we focused on this growth relative to the market. I think when we focus on the external data that our third-party is calling for it's low single-digits of growth and we would expect to be sort of again above that. And I think what you should expect to see is that stronger case growth come from the good momentum we've built in our target customer types and then just remembering that we continue to have tailwinds in the health care and hospitality space. So, that's not exactly an answer but that's really where we expect to see continued growth. And I think the -- to your second part about the second half yes we do -- did embed some sort of modest or mild slowdown so think of it as in past recessions you're talking about call it a few point reduction in sort of overall growth rates. So, we looked at a few ranges and how we thought about that. But -- so it's very modest out there and I think the important part is we have the team internally focusing on what we can control and that's the part that if the environment stays stable, we are focusing on delivering sort of at the high end of that range. \nAndrew Iacobucci: Yes. And just to piggyback on that I think and Dirk has said this a couple of times we are 100% focused on the things that we can control and regardless of the macro, I have a lot of confidence we will continue to take share in those targeted segments just like we did last year.\nKelly Bania: Thank you. And maybe just a follow-up -- and I may have missed this are you able to share any figures or metrics on where you are in terms of staffing, turnover over time, any figures you can share with us to kind of measure that progress? And maybe just broadly when you expect that to get back to normalized levels?\nDirk Locascio: Sure. So, Kelly, this is Dirk again. From a staffing perspective we've been sort of largely staffed for a number of quarters. So, that really isn't the challenge. There's always going to be a market or two here and there where you have sort of a staffing challenge. But we've been in good shape there. If I compare -- although we haven't shared specific numbers when we think about sort of delivery driver turnover that is call it up about one and a half times to where it was sort of in 2019 at its worse. And we've gotten much closer as Andrew said now to 2019. So, significant progress there. On the warehouse, we were at almost 2x and we've closed almost half of that gap. So, good progress. We continue to make progress there. And I think some of the things that you've heard Dave and Andrew talk about give us continued confidence that we'll get there. I think that the part that we can't control as much as the macro still remains a relatively tight labor environment. But I use flexible spending that Dave talked about we think is a key unlock where it's a help for our associates and a help for the business. And those are the things we love when it really either helps both the customer and the business or the associate on the business. \nKelly Bania: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Brian Harbour of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nBrian Harbour: Yes, thank you. Good morning guys and welcome Dave. Maybe just to ask on -- you called out kind of the drag from exiting some customers. And I know that's always a constant process. But do you think that you're kind of past most of the drag from that, or do you think there's still more work to do just on kind of the customer optimization side?\nDirk Locascio: So, good morning Brian, this is Dirk. We've said that we expect to lap sort of the remaining exits in Q1. With that said I think that the thing that we've been pretty consistent is we're going to continue to sort of have good hygiene. In any business you would want us to be continuing to look at our base. So, what wouldn't expect is any significant, sort of, cleansing et cetera as opposed to it's really about continuing to make sure we're growing and focus on the right customers. And hopefully what you see is by us doing that that's showing up in our gross profit and showing up in our market share and it's actually -- and it's clearly showing up in our results. \nBrian Harbour: Okay. Great. Thanks. Maybe just on the debt side. You obviously have EBITDA growth that helps leverage. Do you expect to pay down debt at a similar or perhaps higher rates what you did in 2022? And is that kind of factored into the interest expense outlook? \nDirk Locascio: We do expect to continue to pay down debt. We haven't been specific. So we would expect to continue to pay down debt and also opportunistically repurchase shares. And those will be depending on the market conditions, but the continued reduction in leverage and being opportunistic with what we think is an undervalued share price are two things we'll continue to focus on. And, yes, we've contemplated a level of that in our EPS outlook. \nBrian Harbour: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Edward Kelly of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nEdward Kelly: Hi, guys. Good morning and David, welcome.\nDave Flitman: Thanks, Ed.\nEdward Kelly: Question is really for you Dave. I mean obviously you support the plan that has been in place here and that's very good to hear. But as an outsider with your own, sort of, perspective there's probably also things that you see as additional opportunity. And I think you alluded to that when you said about accelerating the execution of the plan. Could you just maybe talk a bit more about what you mean by that? And then how does that, sort of, roll into the goal that the company has had about the $1.7 billion in EBITDA in 2024? \nDave Flitman: Yes. Let me take the second part of that question first Ed and then I'll come back to the first part. I haven't said anything about the 2024 target, but that's purely an issue of process and timing for me. I've been spending my time learning the business and digging in and understanding the outlook for this year. I haven't seen anything that gives me reason to believe we're off track for 2024. It's just early days. In fact it's just the opposite. You've heard about my confidence in the momentum in the company. And so back to your first part of your question, for me I like to work with teams to execute, execute well and accelerate momentum. We have so much going on in the company all rightfully aimed at improving the results. If there's one thing, I think, I can help the team do is really focus on the critical view and get them done and do them well and then move on to the next pieces of it. So that's purely what I meant. I'm working closely with the team around that now. Let's work on the needle movers, the right ones as you heard Dirk say that help our business as well as our associates and keep moving ahead. \nEdward Kelly: Okay. And then Dirk just a follow-up for you. Your guidance implies gross profit per case improving in 2023 versus 2024, but you also mentioned sequentially a little bit of deflation. I think, there's been questions amongst investors about things like procurement gains and lapping those. So I think this is an important issue as we're seeing this inflation. Can you maybe just talk a bit more about your confidence in growing gross profit per case next year and the drivers of that despite that backdrop? \nDirk Locascio: Sure. Good morning, Ed. So we do feel good about gross profit per case continuing to improve in 2023 above 2022. And I think that it comes back to what we've talked about is that the lion's share of our gross profit per case improvement has been our own four-wall initiatives and the good work that our team has done and really making sure that we're passing those through and reflecting even with customers where we've optimized some pricing reflecting the higher cost operating environment that we're operating in. So we expect it to be pretty durable. Yes, early in the year we'll have some portions of onetime kind of procurement gains that we'll be lapping. But our team through all the good work last year that we've done we feel very good about continuing to have strong gross profit and we think it will be a good durable gross profit as we look ahead. \nEdward Kelly: Great. Thanks, guys.\nDirk Locascio: Thanks, Ed.\nDave Flitman: Thanks, Ed.\nOperator: Your next question is from Lauren Silberman of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nLauren Silberman: Thank you very much and I also echo my congrats, Dave. And this is a little bit of a follow-up to a prior question on 2024. But I know it's still early days. How are you thinking about the level of incremental investments that might be necessary as you look to execute the plan and then add your own, kind of, spin on the plan?\nDave Flitman: Yes, you're right Lauren. It would be premature for me to really think about those investments. Now I think the company is making the right investments. You heard us talk about the things that we're doing in supply chain most of which requires some level of investment. The excitement we have around the sales team and making the appropriate targeted investments there opening of the CHEF'STORES I think we'll continue on the plan that we've had. And then I'll be assessing here over the next few months what I think it's going to take beyond 2023 into 2024 and beyond.\nLauren Silberman: Thank you for that. And then just on near-term, are you guys willing to provide any additional color on what you're seeing quarter-to-date? I know broadly the industry is seeing some improvement -- some of it's Omicron just trying to understand the underlying trends? Thank you.\nDirk Locascio: Sure. Good morning, Lauren. This is Dirk. So overall Andrew commented and I commented on in the prepared comments that we've seen demand hold up quite well here through the early part of the quarter and really haven't seen signs of softening. I think overall the momentum that we expected to enter the year with we are seeing that. So really not a whole lot to share beyond that other than builds on our optimism as we continue to enter the year and what we expect to deliver through the year.\nLauren Silberman: Thank you. Congrats.\nDave Flitman: Thank you.\nAndrew Iacobucci: Thanks, Lauren.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jake Bartlett of Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJake Bartlett: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Mine was a follow-up on the 2023 guidance. It was maintained for EBITDA and EPS, but you did hit the higher end on the 2022 you're talking about accelerating momentum. So I'm wondering whether there's some offset. It seems like you started a better spot. Are you building in more macro pressure? Just trying to understand maybe how conservative that 2023 guidance might be?\nDirk Locascio: Sure. Good morning, Jake. This is Dirk. I will -- I think when you think of we're very pleased with the way 2022 ended again a little bit above our guidance, which we're pleased with and shows the good momentum in the business. I think when you pivot that to 2023 I think in the order of magnitude just knowing the macro uncertainty out there we've tried to do is really reflect a range that illustrates more strength with a considered continued macro recovery potentially still very good progress, but not quite as quick if the economy slows down. But I think the message you should take out of there is very good momentum. We feel good about where we're entering it. And then as the year plays out and we see how things play out we'll continue to update as you would expect us to do.\nJake Bartlett: Great. And then I had a question about the -- really the drivers of the independent case growth that you're putting up. We've heard from others that it's really been driven by new account, whereas, traffic individual accounts might be down just because of the high pricing that for instance restaurants are having to take. Is that the case with US Foods that the case growth -- independent case growth is really being exclusively driven by new account growth? And then if that is the case, I'm wondering about the ability to build on that new account growth. It seems like the larger players are all accomplishing that. My expectation was that the market would get -- would be -- get a little more difficult to penetrate new accounts as supply chains eased and other smaller competitors were able to service those accounts better. Maybe just firstly the answer of what is driving the case growth? And second just the competitive dynamics and whether you think that the larger players are still really in the catbird seat here?\nAndrew Iacobucci: Thanks Jake, it's Andrew. Yeah. So I think as we talked about last quarter as well, we're very pleased with the balance in our I&D growth. We're seeing a good mix of driving new account acquisitions, as well as focusing on penetrating those new accounts. And that's really been part of a sort of a systematic approach we've been taking at a market level to focus -- concentrate on the menu types that are seeing the greatest growth to target those in a very focused way. And then once on boarded, we spent a great deal of energy looking for opportunities to expand our share of wallet with those customers. So, both are important and both, I would say, will continue. As far as what we're seeing within our customers themselves, as I mentioned in my remarks, we are seeing good recovery in those customers for the most part. And that's something that again, we pay very close attention to, because it typically will be an early sign of a potential looming slowdown. And as I said previously, we really have not seen any sign of that at this point.\nDave Flitman: And I'll just say, the other thing, I'm excited about is our exclusive brands, and we've been able to penetrate the independent portion of that north of 50%, but I'm excited about our continued momentum there and the team's focus on accelerating that brand penetration. Our customers love it. They're really good, and it makes sense for them as well as the company.\nJake Bartlett: Great. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question is from Peter Saleh of BTIG. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nPeter Saleh: Great. Thanks for taking the question, and I want to echo my congrats to the team as well. I just wanted to ask about the seven-day delivery pilot and the flexible scheduling. Can you just elaborate a little bit on the cost benefit of this initiative? And just if it does prove out in the pilot, how quickly do you think you can roll this out to the rest of the system?\nAndrew Iacobucci: Yes. Pete, thanks for the question. It's Andrew. We've actually -- we've learned a couple of different things from the pilot, which actually had both elements to a seven-day delivery and a flexible scheduling. And what we've learned along the way is the flexible scheduling is something we can do quite quickly pretty much everywhere that it will be a benefit. In other words, it does -- you don't need to go to seven days in order to be able to get a large measure of the benefits from a flexible scheduling. Just given that choice that it gives our selectors and the impact that has on their willingness to stay with us. Seven day delivery takes a little more work to shift deliveries onto the weekend. That has played out in a very promising way in the pilot market, and we are looking to see that replicated in the two additional markets that we're testing as we speak. And depending on how that plays out, we will look to do that in markets, where that will deliver meaningful benefit, particularly ones where capacity might be a little more constrained because those extra two days that it gives those markets, takes a great deal of pressure off their ability to serve customers. So, both are being looked at in combination or separately as the case may be, and we see a real opportunity this year to roll out the flex scheduling portion to a significant number of our markets and likely be more selective with seven-day delivery elsewhere.\nDirk Locascio: And what we really like about the flexible scheduling part of it is, that it really, as Dave commented earlier, it gives employees that opportunity to find schedules that work for them, which when you have lower turnover, lower hiring costs, that reduces your cost and increase productivity. We've seen, again, the positive employee relations, positive employee feedback and also improved safety results. So, all those things are sort of good reasons to do it, because they help the associate and they benefit the company.\nPeter Saleh: Great. Thanks. And then just lastly, Dave, any other low-hanging fruit that you see -- that you're focused on for 2023 strategically?\nDave Flitman: No. I see a lot of low-hanging fruit and continuing to execute well and keeping the team focused on the things that matter in moving the needle. Like I said earlier, there might be an opportunity here to help with that focus and accelerate results, but outside of that I'll have more to say through the course of time, if I see other opportunities.\nPeter Saleh: Great. Thank you very much.\nDave Flitman: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Andrew Wolf of CL King. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAndrew Wolf: Hi. Good morning and welcome, Dave.\nDave Flitman: Good morning.\nAndrew Wolf: Question for you on strategic acquisitions. I think the company has kind of been in the timeout period both during the CEO transition phase and launching a plan into 2024. But historically, one of the highlights of this industry is creating value through acquisitions for shareholders. Just can you give us a sense sort of where you stand on that? Is that something either in your interview conversations with the Board or just how you feel about it where the company will could eventually -- is likely to eventually get back to acquisitions, or is it just straight ahead with the plan for 2024?\nDave Flitman: Look I think we have the right capital allocation plan. And in order of priority, we'll invest in the company. We'll pay down debt. We'll return capital to shareholders. And finally, we'll be opportunistic on M&A. We're not going to do M&A for M&A's sake. There's going to be value that we need to create either in geographies or portfolio reasons for that. But as you know I mean this is still a highly fragmented industry with Big three maybe having 35% of the market, still highly fragmented, still opportunities for growth through inorganic acquisitions and we'll be opportunistic on that and do the things that make sense where we've got the right valuation.\nAndrew Wolf: Okay. Thank you for that. Andrew, I wanted to ask you about the sales force acceleration. Would you -- is there any way you can quantify like either the rate of additions or anything like that? And also where you would be sourcing them from? Are they from other food service distribution competitors and they're kind of bringing a book of business, or is it folks outside the industry who are either good at sales or chefs who want to do this type of work little color on that would be great.\nAndrew Iacobucci: Yeah. Thanks for the question. Yeah, Andrew. I think the way we're thinking about this is we will be targeting to be at or slightly above 2019 levels by the end of the year. And we will be as I say doubling down in markets with particular growth opportunities in doing so. So we are still very much in hiring mode and will continue to be so. And in terms of where talent is coming from, the mix hasn't changed dramatically. We typically look for people with a culinary background as well as folks that have worked in our industry. And that mix if anything is probably tilted a little bit more toward sourcing from people with industry experience. Of late, we've been having we think quite good success attracting really high-quality sales reps from our competition, and we think that's something that is really standing us in good stead, particularly in those markets with big growth opportunities.\nDave Flitman: I think Andrew is just -- it's an important thing to remember. So as Andrew said earlier, we've been -- the ads have been and will continue to be sort of outsized in those markets and more growth opportunity is headcount and adding seller hasn't been and will not be an inhibitor to our growth, but we are continuing to do that where there's the need.\nAndrew Wolf: Great. Thanks for that color. Appreciate it.\nOperator: We have completed the allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call over to Dave Flitman for closing remarks. \nDave Flitman: Thank you all for joining us today. I'm incredibly excited to be here and the momentum that the company has. I appreciate your time. We'll talk to you all soon. Take care.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Dirk Locascio",
            "content": "Thanks Andrew and good morning everyone. Let's turn to page eight. We are extremely pleased with what we accomplished during the fourth quarter and in fiscal 2022 and how that is translating into our financial results. In the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA grew 34% from the prior year to $350 million. In addition to strong EBITDA dollars, our adjusted EBITDA per case remained strong and was consistent with Q4 of 2019. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 45% over the prior year fourth quarter to $0.55. Net sales were $8.5 billion in the fourth quarter, an increase of 11% over the prior year. Total case volume increased 2.6% from the prior year and food cost inflation was approximately 8%. Independent case growth was nearly 6% over the prior year. We continued our strong gross profit growth from the fourth quarter -- through the fourth quarter, which we're quite pleased with as there was essentially no sequential inflation in the quarter. Our adjusted gross profit dollars increased 16% from the prior year and as a result, we generated strong adjusted gross profit per case. OpEx remained elevated. However, we saw continued improvement in turnover during the quarter signifying further improvement from Q3 results. The improved turnover and impacts from our other initiatives drove increased productivity in the fourth quarter. We still see significant opportunity in our supply chain operations. For the full year 2022, net sales were $34 billion. This is an increase of 15% with a volume increase of 2% and cost inflation of 13%. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.3 billion, an increase of more than $250 million, a 24% increase over the prior year and above our full year guidance due to a strong fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin also expanded 20 basis points over the prior year and our adjusted EBITDA per case was above 2019. Adjusted diluted EPS was $2.14 per share, an increase of 38%. We made good progress against all pillars of our plan in 2022 and we are excited about what we can achieve in 2023. Let's look at volume on Page 9. Independent cases increased 6% over the prior year in Q4, which is an acceleration from the 3% we reported last quarter. Hospitality grew 19% and healthcare grew 6%, offset by 6% lower chain volume. Our chain decline was largely driven this quarter by the strategic exit of a small number of less profitable and more complex customers, consistent with what we shared in Q3. So far in 2023, we are continuing to see volume improvement over the prior year and have not seen signs of softening demand. Year-over-year case growth across almost all customer types was stronger in Q4 than Q3. Additionally, we delivered share gains in target customer types again this quarter. Our keen focus on profitably growing these customer types and opportunistically growing other customer types is resulting in profitable growth, strong gross profit and EBITDA margin expansion. For the full year, we exceeded our goal of growing case volume excluding strategic exits by 1.5x the market for restaurants and 1x for all other. I will focus for a moment on growth relative to 2019. Fourth quarter independent case growth was nearly 5% above 2019. We still have embedded COVID recovery tailwinds, as health care cases were 4% below Q4 of 2019 and hospitality was 11% below 2019. For all other, the decline was related primarily to the strategic exits discussed. As we move into 2023, we will no longer compare results against 2019. Moving to Page 10. We made continued progress in the fourth quarter to further strengthen our capital structure and reduce leverage. We reduced our net leverage compared to both the end of fiscal 2021 and third quarter 2022. Our net leverage ratio was 3.5x at the end of the fourth quarter in line with our guidance, which was a 1.1 turn reduction from a year ago and a two turns reduction from Q3 of this year. During the fourth quarter, we prepaid an additional $200 million of term loan, which means in fiscal 2022, we reduced net debt by approximately $220 million. Leverage reduction remains a focus area of our capital allocation strategy. I am happy with the progress we've made this past year to further strengthen our capital structure and deliver on our priority of leverage reduction. At the same time, we announced US Foods' first share repurchase program for $500 million and repurchased $31 million of shares in the fourth quarter of 2022 and January 2023. Turning now to our guidance for 2023. We expect continued increases in volume and earnings through the execution of the three pillars of our long-range plan, to grow market share, expand margins and improve operational efficiencies. We expect to grow volume at 1.5 times the market for restaurants and grow at market for the remaining customer types. We also expect to deliver $1.45 billion to $1.51 billion of adjusted EBITDA and $2.45 to $2.65 adjusted diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2023. The higher end of the EBITDA range assumes continued solid macro demand improvement, while the lower end assumes a mild volume slowdown in the second half. We also expect continued EBITDA margin expansion in 2023 as we increased gross profit per case above 2022 and achieve more OpEx efficiency through improved turnover and initiatives. We're also providing guidance on interest expense and total CapEx. As we continue to significantly increase earnings and reduce total debt in 2023, we expect net debt to be below three times leverage by year-end, inclusive of any share repurchases. In summary US Foods made very strong progress, against our long-range plan during 2022 in terms of advancing capabilities, achieving record adjusted EBITDA and strengthening our capital structure and capital allocation. Every one of us at US Foods is squarely focused on building on the momentum we created in 2022, and our progress to date is in large part thanks to these efforts. 2022 was just the beginning. We are focused on creating a best-in-class experience for our customers and associates and generating significant value creation for our shareholders. With that, I'll pass it back to Dave for his closing remarks. Good morning, John, this is Dirk. I'll start and then Andrew may add in. But I think, just to start with, your question on the capacity one of the things and the reason our focus really a reason our focus is on independent health care and hospitality is actually from a capacity, we can get much more capacity out of our buildings, because you have customers that are largely using the same SKUs you already have in your warehouse. And so from that perspective, we don't see any issues there. Now that's part of with other customer types why we continue to opportunistically grow. We want to make sure that we're putting the right customers in our warehouses. And then when the right time is there, we will continue to add capacity. We opened sort of a facility this year in Sacramento California, and in New Orleans. But again, we're going to be really smart with that capital. And I think, as far as sales, we have continued and will continue to add sellers. Andrew, do you want to? Sure. So we think that more comes -- so you have the wrap of inflation. But I think we expect more continued growth to come from case volume and we expect pretty healthy case volume across our target customer types and then again opportunistically from some of the other types. We think as Andrew touched upon, the momentum we have coming out of 2022, we think sets us up really well for good growth with the right customer types and continuing to gain share as we did last year. So we feel good about that. I think from an inflation perspective, as you saw this quarter sort of on a year-over-year, it continues to work its way down. In the fourth quarter, we actually saw some sequential deflation. We're seeing a center of the plate have some deflation. Grocery still showing some modest inflation sequentially quarter-to-quarter and that's remaining quite sticky. So I think that's -- we're not counting on a lot of inflation over the course of next year and really, I'll kind of come back to what I've talked a lot about this past year is, we're really focusing on what we can control, which is taking share and really the other initiatives that are driving our overall top line in the right customers. Sure. Good morning, this is Dirk. Benefit in Q4 was pretty similar to what we saw in Q3, so not a whole lot different than I would call out. I think that the one thing in addition to, the strong vendor collaboration, that team has done a really nice job is staying very close to the market and making sure that as market rates are going up and down that we're adjusting our sort of third-party cost, being active at that, they're ahead of or in line with. The team continues to do that this year. So I would expect that, a lot of the bigger gain is there and it's already embedded in our P&L. But with that said, there remains opportunity to continue to convert some cases to us managing them, whether it's our own trucks picking them up or ranging there. So a lot of the benefit there, but still some opportunity ahead and expect a lot of those gains to be pretty durable. Thanks. Sure. Hi Kelly, this is Dirk. I think when we think about the guidance for the year similar to last year we always will look internally how we compare to the market. But just since there still is some macro uncertainty out there that's really why we focused on this growth relative to the market. I think when we focus on the external data that our third-party is calling for it's low single-digits of growth and we would expect to be sort of again above that. And I think what you should expect to see is that stronger case growth come from the good momentum we've built in our target customer types and then just remembering that we continue to have tailwinds in the health care and hospitality space. So, that's not exactly an answer but that's really where we expect to see continued growth. And I think the -- to your second part about the second half yes we do -- did embed some sort of modest or mild slowdown so think of it as in past recessions you're talking about call it a few point reduction in sort of overall growth rates. So, we looked at a few ranges and how we thought about that. But -- so it's very modest out there and I think the important part is we have the team internally focusing on what we can control and that's the part that if the environment stays stable, we are focusing on delivering sort of at the high end of that range. Sure. So, Kelly, this is Dirk again. From a staffing perspective we've been sort of largely staffed for a number of quarters. So, that really isn't the challenge. There's always going to be a market or two here and there where you have sort of a staffing challenge. But we've been in good shape there. If I compare -- although we haven't shared specific numbers when we think about sort of delivery driver turnover that is call it up about one and a half times to where it was sort of in 2019 at its worse. And we've gotten much closer as Andrew said now to 2019. So, significant progress there. On the warehouse, we were at almost 2x and we've closed almost half of that gap. So, good progress. We continue to make progress there. And I think some of the things that you've heard Dave and Andrew talk about give us continued confidence that we'll get there. I think that the part that we can't control as much as the macro still remains a relatively tight labor environment. But I use flexible spending that Dave talked about we think is a key unlock where it's a help for our associates and a help for the business. And those are the things we love when it really either helps both the customer and the business or the associate on the business. So, good morning Brian, this is Dirk. We've said that we expect to lap sort of the remaining exits in Q1. With that said I think that the thing that we've been pretty consistent is we're going to continue to sort of have good hygiene. In any business you would want us to be continuing to look at our base. So, what wouldn't expect is any significant, sort of, cleansing et cetera as opposed to it's really about continuing to make sure we're growing and focus on the right customers. And hopefully what you see is by us doing that that's showing up in our gross profit and showing up in our market share and it's actually -- and it's clearly showing up in our results. We do expect to continue to pay down debt. We haven't been specific. So we would expect to continue to pay down debt and also opportunistically repurchase shares. And those will be depending on the market conditions, but the continued reduction in leverage and being opportunistic with what we think is an undervalued share price are two things we'll continue to focus on. And, yes, we've contemplated a level of that in our EPS outlook. Sure. Good morning, Ed. So we do feel good about gross profit per case continuing to improve in 2023 above 2022. And I think that it comes back to what we've talked about is that the lion's share of our gross profit per case improvement has been our own four-wall initiatives and the good work that our team has done and really making sure that we're passing those through and reflecting even with customers where we've optimized some pricing reflecting the higher cost operating environment that we're operating in. So we expect it to be pretty durable. Yes, early in the year we'll have some portions of onetime kind of procurement gains that we'll be lapping. But our team through all the good work last year that we've done we feel very good about continuing to have strong gross profit and we think it will be a good durable gross profit as we look ahead. Thanks, Ed. Sure. Good morning, Lauren. This is Dirk. So overall Andrew commented and I commented on in the prepared comments that we've seen demand hold up quite well here through the early part of the quarter and really haven't seen signs of softening. I think overall the momentum that we expected to enter the year with we are seeing that. So really not a whole lot to share beyond that other than builds on our optimism as we continue to enter the year and what we expect to deliver through the year. Sure. Good morning, Jake. This is Dirk. I will -- I think when you think of we're very pleased with the way 2022 ended again a little bit above our guidance, which we're pleased with and shows the good momentum in the business. I think when you pivot that to 2023 I think in the order of magnitude just knowing the macro uncertainty out there we've tried to do is really reflect a range that illustrates more strength with a considered continued macro recovery potentially still very good progress, but not quite as quick if the economy slows down. But I think the message you should take out of there is very good momentum. We feel good about where we're entering it. And then as the year plays out and we see how things play out we'll continue to update as you would expect us to do. And what we really like about the flexible scheduling part of it is, that it really, as Dave commented earlier, it gives employees that opportunity to find schedules that work for them, which when you have lower turnover, lower hiring costs, that reduces your cost and increase productivity. We've seen, again, the positive employee relations, positive employee feedback and also improved safety results. So, all those things are sort of good reasons to do it, because they help the associate and they benefit the company."

            "name": "Dave Flitman",
            "content": "Thanks Adam. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I am thrilled to be here as the new CEO of US Foods. I joined this great company because of its strong reputation, significant future growth opportunity, strong culture and talented team of 29,000 associates. I look forward to working with our team to build upon our accomplishments from last year in executing our long-range plan. Since I joined in early January, I've spent much of my first month touring our distribution centers in six of our larger markets across the country, listening to customers and associates and diving deep to understand the US Foods business more thoroughly. While on the road, I met some talented and dedicated associates, many of them long-term veterans at US Foods. In Oklahoma City, for example, I met Randy Koller who's been a delivery driver for our company for more than 29 years. Randy expects excellence and teams up to lead our safety backing courses and is a popular driver trainer. He's so good that he's been named a local driver of the year four times. His customers constantly rave about his professionalism and the extra mile with, which he goes to serve them, which I was able to witness firsthand while riding with him on a seven-hour delivery route. Associates like Randy are one of the many reasons I am proud to be part of this great company. I also look forward to meeting many of our investors and analysts soon. I plan to spend my first three months, formulating my views about our strengths and opportunities in further detail, after which I expect to begin sharing more specific thoughts. That said I'm certainly starting to form some early opinions and perspectives at the six-week point. One early and important conclusion I've drawn is that US Foods long-range plan and the pillars within it are broadly the right areas of focus to ensure success. I would expect that any changes I will have in the near-term would be adjustments aimed at accelerating execution versus any wholesale overhaul of the plan. Earnings growth from a combination of margin expansion and profitable volume growth outlined in our long-range plan is a good mix. The team has made great progress this past year. However, much opportunity remains especially in supply chain. I expect that my more than 35 years of experience in distribution businesses across multiple industries will position me very well for the incredible opportunity to lead US Foods and to help build upon and accelerate the tremendous progress the company has made this past year. Let me share some key highlights of that progress on page 4. First our team has been intensely focused on executing the US Foods long-range plan and it is shown in our results each quarter. Throughout 2022, we grew profitable share, further optimized gross margins and improved operational efficiencies. We drove market share gains in each of our target customer types. We expanded gross margins with significant and durable gains in gross profit per case, while managing through a very challenging operating environment where US Foods and the broader industry face supply chain staffing and turnover challenges. While the progress we made against our operating efficiency pillar is somewhat masked by a challenging macro environment, we have advanced critical initiatives in a number of areas which Andrew and Dirk will highlight shortly. Second, we drove continued growth throughout the year, thanks to the great work of our associates. Our fourth quarter results clearly demonstrate strong execution with adjusted EBITDA increasing 34%, attributable to a combination of accelerating year-over-year case growth and continued margin expansion. Our progress in 2022 gives me immense confidence, in our trajectory. Lastly, we remain focused on creating value for shareholders and allocating our capital prudently by continuing to invest in the business, reducing leverage to our target range, returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program and opportunistically pursuing accretive tuck-in acquisitions. Andrew will walk through some of these progress points in more detail. Before I turn the call over to him, I want to thank him for stepping in as Interim CEO last year for his leadership to get the business on a strong trajectory heading into 2023, and for the support he's providing me, as I onboard. A mark of a great company is its ability to deliver on its commitments. Essentially doing what you say you're going to do. US Foods did exactly that in the first year of our long-range plan. We finished 2022 with a strong fourth quarter, building on our achievements in the first three quarters and exceeding the high-end of our adjusted EBITDA guidance, for 2022. My expectation is that we will continue to build upon that momentum, in 2023. With that, let me turn the call over to Andrew to share a bit more, on our progress. Thanks, Dirk. In closing, I couldn't be more excited to be here, and I look forward to significantly building on the progress our team has made against the company's long-range plan. Our strategy is working and we will remain focused on driving profitable share gains expanding gross margins and improving operational efficiencies to accelerate our progress in the year ahead. We are winning. I am proud of the work our associates have done to accomplish the results we achieved in 2022, and expect we will continue to build on that great work in 2023 to serve our customers better and position the company to deliver compounded shareholder value over the long term. With that, Cheryl, please open up the call for questions. Yes. And this is Dave. I'll just piggyback on to what Andrew said. I've had the opportunity to witness that team-based selling approach in several of our markets with our food-fanatic chefs and our restaurant operations consultants. I believe that is a real differentiator for us as Andrew said, and we'll continue to invest in that. Thanks a lot. Sure. And I would just highlight that the team sequentially through the back half of last year continued to gain market share. As we said in our prepared remarks, we have really good momentum. Our team is focused in, particularly in those three customer segments that we spoke about, the independent restaurants, hospitality and healthcare. And I've seen laser focus, as I've visited in the field, really good momentum. I think we have -- and I would just highlight that's profitable volume growth. And I think we have the right focus in those segments. So I think there's tremendous opportunity for organic case growth. To your question around M&A this is still a very highly fragmented industry. And we will through the course of time look opportunistically for tuck-ins that will either give us a continued advantage in certain geographies or perhaps add product or something to our portfolio but we'll be opportunistic about that going forward. But I'm incredibly excited about our ability to continue to grow organically. Yes I appreciate the question. It's early days for me. I'm six weeks in. I've got a good sense of the focus that we have. I think it's in the right areas. I'll tell you 100%. Our team is focused on this and focused on accelerating the results in our business. There's a lot of differences between us and our competitors in terms of the P&L and how that's constructed and all that, but our focus is continuing to expand those margins in a way that makes sense for us and provides the efficiency that we need for our customers. And as excited as I am about the momentum, you also heard me say that there's tremendous upside opportunity in this business everywhere I look, we talked about growth already, productivity and efficiency. We've got good momentum but there's tremendous upside to go and our team is laser-focused on it. I would expect continued expansion of profitability through the course of time. Thank you. Yes. I mean you're right to point that out in the difference. But I'm not really hung up on any particular organization structure. I think ultimately our success comes down to people and having the right processes in place and executing extremely well. Our team is clearly focused on that. Obviously, I'm making assessments on things like people and organization structure and all that sort of stuff and I'll have more to say about that in time. But as I highlighted, I don't expect any wholesale changes. I think we've got the right focus and really good momentum. You start playing around with organization structure, you tend to do a lot of internal navel-gazing and lose a lot of efficiencies and get distracted. I don't sense any need to do that here. We've got great momentum. We're going to continue to build on that. Thank you, Mark. Yes, absolutely, John. I appreciate that. Look, we -- as you've heard on the call, we made a lot of progress in supply chain. But as I highlighted in my comments, I see that as a huge opportunity to continue to drive efficiency and productivity for the company. As I think about excellence in supply chain, we need to have predictable on-time performance at the lowest possible cost and that's clearly, what the company is aimed at driving. We owe that to ourselves, we owe it to our customers and we certainly owe it to our shareholders, to be as efficient as we possibly can be.  And as I think about the work that's going on I guess, I would put it in four kind of key buckets. You've heard a lot about most of that this morning. This pilot that we've had in the Southeast, the seven-day delivery and flexible scheduling, has tremendous potential to help us continue to drive efficiency and reduce turnover across the company. In fact, I'll just give you one little anecdotal story, when I was visiting that market. I had the opportunity to have some town -- not town halls, but little roundtables with drivers and selectors. In the selector roundtable I had, I just started asking them what they thought about the flex scheduling that we had. And we had an 11-year warehouse veteran, has been working days, who opted to take a weekend schedule. And so I said, well, why would you do that? You're one of the more senior folks in the warehouse. He said, \"Look my wife, has a catering business, she needs help during the week and this gives me the chance to lean in and help her and do what we need to do and balance my career and help my wife out on the personal front\". So, I think we are scratching the surface, as something here that will also help our employees and associates as well as drive efficiency for the company. The second one, we've talked about it here is inbound logistics. We still have a lot of opportunity in that area great momentum strong focus in the company. And then, there's really two others, I think in supply chain that will pay dividends long term. One is, process optimization, standardizing our approach being consistent across the company and how we think about anything from onboarding to training warehouse associates, and how we do our work through the course of the evening. Then the final one, I'll point to is some future opportunities in supply chain, not the least of which is -- and you've heard about this the routing software going to a leading platform that will execute throughout the course of this year, will also pay some long-term benefits. So, I think there's some near-term things. There are certainly some long-term opportunities for the company. I'm excited about the momentum, but tremendous upside here on -- Sure. Thank you. Good morning. Thanks, Ed. Yes. Let me take the second part of that question first Ed and then I'll come back to the first part. I haven't said anything about the 2024 target, but that's purely an issue of process and timing for me. I've been spending my time learning the business and digging in and understanding the outlook for this year. I haven't seen anything that gives me reason to believe we're off track for 2024. It's just early days. In fact it's just the opposite. You've heard about my confidence in the momentum in the company. And so back to your first part of your question, for me I like to work with teams to execute, execute well and accelerate momentum. We have so much going on in the company all rightfully aimed at improving the results. If there's one thing, I think, I can help the team do is really focus on the critical view and get them done and do them well and then move on to the next pieces of it. So that's purely what I meant. I'm working closely with the team around that now. Let's work on the needle movers, the right ones as you heard Dirk say that help our business as well as our associates and keep moving ahead. Thanks, Ed. Yes, you're right Lauren. It would be premature for me to really think about those investments. Now I think the company is making the right investments. You heard us talk about the things that we're doing in supply chain most of which requires some level of investment. The excitement we have around the sales team and making the appropriate targeted investments there opening of the CHEF'STORES I think we'll continue on the plan that we've had. And then I'll be assessing here over the next few months what I think it's going to take beyond 2023 into 2024 and beyond. Thank you. And I'll just say, the other thing, I'm excited about is our exclusive brands, and we've been able to penetrate the independent portion of that north of 50%, but I'm excited about our continued momentum there and the team's focus on accelerating that brand penetration. Our customers love it. They're really good, and it makes sense for them as well as the company. No. I see a lot of low-hanging fruit and continuing to execute well and keeping the team focused on the things that matter in moving the needle. Like I said earlier, there might be an opportunity here to help with that focus and accelerate results, but outside of that I'll have more to say through the course of time, if I see other opportunities. Thank you. Good morning. Look I think we have the right capital allocation plan. And in order of priority, we'll invest in the company. We'll pay down debt. We'll return capital to shareholders. And finally, we'll be opportunistic on M&A. We're not going to do M&A for M&A's sake. There's going to be value that we need to create either in geographies or portfolio reasons for that. But as you know I mean this is still a highly fragmented industry with Big three maybe having 35% of the market, still highly fragmented, still opportunities for growth through inorganic acquisitions and we'll be opportunistic on that and do the things that make sense where we've got the right valuation. I think Andrew is just -- it's an important thing to remember. So as Andrew said earlier, we've been -- the ads have been and will continue to be sort of outsized in those markets and more growth opportunity is headcount and adding seller hasn't been and will not be an inhibitor to our growth, but we are continuing to do that where there's the need. Thank you all for joining us today. I'm incredibly excited to be here and the momentum that the company has. I appreciate your time. We'll talk to you all soon. Take care."

            "name": "Andrew Iacobucci",
            "content": "Thanks Dave. And let me say how terrific it is to have Dave on board. My colleagues on the executive leadership team and I, look forward to working with him, as we continue to build on our strong results in 2022. Now, turning to page 5, I'll walk through our fourth quarter highlights. We delivered strong financial results again this quarter, capping off the year with strong market share growth and margin expansion and in-turn significant earnings growth in a challenging macro environment. Net sales for the fourth quarter grew 11%, compared to the same period in 2021. Year-over-year volume growth strengthened from Q3 to Q4, which we see as a positive for US Foods and our customers as their recovery continues. Adjusted EBITDA grew 34% for the quarter representing an, acceleration from our Q3 growth rate despite essentially zero sequential inflation in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA margins also increased 70 basis points from the prior year, as we gained further operating leverage. I cannot thank our associates enough, for their incredible work to drive progress against our long-range plan. A year ago we set out to deliver $1.3 billion in adjusted EBITDA in 2022 and we exceeded the high-end of our guidance, thanks to their dedication. Turning to our customer experience, we continue to gain share in target customer types via our differentiation strategy and customer focus. We further leveraged our omnichannel capabilities for profitable growth by CHEF'STORE, Pronto and US Foods Direct in addition, to continuing to strengthen our core digital customer platform by expanding customer usage of MOXe\u0304. We also made progress on our supply chain operations in the fourth quarter. The positive trends we saw in Q3 turnover continued in Q4, with driver turnover nearing pre-COVID levels and warehouse turnover showing sustained improvement. We aren't yet where we want to be, but we are encouraged by the continued progress and strong evidence that the actions we are taking are yielding results. As mentioned on our Q3 call we piloted flexible employee scheduling and seven-day delivery in one of our key markets. The results to-date have exceeded our expectations with significant reductions in turnover, positive employee feedback and improved safety results. We are continuing the pilot at that location and are adding two additional locations in Q1. Assuming we replicate these outcomes in these additional markets, we expect to significantly expand the flexible scheduling portion of this initiative in 2023. As we have done in the past few quarters, we continue to strengthen our inbound logistics capabilities, resulting in further improved financial results and third-party partner collaboration. This work is well ahead of plan and a significant contributor to our strong results in 2022. We continue to improve our capital structure and prudently allocate capital during the fourth quarter. Each of these actions reinforce our commitment to being responsible stewards of shareholder value, which Dirk will discuss in more detail shortly. Turning to page six, we are pleased with the significant progress we have made against all three pillars of our long-range plan. Starting with our first pillar, profitable market share growth. We exceeded our volume goals relative to the market for the full year 2022. In fact, we outperformed the market by nearly 150 basis points as our restaurant volumes, excluding our targeted exits, increased by approximately 1%, while the latest survey from our third-party provider showed a market decline of roughly 0.5%. Specifically within restaurants, our independent case growth was 4.3%, while the third-party estimates that the market declined by 1.2%. Our focus on growing with the right customers is yielding sizable benefits by allowing us to serve those customers more effectively and create longer-term relationships. This focus on our target customer types grows EBITDA dollars and expands our margins. We opened six CHEF'STORES in 2022 and are working to increase the number of openings to at least eight in 2023, which means we will have a robust network of nearly 100 CHEF'STORES by the end of the year. We are quite pleased with our market share gains in 2022 and expect further share gains in 2023 as we leverage our differentiated sales support strategy our industry-leading MOXe\u0304 platform and our omnichannel options, as well as other sales growth initiatives. Moving to the margin optimization pillar, we implemented a number of initiatives to improve gross profit per case regardless of market conditions. Those achieved excellent results in 2022. Our three key focus areas are the same I talked about last quarter and have been significant contributors to our results on the year. First, our team very effectively managed significant inflation earlier in the year and some commodity deflation later in the year through our established pricing and procurement processes. We also optimized margins with a number of customers to better reflect the increasingly challenging cost environment facing our industry. Second, we achieved our stretch goal of collaborating with vendors representing approximately 40% of our spend to improve our cost of goods and anticipate an additional 20% of spend to be addressed in 2023. And third, our inbound logistics team focused intensively all year on working with vendors to ensure improved process and economics aligned with the market. We also achieved $70 million of total synergies in 2022 related to our Food Group acquisition, which is above our previously stated $65 million target. These initiatives along with a number of others together delivered the strong gross profit per case we saw in 2022 and we expect to build further on that performance in 2023. We made progress on operational efficiencies despite a very challenging macro environment. Our routing optimization resulted in significant miles reduction and drove cases per mile well above 2019 levels, despite case volume being lower than 2019. Our work on retention and employee engagement also yielded benefits as we saw continued improvement in turnover and consequently productivity in the second half. We further improved productivity through a combination of network-wide initiatives and targeted optimization efforts in select markets with the greatest opportunities. US Foods is advancing critical initiatives that drive our long-range plan and we'll execute against all three pillars with a goal of further enhancing the customer experience and our operational foundation as well as continuing to build on our progress into 2023 and beyond. We've made significant progress throughout 2022. And while we are pleased with our progress, it's important to acknowledge that much opportunity remains here and we expect to build on our second half momentum in 2023. Now, I'd like to hand it over to Dirk to go over our financial performance in more detail. Yeah. A couple of things on that, John. On the sales front, we absolutely plan to continue to expand our sales force. They are an incredibly important part of the relationship with the customer. We will really be focusing on areas of particularly strong growth as opportunities to perhaps even double down on that expansion. But I should also mention, one of the things that we've been very happy with was the way in which we've been able to leverage team-based selling and those -- the specialists of rocks food-fanatic chefs that are present in every market have been an important part of our growth trajectory and we will continue to both leverage those and expand those as appropriate. Thanks, Jeff. Yes. Thanks for the question Mark. It's Andrew. I think we were pretty much in line with what we expected the quarter played out pretty much exactly as we had anticipated with continued momentum, particularly in independent restaurants. We saw a little bit of bumpiness in terms of the way the holidays fell this past year. But other than that I wouldn't say there was anything there that was of any concern. And indeed, we've continued to see really strong momentum coming into the New Year, where we're at or slightly above our forecast in January. So we really feel good about the stability of that. We've been paying very close attention obviously to that case line to just look for signs of softness. And so far we've really not seen that. Yes. Thanks for the question, Alex. It's Andrew. We feel very good about CHEF'STORE's progress, as we've continued to integrate. The acquisition system integration is basically nearing completion now which will really put us in a great position to drive the growth of that part of our business. In terms of new store openings and how they've sort of played out in terms of our model of driving that top line synergy between broadline and the stores, they're playing out exactly as we had anticipated. We have a great team in place that is busily working through a way to significantly accelerate our rate of store builds. And they've also made some really good progress around time to break even in those new store openings both of which will stand us in very good stead as we look to roll those out more quickly across the business. So generally, I think we're feeling quite good about delivering the synergies that we had planned to, and also feeling good about the continued rollout as we talked about this year, trying to accelerate from six last year to eight or even more this year. Yes. And just to piggyback on that I think and Dirk has said this a couple of times we are 100% focused on the things that we can control and regardless of the macro, I have a lot of confidence we will continue to take share in those targeted segments just like we did last year. Thanks, Lauren. Thanks Jake, it's Andrew. Yeah. So I think as we talked about last quarter as well, we're very pleased with the balance in our I&D growth. We're seeing a good mix of driving new account acquisitions, as well as focusing on penetrating those new accounts. And that's really been part of a sort of a systematic approach we've been taking at a market level to focus -- concentrate on the menu types that are seeing the greatest growth to target those in a very focused way. And then once on boarded, we spent a great deal of energy looking for opportunities to expand our share of wallet with those customers. So, both are important and both, I would say, will continue. As far as what we're seeing within our customers themselves, as I mentioned in my remarks, we are seeing good recovery in those customers for the most part. And that's something that again, we pay very close attention to, because it typically will be an early sign of a potential looming slowdown. And as I said previously, we really have not seen any sign of that at this point. Yes. Pete, thanks for the question. It's Andrew. We've actually -- we've learned a couple of different things from the pilot, which actually had both elements to a seven-day delivery and a flexible scheduling. And what we've learned along the way is the flexible scheduling is something we can do quite quickly pretty much everywhere that it will be a benefit. In other words, it does -- you don't need to go to seven days in order to be able to get a large measure of the benefits from a flexible scheduling. Just given that choice that it gives our selectors and the impact that has on their willingness to stay with us. Seven day delivery takes a little more work to shift deliveries onto the weekend. That has played out in a very promising way in the pilot market, and we are looking to see that replicated in the two additional markets that we're testing as we speak. And depending on how that plays out, we will look to do that in markets, where that will deliver meaningful benefit, particularly ones where capacity might be a little more constrained because those extra two days that it gives those markets, takes a great deal of pressure off their ability to serve customers. So, both are being looked at in combination or separately as the case may be, and we see a real opportunity this year to roll out the flex scheduling portion to a significant number of our markets and likely be more selective with seven-day delivery elsewhere. Yeah. Thanks for the question. Yeah, Andrew. I think the way we're thinking about this is we will be targeting to be at or slightly above 2019 levels by the end of the year. And we will be as I say doubling down in markets with particular growth opportunities in doing so. So we are still very much in hiring mode and will continue to be so. And in terms of where talent is coming from, the mix hasn't changed dramatically. We typically look for people with a culinary background as well as folks that have worked in our industry. And that mix if anything is probably tilted a little bit more toward sourcing from people with industry experience. Of late, we've been having we think quite good success attracting really high-quality sales reps from our competition, and we think that's something that is really standing us in good stead, particularly in those markets with big growth opportunities."

Thank you for your interest in US Foods, and I will now turn over the call to Andrew.\nAndrew Iacobucci: Thanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. First and foremost, I'm delighted to report that we delivered strong third quarter results, reflecting continued execution of our long-range plan. US Foods performance to date underscores our confidence in achieving our 2022 outlook. We remain committed to continuing the momentum from the first three quarters and driving our long-range plan. Let's turn to Page 3 for key takeaways from the quarter. First, our results this quarter demonstrate continued solid execution across the three pillars of our long-range plan. Our associates are a critical part of this progress, and I am grateful to them for their focus on execution and on serving our customers. In addition to strong day-to-day execution, US Foods associates have continued their tradition of stepping up when our customers and communities need us most. Most recently, during Hurricane Ian, which severely impacted many of our customers on the East Coast, our teams worked tirelessly to ensure our customers and the relief agencies we support could operate effectively and properly serve their customers. Based on feedback we received, our storm preparation and response are best-in-class in our industry. This intense focus on delivering for our customers is a large part of why we've been able to capture market share with key customer types in all three quarters of 2022. Second, with strong momentum in our plan, US Foods is increasingly well positioned to win in an evolving macro environment, particularly in light of our effective management of inflation and deflation, our scale and customer diversity and continued recovery tailwinds. Our results reinforce our confidence to deliver a strong finish to the year. Finally, we expect to drive meaningful value creation for shareholders through a new share repurchase program announced this morning. We are committed to utilizing U.S. Foods strong cash flow to deliver long-term shareholder value. Turning to Page 4. I'll start by walking through our third quarter highlights. Starting off, we once again delivered strong financial results. Net sales for the quarter grew 13% year-over-year, volume growth strengthened as the quarter progressed, which we see as positive for both our business and for our customers. Adjusted EBITDA grew nearly 21% for the quarter, an acceleration from our Q2 growth rate. Our adjusted EBITDA margins also increased 20 basis points from the prior year as we gained operating leverage. Finally, we have updated our 2022 guidance toward the top end of our prior adjusted EBITDA outlook range. Our results show the resiliency in our business and the ability of our team to deliver on the plan we put forth earlier this year. Turning to our customer experience. We launched MOX\u0113, our next-generation industry-leading digital tool and we continue to drive market share gains with key customer types, which we expect to continue as we further embed share data into our operating processes. Finally, we further expanded our omnichannel with two new chef stores, which opened in Q3 and early Q4. This brings us to four stores open to date with an expectation of two more openings before the end of 2022. We also continue to expand our Pronto service, a delivery service focused on smaller customers in concentrated geographies and are active with that program in nearly 30 markets. Next, we are pleased with our continued progress on supply chain. We completed our warehouse selection technology deployment as planned. This system enables a better associate experience, improved selection accuracy and ultimately, a better customer experience. I talked last quarter about the various actions we are taking to improve employee retention, and I'm happy to report that we are seeing progress. Both driver and warehouse turnover have improved from what we experienced in H1. We are not yet where we want to be, and we remain laser-focused on improving retention by simplifying our core processes, strengthening leadership engagement and offering greater flexibility with respect to shift schedules. Early returns from our seven-day work week pilot in the Southeast have been promising, and the flexibility it offers proved very helpful before and after Hurricane Ian. Finally, we continue to make progress on inbound logistics, resulting in further improved financial results and third-party partner collaboration. This work is well ahead of plan for the year. Lastly, we've been intentional in managing our capital structure and have reduced our leverage to 3.7x as of the end of Q3 2022. During Q3, we prepaid $100 million on our 2021 term loan, in October prepaid another $100 million on our 2019 term loan. We were also very pleased to have announced earlier today that our Board of Directors has approved a $500 million share repurchase program, a significant step in further demonstrating the strength of our capital structure, confidence in our future and focus on shareholder value creation. We see this move as highly accretive to shareholder value at our current share price and is further evidence of our commitment to being responsible stewards of shareholder capital. With that, let's turn to Page 5 and discuss how our performance in the quarter translates into progress on the three pillars of the long-range plan to drive profitable share gains, expand margins and improve operational efficiencies. Looking at our first pillar, we are tracking to exceed our targeted restaurant growth rate of 1.5x the market. We are also continuing to win in the marketplace, as demonstrated by our share gains in key customer types of independence, health care and hospitality. The MOX\u0113 launch I mentioned earlier is a significant milestone. MOX\u0113 is a step change to the customer experience from a performance and ease-of-use perspective. We have been focused on ensuring increased customer speed, confidence and control. Our new one-stop shop app is 30% faster than it was before and is similar to the user experience of leading retail apps. Customer and seller feedback has been very positive and we expect this to extend our technology lead in the industry. As mentioned earlier, we expect to open six new Chef stores in 2022, which is the high end of the range we previously communicated. As we open stores, we are building our capabilities to accelerate that pace in 2023. Let's move on to the margin optimization pillar. As a reminder, we've been working on a number of internal initiatives to improve gross profit per case that are independent of market conditions. For example, we continue to build on the momentum from inbound logistics as our process management initiatives program continues to drive efficiencies. We effectively managed inflation and deflation by running our proven plays. In the third quarter, we saw less sequential inflation than we experienced in the first half of the year, and yet our gross margins remained strong and in line with the first half of the year. Our cost of goods management program is also performing well and continues ahead of schedule with approximately 40% of our total vendor spend expected to be addressed by year-end. Turning last to operational efficiencies. We are making progress despite the challenging macro environment. Our routing optimization and network planning work continued, and our cases per mile improved further ahead of 2019 in the third quarter to the best results we've seen to date. We are pleased with the progress, yet remain focused on the benefits still to come from this work and from the routing system replacement in a future phase. The work we are doing on employee engagement, flexible schedules and process standardization, for example, is yielding benefits as we experienced a lower turnover in the third quarter than we saw in the second quarter. We tackled productivity through a combination of network-wide initiatives and targeted optimization efforts in select markets with the greatest productivity opportunities. Turning next to Page 6. We've made significant progress over the last three quarters and expect to build on that progress to achieve our plan. The entire US Foods organization is focused on these initiatives and the actions that drive our long-range plan and we are relentlessly executing against all three pillars. As a result, we are enhancing the customer experience and our operational foundation, leading to share gains and significant year-over-year profitability improvements. We are a resilient business serving many customer types. Given our U.S. focus, our operations are less volatile than others. This positions us well to win even in a challenging macro environment and further strengthens our belief in the rightness and the achievability of our long-range plan. As we continue to build momentum against this plan, we will prudently allocate the strong and growing cash flow against our four priorities to create shareholder value. In summary, I am proud of and energized by our progress this year, and I am confident we will build on this momentum to deliver a strong 2022 and set us up for a strong 2023. With that, I will hand it over to Dirk to do a deeper dive into our financial results. Dirk, over to you.\nDirk Locascio: Thanks, Andrew, and good morning. I will start on Page 8. We're very pleased with what we accomplished this quarter. We continue to build on our momentum from the last two quarters and demonstrated progress against our long-range plan. Adjusted EBITDA grew 21% from the prior year to $351 million for the quarter, which is an acceleration from our Q2 growth rate. In addition to strong EBITDA dollars, our adjusted EBITDA per case remained strong and was in line with Q3 2019. The Q3 adjusted EBITDA was the best quarter relative to 2019 since prior to the start of the pandemic. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 25% over the prior year third quarter to $0.60. These highlights demonstrate the actions we are taking to grow and further strengthen our business are delivering meaningful results. Net sales were $8.9 billion in Q3, an increase of 13% over the prior year. Total case volume increased 1% from the prior year and food cost inflation was 12%. Similar to last quarter, our Q3 year-over-year case growth was negatively impacted approximately 200 basis points by the planned mid-2021 exit of the grocery retail business we temporarily added during the pandemic and a small number of strategic exits. Independent case growth increased 3% over the prior year. We continued our trend of strong gross profit dollar growth again this quarter. Our adjusted gross profit dollars increased 15% from the prior year. And as a result, we generated strong adjusted gross profit per case. This is important because we experienced little sequential inflation compared to large amounts in the first half of the year, yet we're able to maintain similar gross profit per case. OpEx remains elevated, however, as the quarter progressed, we saw positive signs with improved operations turnover and productivity rates. Let's look at volume further on Page 9. Independent cases increased 3% on top of nearly 25% growth in the prior year. Hospitality grew 20% and health care grew 3%, offset by approximately 7% lower chain volume and the retail exit impact I noted previously. Our chain decline was driven this quarter largely by the strategic exit of a small number of lower profitability and more complex customers, consistent with what we talked about in Q2. Case growth across almost all customer types finished the quarter with stronger growth rates than they started and above the quarter's overall case growth for each type. This was very positive, and we expect volume to improve further in Q4. We delivered share gains in key customer types again this quarter. I will focus briefly on growth relative to 2019, the last full-year prior to the outside of the pandemic. Q3 total case growth was about 6.5% below 2019 with IND cases or independent cases performing the strongest at 3.3% above Q3 2019. We ended the quarter with strong momentum as our exit rates were above Q3 growth rates for most customer types. We still have embedded COVID recovery gains regardless of the macro backdrop. As health care cases were about 6% below Q3 2019 and hospitality was approximately 14% below 2019, while showing improvement from Q2 results. We are optimistic about our positive volume trends in September and October as they show continued strength and improvement. Turning to Page 10. We are updating our fiscal 2022 guidance provided previously. We expect to exceed our volume goal relative to the market. Technomic's latest outlook for 2022 calls for restaurants to be negative compared to 2021, while we expect to be positive, even with a small number of strategic [indiscernible] previously discussed. Within restaurants overall, our independent growth remains positive and is expected to improve further, while the Technomic outlook for the year is negative. We also are on track to exceed their outlook for health care and be in line for hospitality. As full-service lodging, an area that has been lagging in recovery accelerates, we expect to further improve hospitality relative to the industry. Moving to earnings. We are tightening our adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $1.28 billion to $1.3 billion. This reflects our significantly increased confidence in achieving the high end of our previously provided range, as a result, the three quarters of strong execution against the three pillars of our long-range plan. We're also tightening our adjusted diluted EPS range to $2.10 to $2.20 to align with the updated adjusted EBITDA range. Interest expense is expected to be $250 million to $255 million and cash CapEx is expected to be $270 million to $280 million. Total CapEx, including cash and financing leases for fleet are expected to be approximately $400 million. Finally, we continue to expect net leverage to be approximately 3.5x at year-end. Looking at Page 11. We made further progress again this quarter in strengthening our capital structure and reducing leverage. We reduced our net leverage compared to both Q3 2021 and Q2 2022. Our net leverage ratio was 3.7x at the end of the third quarter, which is a 1.1 turn reduction from a year ago and a 0.5 turn reduction from Q2 of this year. We reduced gross debt approximately $450 million compared to Q3 2021 and during Q3 2022 prepaid $100 million of term loan. And finally to date, in Q4, we have prepaid an additional $100 million of term loan. Leverage reduction is one of the focus areas of our capital allocation strategy. We continue to make strong progress toward our goal of 2.5x to 3x net leverage, and we expect to achieve net leverage range in fiscal 2023. I am quite pleased with the progress we continue to make in further strengthening our capital structure and delivering on our priority to reduce leverage. Turning to Page 12. US Foods has strong cash flow, and we're using to fuel our stated priorities. We will continue to invest in the business for growth with roughly $400 million in capital invested in 2022. And against technologies such as MOX\u0113 and warehouse selection, facilities such as our new distribution center in New Orleans and our most environmentally sustainable distribution center in Sacramento, New Chef stores and fleet. We have made significant progress in reducing our leverage and expect to achieve our target range of 2.5x to 3x in 2023. We are doing this by using our strong cash flow to reduce debt and growing earnings. Finally, we are very pleased to announce the $500 million share repurchase program. This is a significant step as we have demonstrated meaningful leverage reduction and focus on a balance of further leverage reduction and return of capital to shareholders. We expect to begin some opportunistic repurchases in the fourth quarter. It refunds strength in our balance sheet, the resiliency of our business, our strong cash flow generation and the tremendous value we see in our shares. In 2023, we expect to continue reducing leverage and opportunistically repurchasing shares in parallel. These actions and outcomes demonstrate our commitment to a strong capital structure and activities that create shareholder value. We expect to end the year in our target leverage range, inclusive of any capital we may return to shareholders. Just to sum it up, I am pleased with our progress this year, and I'm confident in our ability to deliver our 2022 outlook. With that, I'll pass it back to Andrew.\nAndrew Iacobucci: Thanks, Dirk. In closing, we continue to be laser-focused on driving profitable share gains, expanding gross margins and building on our strong operational and financial momentum. I'm confident in the growing strength of our business, thanks to the initiatives we have underway and the hard work of our talented team as they continue to focus on serving our customers and executing our long-range plan with excellence. To put it succinctly, we are winning, and I am proud of our progress. With that, operator, please open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jake Bartlett from Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nJake Bartlett: Great, thanks for taking the question. My first is on independent case growth. And it's nice to see an acceleration there. I'm wondering if you could provide detail on what's driving the acceleration? How traffic is going for the customers, whether that's been a drag or a plus and whether the acceleration is driven by -- more by wallet share gains or new account generation? Then I have a follow-up, please.\nAndrew Iacobucci: Hi, Jake, it's Andrew. Thanks for the question. Yes, we're actually quite pleased with the balance that we're seeing in that growth. It is actually a combination of both share of wallet gains as well as new business. And I will also say, we've also seen a reasonable strengthening of our own customer demand, suggesting that they too are growing as well. So it's sort of a combination across all three of expanding share of wallet, driving new customers -- growth through new customers as well as our customers themselves seeing growth in their business.\nJake Bartlett: Great. And then I had a question on versus '19, the case growth versus '19. It looks like in most segments, other than the hospitality and health care, there was a slight deceleration in the third quarter versus the second. So I just was hoping if you could comment on kind of what drove that? Whether your share gains were similar in the third quarter versus the second? And just any commentary on what -- why those decelerate just slightly?\nDirk Locascio: Sure. Good morning, Jake, this is Dirk. Good question. So overall, I think we're pleased. What we saw was the beginning of the third quarter had a little bit of -- just like you saw sort of broadly across there, had a slower start just with some -- a little bit slower demand broadly. We've seen that continue to improve as the quarter has gone on. Hence, what Andrew and I have talked about, just the confidence in which we exited the quarter and entered the fourth quarter, I feel good about the trajectory of the case growth. I think the important thing is we do continue to see share gains across our key customer types. And we think just with health care and hospitality also, those are continuing to improve relative to 2019 and expect that to continue as well and is really a built-in tailwind. So I feel the position is well -- we are well positioned to grow with the right key customer types, as we've talked a lot about -- for us, it's about profitably growing with the right customer types as opposed to growth just for the sake of growth. So feel good about the quarter and where we ended the fourth quarter.\nAndrew Iacobucci: Yes. And Jake, just to add to your question, we saw share gains that were quite consistent in trajectory to what we saw in Q2.\nJake Bartlett: Great, I appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nicole Miller from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nNicole Miller: Thank you so much. A couple of quick ones. Can you talk a little bit about your fill rates, both inbound and outbound and then any backhaul opportunity, I do believe that's quite -- it's a fairly material opportunity for you.\nAndrew Iacobucci: Yes. Thanks, Nicole. It's Andrew. Appreciate the question. So we would say our outbound fill rates, our fill rates to our customers continue to improve. The inbound though has been fairly flat versus where it was in Q2, a little bit of improvement in some key categories. But generally speaking, still fairly flat, and we continue to basically manage that through two main means. One is to diversify our supplier base to make sure we've got alternatives when our primaries aren't in stock and secondly, to build up a little bit of extra safety stock to ensure that we have products in key categories. As far as the backhaul opportunity, that is something that we have been actively pursuing for quite some time. And you'll see -- you've seen from our freight results or logistics income results that those efforts are really paying off. I think we still got some opportunity to continue to go after that, and that's something that, that team is very focused on.\nNicole Miller: And remind us the inbound, like I've asked this question, I guess, of late, had the opportunity to. It's trying to understand the domino effect there. Is that something on the manufacturer side with their or their own inventory, their own capacity, like what's the problem today?\nAndrew Iacobucci: I think it's all of the above continued challenges. The only thing I'd add to that list is continued challenges as raw material supply in some of our categories. The system has still got some challenges that it's working through. We're definitely starting to see some improvements. And even though our fill rates in absolute terms haven't improved as much as we would like, our de facto fill rates have improved because of the diversification of supplier base. So we are still getting the product, which is not getting it from the usual sources in all cases.\nNicole Miller: And then thinking back to prior recessions or really any period of macro consumer weakness that you could speak to. Did US Foods, I guess, sales, right, I guess it would be organic go up or down. And more importantly, in terms of your share when you think back to those types of prior periods. Did you take care from bigger and smaller peers? Or did you see share to smaller or bigger peers?\nDirk Locascio: Good morning, Nicole. This is Dirk. That's a good question. So overall, our industry and our business has shown itself to be quite resilient. If you look at what was a very tough recession in 2008, 2009, cases were down mid-single digits, earnings were relatively flat. If you look at other though, outside of 2008, 2009, the last three or four inflation-induced recessions, you saw much less volume decline. So it's a very, very small impact. I think that's a demonstration of the resiliency of our business. One of the things that I think if you look back even in '08, '09 and prior, we were a very different company. A lot of the work around differentiation that we've done has been since then. And so we would expect that all the same things that are resonating today for us to take share across these key customer types to continue to resonate. And in fact, I think that positions us even better to weather any kind of a challenge that comes than we were in the past. So I think we're well positioned and even though we can't control the macro, we can't control the execution of our long-range plan and the initiatives to drive that, and that's what we're going to focus on.\nNicole Miller: And last question, please. How does less inflation disinflation impact the top and bottom line? And what is the lag until you see that impact versus the market movement in the underlying commodity items? Thank you.\nDirk Locascio: Sure. So overall, what we see is -- the lag is relatively short. So again, most of our contracts or noncontract price that tends to be, call it, within a month, it can be from a week to a month or so. I think -- so pretty quick. The positive thing is in the third quarter, so we saw the least amount of sequential inflation that we've seen since, I think, at the beginning of 2021 and very small amounts relative to the first half of the year, yet our gross profit per case remained quite strong. And I think that demonstrates the resiliency of the business. And within that sequential inflation in Q3, we actually saw many center of the plates or protein categories that saw some deflation. And our processes that Andrew made reference to earlier and the playbooks that we have, we manage through that quite effectively. And those are the categories actually that we think are more likely to show the deflation. And almost all those categories tend to be a fixed markup over whatever our cost is. So therefore, over time, not really impacting our overall profitability. So quite pleased with the progress, quite pleased with our management through it and where we're positioned from an inflationary and deflationary environment.\nNicole Miller: Thank you very much.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim. Your line is open.\nJohn Heinbockel: On to start independent cases, right? So I think you've said you've seen improvement thus far in the fourth quarter. Any quantification of that, right? I'd imagine it's fairly modest, but maybe that's wrong. And is that coming from a number of accounts were drop size. And then lastly, just on that topic, right? If the market grew slower, do you think you can flex up the 1.5 to maintain the current level of growth or the market would impact your ability to grow?\nAndrew Iacobucci: So John, thanks for the question. Yes, we would say a meaningfully better exit rate than we saw overall in the quarter. And that would be driven by a combination of the factors you mentioned, as I said in the earlier question from Jake, we're pretty happy with the balance that we're seeing in the way we're driving IND growth.\nDirk Locascio: Yes. I was just going to say on the second part of the ability to outgrow what we think is in the environment, it's hard to know exactly where we shake out if you see a slowdown, but I think what we would expect is we would expect to outgrow period. And I think the thing that would be a factor that would potentially enable us to even outgrow further would be our differentiation and the offerings that we have to customers to help them succeed is something that helps them through difficult environments. And we've seen that in the way we help customers manage their way through with the PPP loans, how to get them, how to use them effectively as well as how we're helping them manage through inflation in their businesses. So I think if anything, we're probably better positioned, but the work that we're doing, we think is -- will allow us to continue to take share.\nAndrew Iacobucci: And John, just to add to that, I think one of the things we've learned most through COVID really is the ability to be nimble and agile and redeploy resources where the growth is. And I think that's been a pretty significant contributor to what has really been very steady sequential market share gains period-over-period over the course of the entire first three quarters of the year.\nJohn Heinbockel: And then maybe the second one, Dirk, usually give a little bit of an update right on staffing selectors and drivers, right? So where do we stand on that? And then I'm curious, on a go-forward normalized basis, right? Do you think labor hours -- how much below case growth can labor hours be with the benefit of productivity, right? And I assume would you expect hourly wage rate, right? Will that grow mid-single digit or there's an opportunity to bring that in lower than that?\nAndrew Iacobucci: Yes. John, why don't I start and then maybe Dirk can talk a little bit about what we're seeing on the rate side. As far as our staffing situation, we feel very good. We're in a very solid position in the vast majority of our markets. As I mentioned in my remarks, we saw turnover take a pretty meaningful reduction over the course of the third quarter. And that was a combination, primarily, I think driven by some of the initiatives we've taken to better engage our workforce and create a culture that they want to be part of. Those are really starting to show some real impacts. But we've also undoubtedly had a little bit of help from the macro environment as well. So I would say, right now, I feel pretty good about the staffing situation. I'll maybe start on the second part of the question. What we've seen primarily as we get to a better place is, obviously, that has an almost immediate impact on our productivity, and that is starting to show up in our business. The other thing we've also seen is there's a lot more straight time in our facilities much less need for over time, which is probably the first impact that we're likely going to see more than necessarily overall hours reduction in the short term.\nDirk Locascio: John, I think to get back to the point on what we look at costs going forward. So I do think we can get back to an environment where costs grow in line to less than cases. I think that the part that's a little harder to know exactly is at what pace that happens, just knowing that so much of it is driven by the turnover and the retention factor. And as Andrew said, we're pleased with the early signs we're seeing there, and we know we're not where we want to be, but we're going to continue to be focused on improving that. I think from overall wage inflation perspective, as we see and as we look ahead, that does appear to be coming back, call it, closer to historical levels of inflation. It's hard to know depending on what happens with the macro exactly where it settles. But I think the important takeaway there is it doesn't appear as though last year's level of outsized increases appear to be the new norm. But as you would expect, we're watching and managing that quite closely.\nJohn Heinbockel: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nEdward Kelly: Hi, good morning guys. I just wanted to zero in on a couple of things that have been sort of asked already. But in terms of gross profit per case, I think, Dirk, you pretty intentionally highlight the fact that inflation is decelerating yet cost or gross profit per case has been very strong and even this quarter, it looks like it's accelerated. I guess I'm trying to figure out, are you implying that the current level is sustainable. And then as we think about going forward into next year with the continued benefit of mix, is that a line item that you could even grow from here? Just kind of curious as to how you're thinking about gross profit per case off of this level.\nDirk Locascio: Sure. Thanks, Ed. Good question. You're right, that was very intentional in highlighting that. And I think really what we're just trying to make sure is clear to people is the durability that we think is there in our gross profit per case. And in the environment where you see it in center of the plate deflation, which is where we think more of the potential of deflation is more likely than in grocery. And we're managing through it. So to your point, we do think as we look ahead, we think we can continue to have strong growing gross profit. And that really is underscored by the points that both Andrew and I made of the majority -- vast majority of our gross profit gains are coming from the things we're doing in our four walls as part of our plan as opposed to deflation or inflation and the pieces of inflation that are helped, especially on the parts of the business that are a percentage markup, we think are sticky. So overall, feel like we're very well positioned, very happy with the progress we made this quarter and look forward to continuing that into 2023. In fact, it's a good example. As we think of 2022 and even when we look ahead to 2023. So much of the work that we've done on our initiatives this year across the spectrum of the pillars, we think position us very well and will drive a lot of the earnings growth as we get into 2023.\nEdward Kelly: Great. And then just a quick follow-up on where you stand in terms of customer exits. I know you know it sort of retail and then some other miscellaneous exits. But are you now at the point where you're really focused on more of sort of like the net case growth going forward, meaning a lot of the exits are behind you?\nDirk Locascio: Sure. So I think that out of the 200 basis points that we talked about this quarter, a little under half of it was the grocery piece, retail that is fully lapped by the end of the first -- by the end of the third quarter. The other piece that's changed will continue through Q1. What I would say is our focus has been and continues to be around growing with the right customers. So it's about growing profitably as opposed to just case growth. I think when you look at any business, looking across and having sort of some level of, I'll call it, hygiene and what's the right mix and replacing customers the better customers is part of what we and you would expect, I would think others to do as we go through there. So overall, it is about growing the business, but it really is about growing the business with those more profitable customers. And hopefully, what you see this quarter is with 21% EBITDA growth that we are well positioned as we think to exit 2023 -- sorry, 2022 and end of 2023.\nEdward Kelly: Awesome, thank you.\nDirk Locascio: Thanks, Ed.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Silberman from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nLauren Silberman: Thank you very much. As I want to start with the announcement of the share repurchase program, which I think is the first -- can you talk about how your capital allocation priorities change and just those priorities and where buybacks fit in relative to reducing debt? Thank you.\nDirk Locascio: Sure. Good morning, Lauren. Good question. So this is exciting for us to be in a position to talk about this. And I think it's really been Andrew used the word intentional. We've been very intentional in the way we manage our capital structure. And so really, what this does is it fits right into one of the four priorities that we've talked a lot about. And what we've said regularly is we don't need to get all the way to the 3x high end of the range in order to begin this. But what I will be clear about though is that we remain committed to reducing leverage to getting in that range. And we think that going forward, this sort of the repurchase is an opportunistic way to, again, create shareholder value, especially with our shares at the levels they're at. But secondly, that we would expect in parallel to further reduce debt and we'll grow earnings as well as repurchase shares. And think that we will be -- expect to be in that range of 2.5x to 3x by the end of next year, inclusive of any capital that we return. So this really is about just because of the strengthening of the capital structure, the maturity as part of our whole priority and plan that we've been managing to, it is just the next step in that journey and very pleased with our ability to announce that today.\nLauren Silberman: Great. Thanks. And just on the gross profit side, can you talk about what you're seeing with private label? And in more challenging environment, would you expect to see an increase in the level of penetration? And I guess just going forward, the most meaningful initiatives or opportunities you see to get that level even higher.\nAndrew Iacobucci: Yes, hi Lauren, it's Andrew. Thanks for the question. Yes, we absolutely have seen throughout a great opportunity to improve our penetration. One of the challenges, of course, has been supply. Most of our arrangements are with a limited number of suppliers from pre-COVID times, and we've had to significantly change our thinking around that to have alternatives in place. And we've done a really good job of doing that. We're in a very, very good spot now from a fairly stable supply foundation to really aggressively go after those increases. We've seen a natural improvement as customers tend to seek out the value that the control brand represents. And we expect that to accelerate as we get into a much better supply situation. So yes, I definitely expect to see that penetration level go up over the next several quarters.\nLauren Silberman: And just the last one. On the gross profit per case, how much of your business is on a percentage markup versus a dollar markup to the extent you're willing to provide that?\nDirk Locascio: Sure. As a straight percentage, it's about half of the business, and then the other half is a combination of either a fixed markup and/or kind of more spot pricing on noncontract type of business.\nLauren Silberman: Perfect, thank you.\nDirk Locascio: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is open.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. A couple of questions. The first one just on the food service chain business. You mentioned the decline in that business relative to independent growth. Just trying to get a sense, you mentioned a big portion of that is intentional exits of certain business. What we've heard from others that maybe there's an actual slowdown in the actual chain business. So just trying to get a sense for the balance between what you consciously exited versus what perhaps is the business slowing down and maybe the outlook you see for that going into '23?\nDirk Locascio: Sure. If we compare the decline that we're seeing are still the amount below 2019 levels. Almost all of that is the combination of these exits that we've talked about as well as the two concepts that we've talked about that have more meaningful reductions in same-store sales. Absent those two things, our chain business is relatively in line with where it was 2019. I think to your point, Jeff. So we're watching it closely. You do see across the different chains. You see some that continue to perform very well. You see others that don't perform as well. We'll continue to watch to see if you see any kind of a sort of more discernible slowdown. But again, those are typically on the lower end of the margin spectrum. And we think that even chains that we have on board and growing are well positioned in the environment that we're in. So our key is going to continue to be with growing with those key customer types and then being very opportunistic in the all other.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Understood. And then you mentioned on the commodity inflation side, I think you were implying you'd expect continued easing, whether or not that means as a basket, you're comfortable that it would fall into the single digits as we close out '22. And is there actual -- you mentioned deflation a couple of times. I know you mentioning it's specific to [indiscernible] plate, but is there a concern that the overall basket would turn to deflation or perhaps that wouldn't be a concern at all? Any kind of sense for where you see that basket of inflation going in the short term and whether or not it would be concerning if it went to deflation?\nAndrew Iacobucci: Yes. So obviously, it's a little hard to predict as we've all discovered over the last several quarters, what inflation is going to do. Where I think what Dirk is sort of signaling is -- we have seen a little bit of easing off in a couple of the commodity categories, and we feel very good about our ability to manage through that. Our expectation, as we look forward, though, and I think we've said this in the past, is there could very well be and likely will be some easing off in commodity categories, but we don't expect to see the same level of easing in noncommodity categories. Typically, prices go one direction in that area, and that we expect, therefore, there to be a fair amount of stickiness in the non-commodity categories from an inflation standpoint.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Got it. And lastly, just because we're now a month or so away from 2023. Is it still reasonable to assume that the prior guidance is achievable? I mean, it seems like you're coming in, in '22 at the upper end of ranges. I know you've talked about growing that 1.5x the market, but I think you had also thrown out there at least $1.5 billion in EBITDA and margins getting back into that mid-4% range. Is that realistic for 2023? Or has the more recent dynamic made that those goals change either for better or for worse?\nDirk Locascio: Sure. So I think, Jeff, we will update that when we release our Q4. But what I will tell you is just kind of reinforcing what Andrew and I both said is we're very pleased with where we're sort of the progress we're at to date and that we expect to exit '22 with. So I think with that, we feel very good about where the business is. We feel very good about the progress against the plan. And we'll let you take with that which you may, and again, look forward to talking about it more in February.\nJeffrey Bernstein: It sounds pretty clear. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Carden from UBS. Your line is open.\nMark Carden: Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the questions. So to start on MOX\u0113, it sounds like you're hearing good feedback so far. Would you expect for this to be a reasonable tailwind where it's been deployed so far in 4Q. Or is it still too early from a ramp perspective? And then more broadly, how should we think about the pacing of the broader rollout over the next few quarters?\nAndrew Iacobucci: Yes. Thanks, Mark. So we definitely are very pleased with the early returns from MOX\u0113. MOX\u0113 has really primary benefit in the short term of being a further inducement to all of our customers to get on the e-commerce platform, which we've talked about in the past creates all sorts of benefits. We've been told and we would agree that this really is comparable to any of the sort of leading retail platforms out there in terms of ease of use and functionality. As far as the sort of the tailwind and impact on independent case growth, we haven't specifically tried to isolate on that, but it's clear that the momentum we're seeing is likely driven at least in part by MOX\u0113. In terms of this rollout, it is basically now rolled out across our business for our local customers. We still have some work to do to make the platform available to the entirety of our national customer base as we've got some -- we need to make it -- make some adjustments to the platform in order for it to fit their order guide set up typically. But that is something that will be actively worked on and likely come and start to see in the first half of next year. So very, very pleased with what we've seen from a local standpoint -- haven't sort of isolated the specific impact of MOX\u0113 but have very little doubt that we are seeing many of the benefits that we've seen historically of getting folks on that e-commerce platform being driven by increases from -- as a result of using MOX\u0113.\nMark Carden: Okay. Great. And then my second one is a follow-up to Lauren's question. After your recent debt paydowns, how does your exposure to fixed and floating rates shake out? And how are you thinking about the mix there going forward?\nDirk Locascio: Sure. So we ended the quarter. So as of end of Q3, we were about 55% fixed, so the additional $100 million from variable would increase the percentage of variable -- sorry, fixed a little bit. I would expect that the additional debt that we will pay down going forward will be against variable rate debt. So that will continue to increase the fix over time.\nMark Carden: Great, thanks so much and good luck.\nDirk Locascio: All right, thanks Mark.\nAndrew Iacobucci: Thanks, Mark.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nKelly Bania: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. Just a couple of follow-ups here on inflation and the impact. I guess, one, do you anticipate that moderating inflationary environment may or may not impact the competitive environment. So that's part one. And then also, do you think there could be some stronger volume growth hard to tell with all the volatility, how inflation has really impacted volume. I guess I'm just trying to ask the elasticity question if we start to see inflation really start to moderate here, could you have some stronger volume growth as the offset to that.\nAndrew Iacobucci: Yes, thanks, Kelly. It's Andrew. Appreciate the question. I think we would say as far as what we're seeing in the competitive environment today and have done through much of the last couple of years, is there's still continues to be, I would say, a fair degree of rationality from a pricing standpoint. We're obviously all looking for opportunities to reduce our cost of goods and allow us to price to a more competitive level. And that's something that will, I think continue to be a priority for everyone. But I don't anticipate necessarily a meaningful change in the dynamics that we're seeing in the competitive environment as a result of that. And as far as volume growth is concerned, we've been obviously paying very close attention, not only to our relative price position to the extent we're able to determine it, but also share gains by category and paying very close attention to category softening and where we have seen that softening. We've taken some steps to address our prices if we believe that's the issue. So -- but I would say, overall, we've not seen a great deal of impact even though prices have continued to go up at quite a considerable rate. Not saying it couldn't someday happen, and certainly something we're going to continue to pay close attention to. But we have been feeling very good about the way in which we've been managing the balance between margin and volume growth in the environment based on the fact that we've been able to grow our margin at a pretty good rate while at the same time growing market share at an equally good rate.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi, thank you. I would just take a step back, and this might be an obvious question. When you look at your most profitable market segments, I mean, obviously, independent restaurants, but perhaps we could put health care and hospitality as well, but the focus on independent restaurants. What are the key reasons in 2022 of why you might be losing some customers? What are the reasons why you haven't been able to gain new customers. I wonder if that's kind of changing in if you're kind of identifying the factors like what you could do, what you could improve to make your customer base stickier and to grow your customer base, maybe that -- how that's evolving and gosh, we've talked about so many things, but what you think the most important thing that US Foods can do outside of just straight price, obviously, to really drive retention, if that's maybe changed relative to a couple of years ago in this obviously dynamic environment?\nAndrew Iacobucci: Yes, John, thanks for the question. I think we would say we've been very pleased really with the way in which we've grown our business across all our key segments as reflected in our market share gains sequentially from really the beginning of the year through until today. And we expect to see that continue. And I'd say there's a couple of reasons for that. I think our -- as the supply environment gets to a better place, it allows what we believe to be some of the important differentiators we have as a company to really sort of come to the fore, namely our team-based selling, the great innovative product platform as well as the technology that we bring to our customers. And so I think a combination of those things as well as just some of the great work the team has done around just focusing on ongoing after business in the areas where it's growing have been really made the business sort of the year of the success it's been in terms of our ability to continue to grow, grow share across those key profitable segments you mentioned.\nJohn Ivankoe: And then let me ask you this. I mean, I remember some years ago, I mean in terms of overall route efficiencies, there were changes of the day or time a day that maybe customers were getting their orders that the customer wasn't necessarily happy about, that could have influenced the deliveries, I mean things like the minimum number of cases that a customer would have to order? I mean, were those types of changes that were made a few years ago, maybe obstacles or is that not really a factor? Or I mean, just trying to think about what -- how maybe the customers' demand for flexibility may have changed in your ability to serve that flexibility?\nAndrew Iacobucci: Yes. It's -- look, that's the balance. And getting back to your earlier question as well, one of the things customers are quite prepared to pay for is strong service. But they -- you'll find many customers typically want to have their product delivered within a pretty tight window, and that's something we obviously strive to do, but our -- we can't be everywhere sort of at once. We have to build our roots in a way that is most logical to sort of minimize miles. What we have found that I think has really been a very effective approach has been to prioritize or really our most profitable customers in building those routes, and that has allowed us not only to create some efficiencies, but also to ensure that those high-value customers get the service that they deserve. And that's something that I think we will continue to build upon as we move forward. But there's a lot of things we've also been exploring, as we mentioned earlier, a seven-day work week, which has, we think, some really important benefits from a select or turnover standpoint, but we also think there's an opportunity by spreading some of the volume across the week of creating a much better service experience for our customers as well, which is why we're very optimistic about what that could bring.\nDirk Locascio: And John, just real quick is, I think specifically on the drop size, in fact, we've not seen an issue -- in fact, that can almost be in some cases, a worse customer experience because you have more small drops on trucks that cause competitors, trucks to be late. But one of the things that I think underscores sort of our focus on the customer here is so the things that Andrew talked about on the core sort of broad line delivery customers, we also have our Pronto that Andrew talked about, which is our small truck service that's live in almost 30 markets. And that is in largely dense, more urban areas that allows for smaller customers and has very attractive economics on there, and it allows more flexibility, later cutoffs for those customers that have less storage space, et cetera, and we think there's still a runway there. Our direct that we've talked about, which is a much broader assortment online, it's more of a direct ship. And then finally, of course, the Cash & Carry, which we continue to add to and that allows our existing customers to do fill-ins as well as other smaller customers to shop their way. So it really is about, we think, serving the right customers with the right options as opposed to having a broad line, try to be all things to all people.\nJohn Ivankoe: Excellent, thank you.\nDirk Locascio: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Slagle from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nAlexander Slagle: Hey, thanks. Good morning and congrats on the progress. And yes, I was actually going to ask about that seven-day work week pilot and what you're doing with the program and maybe what you are looking at in timing, but I covered a little bit of that. But if there's anything more there. Otherwise, I did -- I just wanted to follow up on -- the working capital, I guess, that positive shift we have here, is it fair to say we've kind of transitioned to this becoming more of a tailwind now. And I think you said at the end of '23, Dirk getting to within the range of 2.5x to 3x or maybe 2.5x, if that was the target. I just wanted to clarify those.\nDirk Locascio: Sure. So overall, I think there's really not much more to add on the first part that Andrew mentioned. On the seven-day work week, it is a pilot, as he talked about, early positive returns but early on. So -- we look forward to updating as that progresses, but really a good win for sort of the associate, the customer and the company if we were able to move ahead successfully. I think overall, when we look to next year, you're right, so working capital, a good positive, good shift. I think that as the recovery continues in certain customer types, I think it will be -- I don't know that it's a tailwind, but it gets closer to being a more normalized working capital environment as we look ahead. And then I think finally, can you remind me of the last part of your question?\nAlexander Slagle: Debt leverage target.\nDirk Locascio: So I wasn't specific. 2.5x to 3x is the range, and we expect to be within that -- if we have anything more specific to add, we will do that when we do our 2023 guidance early in next year. But just reiterating pleased and on track for our 3.5x that we talked about by the end of 2022. So really making sure that we're delivering against the commitments that we have put forth.\nAlexander Slagle: Great. Are there any like calendar shift impacts or anything in fourth quarter to think about? I think there might have been last year.\nDirk Locascio: There is a little bit -- I'm trying to remember, I think it's at the New Year's holiday shift. So if I remember right, potentially a modest negative to Q4, but again, fairly modest or quite modest.\nAlexander Slagle: Got it, all right. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJohn Glass: Thanks very much. Dirk, just back on the balance sheet, and I appreciate all the conversation about buybacks and sort of balancing that now. You still have a large amount of variable rate debt. One, what do you intend to do about that? Is that something that you can action? And I guess maybe as an adjunct to that, if you were either to hedge or to go back to the market and fix the rate, what do you think the prevailing rates are to do so if you -- is that the prohibiting factor right now? Thanks.\nDirk Locascio: Sure. So overall, we do expect to continue to reduce that variable rate. To your point, we are -- we do look at our capital structure in that mix. And when we have an update, we would definitely provide that. We don't think that the current market is an inhibitor to potentially being able to take some action more likely a form of a financial instrument than a new issuance. But to the extent that we have an update, we'll provide that. I think the important thing is even at the rates that they're at right now, our overall borrowing rates are so quite solid, and we will manage that and think we're relatively well positioned in the environment.\nJohn Glass: Thank you. And just on market share growth, your peers down in Houston talk about this holistically, right? They grew at 1.4% or whatever times the market, including all segments. Can you talk about maybe that in your business in that context, what you think you're growing at relative to the market? And I know you said you're going to exceed your 1.5x target for restaurants. What is that right now? Where are you growing at?\nDirk Locascio: So overall, we would expect to be largely in line with the market with our goals for the overall business, which would be about 1x or a little over 1x. We do have the retail piece that we would pull out this year again. But other than that, we expect to be in line. I think the important thing to take away and the reason that we separate it and don't talk about it maybe in the same way that they do is because not all growth is the same. So if you had outsized growth in chain or K-12 education, that is not our focus. And we really are targeted at really outgrowing in those key more attractive customer types. And I think what you're seeing is you're seeing this show up in our larger increases in profitability overall. And so we'll continue to grow and grow smartly, and you should expect that of us.\nJohn Glass: Okay, thank you.\nDirk Locascio: Thanks.\nOperator: And your final question comes from the line of Peter Saleh from BTIG. Your line is open.\nPeter Saleh: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask about seasonality, and we've heard from many restaurant operators, the seasonality kind of return this summer -- slower in the summer and kind of accelerated into the Fall. Can you guys comment on the seasonality in your business, particularly in hospitality and if there's any in health care as well, are you seeing that seasonality return? Also just any comments on Omicron which I think was -- which was maybe a little bit in the fourth quarter last year and a little bit in 1Q. Just any comments on that would be helpful.\nDirk Locascio: Sure, Peter. Thank you, good question. So maybe I'll start with to answer to your point, Omicron, limited impact in Q4, more so in Q1. As we think about the seasonality, I think the -- in the summer, some of the slowing, it's also harder to tell exactly if it's seasonality because that slowing also happened about the same time as you had fuel prices really spike. And we see that oftentimes that is -- like they were very closely correlated as far as timing on that. The important part for our business is the increased exit rates that we talked about and the strength into the early part of Q4. I think beyond that, the seasonality that I would reference not as much on health care is on hospitality, you do have some of the holiday events, and that will be something we're watching closely as that and other larger group events come back. I think the other final thing in hospitality as you have events around football and things in the fall, again, watching that closely there. Those would be the main things that I would think about there and that we'll continue to watch as the year goes on.\nAndrew Iacobucci: I think, Peter, the other thing I'd add is just we continue to have, we think, some real untapped recovery in those two pretty important segments, health care and hospitality. And so there will, we think continue to be some sort of baseline acceleration in those segments that will sort of defy the seasonality that typically is associated with them. And that we expect to see probably over the next -- the course of the next year or so.\nPeter Saleh: Thanks and just my last question would be, I think you mentioned several times some deflation in center of the plate. Any way to quantify what you're seeing? And is there any evidence to suggest that that won't continue into 4Q and into '23?\nAndrew Iacobucci: We don't typically quantify at that level, but I would say we saw in some categories, a pretty meaningful pullback. But those categories are, I think returning to sort of more normal volatility, I would describe it, than necessarily systematically reverting back to a deflationary world. In fact, we've already started to see a number of the poultry category start to creep back up again. There just continues to be such volatility in the market from a supply standpoint that, that's, I think, driving as much of sort of the unpredictability of it. I don't foresee, I don't think the team is foreseeing a continued downward trend, but instead, more volatility than perhaps we've seen where the trajectory was typically mostly upwards.\nPeter Saleh: Great, thank you very much.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dirk Locascio",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew, and good morning. I will start on Page 8. We're very pleased with what we accomplished this quarter. We continue to build on our momentum from the last two quarters and demonstrated progress against our long-range plan. Adjusted EBITDA grew 21% from the prior year to $351 million for the quarter, which is an acceleration from our Q2 growth rate. In addition to strong EBITDA dollars, our adjusted EBITDA per case remained strong and was in line with Q3 2019. The Q3 adjusted EBITDA was the best quarter relative to 2019 since prior to the start of the pandemic. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 25% over the prior year third quarter to $0.60. These highlights demonstrate the actions we are taking to grow and further strengthen our business are delivering meaningful results. Net sales were $8.9 billion in Q3, an increase of 13% over the prior year. Total case volume increased 1% from the prior year and food cost inflation was 12%. Similar to last quarter, our Q3 year-over-year case growth was negatively impacted approximately 200 basis points by the planned mid-2021 exit of the grocery retail business we temporarily added during the pandemic and a small number of strategic exits. Independent case growth increased 3% over the prior year. We continued our trend of strong gross profit dollar growth again this quarter. Our adjusted gross profit dollars increased 15% from the prior year. And as a result, we generated strong adjusted gross profit per case. This is important because we experienced little sequential inflation compared to large amounts in the first half of the year, yet we're able to maintain similar gross profit per case. OpEx remains elevated, however, as the quarter progressed, we saw positive signs with improved operations turnover and productivity rates. Let's look at volume further on Page 9. Independent cases increased 3% on top of nearly 25% growth in the prior year. Hospitality grew 20% and health care grew 3%, offset by approximately 7% lower chain volume and the retail exit impact I noted previously. Our chain decline was driven this quarter largely by the strategic exit of a small number of lower profitability and more complex customers, consistent with what we talked about in Q2. Case growth across almost all customer types finished the quarter with stronger growth rates than they started and above the quarter's overall case growth for each type. This was very positive, and we expect volume to improve further in Q4. We delivered share gains in key customer types again this quarter. I will focus briefly on growth relative to 2019, the last full-year prior to the outside of the pandemic. Q3 total case growth was about 6.5% below 2019 with IND cases or independent cases performing the strongest at 3.3% above Q3 2019. We ended the quarter with strong momentum as our exit rates were above Q3 growth rates for most customer types. We still have embedded COVID recovery gains regardless of the macro backdrop. As health care cases were about 6% below Q3 2019 and hospitality was approximately 14% below 2019, while showing improvement from Q2 results. We are optimistic about our positive volume trends in September and October as they show continued strength and improvement. Turning to Page 10. We are updating our fiscal 2022 guidance provided previously. We expect to exceed our volume goal relative to the market. Technomic's latest outlook for 2022 calls for restaurants to be negative compared to 2021, while we expect to be positive, even with a small number of strategic [indiscernible] previously discussed. Within restaurants overall, our independent growth remains positive and is expected to improve further, while the Technomic outlook for the year is negative. We also are on track to exceed their outlook for health care and be in line for hospitality. As full-service lodging, an area that has been lagging in recovery accelerates, we expect to further improve hospitality relative to the industry. Moving to earnings. We are tightening our adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $1.28 billion to $1.3 billion. This reflects our significantly increased confidence in achieving the high end of our previously provided range, as a result, the three quarters of strong execution against the three pillars of our long-range plan. We're also tightening our adjusted diluted EPS range to $2.10 to $2.20 to align with the updated adjusted EBITDA range. Interest expense is expected to be $250 million to $255 million and cash CapEx is expected to be $270 million to $280 million. Total CapEx, including cash and financing leases for fleet are expected to be approximately $400 million. Finally, we continue to expect net leverage to be approximately 3.5x at year-end. Looking at Page 11. We made further progress again this quarter in strengthening our capital structure and reducing leverage. We reduced our net leverage compared to both Q3 2021 and Q2 2022. Our net leverage ratio was 3.7x at the end of the third quarter, which is a 1.1 turn reduction from a year ago and a 0.5 turn reduction from Q2 of this year. We reduced gross debt approximately $450 million compared to Q3 2021 and during Q3 2022 prepaid $100 million of term loan. And finally to date, in Q4, we have prepaid an additional $100 million of term loan. Leverage reduction is one of the focus areas of our capital allocation strategy. We continue to make strong progress toward our goal of 2.5x to 3x net leverage, and we expect to achieve net leverage range in fiscal 2023. I am quite pleased with the progress we continue to make in further strengthening our capital structure and delivering on our priority to reduce leverage. Turning to Page 12. US Foods has strong cash flow, and we're using to fuel our stated priorities. We will continue to invest in the business for growth with roughly $400 million in capital invested in 2022. And against technologies such as MOXe\u0304 and warehouse selection, facilities such as our new distribution center in New Orleans and our most environmentally sustainable distribution center in Sacramento, New Chef stores and fleet. We have made significant progress in reducing our leverage and expect to achieve our target range of 2.5x to 3x in 2023. We are doing this by using our strong cash flow to reduce debt and growing earnings. Finally, we are very pleased to announce the $500 million share repurchase program. This is a significant step as we have demonstrated meaningful leverage reduction and focus on a balance of further leverage reduction and return of capital to shareholders. We expect to begin some opportunistic repurchases in the fourth quarter. It refunds strength in our balance sheet, the resiliency of our business, our strong cash flow generation and the tremendous value we see in our shares. In 2023, we expect to continue reducing leverage and opportunistically repurchasing shares in parallel. These actions and outcomes demonstrate our commitment to a strong capital structure and activities that create shareholder value. We expect to end the year in our target leverage range, inclusive of any capital we may return to shareholders. Just to sum it up, I am pleased with our progress this year, and I'm confident in our ability to deliver our 2022 outlook. With that, I'll pass it back to Andrew. Sure. Good morning, Jake, this is Dirk. Good question. So overall, I think we're pleased. What we saw was the beginning of the third quarter had a little bit of -- just like you saw sort of broadly across there, had a slower start just with some -- a little bit slower demand broadly. We've seen that continue to improve as the quarter has gone on. Hence, what Andrew and I have talked about, just the confidence in which we exited the quarter and entered the fourth quarter, I feel good about the trajectory of the case growth. I think the important thing is we do continue to see share gains across our key customer types. And we think just with health care and hospitality also, those are continuing to improve relative to 2019 and expect that to continue as well and is really a built-in tailwind. So I feel the position is well -- we are well positioned to grow with the right key customer types, as we've talked a lot about -- for us, it's about profitably growing with the right customer types as opposed to growth just for the sake of growth. So feel good about the quarter and where we ended the fourth quarter. Good morning, Nicole. This is Dirk. That's a good question. So overall, our industry and our business has shown itself to be quite resilient. If you look at what was a very tough recession in 2008, 2009, cases were down mid-single digits, earnings were relatively flat. If you look at other though, outside of 2008, 2009, the last three or four inflation-induced recessions, you saw much less volume decline. So it's a very, very small impact. I think that's a demonstration of the resiliency of our business. One of the things that I think if you look back even in '08, '09 and prior, we were a very different company. A lot of the work around differentiation that we've done has been since then. And so we would expect that all the same things that are resonating today for us to take share across these key customer types to continue to resonate. And in fact, I think that positions us even better to weather any kind of a challenge that comes than we were in the past. So I think we're well positioned and even though we can't control the macro, we can't control the execution of our long-range plan and the initiatives to drive that, and that's what we're going to focus on. Sure. So overall, what we see is -- the lag is relatively short. So again, most of our contracts or noncontract price that tends to be, call it, within a month, it can be from a week to a month or so. I think -- so pretty quick. The positive thing is in the third quarter, so we saw the least amount of sequential inflation that we've seen since, I think, at the beginning of 2021 and very small amounts relative to the first half of the year, yet our gross profit per case remained quite strong. And I think that demonstrates the resiliency of the business. And within that sequential inflation in Q3, we actually saw many center of the plates or protein categories that saw some deflation. And our processes that Andrew made reference to earlier and the playbooks that we have, we manage through that quite effectively. And those are the categories actually that we think are more likely to show the deflation. And almost all those categories tend to be a fixed markup over whatever our cost is. So therefore, over time, not really impacting our overall profitability. So quite pleased with the progress, quite pleased with our management through it and where we're positioned from an inflationary and deflationary environment. Yes. I was just going to say on the second part of the ability to outgrow what we think is in the environment, it's hard to know exactly where we shake out if you see a slowdown, but I think what we would expect is we would expect to outgrow period. And I think the thing that would be a factor that would potentially enable us to even outgrow further would be our differentiation and the offerings that we have to customers to help them succeed is something that helps them through difficult environments. And we've seen that in the way we help customers manage their way through with the PPP loans, how to get them, how to use them effectively as well as how we're helping them manage through inflation in their businesses. So I think if anything, we're probably better positioned, but the work that we're doing, we think is -- will allow us to continue to take share. John, I think to get back to the point on what we look at costs going forward. So I do think we can get back to an environment where costs grow in line to less than cases. I think that the part that's a little harder to know exactly is at what pace that happens, just knowing that so much of it is driven by the turnover and the retention factor. And as Andrew said, we're pleased with the early signs we're seeing there, and we know we're not where we want to be, but we're going to continue to be focused on improving that. I think from overall wage inflation perspective, as we see and as we look ahead, that does appear to be coming back, call it, closer to historical levels of inflation. It's hard to know depending on what happens with the macro exactly where it settles. But I think the important takeaway there is it doesn't appear as though last year's level of outsized increases appear to be the new norm. But as you would expect, we're watching and managing that quite closely. Sure. Thanks, Ed. Good question. You're right, that was very intentional in highlighting that. And I think really what we're just trying to make sure is clear to people is the durability that we think is there in our gross profit per case. And in the environment where you see it in center of the plate deflation, which is where we think more of the potential of deflation is more likely than in grocery. And we're managing through it. So to your point, we do think as we look ahead, we think we can continue to have strong growing gross profit. And that really is underscored by the points that both Andrew and I made of the majority -- vast majority of our gross profit gains are coming from the things we're doing in our four walls as part of our plan as opposed to deflation or inflation and the pieces of inflation that are helped, especially on the parts of the business that are a percentage markup, we think are sticky. So overall, feel like we're very well positioned, very happy with the progress we made this quarter and look forward to continuing that into 2023. In fact, it's a good example. As we think of 2022 and even when we look ahead to 2023. So much of the work that we've done on our initiatives this year across the spectrum of the pillars, we think position us very well and will drive a lot of the earnings growth as we get into 2023. Sure. So I think that out of the 200 basis points that we talked about this quarter, a little under half of it was the grocery piece, retail that is fully lapped by the end of the first -- by the end of the third quarter. The other piece that's changed will continue through Q1. What I would say is our focus has been and continues to be around growing with the right customers. So it's about growing profitably as opposed to just case growth. I think when you look at any business, looking across and having sort of some level of, I'll call it, hygiene and what's the right mix and replacing customers the better customers is part of what we and you would expect, I would think others to do as we go through there. So overall, it is about growing the business, but it really is about growing the business with those more profitable customers. And hopefully, what you see this quarter is with 21% EBITDA growth that we are well positioned as we think to exit 2023 -- sorry, 2022 and end of 2023. Thanks, Ed. Sure. Good morning, Lauren. Good question. So this is exciting for us to be in a position to talk about this. And I think it's really been Andrew used the word intentional. We've been very intentional in the way we manage our capital structure. And so really, what this does is it fits right into one of the four priorities that we've talked a lot about. And what we've said regularly is we don't need to get all the way to the 3x high end of the range in order to begin this. But what I will be clear about though is that we remain committed to reducing leverage to getting in that range. And we think that going forward, this sort of the repurchase is an opportunistic way to, again, create shareholder value, especially with our shares at the levels they're at. But secondly, that we would expect in parallel to further reduce debt and we'll grow earnings as well as repurchase shares. And think that we will be -- expect to be in that range of 2.5x to 3x by the end of next year, inclusive of any capital that we return. So this really is about just because of the strengthening of the capital structure, the maturity as part of our whole priority and plan that we've been managing to, it is just the next step in that journey and very pleased with our ability to announce that today. Sure. As a straight percentage, it's about half of the business, and then the other half is a combination of either a fixed markup and/or kind of more spot pricing on noncontract type of business. Thanks. Sure. If we compare the decline that we're seeing are still the amount below 2019 levels. Almost all of that is the combination of these exits that we've talked about as well as the two concepts that we've talked about that have more meaningful reductions in same-store sales. Absent those two things, our chain business is relatively in line with where it was 2019. I think to your point, Jeff. So we're watching it closely. You do see across the different chains. You see some that continue to perform very well. You see others that don't perform as well. We'll continue to watch to see if you see any kind of a sort of more discernible slowdown. But again, those are typically on the lower end of the margin spectrum. And we think that even chains that we have on board and growing are well positioned in the environment that we're in. So our key is going to continue to be with growing with those key customer types and then being very opportunistic in the all other. Sure. So I think, Jeff, we will update that when we release our Q4. But what I will tell you is just kind of reinforcing what Andrew and I both said is we're very pleased with where we're sort of the progress we're at to date and that we expect to exit '22 with. So I think with that, we feel very good about where the business is. We feel very good about the progress against the plan. And we'll let you take with that which you may, and again, look forward to talking about it more in February. Sure. So we ended the quarter. So as of end of Q3, we were about 55% fixed, so the additional $100 million from variable would increase the percentage of variable -- sorry, fixed a little bit. I would expect that the additional debt that we will pay down going forward will be against variable rate debt. So that will continue to increase the fix over time. All right, thanks Mark. And John, just real quick is, I think specifically on the drop size, in fact, we've not seen an issue -- in fact, that can almost be in some cases, a worse customer experience because you have more small drops on trucks that cause competitors, trucks to be late. But one of the things that I think underscores sort of our focus on the customer here is so the things that Andrew talked about on the core sort of broad line delivery customers, we also have our Pronto that Andrew talked about, which is our small truck service that's live in almost 30 markets. And that is in largely dense, more urban areas that allows for smaller customers and has very attractive economics on there, and it allows more flexibility, later cutoffs for those customers that have less storage space, et cetera, and we think there's still a runway there. Our direct that we've talked about, which is a much broader assortment online, it's more of a direct ship. And then finally, of course, the Cash & Carry, which we continue to add to and that allows our existing customers to do fill-ins as well as other smaller customers to shop their way. So it really is about, we think, serving the right customers with the right options as opposed to having a broad line, try to be all things to all people. Thanks, John. Sure. So overall, I think there's really not much more to add on the first part that Andrew mentioned. On the seven-day work week, it is a pilot, as he talked about, early positive returns but early on. So -- we look forward to updating as that progresses, but really a good win for sort of the associate, the customer and the company if we were able to move ahead successfully. I think overall, when we look to next year, you're right, so working capital, a good positive, good shift. I think that as the recovery continues in certain customer types, I think it will be -- I don't know that it's a tailwind, but it gets closer to being a more normalized working capital environment as we look ahead. And then I think finally, can you remind me of the last part of your question? So I wasn't specific. 2.5x to 3x is the range, and we expect to be within that -- if we have anything more specific to add, we will do that when we do our 2023 guidance early in next year. But just reiterating pleased and on track for our 3.5x that we talked about by the end of 2022. So really making sure that we're delivering against the commitments that we have put forth. There is a little bit -- I'm trying to remember, I think it's at the New Year's holiday shift. So if I remember right, potentially a modest negative to Q4, but again, fairly modest or quite modest. Sure. So overall, we do expect to continue to reduce that variable rate. To your point, we are -- we do look at our capital structure in that mix. And when we have an update, we would definitely provide that. We don't think that the current market is an inhibitor to potentially being able to take some action more likely a form of a financial instrument than a new issuance. But to the extent that we have an update, we'll provide that. I think the important thing is even at the rates that they're at right now, our overall borrowing rates are so quite solid, and we will manage that and think we're relatively well positioned in the environment. So overall, we would expect to be largely in line with the market with our goals for the overall business, which would be about 1x or a little over 1x. We do have the retail piece that we would pull out this year again. But other than that, we expect to be in line. I think the important thing to take away and the reason that we separate it and don't talk about it maybe in the same way that they do is because not all growth is the same. So if you had outsized growth in chain or K-12 education, that is not our focus. And we really are targeted at really outgrowing in those key more attractive customer types. And I think what you're seeing is you're seeing this show up in our larger increases in profitability overall. And so we'll continue to grow and grow smartly, and you should expect that of us. Thanks. Sure, Peter. Thank you, good question. So maybe I'll start with to answer to your point, Omicron, limited impact in Q4, more so in Q1. As we think about the seasonality, I think the -- in the summer, some of the slowing, it's also harder to tell exactly if it's seasonality because that slowing also happened about the same time as you had fuel prices really spike. And we see that oftentimes that is -- like they were very closely correlated as far as timing on that. The important part for our business is the increased exit rates that we talked about and the strength into the early part of Q4. I think beyond that, the seasonality that I would reference not as much on health care is on hospitality, you do have some of the holiday events, and that will be something we're watching closely as that and other larger group events come back. I think the other final thing in hospitality as you have events around football and things in the fall, again, watching that closely there. Those would be the main things that I would think about there and that we'll continue to watch as the year goes on."

            "name": "Andrew Iacobucci",
            "content": "Thanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. First and foremost, I'm delighted to report that we delivered strong third quarter results, reflecting continued execution of our long-range plan. US Foods performance to date underscores our confidence in achieving our 2022 outlook. We remain committed to continuing the momentum from the first three quarters and driving our long-range plan. Let's turn to Page 3 for key takeaways from the quarter. First, our results this quarter demonstrate continued solid execution across the three pillars of our long-range plan. Our associates are a critical part of this progress, and I am grateful to them for their focus on execution and on serving our customers. In addition to strong day-to-day execution, US Foods associates have continued their tradition of stepping up when our customers and communities need us most. Most recently, during Hurricane Ian, which severely impacted many of our customers on the East Coast, our teams worked tirelessly to ensure our customers and the relief agencies we support could operate effectively and properly serve their customers. Based on feedback we received, our storm preparation and response are best-in-class in our industry. This intense focus on delivering for our customers is a large part of why we've been able to capture market share with key customer types in all three quarters of 2022. Second, with strong momentum in our plan, US Foods is increasingly well positioned to win in an evolving macro environment, particularly in light of our effective management of inflation and deflation, our scale and customer diversity and continued recovery tailwinds. Our results reinforce our confidence to deliver a strong finish to the year. Finally, we expect to drive meaningful value creation for shareholders through a new share repurchase program announced this morning. We are committed to utilizing U.S. Foods strong cash flow to deliver long-term shareholder value. Turning to Page 4. I'll start by walking through our third quarter highlights. Starting off, we once again delivered strong financial results. Net sales for the quarter grew 13% year-over-year, volume growth strengthened as the quarter progressed, which we see as positive for both our business and for our customers. Adjusted EBITDA grew nearly 21% for the quarter, an acceleration from our Q2 growth rate. Our adjusted EBITDA margins also increased 20 basis points from the prior year as we gained operating leverage. Finally, we have updated our 2022 guidance toward the top end of our prior adjusted EBITDA outlook range. Our results show the resiliency in our business and the ability of our team to deliver on the plan we put forth earlier this year. Turning to our customer experience. We launched MOXe\u0304, our next-generation industry-leading digital tool and we continue to drive market share gains with key customer types, which we expect to continue as we further embed share data into our operating processes. Finally, we further expanded our omnichannel with two new chef stores, which opened in Q3 and early Q4. This brings us to four stores open to date with an expectation of two more openings before the end of 2022. We also continue to expand our Pronto service, a delivery service focused on smaller customers in concentrated geographies and are active with that program in nearly 30 markets. Next, we are pleased with our continued progress on supply chain. We completed our warehouse selection technology deployment as planned. This system enables a better associate experience, improved selection accuracy and ultimately, a better customer experience. I talked last quarter about the various actions we are taking to improve employee retention, and I'm happy to report that we are seeing progress. Both driver and warehouse turnover have improved from what we experienced in H1. We are not yet where we want to be, and we remain laser-focused on improving retention by simplifying our core processes, strengthening leadership engagement and offering greater flexibility with respect to shift schedules. Early returns from our seven-day work week pilot in the Southeast have been promising, and the flexibility it offers proved very helpful before and after Hurricane Ian. Finally, we continue to make progress on inbound logistics, resulting in further improved financial results and third-party partner collaboration. This work is well ahead of plan for the year. Lastly, we've been intentional in managing our capital structure and have reduced our leverage to 3.7x as of the end of Q3 2022. During Q3, we prepaid $100 million on our 2021 term loan, in October prepaid another $100 million on our 2019 term loan. We were also very pleased to have announced earlier today that our Board of Directors has approved a $500 million share repurchase program, a significant step in further demonstrating the strength of our capital structure, confidence in our future and focus on shareholder value creation. We see this move as highly accretive to shareholder value at our current share price and is further evidence of our commitment to being responsible stewards of shareholder capital. With that, let's turn to Page 5 and discuss how our performance in the quarter translates into progress on the three pillars of the long-range plan to drive profitable share gains, expand margins and improve operational efficiencies. Looking at our first pillar, we are tracking to exceed our targeted restaurant growth rate of 1.5x the market. We are also continuing to win in the marketplace, as demonstrated by our share gains in key customer types of independence, health care and hospitality. The MOXe\u0304 launch I mentioned earlier is a significant milestone. MOXe\u0304 is a step change to the customer experience from a performance and ease-of-use perspective. We have been focused on ensuring increased customer speed, confidence and control. Our new one-stop shop app is 30% faster than it was before and is similar to the user experience of leading retail apps. Customer and seller feedback has been very positive and we expect this to extend our technology lead in the industry. As mentioned earlier, we expect to open six new Chef stores in 2022, which is the high end of the range we previously communicated. As we open stores, we are building our capabilities to accelerate that pace in 2023. Let's move on to the margin optimization pillar. As a reminder, we've been working on a number of internal initiatives to improve gross profit per case that are independent of market conditions. For example, we continue to build on the momentum from inbound logistics as our process management initiatives program continues to drive efficiencies. We effectively managed inflation and deflation by running our proven plays. In the third quarter, we saw less sequential inflation than we experienced in the first half of the year, and yet our gross margins remained strong and in line with the first half of the year. Our cost of goods management program is also performing well and continues ahead of schedule with approximately 40% of our total vendor spend expected to be addressed by year-end. Turning last to operational efficiencies. We are making progress despite the challenging macro environment. Our routing optimization and network planning work continued, and our cases per mile improved further ahead of 2019 in the third quarter to the best results we've seen to date. We are pleased with the progress, yet remain focused on the benefits still to come from this work and from the routing system replacement in a future phase. The work we are doing on employee engagement, flexible schedules and process standardization, for example, is yielding benefits as we experienced a lower turnover in the third quarter than we saw in the second quarter. We tackled productivity through a combination of network-wide initiatives and targeted optimization efforts in select markets with the greatest productivity opportunities. Turning next to Page 6. We've made significant progress over the last three quarters and expect to build on that progress to achieve our plan. The entire US Foods organization is focused on these initiatives and the actions that drive our long-range plan and we are relentlessly executing against all three pillars. As a result, we are enhancing the customer experience and our operational foundation, leading to share gains and significant year-over-year profitability improvements. We are a resilient business serving many customer types. Given our U.S. focus, our operations are less volatile than others. This positions us well to win even in a challenging macro environment and further strengthens our belief in the rightness and the achievability of our long-range plan. As we continue to build momentum against this plan, we will prudently allocate the strong and growing cash flow against our four priorities to create shareholder value. In summary, I am proud of and energized by our progress this year, and I am confident we will build on this momentum to deliver a strong 2022 and set us up for a strong 2023. With that, I will hand it over to Dirk to do a deeper dive into our financial results. Dirk, over to you. Thanks, Dirk. In closing, we continue to be laser-focused on driving profitable share gains, expanding gross margins and building on our strong operational and financial momentum. I'm confident in the growing strength of our business, thanks to the initiatives we have underway and the hard work of our talented team as they continue to focus on serving our customers and executing our long-range plan with excellence. To put it succinctly, we are winning, and I am proud of our progress. With that, operator, please open up the line for questions. Hi, Jake, it's Andrew. Thanks for the question. Yes, we're actually quite pleased with the balance that we're seeing in that growth. It is actually a combination of both share of wallet gains as well as new business. And I will also say, we've also seen a reasonable strengthening of our own customer demand, suggesting that they too are growing as well. So it's sort of a combination across all three of expanding share of wallet, driving new customers -- growth through new customers as well as our customers themselves seeing growth in their business. Yes. And Jake, just to add to your question, we saw share gains that were quite consistent in trajectory to what we saw in Q2. Yes. Thanks, Nicole. It's Andrew. Appreciate the question. So we would say our outbound fill rates, our fill rates to our customers continue to improve. The inbound though has been fairly flat versus where it was in Q2, a little bit of improvement in some key categories. But generally speaking, still fairly flat, and we continue to basically manage that through two main means. One is to diversify our supplier base to make sure we've got alternatives when our primaries aren't in stock and secondly, to build up a little bit of extra safety stock to ensure that we have products in key categories. As far as the backhaul opportunity, that is something that we have been actively pursuing for quite some time. And you'll see -- you've seen from our freight results or logistics income results that those efforts are really paying off. I think we still got some opportunity to continue to go after that, and that's something that, that team is very focused on. I think it's all of the above continued challenges. The only thing I'd add to that list is continued challenges as raw material supply in some of our categories. The system has still got some challenges that it's working through. We're definitely starting to see some improvements. And even though our fill rates in absolute terms haven't improved as much as we would like, our de facto fill rates have improved because of the diversification of supplier base. So we are still getting the product, which is not getting it from the usual sources in all cases. So John, thanks for the question. Yes, we would say a meaningfully better exit rate than we saw overall in the quarter. And that would be driven by a combination of the factors you mentioned, as I said in the earlier question from Jake, we're pretty happy with the balance that we're seeing in the way we're driving IND growth. And John, just to add to that, I think one of the things we've learned most through COVID really is the ability to be nimble and agile and redeploy resources where the growth is. And I think that's been a pretty significant contributor to what has really been very steady sequential market share gains period-over-period over the course of the entire first three quarters of the year. Yes. John, why don't I start and then maybe Dirk can talk a little bit about what we're seeing on the rate side. As far as our staffing situation, we feel very good. We're in a very solid position in the vast majority of our markets. As I mentioned in my remarks, we saw turnover take a pretty meaningful reduction over the course of the third quarter. And that was a combination, primarily, I think driven by some of the initiatives we've taken to better engage our workforce and create a culture that they want to be part of. Those are really starting to show some real impacts. But we've also undoubtedly had a little bit of help from the macro environment as well. So I would say, right now, I feel pretty good about the staffing situation. I'll maybe start on the second part of the question. What we've seen primarily as we get to a better place is, obviously, that has an almost immediate impact on our productivity, and that is starting to show up in our business. The other thing we've also seen is there's a lot more straight time in our facilities much less need for over time, which is probably the first impact that we're likely going to see more than necessarily overall hours reduction in the short term. Yes, hi Lauren, it's Andrew. Thanks for the question. Yes, we absolutely have seen throughout a great opportunity to improve our penetration. One of the challenges, of course, has been supply. Most of our arrangements are with a limited number of suppliers from pre-COVID times, and we've had to significantly change our thinking around that to have alternatives in place. And we've done a really good job of doing that. We're in a very, very good spot now from a fairly stable supply foundation to really aggressively go after those increases. We've seen a natural improvement as customers tend to seek out the value that the control brand represents. And we expect that to accelerate as we get into a much better supply situation. So yes, I definitely expect to see that penetration level go up over the next several quarters. Yes. So obviously, it's a little hard to predict as we've all discovered over the last several quarters, what inflation is going to do. Where I think what Dirk is sort of signaling is -- we have seen a little bit of easing off in a couple of the commodity categories, and we feel very good about our ability to manage through that. Our expectation, as we look forward, though, and I think we've said this in the past, is there could very well be and likely will be some easing off in commodity categories, but we don't expect to see the same level of easing in noncommodity categories. Typically, prices go one direction in that area, and that we expect, therefore, there to be a fair amount of stickiness in the non-commodity categories from an inflation standpoint. Yes. Thanks, Mark. So we definitely are very pleased with the early returns from MOXe\u0304. MOXe\u0304 has really primary benefit in the short term of being a further inducement to all of our customers to get on the e-commerce platform, which we've talked about in the past creates all sorts of benefits. We've been told and we would agree that this really is comparable to any of the sort of leading retail platforms out there in terms of ease of use and functionality. As far as the sort of the tailwind and impact on independent case growth, we haven't specifically tried to isolate on that, but it's clear that the momentum we're seeing is likely driven at least in part by MOXe\u0304. In terms of this rollout, it is basically now rolled out across our business for our local customers. We still have some work to do to make the platform available to the entirety of our national customer base as we've got some -- we need to make it -- make some adjustments to the platform in order for it to fit their order guide set up typically. But that is something that will be actively worked on and likely come and start to see in the first half of next year. So very, very pleased with what we've seen from a local standpoint -- haven't sort of isolated the specific impact of MOXe\u0304 but have very little doubt that we are seeing many of the benefits that we've seen historically of getting folks on that e-commerce platform being driven by increases from -- as a result of using MOXe\u0304. Thanks, Mark. Yes, thanks, Kelly. It's Andrew. Appreciate the question. I think we would say as far as what we're seeing in the competitive environment today and have done through much of the last couple of years, is there's still continues to be, I would say, a fair degree of rationality from a pricing standpoint. We're obviously all looking for opportunities to reduce our cost of goods and allow us to price to a more competitive level. And that's something that will, I think continue to be a priority for everyone. But I don't anticipate necessarily a meaningful change in the dynamics that we're seeing in the competitive environment as a result of that. And as far as volume growth is concerned, we've been obviously paying very close attention, not only to our relative price position to the extent we're able to determine it, but also share gains by category and paying very close attention to category softening and where we have seen that softening. We've taken some steps to address our prices if we believe that's the issue. So -- but I would say, overall, we've not seen a great deal of impact even though prices have continued to go up at quite a considerable rate. Not saying it couldn't someday happen, and certainly something we're going to continue to pay close attention to. But we have been feeling very good about the way in which we've been managing the balance between margin and volume growth in the environment based on the fact that we've been able to grow our margin at a pretty good rate while at the same time growing market share at an equally good rate. Yes, John, thanks for the question. I think we would say we've been very pleased really with the way in which we've grown our business across all our key segments as reflected in our market share gains sequentially from really the beginning of the year through until today. And we expect to see that continue. And I'd say there's a couple of reasons for that. I think our -- as the supply environment gets to a better place, it allows what we believe to be some of the important differentiators we have as a company to really sort of come to the fore, namely our team-based selling, the great innovative product platform as well as the technology that we bring to our customers. And so I think a combination of those things as well as just some of the great work the team has done around just focusing on ongoing after business in the areas where it's growing have been really made the business sort of the year of the success it's been in terms of our ability to continue to grow, grow share across those key profitable segments you mentioned. Yes. It's -- look, that's the balance. And getting back to your earlier question as well, one of the things customers are quite prepared to pay for is strong service. But they -- you'll find many customers typically want to have their product delivered within a pretty tight window, and that's something we obviously strive to do, but our -- we can't be everywhere sort of at once. We have to build our roots in a way that is most logical to sort of minimize miles. What we have found that I think has really been a very effective approach has been to prioritize or really our most profitable customers in building those routes, and that has allowed us not only to create some efficiencies, but also to ensure that those high-value customers get the service that they deserve. And that's something that I think we will continue to build upon as we move forward. But there's a lot of things we've also been exploring, as we mentioned earlier, a seven-day work week, which has, we think, some really important benefits from a select or turnover standpoint, but we also think there's an opportunity by spreading some of the volume across the week of creating a much better service experience for our customers as well, which is why we're very optimistic about what that could bring. I think, Peter, the other thing I'd add is just we continue to have, we think, some real untapped recovery in those two pretty important segments, health care and hospitality. And so there will, we think continue to be some sort of baseline acceleration in those segments that will sort of defy the seasonality that typically is associated with them. And that we expect to see probably over the next -- the course of the next year or so. We don't typically quantify at that level, but I would say we saw in some categories, a pretty meaningful pullback. But those categories are, I think returning to sort of more normal volatility, I would describe it, than necessarily systematically reverting back to a deflationary world. In fact, we've already started to see a number of the poultry category start to creep back up again. There just continues to be such volatility in the market from a supply standpoint that, that's, I think, driving as much of sort of the unpredictability of it. I don't foresee, I don't think the team is foreseeing a continued downward trend, but instead, more volatility than perhaps we've seen where the trajectory was typically mostly upwards."

As I mentioned last quarter, my commitment as interim CEO is to continue the momentum coming out of our first quarter and to deliver on our long-range plan, which we introduced in February. Today, I'm pleased to report that US Foods continues to make progress against our plan and delivered strong earnings growth in the second quarter. Let's turn to Page 3, where you will find 3 key takeaways from the quarter. First, our Q2 results demonstrate good progress on executing our long-range plan. I'd like to thank our hardworking associates across the country for being a critical part of this progress and for continuing to serve our customers despite the challenges facing our industry. Second, US Foods continued its market share momentum from Q1, again delivering market share gains in key customer types. And third, our results further reinforce our confidence to deliver strong results despite the challenging macro environment affecting our industry. While US Foods and the industry as a whole continue to face headwinds related to inflation in food costs and fuel, as well as a challenging labor market, we remain well positioned to win in this marketplace. On Page 4, you will see key highlights from the second quarter. First, net sales for the quarter grew at 15% year-over-year, and we saw continued gross profit per case strength, driven in large part by progress on our long-range plan initiatives that we will discuss momentarily. As a result, adjusted EBITDA grew 11% on the quarter. On supply chain optimization, we continue to make significant strides as a result of the investments we are making in the business. We continued the implementation of new warehouse selection technology in our facilities, and we're on track to complete this in September. Additionally, freight income per case continues to gain momentum as our inbound logistics initiatives progress. Lastly, we're driving month-over-month improvement in our service levels to customers, while operating in a very challenging and fairly stagnant vendor supply environment. Our customer service levels, although still just shy of pre-pandemic levels, have improved nearly 120 basis points through the start of the year. Moving on, we continue to invest in enhancing the customer experience. US Foods has led the industry for over 10 years in this area, and digital is paramount to our success. We are launching our next-generation digital tool, which we call MOXe which is all about increased speed, confidence and control for our customers. This is a step change to the customer experience from performance and ease-of-use perspective. MOXe will begin rolling out in the third quarter, and we are excited to bring you more updates in the coming quarters. In Q2, we continued to expand our CHEF'STORE footprint, as well as assortment on our US Foods direct online marketplace. And last but not least, our team-based selling approach and value-added services continue to be differentiators and are helping us drive share gains in key customer types. A recent example is renewing our strategic partnership with Toast. This collaboration demonstrates our commitment to building deeper relationships with our customers by providing the right technology solutions to save time and improve the customer experience. Finally, I want to focus on the significant continued progress that we're making on environment, social and governance, or ESG. We recently launched a partnership with Kalera, one of the world's leading hydroponic indoor vertical farming companies, to expand our portfolio of local farms that we source from to support our served local program. Launched in 2018, the served local program is designed to better connect US Foods' customers with local farmers, producers and manufacturers. Additionally, we remain committed to reducing the environmental footprint of our operations, and recently announced a science-based climate goal to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 32.5% by 2032 from a 2019 base year. We are working to reduce emissions by optimizing routing to reduce miles driven, deploying new lower carbon footprint vehicle technologies and investing in alternative fuels. Plans include converting our compressed natural gas vehicles, or CNG, to renewable natural gas and introducing 42 new CNG vehicles to our fleet by the end of 2022. In addition, our California broadline distribution center fueling stations have been converted to providing renewable diesel fuel for our Vista, Corona, Livermore and La Mirada diesel fleet and our newly opened Sacramento facility leverages renewable diesel fuel at its onsite fueling station. We also plan to introduce 30 new electric trucks into our La Mirada, California fleet by 2023. In our facilities, we continue to optimize the efficiency of our building operations by investing in renewable energy and adopting energy-efficient equipment and technologies. Page 5 illustrates why we believe US Foods is well positioned in the current environment. It starts with our diversified customer mix. Specifically, while restaurants represent over half of our sales mix, we are very focused on other customer types such as Healthcare and Hospitality to continue to propel our business forward. Healthcare and Hospitality were about 1/3 of our business prior to the pandemic, and we would expect them to return closer to that level as these 2 customer types fully recover. We are also driving market share gains in key customer types, independent restaurants continue to perform well and case volumes are well above 2019 levels. As you may recall, US Foods is relentlessly focused on growing with the right customers, leading to ongoing optimization of our customer mix to ensure we are gaining market share profitably. And as a result, we continue to exit a small number of lower margin and/or more complex primarily chain customers and typically replace that business with more profitable and more flexible IND, Healthcare or Hospitality business, as well as chain business that is a better fit and less complex. We are continuing to improve margins of our existing chain business to reflect the current operating environment. In Healthcare, we are pleased to report a positive trend in the case growth relative to 2019. This is a result of new business wins and improved bed occupancy rates in the Senior Living segment, as well as retail shops opening back up in hospital settings. In Hospitality, we continue with significant year-over-year growth. Given the recent macro backdrop, we will be closely monitoring development in this customer type as the increased inflation levels and work from home trends impact customers' willingness to travel. As a pure-play U.S.-only business, we are well positioned to leverage our differentiated tools and capabilities to support the growth of our diverse customers. As I mentioned earlier, this differentiation has historically enabled us to win share in our key customer types and we expect it will continue to enable us to do so. Customers are telling us that they appreciate our service and commitment to helping them grow and to fight through these difficult times. To them, US Foods does much more than just deliver groceries. Additionally, as a reminder, in rising inflationary periods such as these, US Foods is able to pass much of this inflation through via our contracts and pricing tools. Also, as the Healthcare and Hospitality customer types continue to return to 2019 or normal levels, we will benefit from these tailwinds via top line growth and supply chain efficiencies. And lastly, it's important to note that US Foods has a track record of resiliency during challenging economic times. For instance, during the recession of 2008, 2009, US Foods maintained essentially flat earnings and saw our case volume hold up reasonably well, declining only by mid-single digits. With that, let's turn to Page 6 to walk through how our strong performance in the quarter translates into progress on our long-range plan to drive profitable share gains, expand margins and improve operational efficiencies. We are on track to meet or exceed our targeted growth rate of 1.5x the market. We are continuing to win in the marketplace as demonstrated by our share gains in key customer types. As I noted earlier, the US Foods' team-based selling approach continues to be a differentiator relative to our competition and is an important ingredient in our customers' success. The continued expansion of our cash and carry business, CHEF'STORE, illustrates the power of our omnichannel strategy. During Q2, we opened a new store in Lynchburg, Virginia. We expect still to open 4 to 6 stores this year, and are building our capabilities to accelerate that pace in future years. This strategy allows our broadline customers to fill urgent needs between deliveries during the week to help meet demand. It is also an excellent way for potential customers and consumers to get to know the outstanding lineup of US Foods private label products and high-quality fresh offerings. Turning to the margin expansion or optimization pillar, we had strong gross profit results again this quarter. As we shared on our last call, we are seeing significant momentum with our inbound logistics program initiatives. This program continues to drive significant efficiencies and meaningful freight income expansion. Additionally, US Foods continues to grow its exclusive brand penetration rate. For Q2, organic penetration grew by approximately 80 basis points versus the prior year. Our Cost of Goods program is also performing well and ahead of schedule, with approximately 25% of our total vendor spend already under consideration. Turning to operational efficiencies. We are making solid progress in the midst of a very challenging macro environment. First, as a result of our continued focus on routing optimization and network planning, cases per mile across our network are modestly above 2019 levels despite case volume being down mid-single digits compared to 2019. While that is a significant achievement, we still have significant opportunity ahead. As I mentioned earlier, US Foods is on track with our warehouse selection technology rollout, which is expected to be completed later this quarter. I'm excited about this rollout as it will continue to support our warehouse team members and enhance the selection process, leading to better productivity and job satisfaction. Similarly, our outbound service levels to customers continue to deliver month-to-month improvement, which is a testament to the hard work of our associates, given that vendor fill rates remain challenged. It's important to note that the warehouse labor environment remains challenged for us and our industry. However, we are confident that we have the right plans in place to address turnover and associated productivity headwinds. On Page 7, you will see a summary of our strategic imperatives as we enter the second half of 2022. We are encouraged by our LRP momentum, and we'll continue to update you on the performance of our 3 pillars of profitably growing market share, optimizing gross profit and improving operational efficiency. We are and remain relentlessly focused on building upon our first-class customer service program and platform. We will continue to make investments in our business to provide an enhanced and differentiated service platform at US Foods. And finally, as we create value for our shareholders, we will remain prudent around our capital allocation priorities. Our focus continues to be investing in the business, reducing our leverage, returning cash to shareholders and pursuing tuck-in M&A opportunities. We will continue to execute against these priorities and focus on driving long-term growth ahead, and thus, expect to create significant shareholder value. We've made strong progress against our plan to date, and expect to continue building on this momentum. And with that, I'll pass it over to Dirk to review the financial performance.\nDirk Locascio: Thank you, Andrew, and good morning. I'll walk through some highlights on our second quarter and then spend time on several key macro considerations that continue to be a factor in our industry and the broader economy, as well as on our 2022 outlook. I'm on Page 9. Overall, we're very pleased with our second quarter financial results. They demonstrate the continued progress we are making against our plan initiatives and outcomes. Adjusted EBITDA grew 11% from the prior year to $368 million for the quarter. In addition to strong EBITDA dollars, our adjusted EBITDA per case was above Q2 of 2019. Q2 adjusted EBITDA was the best quarter relative to 2019 since the pandemic began. So we're very encouraged with the outcome, which we believe demonstrates the actions we're taking are truly delivering results. Adjusted diluted EPS increased as well, and was $0.67. Q2 net sales were $8.8 billion, which was an increase of 15% over prior year. Total case volume was flat to prior year and food cost inflation was 15%. Our Q2 year-over-year case growth was negatively impacted roughly 375 basis points by the mid-2021 exit of the grocery retail business, we temporarily added during a pandemic and a small number of strategic exits. As you'll recall, Q2 2021 was also the strongest quarter from a volume perspective since the pandemic began with a very strong recovery. I'll talk more about volume on the next page. We continue to drive robust gross profit dollar growth again this quarter. Our adjusted gross profit dollars increased 14% from the prior year, and we generated strong adjusted gross profit per case for the quarter. OpEx remained higher as we continue to invest in staffing and work on improving supply chain employee retention. Reducing turnover remains a top priority for us as we face the challenges higher turnover presents, similar to many other companies. Looking at Page 10. Within volume, independent cases were flat to prior year after growing nearly 80% in the prior year. We had 35% Hospitality growth and 2.4% Healthcare growth, offset by 8.7% lower chain volume and the retail exit impact I noted earlier. Our chain decline was driven largely this quarter by a smaller number of lower profitability and more complex strategic exits. We expect volume to improve through Half 2. The combination of the retail exit and the lower margin strategic exits was about a 375 basis point negative impact on total case growth and had a small impact on net EBITDA. We continue to focus on the health and quality of our customers and on the opportunistically growing with chains while increasing our margins. We delivered share gains again this quarter in key customer types. Specifically, for independent restaurants, Q2 share gains were among the strongest we've seen since the pandemic began, demonstrating we are winning in the market. I talked about volume compared to 2021. However, I know most of us continue to focus on volume relative to 2019 as well as a key anchor of a normal environment. Q2 2022 total case volume was approximately 6% below 2019, which is a more than 200 basis point improvement from Q1. Independent case growth was 4% above 2019. Healthcare cases were about 7% below 2019, demonstrating continued improvement. And hospitality was approximately 15% below 2019, which also has further improved from Q1 results. We're continuing to improve relative to 2019, and are encouraged by the continued share gains in key customer types. On Page 11, through Q2 and as we look at half 2, the macro environment remains challenging for our entire industry and our customers. Starting with labor. The labor market continues to be better than it was in 2021 from a recruitment perspective. In the second quarter, we continued to hire for expected volume growth. Our markets are broadly in a very good position when it comes to staffing. As I talked about last quarter, the primary challenge remains retention, which is not unique to us. Turnover remains higher than it's been historically. For reference, our warehouse turnover is nearly double what it's been historically, and roughly half of that workforce has been with us for less than a year. New associates are significantly less productive than tenured associates. Anecdotally, our understanding is that our retention challenges are very similar to other companies. A positive is that it likely isn't permanent, and we are taking steps to address it, such as limiting hours work for new hires to allow them to ease into the job and retraining our frontline supply chain managers and supervisors on effective management and employee engagement practices and processes. As planned and as Andrew noted, we're finishing the deployment of our new warehouse selection technology and deploying processes, leveraging our continuous improvement team to make the jobs a little easier. With turnover remaining high, we aren't making as much progress on productivity improvements as we expected. However, we are focused and are seeing a number of signs of improvement throughout our network, some of which Andrew discussed earlier. Inflation, whether fuel or food, is something we are watching closely. Food cost inflation continued in the quarter with year-over-year inflation of 15%. Year-over-year inflation has slowed and sequential inflation continues to be below the peaks of mid-2021, which is a positive. Inflation in Q2 has been more in the grocery categories and other categories, and we've continued to be successful in passing it through to customers. We don't expect the supply chain challenges that remain for our industry more broadly that they are likely to be resolved in the near term. We've made continued progress improving our service levels to customers through Q2 despite stagnating vendor service levels. Our Net Promoter Score data indicates our service levels continue to be as good or better than others as we continue to identify and act on ways to improve service for our customers. Overall, volumes remain solid. However, we will continue to watch for behavioral changes. Week-to-week results can vary, and we're watching for trends. Independent growth versus 2019 has continued to be 3% to 4% above 2019 in recent weeks. Healthcare continues to slowly improve and has been roughly 6% below 2019 in recent weeks. Hospitality remains mid-teens below 2019 and has shown continued improvement in recent quarters. We are strategically taking share in key customer types and continue to watch the macro environment for changes in demand. The macro environment remains a challenge. However, our business and industry has recovery tailwinds from Healthcare and Hospitality, and we are seeing share gains in key customer types. We also benefit from serving many customer types and eating away from home as a staple in most people's routines, which makes it quite resilient, potentially even more than in prior downturns. We are pleased with the strength of our Q2 results and we expect to continue making meaningful progress and specifically on actions to improve the continued high turnover in supply chain. We're reaffirming our 2022 fiscal adjusted EBITDA, adjusted diluted EPS, CapEx and net leverage guidance provided in February. However, we now expect higher interest expense to be $245 million to $255 million for the year as a result of the Fed's more aggressive interest rate increases through 2022. And finally, we still expect to achieve the higher end of the earnings outlook range, assuming there's not another Omicron-like wave or macro slowdown. I talked about our Q2 earnings, macro factors and our outlook. Now on Page 12, I'll just spend a moment on our capital structure. We reduced our net leverage compared to the second quarter of 2021 as well as the first quarter of this year. Our net leverage ratio was 4.2x at the end of the second quarter, which is a 1.2x reduction from a year ago and 0.1x reduction from the first quarter of this year. Net debt dollars are relatively flat as we've continued to necessarily invest in working capital via increased receivables from inflation, as well as additional inventory due to the vendor supply challenges we and the industry continue to face. Leverage reduction is one of our four components we outlined as part of our capital allocation strategy, Andrew noted earlier. We continue to make progress toward our leverage goal of 2.5x to 3x net leverage, and are committed to achieving it. Our business has strong cash flow generation, which we expect to use for debt reduction in our other stated priorities. Just in closing, I'm pleased with the significant progress we're making, which we demonstrated in our Q2 results. Now back to Andrew.\nAndrew Iacobucci: Thanks, Dirk. In conclusion, US Foods continues to make progress in executing our long-range plan. Despite ongoing challenges in the macro environment, we continue to deliver positive results. This is a testament to the hard work of all our associates at US Foods, and I thank all of them for their continued focus on execution and dedication to serving our customers. With that, operator, please open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We will now take our first question. Please go ahead, caller. Your line is open.\nLauren Silberman: This is Lauren Silberman from Credit Suisse. I wanted to ask about independent case growth. Volumes up 4% versus '19, I believe you said, which looks like an acceleration from 1Q. So can you talk about what's driving that underlying acceleration? How much is coming from new customer acquisition versus wallet share is where are you running with independent customer accounts versus '19? And then you mentioned, I think, case growth remains 3% to 4% above '19 in recent weeks. Can we assume you're not seeing any meaningful shift in customer behavior trends?\nAndrew Iacobucci: Yes, Lauren, it's Andrew. Thanks for the question. I'll try and remember the parts to it. So remind me if I miss any of them. Yes, I think overall, we feel very good about the momentum we're seeing in our independent restaurant growth. And I would say that the growth is being generated through, I'd say, a pretty balanced mix between increasing penetration with the existing customers, as well as going after new. We are still slightly down in terms of our customer count versus '19, but we are seeing a significant improvement in our share of wallet as we move forward. That momentum and sort of the improvement, I think, you would attribute to really, given the market itself, has probably been largely flat from 1 to 2. We've actually seen a pretty sizable, as Dirk mentioned, one of the best share improvements we've seen and certainly significantly better than we were in Q1 in terms of our market share in the IND segment. So feeling, I think, really good about the momentum. We haven't seen, as Dirk mentioned, a meaningful change in behavior, although obviously, that is something we're monitoring very closely. But the fact that we've been able to gain share in this environment also gives us some optimism that we will be able to mitigate the impact, if any of -- any slowing of demand on the independent segment. Did I cover all your questions? Or was there any...\nLauren Silberman: Yes, you did. You're great. If I could just ask one more. Does on the long-term targets, I know a lot of uncertainty in the environment, should we see a more challenging consumer environment? What gives you confidence in delivering on the longer-term guide or to what extent is sort of that macro uncertainty being factored in?\nDirk Locascio: Lauren, this is Dirk. So ultimately, I think the important thing to come back to is our focus in the plan, which is control the controllables, and we put a plan in place that we feel very good about. We're continuing to execute. Our last 2 quarters have really shown good progress against that. And I think that the thing that we've learned during COVID is you need to be agile, nimble or if you want to put it. And so as we see the environments adjust, we'll adjust accordingly, but we're continuing to execute against our plan and very pleased with the progress we're making.\nOperator: We will now take our next question. Please go ahead, caller. Your line is open.\nEdward Kelly: It's Ed Kelly at Wells Fargo. I just wanted to start with a quick follow-up on case volumes. Can you just provide a bit more color on the decision to exit some of the lower margin contract accounts? I mean, obviously, this has been part of your strategy in the past, so it's not new. But on the other hand, you still have -- you do have volumes below '19. I'm just kind of curious as to the calculus there. And then as we think about the back half, I think Dirk mentioned you expect case volume to improve. So I just want to make sure what you're saying there. Do you -- are you saying that you expect organic total case volume to be up in the back half?\nAndrew Iacobucci: Ed, it's Andrew. Why don't I start, and I'll ask Dirk to maybe weigh in on additional detail. As far as the case volumes picture, I think we do feel and have sort of approached things, as we always have, of saying we want to grow in the right way, which is a profitable case growth. And given the environment we are in, we've been working very closely with our customers, particularly the larger chain groups to ensure that we are -- we have arrangements that are reflective of the environment we're operating in. Our goal in all of those conversations is to continue to drive the business forward and work together. But where we aren't able to find an operating model and an arrangement with those customers, we have made the decision in a relatively small number of cases to exit. And that is something that we would do, but we would do it typically as a last resort. As far as the back half, maybe I'll turn it to Dirk to talk a little bit about how we're thinking about that.\nDirk Locascio: Sure. So Ed, we would expect to see continued improvement relative to 2019 from where we've been trending, assuming a stable macro environment and continuing to improve against that. I think the other point is we're very pleased with the strength of our independent volume and the continued share gains that Andrew talked about. On the chains and then a small number of education customers, this has been part of the plan. And so I think we've been deliberate. Of course, there is the retail business that we picked up during COVID that I talked about last quarter. So there should be no surprises on that. But on the chains and the education, I think on that one, our focus has been to be opportunistic on those who were the right fit from a financial and complexity perspective. And I think even as one of our competitors has talked about, and you see where they have dedicated chain facilities, they are breakeven. It really is one where being opportunistic versus just growing for the sake of growing in a particular area is the right answer. And we're seeing that show up in higher EBITDA per case. We're seeing this show up in earnings growth and continued improvement there. So we believe our strategy is the right one, and we're going to continue to focus on growing with independent Healthcare and Hospitality and then be very thoughtful and opportunistic on the other customer types.\nOperator: We will now take our next question. Please go ahead, caller. Your line is open.\nJohn Glass: It's John Glass from Morgan Stanley. First, if I could just further more clarify in cases and then I would add a real question. Is this the last quarter you're going to be lapping the grocery exit so that shouldn't be a factor in the back half? And can you quantify what the impact of those chain restaurant exits? Because I assume that will impact future, 4 quarters or 3 quarters. So just what's the quantum of that? And the question is what you're doing to reduce labor turnover, improve efficiency, I understand about training in hours and et cetera. But is there something more meaningful? I mean, your biggest competitor talked about going to a 4-day work week, for example, is one way to do that. Are there bigger ideas that can really advance that turnover and efficiency and lifestyle to make this more attractive job that you're contemplating?\nDirk Locascio: I'll start with the first part, and then maybe Andrew can talk about the second part on retention or turnover. On that one, for the quarter, there will be some impact. It will be lesser in the third quarter from the retail exit, and then that will be the last quarter, it's impacted. But just for reference, out of the roughly 375 basis points impact in Q2, in order of magnitude, about 2/3 of that is the retail and about 1/3 of it is the chain exits. So that helps you size up the impact across there. I think the other thing to -- when you look at year-over-year, that's important, too, on the chains is if you go and you see we were kind of at the peak last year in Q2 with chains where we had onboarded some of the new customers, we hadn't yet exited some of the planned exits. So again, this is all sort of part of the plan, but hopefully, that's helpful on the go forward. Andrew, you want to talk about retention?\nAndrew Iacobucci: Yes, sure. And I think, on the labor front, we feel good about our staffing situation. We are substantially staffed in almost all our markets at this point. And what continues to be the challenge, as Dirk mentioned, is our ability to stand the turnover type. We are aggressively exploring and implementing flexible shift lengths to allow our colleagues to be able to have a schedule that fits their needs. We've also taken some steps to significantly reduce shift lengths for our new hires. We find that's typically where the greatest turnover comes from is from that group because it's a tough job, let's face it. And our ability to minimize those early shifts to get them -- allow them to sort of harden themselves to the work, I think, is helping a lot in that area. And then really importantly, because we all know that turnover is much a function of who you work for than anything else, we've taken some pretty aggressive steps to really invest in leadership training and development for our frontline leaders, our supervisors and managers. They are really the critical linchpin in that relationship in markets where we've seen turnover in a better position that typically it's a direct result of that strong leadership. And so we've seen -- it's early days to really start to see significant results from that. But we have seen some very promising signs coming out of that leadership training, and we expect that to continue.\nOperator: We will now take our next question. Please go ahead, caller. Your line is open.\nPeter Saleh: It's Peter Saleh from BTIG. A number of restaurants have talked about seasonality returning to the industry, something that they haven't had since 2019. Are you guys seeing that as well? Are you seeing seasonality? Did you feel like trends maybe slowed a little bit during the summer? And are you expecting that to kind of pick up and get back to normal seasonality as we head into the fall?\nAndrew Iacobucci: Pete, it's Andrew. I think we would say it's a little hard to tell given the volatility that still is out there. But overall, I think there is certainly a little bit more normalcy returning to the rhythm of our business, which I think is a positive sign. But again, I think right now, it's a little hard to declare it as a trend.\nPeter Saleh: Great. And then just on the food cost inflation, I know this quarter was 15%. I think that was a little bit -- a couple of hundred basis points less than what you saw in the first quarter. What are you anticipating in terms of food cost inflation in the back end of the year?\nAndrew Iacobucci: I think we are -- it's obviously hard to predict where we expect things to go. I think we've certainly seen a slowing in the rate of increase, but we don't -- we certainly don't expect deflation anytime soon. But we are watching it very carefully, not only from a cost of goods standpoint, but also in terms of the impact it's having on demand, and ultimately, our customers. So we have felt pretty good about, not only the ability of our organization to pass along that those inflation costs through the cost plus pricing that we typically have in our contracts, but we've also made really great strides working with our customers to help them manage through the inflationary environment, which is something that I think really has paid some big dividends as we continue to help them with ways to address some of their menu types to steer clear of more inflation impacted categories to look at portion sizing and other factors as well. And that's really something that, again, is really true to the brand of US Foods, something that we really are very proud of.\nOperator: We will now take our next question. Please go ahead, caller. Your line is open.\nNicole Miller: This is Nicole Miller from Piper Sandler. The first question, you've addressed turnover. But I was wondering to compare and contrast kind of the truck driver, DC selector and also the salesperson tenure and turnover. And the real question is, when they work in concert, when you're at your best in any one market locally or in terms of execution, what kind of wallet share gains can you achieve versus where you stand at average?\nAndrew Iacobucci: Nicole, it's Andrew. So I think your first question is how has turnover varied across a driver versus selector versus seller. And what I would say is we've seen very consistent turnover within our sellers, in fact, even a little bit less than usual we've seen in past years. Drivers has seen considerably less increase in turnover versus pre-pandemic levels. It's the selector area where we've seen, as I think Dirk mentioned, twice the turnover rates than we saw pre-pandemic. So that's really where the bulk of the -- when we talk about turnover, that's really the main place that we're seeing it. And your second question, which is a great one, around the relationship between the 3. Certainly, the driver and seller relationship is an incredibly important one, because both have such a significant impact on our customer experience. And that's why I think seeing -- especially seeing the reduction in an already lower level of turnover in the driver community has been very positive. And one of the things we've actually started to do more intentionally is really creating a working relationship between the driver and the seller to ensure that any feedback that comes from either of them is passed along to the other, and that's actually really, I think, pretty significantly enhancing the relationship that they have with our customers as a consequence.\nNicole Miller: And then just how would you characterize the inbound fill rates to you, the outbound sell rates to your customers? And is there an opportunity to backhaul with your drivers?\nAndrew Iacobucci: Yes. So we have seen continued improvement in our customer service level, which is the thing we're most concerned about. And what I think is most sort of positive in that trend is that we've been able to do so with vendor fill rates that have been largely flat relative to where they were to start the year. There's been a bit of an improvement, but not significant. And it's been, I think, a real achievement on the part of the replenishment organization to be able to drive that continued month-over-month improvement in our service level to our customers despite the fact that we are still seeing pretty poor service from an inbound. And the particular challenge there is that the nature of those fill rate challenges. It tends to change from day-to-day and week-to-week. It's not always the same categories and so a little bit of a moving target. But generally speaking, I think we feel very good about the progress that we've made in handling that.\nDirk Locascio: To your second part, just on the backhaul, we definitely -- we backhaul a meaningful portion of our inbound cases ourselves. And that, along with a number of the other initiatives we have going, are contributing to the very strong results we've seen in our inbound logistics or freight income year-to-date. But that remains a focus.\nNicole Miller: And just the last one, deflation. I mean, it may sound silly now because it would require supply our shipping demand and really easing labor conditions, and none of that seems likely. But can you just remind us what happens like by type of contract? How does deflation flow through gross profit? How does it flow through OpEx, et cetera?\nDirk Locascio: Sure. So if it's a product deflation, it doesn't flow through OpEx as much versus it shows up and up in gross profit. And the portion of our customer contracts that are a fixed markup per case or per pound, et cetera, in that case, you're still making the same markup, so it doesn't impact profitability at all. If you see it in the portion of our contracts that are a percentage markup over, if you have deflation, it can decrease that profitability a little bit. What we see over time though, oftentimes is a lot of the center of the plate is fixed, which can be more volatile. So that means over time, that's can be a little volatile if it goes up or down, but over time is a meaningful impact. And then on the grocery, a lot of the suppliers over time, they tend to go one way from the ultimate manufacturers. So I think when we think through that, we are watching it closely, we have a playbook that we run for inflation and deflation to manage it. But as we noted earlier, don't expect inflation to show up sort of broad scale in the near term.\nOperator: We will now take our next question. Please go ahead, caller. Your line is open.\nJohn Heinbockel: John Heinbockel, Guggenheim. So guys, let me start with drop size. Really focused on comparable restaurant locations, right? Whether they be independent or chain. What are you seeing with drop size, right? I imagine it's up, right, because locations are down, I think. Is it up low to mid-single digit? And then obviously, that's probably 2x the incremental margin. Is that a material benefit to the P&L now and kind of going forward, meaning, I don't know if it's tens of millions of dollars, but is it a material benefit as we sit here today?\nAndrew Iacobucci: John, it's Andrew. You may have to repeat the second half of your question just to make sure I got it. But on the first half around drop side, I would say we are seeing a small increase in our drop size, as I think we've reported for the reason that you mentioned. Remind me the second half of your question.\nJohn Heinbockel: Well, the incremental margin on that, right? It's not your gross margin. But it's got to be 2x, 2.5x normal margin. So that is a clear benefit to the P&L as we sit today, and do you think that will continue?\nAndrew Iacobucci: Yes, definitely a clear benefit. We won't quantify the range of it, but it's certainly significant given the incremental cost of those additional cases or the marginal cost of those additional cases are relatively low. As far as continuing, that's certainly an area, as I mentioned, our share gains, especially in the IND space, have been a pretty good mix of growing share of wallet and new. And we do expect that to continue. And certainly a big focus of the independent seller organization is to continue to grow our penetration with existing customers.\nDirk Locascio: John, just one other thing I would add. I think the other opportunity that still lies ahead is as you see volume continue to come back in Healthcare and Hospitality. A lot of that shows up with existing customers. And so that helps from a drop size perspective for those customers, which are already pretty attractive from the drop sizes they tend to have.\nJohn Heinbockel: The other thing I was going to ask, right, is what maybe makes this environment a little different in some respects than the past, right, is this tightness in labor? So if we get -- I don't think we're going to see deflation, right? But as we get disinflation, do you think either the timing lines up, right, the top line deflates at the same time that labor cost is easing or the environment creates, right, the macro environment creates an easing? Or do you have to kind of tee up some proactive cost outs in case the top line deflates and labor doesn't? How do you think about that?\nDirk Locascio: Sure. I think they're kind of -- where you're going. There are 2 separate levers because the top line sort of is more automatic and you manage your way through it. I think the -- as said, we would expect for the foreseeable future that, to your point, is essentially modest inflation and/or likely not deflation. I think that shows up a little quicker on the cost side. That is one where you have to be more proactive in the way you manage through that than you do on the GP side. What I'll come back to, what I talked about earlier, is, through COVID, what we really learned is, again, the need to be agile. And as we see in that environment, on the product side, we have very good playbooks on how we're running in inflation and deflation. And then on the cost side, always are looking as to how to effectively manage that across the different spectrums of the cost.\nAndrew Iacobucci: But John, maybe just to address the question on labor tightness being a benefit. That certainly will be. I mean, one of the challenges that we face with the turnover levels that we are seeing right now is just the costs associated with the recruitment, hiring and onboarding of those associates, as well as the impact that it has on productivity. So I think that will certainly be an important aspect if we do start to see some loosening in that labor environment.\nOperator: We will now take our next question. Please go ahead, caller. Your line is open.\nBrian Mullan: Brian Mullan, Deutsche Bank. My question is on the strategic vendor management opportunity. I believe this is an important component of the long-term plan. Maybe could you just speak to what the organization is doing differently today versus how it managed this area of the business prior? And then just zooming in a bit. Just wonder if you could speak to your degree of confidence in this sitting here in August, maybe relative to how you felt earlier this year. How are the strategies progressing? Are your partners being receptive? Are you finding win-win situations in your negotiations? Just any color.\nAndrew Iacobucci: I think there's -- first of all, as I said in my remarks, we're feeling very good about the progression of that initiative. We're actually ahead of our schedule on that. And really, the opportunity there and what's maybe a little different today than perhaps in the past, a couple of things. First, we have had -- the volatility of the last couple of years has obviously made it difficult to sort of benchmark our cost of goods, as well as precisely as perhaps we've been able to in the past. And so I think this is really a large part is just going back and making sure that we are continuing to be in this competitive position as we can, given our scale. And I think in terms of the confidence we feel today versus earlier this year or last, I think, has grown as a consequence of the really very productive nature of the conversations that we've had thus far. We have found significant opportunities for mutual wins. I think just given the way the world is right now, there are some opportunities to work more closely together to find ways that will not only help us ultimately from a cost of goods standpoint, but also help our vendors from a production efficiency standpoint. And those are the conversations that have really yielded the greatest fruit thus far.\nBrian Mullan: And then just a follow-up, just a question on the permanent CEO search. Understanding there's only so much you can maybe say, just can you comment on how that's going, if the pool of candidates is starting to narrow down in any way? And then related, is there a priority or a preference to find someone from inside the food distribution industry? Or is that not a particular mandate of the Board at this time?\nAndrew Iacobucci: Bob, do you want to take that?\nRobert Dutkowsky: Yes. It's Bob Dutkowsky. I think I'll try to take a shot at that. So we're really pleased with the progress that we've made in terms of searching for the next CEO. We quickly formed a search committee, we built a spec that we believe can lead the company into the future, we hired a search firm and started the process. We're really searching for a proven public company C-suite executive. It would be great if they had experience relative to US Foods, but a supply chain executive, for example, not in the food industry could be a very good candidate. We're really searching for an executive that has a track record of creating shareholder value, and importantly, one that embraces the culture of US Foods. So we have a really good plan. We're well into the process. The search firm has identified a very strong list of candidates, and we've begun the interviewing process. So we're really pleased with where we are with the process.\nOperator: We will now take our next question. Please go ahead, caller. Your line is open.\nJake Bartlett: This is Jake Bartlett from Truist Securities. My first is on the chain business and the exit there. It seems like very recently, last quarter, we were talking about onboarding chain business. And I'm wondering whether this is maybe an indication that the customers are -- now that the supply chain, maybe, disruptions or less of an issue and the ability to service the customer is maybe more broadly able to be done, whether this is a sign of pushback on pricing or whether customers generally are feeling like they can now look around for better prices and whether that could be more of an impact as we go throughout the year.\nAndrew Iacobucci: Jake, it's Andrew. First of all, I think it's important to say that our net new versus lost in chain is actually up slightly. So I wouldn't necessarily characterize this as a net negative. And it certainly doesn't signal in any way a move away from the right kind of chain business, which is where we've seen the growth coming from, chains that have more of a urban presence, as well as more of an independent restaurant-type offering, have been proven to be very attractive customers and the ones that we are quite happily brought on board. And in addition, as I said, exit is the last resort. We've typically worked with them to find opportunities for the vast majority of our existing customers that has been the outcome.\nDirk Locascio: Just, Jake, if I could add. This is Dirk. So actually, the exits that we're talking about in chain are where they are part of the strategic exit plan. Our regrettable losses remain quite low across our customer types and continue to have a good pipeline there from a growth perspective.\nJake Bartlett: Great. And then just one on operating expenses. You mentioned that the training costs are still high over time and may be temporary workers. I'm wondering what kind of -- what level of cost in the second quarter here that are might not be worth recurring? Just trying to gauge what kind of a benefit we might have as we go forward from the elevated costs that you've seen over the last, call it, 1.5 years.\nDirk Locascio: Sure. So the last couple of quarters, we haven't specifically quantified that. But what I will just say is it remains similar to the last few quarters, and it really is largely driven by, what Andrew talked about, the higher level of turnover. And as we see these green shoots in different areas of the business, whether it's productivity or other pieces there that we would expect to build upon those. And we'll talk more about it as we make progress. I think the important thing to take away, though, is even though retention, again, which is a kind of industry and even broader issue, even with that being the case, we are still seeing progress, whether it be the routing initiative that Andrew talked about, whether it be some of the other things there around our process redesign, around inbound receiving product, et cetera, there, that are showing gains. So we know the things we're doing are generating some gains. Unfortunately, in the macro environment, we and others just are still battling with the retention and continue to be relentlessly focused on things to address it.\nOperator: We will now take our next question. Please go ahead, caller. Your line is open.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. This is Jeff Bernstein from Barclays. Two questions. One, just on the fundamentals of the business. I think you mentioned no change of late in terms of volumes. But more broadly, I know chain volumes were down close to 10% this past quarter. I'm wondering how much of that is the conscious exits you mentioned, otherwise, any common themes with the accounts that you're seeing, anything maybe by consumer income level? Are you seeing any changes or quick service versus casual dining? Any kind of color in terms of the change by account or any color on that chain volume being down that 10%. And then I have one follow-up.\nDirk Locascio: Sure. Jeff, it's Dirk. So overall, the 2 contributors mainly to the chain being down are, we talked about the strategic exits. And then if you recall, last quarter, we talked about softness in a couple of specific concepts, and we continue to see that, and they happen to be a larger concept. So what we're not seeing is we're not seeing any widespread trends, softening, et cetera, across different types within the chains. And we see that some -- whether it's in fast casual, QSR, et cetera, you see winners and losers across the different ones. But not any specific trend that I would call out at this point. And I think the thing in change that we are continuing to see and do is move toward those customers that continue to be a better fit, and we're seeing good results with that.\nAndrew Iacobucci: Yes. Jeff, it's Andrew. The other, I think, we would say is that we haven't -- we've been watching carefully for it, but have not seen any meaningful sort of trading down within menu types either. And that's something that, again, when we say no meaningful change in behavior, that's one of the things we look at very closely.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Understood. And then in terms of just the broader food service distribution industry, I mean, are you seeing rational competitive behavior? I mean, obviously, these are unusual times for, well, for you guys for sure and for the industry more broadly. Just trying to get a sense for how you see the behavior of your competitive set, both large and small?\nAndrew Iacobucci: Yes, I think we would describe it as a rational market right now for sure. There is obviously the volatility that continues as well as the ongoing inflation have both been real challenges. We have not seen any significant sort of irrational behavior at this point.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Got it. And then lastly, Bob, I appreciate your contribution to the question earlier. Just wondering, in terms of the most recent Board additions, just wondering, we obviously don't get a look inside the boardroom, but what are the kind of the areas of initial focus? Or would you call it constructive dialogue? Any change in maybe brand direction? Or how those early conversations going as you now have kind of a significant change in some of the members on the Board?\nRobert Dutkowsky: Yes, it's a very good question here. We've added 5 new Board members since the beginning of the year. So they brought to the board room a fresh perspective, a different set of skills. And we're really very, very encouraged by the addition of the new Board members. They're aggressively oriented to the US Foods and have jumped into their areas of expertise really aggressively. I'll give you one example. We added 2 executives that have supply chain experience, Jim Barber and Quentin Roach. Both of them have engaged with Bill Hancock, our leader of the supply chain, and have brought really interesting ideas around productivity and staffing that are things that we're aggressively deploying. So we're thrilled with the new additions. And really, we now have a very, very strong Board in place that we're real pleased with.\nOperator: We will now take our next question. Please go ahead, caller. Your line is open.\nAlexander Slagle: It's Alex Slagle from Jefferies. First, a clarification on the guidance in the release, you talked about continued confidence towards the higher end of the EBITDA range, and wasn't sure if that also applied to the EPS guide or would the leaning on the EPS range move towards the lower end just with the higher interest expense or if there's an offset there?\nDirk Locascio: Sure. So yes, confident in the outlook for EBITDA. On EPS, I still expect stronger. I think that's not quite at the strength of the high end, given the higher interest expense, but still feel like a good strong EPS outcome that likely still leans sort of in the upper half, again, assuming an environment that remains similar to where we're in.\nAlexander Slagle: Okay. And then a follow-up question on freight and your work optimizing the vendor allowances and everything there and just to get additional color. How the progress in the second quarter compared to the first quarter, which seemed like it was a very solid improvement in the first quarter. And maybe if you have any comment on how your freight income per case compares to '19 levels.\nAndrew Iacobucci: Yes, Alex, it's Andrew. We're very pleased with the progress the team has made on freight. And we would say actually been a slight acceleration versus the very strong progress we saw in Q1 and Q2. And it's a function of really just getting underneath the arrangements we have in place to look not only to take over lanes where they're appropriate, but also to push them back when the profitability equation just doesn't make sense. We've also, I think, made really strong progress. And this is an important, I think, catalyst here is that we've made great progress engaging our vendors on a more regular basis, just given the way in which the freight markets have been volatile of late -- really over the last 2 or 3 years. Finding ways to kind of get more flexibility in the rate adjustments that our vendors are making, which used to be only really once a year as, I think, been a really important contributor to the progress that we've made.\nOperator: Just to advise, we only have time for two more questions. We will now take our next question. Please go ahead, caller. Your line is open.\nMark Carden: It's Mark Carden on from UBS. To start, are you seeing any changes in how customers are shopping our cash-and-carry stores? Do you see much of an uptick in interest over the past quarter just given some of the macro pressures that are out there? And then, are you seeing any major differences between your legacy Smart Foodservice locations and your legacy CHEF'STORE ones?\nAndrew Iacobucci: Mark, it's Andrew. I would say we haven't seen a really significant change in customer behavior in terms of the composition of it nor the categories they're shopping. That's been pretty consistent really throughout. And in terms of between the legacy foods CHEF'STORE versus Foodservice stores again, I wouldn't see a big a big gap in their behavior. We are very pleased since we're on the topic to welcome [indiscernible] to the team. He's now leading that organization, and he comes with a tremendous retail background and has a ton of great ideas and first among them is, as I mentioned in my remarks, is to find an opportunity to really accelerate the rate at which we roll out new CHEF'STORE because we really are extremely pleased with the performance of that business and really are looking for opportunities to continue to expand it.\nMark Carden: Great. That's helpful. And then have you seen much of an increase in private label demand from restaurants and others to help reduce costs and offset some of the pressures that they're facing? Has penetration really picked up relative to the last few quarters? Or has demand remain pretty consistent across the board?\nAndrew Iacobucci: Well, as I mentioned, we saw an 80 basis point improvement year-over-year in exclusive brands. We think that is, in part, a function of the better value proposition that it offers our customers. And we are continuing to make sure we are driving that business as aggressively forward as we can. Supply challenges have been a bit of an issue in the past, but we are starting to see that ease up pretty considerably as we've been able to source as needed additional sources of supply for our exclusive brand products. So yes, definitely, we believe an opportunity in this environment and one we will continue to pursue aggressively.\nOperator: We will now take our last question. Please go ahead, caller. Your line is open.\nKelly Bania: This is Kelly Bania from BMO. Just wanted to ask a little bit about how you think case volumes might respond in a moderating inflationary environment? And do you think that inflation is depressing volumes today? And maybe just how you think about that by your different customer segments like, especially Healthcare and Hospitality, that might be less economically sensitive?\nAndrew Iacobucci: Kelly, it's Andrew. As we said previously, we have not seen a meaningful change in behavior over the last couple of quarters in spite of the inflation levels that we're seeing. So it's hard to predict what will happen. It's hard to predict how any moderation will occur in which categories. So unfortunately, I don't have a great answer for you on that. But I think in the main, we feel -- what we do feel good about is our ability even in an inflationary environment to continue to drive market share gains through our great sales organization, as well as the great existing relationships, finding ways to build our share of wallet within those customers.\nKelly Bania: Got it. And then just in terms of the Healthcare and Hospitality, or maybe more the Healthcare, I guess. What do you think is the catalyst to really get that back to where you think it can be?\nDirk Locascio: Kelly, I am Dirk. I think on that one, it's just -- a lot of it is continued confidence in people's comfort in getting back out to -- getting their seniors into Senior Living facilities as bed occupancy rates have continued to very slowly tick up. Also, I think some of it in acute or hospital systems and staffing, they continue to staff up and being able to reopen catering and the like. So it really is -- that is one where -- because we have a fair bit of business in Healthcare, it means a little slower recovery for us perhaps than some others. But we are seeing that continued improvement really each quarter that goes by. And that continues to be very encouraging. And we think that as we continue -- as people continue to build confidence that, that hopefully continues.\nOperator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back to Mr. Shah for any additional or closing remarks.\nSnehal Shah: Thank you, everyone, for participating today, and we will follow up shortly after the call. Thank you, and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Dirk Locascio",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrew, and good morning. I'll walk through some highlights on our second quarter and then spend time on several key macro considerations that continue to be a factor in our industry and the broader economy, as well as on our 2022 outlook. I'm on Page 9. Overall, we're very pleased with our second quarter financial results. They demonstrate the continued progress we are making against our plan initiatives and outcomes. Adjusted EBITDA grew 11% from the prior year to $368 million for the quarter. In addition to strong EBITDA dollars, our adjusted EBITDA per case was above Q2 of 2019. Q2 adjusted EBITDA was the best quarter relative to 2019 since the pandemic began. So we're very encouraged with the outcome, which we believe demonstrates the actions we're taking are truly delivering results. Adjusted diluted EPS increased as well, and was $0.67. Q2 net sales were $8.8 billion, which was an increase of 15% over prior year. Total case volume was flat to prior year and food cost inflation was 15%. Our Q2 year-over-year case growth was negatively impacted roughly 375 basis points by the mid-2021 exit of the grocery retail business, we temporarily added during a pandemic and a small number of strategic exits. As you'll recall, Q2 2021 was also the strongest quarter from a volume perspective since the pandemic began with a very strong recovery. I'll talk more about volume on the next page. We continue to drive robust gross profit dollar growth again this quarter. Our adjusted gross profit dollars increased 14% from the prior year, and we generated strong adjusted gross profit per case for the quarter. OpEx remained higher as we continue to invest in staffing and work on improving supply chain employee retention. Reducing turnover remains a top priority for us as we face the challenges higher turnover presents, similar to many other companies. Looking at Page 10. Within volume, independent cases were flat to prior year after growing nearly 80% in the prior year. We had 35% Hospitality growth and 2.4% Healthcare growth, offset by 8.7% lower chain volume and the retail exit impact I noted earlier. Our chain decline was driven largely this quarter by a smaller number of lower profitability and more complex strategic exits. We expect volume to improve through Half 2. The combination of the retail exit and the lower margin strategic exits was about a 375 basis point negative impact on total case growth and had a small impact on net EBITDA. We continue to focus on the health and quality of our customers and on the opportunistically growing with chains while increasing our margins. We delivered share gains again this quarter in key customer types. Specifically, for independent restaurants, Q2 share gains were among the strongest we've seen since the pandemic began, demonstrating we are winning in the market. I talked about volume compared to 2021. However, I know most of us continue to focus on volume relative to 2019 as well as a key anchor of a normal environment. Q2 2022 total case volume was approximately 6% below 2019, which is a more than 200 basis point improvement from Q1. Independent case growth was 4% above 2019. Healthcare cases were about 7% below 2019, demonstrating continued improvement. And hospitality was approximately 15% below 2019, which also has further improved from Q1 results. We're continuing to improve relative to 2019, and are encouraged by the continued share gains in key customer types. On Page 11, through Q2 and as we look at half 2, the macro environment remains challenging for our entire industry and our customers. Starting with labor. The labor market continues to be better than it was in 2021 from a recruitment perspective. In the second quarter, we continued to hire for expected volume growth. Our markets are broadly in a very good position when it comes to staffing. As I talked about last quarter, the primary challenge remains retention, which is not unique to us. Turnover remains higher than it's been historically. For reference, our warehouse turnover is nearly double what it's been historically, and roughly half of that workforce has been with us for less than a year. New associates are significantly less productive than tenured associates. Anecdotally, our understanding is that our retention challenges are very similar to other companies. A positive is that it likely isn't permanent, and we are taking steps to address it, such as limiting hours work for new hires to allow them to ease into the job and retraining our frontline supply chain managers and supervisors on effective management and employee engagement practices and processes. As planned and as Andrew noted, we're finishing the deployment of our new warehouse selection technology and deploying processes, leveraging our continuous improvement team to make the jobs a little easier. With turnover remaining high, we aren't making as much progress on productivity improvements as we expected. However, we are focused and are seeing a number of signs of improvement throughout our network, some of which Andrew discussed earlier. Inflation, whether fuel or food, is something we are watching closely. Food cost inflation continued in the quarter with year-over-year inflation of 15%. Year-over-year inflation has slowed and sequential inflation continues to be below the peaks of mid-2021, which is a positive. Inflation in Q2 has been more in the grocery categories and other categories, and we've continued to be successful in passing it through to customers. We don't expect the supply chain challenges that remain for our industry more broadly that they are likely to be resolved in the near term. We've made continued progress improving our service levels to customers through Q2 despite stagnating vendor service levels. Our Net Promoter Score data indicates our service levels continue to be as good or better than others as we continue to identify and act on ways to improve service for our customers. Overall, volumes remain solid. However, we will continue to watch for behavioral changes. Week-to-week results can vary, and we're watching for trends. Independent growth versus 2019 has continued to be 3% to 4% above 2019 in recent weeks. Healthcare continues to slowly improve and has been roughly 6% below 2019 in recent weeks. Hospitality remains mid-teens below 2019 and has shown continued improvement in recent quarters. We are strategically taking share in key customer types and continue to watch the macro environment for changes in demand. The macro environment remains a challenge. However, our business and industry has recovery tailwinds from Healthcare and Hospitality, and we are seeing share gains in key customer types. We also benefit from serving many customer types and eating away from home as a staple in most people's routines, which makes it quite resilient, potentially even more than in prior downturns. We are pleased with the strength of our Q2 results and we expect to continue making meaningful progress and specifically on actions to improve the continued high turnover in supply chain. We're reaffirming our 2022 fiscal adjusted EBITDA, adjusted diluted EPS, CapEx and net leverage guidance provided in February. However, we now expect higher interest expense to be $245 million to $255 million for the year as a result of the Fed's more aggressive interest rate increases through 2022. And finally, we still expect to achieve the higher end of the earnings outlook range, assuming there's not another Omicron-like wave or macro slowdown. I talked about our Q2 earnings, macro factors and our outlook. Now on Page 12, I'll just spend a moment on our capital structure. We reduced our net leverage compared to the second quarter of 2021 as well as the first quarter of this year. Our net leverage ratio was 4.2x at the end of the second quarter, which is a 1.2x reduction from a year ago and 0.1x reduction from the first quarter of this year. Net debt dollars are relatively flat as we've continued to necessarily invest in working capital via increased receivables from inflation, as well as additional inventory due to the vendor supply challenges we and the industry continue to face. Leverage reduction is one of our four components we outlined as part of our capital allocation strategy, Andrew noted earlier. We continue to make progress toward our leverage goal of 2.5x to 3x net leverage, and are committed to achieving it. Our business has strong cash flow generation, which we expect to use for debt reduction in our other stated priorities. Just in closing, I'm pleased with the significant progress we're making, which we demonstrated in our Q2 results. Now back to Andrew. Lauren, this is Dirk. So ultimately, I think the important thing to come back to is our focus in the plan, which is control the controllables, and we put a plan in place that we feel very good about. We're continuing to execute. Our last 2 quarters have really shown good progress against that. And I think that the thing that we've learned during COVID is you need to be agile, nimble or if you want to put it. And so as we see the environments adjust, we'll adjust accordingly, but we're continuing to execute against our plan and very pleased with the progress we're making. Sure. So Ed, we would expect to see continued improvement relative to 2019 from where we've been trending, assuming a stable macro environment and continuing to improve against that. I think the other point is we're very pleased with the strength of our independent volume and the continued share gains that Andrew talked about. On the chains and then a small number of education customers, this has been part of the plan. And so I think we've been deliberate. Of course, there is the retail business that we picked up during COVID that I talked about last quarter. So there should be no surprises on that. But on the chains and the education, I think on that one, our focus has been to be opportunistic on those who were the right fit from a financial and complexity perspective. And I think even as one of our competitors has talked about, and you see where they have dedicated chain facilities, they are breakeven. It really is one where being opportunistic versus just growing for the sake of growing in a particular area is the right answer. And we're seeing that show up in higher EBITDA per case. We're seeing this show up in earnings growth and continued improvement there. So we believe our strategy is the right one, and we're going to continue to focus on growing with independent Healthcare and Hospitality and then be very thoughtful and opportunistic on the other customer types. I'll start with the first part, and then maybe Andrew can talk about the second part on retention or turnover. On that one, for the quarter, there will be some impact. It will be lesser in the third quarter from the retail exit, and then that will be the last quarter, it's impacted. But just for reference, out of the roughly 375 basis points impact in Q2, in order of magnitude, about 2/3 of that is the retail and about 1/3 of it is the chain exits. So that helps you size up the impact across there. I think the other thing to -- when you look at year-over-year, that's important, too, on the chains is if you go and you see we were kind of at the peak last year in Q2 with chains where we had onboarded some of the new customers, we hadn't yet exited some of the planned exits. So again, this is all sort of part of the plan, but hopefully, that's helpful on the go forward. Andrew, you want to talk about retention? To your second part, just on the backhaul, we definitely -- we backhaul a meaningful portion of our inbound cases ourselves. And that, along with a number of the other initiatives we have going, are contributing to the very strong results we've seen in our inbound logistics or freight income year-to-date. But that remains a focus. Sure. So if it's a product deflation, it doesn't flow through OpEx as much versus it shows up and up in gross profit. And the portion of our customer contracts that are a fixed markup per case or per pound, et cetera, in that case, you're still making the same markup, so it doesn't impact profitability at all. If you see it in the portion of our contracts that are a percentage markup over, if you have deflation, it can decrease that profitability a little bit. What we see over time though, oftentimes is a lot of the center of the plate is fixed, which can be more volatile. So that means over time, that's can be a little volatile if it goes up or down, but over time is a meaningful impact. And then on the grocery, a lot of the suppliers over time, they tend to go one way from the ultimate manufacturers. So I think when we think through that, we are watching it closely, we have a playbook that we run for inflation and deflation to manage it. But as we noted earlier, don't expect inflation to show up sort of broad scale in the near term. John, just one other thing I would add. I think the other opportunity that still lies ahead is as you see volume continue to come back in Healthcare and Hospitality. A lot of that shows up with existing customers. And so that helps from a drop size perspective for those customers, which are already pretty attractive from the drop sizes they tend to have. Sure. I think they're kind of -- where you're going. There are 2 separate levers because the top line sort of is more automatic and you manage your way through it. I think the -- as said, we would expect for the foreseeable future that, to your point, is essentially modest inflation and/or likely not deflation. I think that shows up a little quicker on the cost side. That is one where you have to be more proactive in the way you manage through that than you do on the GP side. What I'll come back to, what I talked about earlier, is, through COVID, what we really learned is, again, the need to be agile. And as we see in that environment, on the product side, we have very good playbooks on how we're running in inflation and deflation. And then on the cost side, always are looking as to how to effectively manage that across the different spectrums of the cost. Just, Jake, if I could add. This is Dirk. So actually, the exits that we're talking about in chain are where they are part of the strategic exit plan. Our regrettable losses remain quite low across our customer types and continue to have a good pipeline there from a growth perspective. Sure. So the last couple of quarters, we haven't specifically quantified that. But what I will just say is it remains similar to the last few quarters, and it really is largely driven by, what Andrew talked about, the higher level of turnover. And as we see these green shoots in different areas of the business, whether it's productivity or other pieces there that we would expect to build upon those. And we'll talk more about it as we make progress. I think the important thing to take away, though, is even though retention, again, which is a kind of industry and even broader issue, even with that being the case, we are still seeing progress, whether it be the routing initiative that Andrew talked about, whether it be some of the other things there around our process redesign, around inbound receiving product, et cetera, there, that are showing gains. So we know the things we're doing are generating some gains. Unfortunately, in the macro environment, we and others just are still battling with the retention and continue to be relentlessly focused on things to address it. Sure. Jeff, it's Dirk. So overall, the 2 contributors mainly to the chain being down are, we talked about the strategic exits. And then if you recall, last quarter, we talked about softness in a couple of specific concepts, and we continue to see that, and they happen to be a larger concept. So what we're not seeing is we're not seeing any widespread trends, softening, et cetera, across different types within the chains. And we see that some -- whether it's in fast casual, QSR, et cetera, you see winners and losers across the different ones. But not any specific trend that I would call out at this point. And I think the thing in change that we are continuing to see and do is move toward those customers that continue to be a better fit, and we're seeing good results with that. Sure. So yes, confident in the outlook for EBITDA. On EPS, I still expect stronger. I think that's not quite at the strength of the high end, given the higher interest expense, but still feel like a good strong EPS outcome that likely still leans sort of in the upper half, again, assuming an environment that remains similar to where we're in. Kelly, I am Dirk. I think on that one, it's just -- a lot of it is continued confidence in people's comfort in getting back out to -- getting their seniors into Senior Living facilities as bed occupancy rates have continued to very slowly tick up. Also, I think some of it in acute or hospital systems and staffing, they continue to staff up and being able to reopen catering and the like. So it really is -- that is one where -- because we have a fair bit of business in Healthcare, it means a little slower recovery for us perhaps than some others. But we are seeing that continued improvement really each quarter that goes by. And that continues to be very encouraging. And we think that as we continue -- as people continue to build confidence that, that hopefully continues."

            "name": "Andrew Iacobucci",
            "content": "Thanks, Snehal, and good morning, everyone. Thank you so much for joining our call. As I mentioned last quarter, my commitment as interim CEO is to continue the momentum coming out of our first quarter and to deliver on our long-range plan, which we introduced in February. Today, I'm pleased to report that US Foods continues to make progress against our plan and delivered strong earnings growth in the second quarter. Let's turn to Page 3, where you will find 3 key takeaways from the quarter. First, our Q2 results demonstrate good progress on executing our long-range plan. I'd like to thank our hardworking associates across the country for being a critical part of this progress and for continuing to serve our customers despite the challenges facing our industry. Second, US Foods continued its market share momentum from Q1, again delivering market share gains in key customer types. And third, our results further reinforce our confidence to deliver strong results despite the challenging macro environment affecting our industry. While US Foods and the industry as a whole continue to face headwinds related to inflation in food costs and fuel, as well as a challenging labor market, we remain well positioned to win in this marketplace. On Page 4, you will see key highlights from the second quarter. First, net sales for the quarter grew at 15% year-over-year, and we saw continued gross profit per case strength, driven in large part by progress on our long-range plan initiatives that we will discuss momentarily. As a result, adjusted EBITDA grew 11% on the quarter. On supply chain optimization, we continue to make significant strides as a result of the investments we are making in the business. We continued the implementation of new warehouse selection technology in our facilities, and we're on track to complete this in September. Additionally, freight income per case continues to gain momentum as our inbound logistics initiatives progress. Lastly, we're driving month-over-month improvement in our service levels to customers, while operating in a very challenging and fairly stagnant vendor supply environment. Our customer service levels, although still just shy of pre-pandemic levels, have improved nearly 120 basis points through the start of the year. Moving on, we continue to invest in enhancing the customer experience. US Foods has led the industry for over 10 years in this area, and digital is paramount to our success. We are launching our next-generation digital tool, which we call MOXe which is all about increased speed, confidence and control for our customers. This is a step change to the customer experience from performance and ease-of-use perspective. MOXe will begin rolling out in the third quarter, and we are excited to bring you more updates in the coming quarters. In Q2, we continued to expand our CHEF'STORE footprint, as well as assortment on our US Foods direct online marketplace. And last but not least, our team-based selling approach and value-added services continue to be differentiators and are helping us drive share gains in key customer types. A recent example is renewing our strategic partnership with Toast. This collaboration demonstrates our commitment to building deeper relationships with our customers by providing the right technology solutions to save time and improve the customer experience. Finally, I want to focus on the significant continued progress that we're making on environment, social and governance, or ESG. We recently launched a partnership with Kalera, one of the world's leading hydroponic indoor vertical farming companies, to expand our portfolio of local farms that we source from to support our served local program. Launched in 2018, the served local program is designed to better connect US Foods' customers with local farmers, producers and manufacturers. Additionally, we remain committed to reducing the environmental footprint of our operations, and recently announced a science-based climate goal to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 32.5% by 2032 from a 2019 base year. We are working to reduce emissions by optimizing routing to reduce miles driven, deploying new lower carbon footprint vehicle technologies and investing in alternative fuels. Plans include converting our compressed natural gas vehicles, or CNG, to renewable natural gas and introducing 42 new CNG vehicles to our fleet by the end of 2022. In addition, our California broadline distribution center fueling stations have been converted to providing renewable diesel fuel for our Vista, Corona, Livermore and La Mirada diesel fleet and our newly opened Sacramento facility leverages renewable diesel fuel at its onsite fueling station. We also plan to introduce 30 new electric trucks into our La Mirada, California fleet by 2023. In our facilities, we continue to optimize the efficiency of our building operations by investing in renewable energy and adopting energy-efficient equipment and technologies. Page 5 illustrates why we believe US Foods is well positioned in the current environment. It starts with our diversified customer mix. Specifically, while restaurants represent over half of our sales mix, we are very focused on other customer types such as Healthcare and Hospitality to continue to propel our business forward. Healthcare and Hospitality were about 1/3 of our business prior to the pandemic, and we would expect them to return closer to that level as these 2 customer types fully recover. We are also driving market share gains in key customer types, independent restaurants continue to perform well and case volumes are well above 2019 levels. As you may recall, US Foods is relentlessly focused on growing with the right customers, leading to ongoing optimization of our customer mix to ensure we are gaining market share profitably. And as a result, we continue to exit a small number of lower margin and/or more complex primarily chain customers and typically replace that business with more profitable and more flexible IND, Healthcare or Hospitality business, as well as chain business that is a better fit and less complex. We are continuing to improve margins of our existing chain business to reflect the current operating environment. In Healthcare, we are pleased to report a positive trend in the case growth relative to 2019. This is a result of new business wins and improved bed occupancy rates in the Senior Living segment, as well as retail shops opening back up in hospital settings. In Hospitality, we continue with significant year-over-year growth. Given the recent macro backdrop, we will be closely monitoring development in this customer type as the increased inflation levels and work from home trends impact customers' willingness to travel. As a pure-play U.S.-only business, we are well positioned to leverage our differentiated tools and capabilities to support the growth of our diverse customers. As I mentioned earlier, this differentiation has historically enabled us to win share in our key customer types and we expect it will continue to enable us to do so. Customers are telling us that they appreciate our service and commitment to helping them grow and to fight through these difficult times. To them, US Foods does much more than just deliver groceries. Additionally, as a reminder, in rising inflationary periods such as these, US Foods is able to pass much of this inflation through via our contracts and pricing tools. Also, as the Healthcare and Hospitality customer types continue to return to 2019 or normal levels, we will benefit from these tailwinds via top line growth and supply chain efficiencies. And lastly, it's important to note that US Foods has a track record of resiliency during challenging economic times. For instance, during the recession of 2008, 2009, US Foods maintained essentially flat earnings and saw our case volume hold up reasonably well, declining only by mid-single digits. With that, let's turn to Page 6 to walk through how our strong performance in the quarter translates into progress on our long-range plan to drive profitable share gains, expand margins and improve operational efficiencies. We are on track to meet or exceed our targeted growth rate of 1.5x the market. We are continuing to win in the marketplace as demonstrated by our share gains in key customer types. As I noted earlier, the US Foods' team-based selling approach continues to be a differentiator relative to our competition and is an important ingredient in our customers' success. The continued expansion of our cash and carry business, CHEF'STORE, illustrates the power of our omnichannel strategy. During Q2, we opened a new store in Lynchburg, Virginia. We expect still to open 4 to 6 stores this year, and are building our capabilities to accelerate that pace in future years. This strategy allows our broadline customers to fill urgent needs between deliveries during the week to help meet demand. It is also an excellent way for potential customers and consumers to get to know the outstanding lineup of US Foods private label products and high-quality fresh offerings. Turning to the margin expansion or optimization pillar, we had strong gross profit results again this quarter. As we shared on our last call, we are seeing significant momentum with our inbound logistics program initiatives. This program continues to drive significant efficiencies and meaningful freight income expansion. Additionally, US Foods continues to grow its exclusive brand penetration rate. For Q2, organic penetration grew by approximately 80 basis points versus the prior year. Our Cost of Goods program is also performing well and ahead of schedule, with approximately 25% of our total vendor spend already under consideration. Turning to operational efficiencies. We are making solid progress in the midst of a very challenging macro environment. First, as a result of our continued focus on routing optimization and network planning, cases per mile across our network are modestly above 2019 levels despite case volume being down mid-single digits compared to 2019. While that is a significant achievement, we still have significant opportunity ahead. As I mentioned earlier, US Foods is on track with our warehouse selection technology rollout, which is expected to be completed later this quarter. I'm excited about this rollout as it will continue to support our warehouse team members and enhance the selection process, leading to better productivity and job satisfaction. Similarly, our outbound service levels to customers continue to deliver month-to-month improvement, which is a testament to the hard work of our associates, given that vendor fill rates remain challenged. It's important to note that the warehouse labor environment remains challenged for us and our industry. However, we are confident that we have the right plans in place to address turnover and associated productivity headwinds. On Page 7, you will see a summary of our strategic imperatives as we enter the second half of 2022. We are encouraged by our LRP momentum, and we'll continue to update you on the performance of our 3 pillars of profitably growing market share, optimizing gross profit and improving operational efficiency. We are and remain relentlessly focused on building upon our first-class customer service program and platform. We will continue to make investments in our business to provide an enhanced and differentiated service platform at US Foods. And finally, as we create value for our shareholders, we will remain prudent around our capital allocation priorities. Our focus continues to be investing in the business, reducing our leverage, returning cash to shareholders and pursuing tuck-in M&A opportunities. We will continue to execute against these priorities and focus on driving long-term growth ahead, and thus, expect to create significant shareholder value. We've made strong progress against our plan to date, and expect to continue building on this momentum. And with that, I'll pass it over to Dirk to review the financial performance. Thanks, Dirk. In conclusion, US Foods continues to make progress in executing our long-range plan. Despite ongoing challenges in the macro environment, we continue to deliver positive results. This is a testament to the hard work of all our associates at US Foods, and I thank all of them for their continued focus on execution and dedication to serving our customers. With that, operator, please open up the line for questions. Yes, Lauren, it's Andrew. Thanks for the question. I'll try and remember the parts to it. So remind me if I miss any of them. Yes, I think overall, we feel very good about the momentum we're seeing in our independent restaurant growth. And I would say that the growth is being generated through, I'd say, a pretty balanced mix between increasing penetration with the existing customers, as well as going after new. We are still slightly down in terms of our customer count versus '19, but we are seeing a significant improvement in our share of wallet as we move forward. That momentum and sort of the improvement, I think, you would attribute to really, given the market itself, has probably been largely flat from 1 to 2. We've actually seen a pretty sizable, as Dirk mentioned, one of the best share improvements we've seen and certainly significantly better than we were in Q1 in terms of our market share in the IND segment. So feeling, I think, really good about the momentum. We haven't seen, as Dirk mentioned, a meaningful change in behavior, although obviously, that is something we're monitoring very closely. But the fact that we've been able to gain share in this environment also gives us some optimism that we will be able to mitigate the impact, if any of -- any slowing of demand on the independent segment. Did I cover all your questions? Or was there any... Ed, it's Andrew. Why don't I start, and I'll ask Dirk to maybe weigh in on additional detail. As far as the case volumes picture, I think we do feel and have sort of approached things, as we always have, of saying we want to grow in the right way, which is a profitable case growth. And given the environment we are in, we've been working very closely with our customers, particularly the larger chain groups to ensure that we are -- we have arrangements that are reflective of the environment we're operating in. Our goal in all of those conversations is to continue to drive the business forward and work together. But where we aren't able to find an operating model and an arrangement with those customers, we have made the decision in a relatively small number of cases to exit. And that is something that we would do, but we would do it typically as a last resort. As far as the back half, maybe I'll turn it to Dirk to talk a little bit about how we're thinking about that. Yes, sure. And I think, on the labor front, we feel good about our staffing situation. We are substantially staffed in almost all our markets at this point. And what continues to be the challenge, as Dirk mentioned, is our ability to stand the turnover type. We are aggressively exploring and implementing flexible shift lengths to allow our colleagues to be able to have a schedule that fits their needs. We've also taken some steps to significantly reduce shift lengths for our new hires. We find that's typically where the greatest turnover comes from is from that group because it's a tough job, let's face it. And our ability to minimize those early shifts to get them -- allow them to sort of harden themselves to the work, I think, is helping a lot in that area. And then really importantly, because we all know that turnover is much a function of who you work for than anything else, we've taken some pretty aggressive steps to really invest in leadership training and development for our frontline leaders, our supervisors and managers. They are really the critical linchpin in that relationship in markets where we've seen turnover in a better position that typically it's a direct result of that strong leadership. And so we've seen -- it's early days to really start to see significant results from that. But we have seen some very promising signs coming out of that leadership training, and we expect that to continue. Pete, it's Andrew. I think we would say it's a little hard to tell given the volatility that still is out there. But overall, I think there is certainly a little bit more normalcy returning to the rhythm of our business, which I think is a positive sign. But again, I think right now, it's a little hard to declare it as a trend. I think we are -- it's obviously hard to predict where we expect things to go. I think we've certainly seen a slowing in the rate of increase, but we don't -- we certainly don't expect deflation anytime soon. But we are watching it very carefully, not only from a cost of goods standpoint, but also in terms of the impact it's having on demand, and ultimately, our customers. So we have felt pretty good about, not only the ability of our organization to pass along that those inflation costs through the cost plus pricing that we typically have in our contracts, but we've also made really great strides working with our customers to help them manage through the inflationary environment, which is something that I think really has paid some big dividends as we continue to help them with ways to address some of their menu types to steer clear of more inflation impacted categories to look at portion sizing and other factors as well. And that's really something that, again, is really true to the brand of US Foods, something that we really are very proud of. Nicole, it's Andrew. So I think your first question is how has turnover varied across a driver versus selector versus seller. And what I would say is we've seen very consistent turnover within our sellers, in fact, even a little bit less than usual we've seen in past years. Drivers has seen considerably less increase in turnover versus pre-pandemic levels. It's the selector area where we've seen, as I think Dirk mentioned, twice the turnover rates than we saw pre-pandemic. So that's really where the bulk of the -- when we talk about turnover, that's really the main place that we're seeing it. And your second question, which is a great one, around the relationship between the 3. Certainly, the driver and seller relationship is an incredibly important one, because both have such a significant impact on our customer experience. And that's why I think seeing -- especially seeing the reduction in an already lower level of turnover in the driver community has been very positive. And one of the things we've actually started to do more intentionally is really creating a working relationship between the driver and the seller to ensure that any feedback that comes from either of them is passed along to the other, and that's actually really, I think, pretty significantly enhancing the relationship that they have with our customers as a consequence. Yes. So we have seen continued improvement in our customer service level, which is the thing we're most concerned about. And what I think is most sort of positive in that trend is that we've been able to do so with vendor fill rates that have been largely flat relative to where they were to start the year. There's been a bit of an improvement, but not significant. And it's been, I think, a real achievement on the part of the replenishment organization to be able to drive that continued month-over-month improvement in our service level to our customers despite the fact that we are still seeing pretty poor service from an inbound. And the particular challenge there is that the nature of those fill rate challenges. It tends to change from day-to-day and week-to-week. It's not always the same categories and so a little bit of a moving target. But generally speaking, I think we feel very good about the progress that we've made in handling that. John, it's Andrew. You may have to repeat the second half of your question just to make sure I got it. But on the first half around drop side, I would say we are seeing a small increase in our drop size, as I think we've reported for the reason that you mentioned. Remind me the second half of your question. Yes, definitely a clear benefit. We won't quantify the range of it, but it's certainly significant given the incremental cost of those additional cases or the marginal cost of those additional cases are relatively low. As far as continuing, that's certainly an area, as I mentioned, our share gains, especially in the IND space, have been a pretty good mix of growing share of wallet and new. And we do expect that to continue. And certainly a big focus of the independent seller organization is to continue to grow our penetration with existing customers. But John, maybe just to address the question on labor tightness being a benefit. That certainly will be. I mean, one of the challenges that we face with the turnover levels that we are seeing right now is just the costs associated with the recruitment, hiring and onboarding of those associates, as well as the impact that it has on productivity. So I think that will certainly be an important aspect if we do start to see some loosening in that labor environment. I think there's -- first of all, as I said in my remarks, we're feeling very good about the progression of that initiative. We're actually ahead of our schedule on that. And really, the opportunity there and what's maybe a little different today than perhaps in the past, a couple of things. First, we have had -- the volatility of the last couple of years has obviously made it difficult to sort of benchmark our cost of goods, as well as precisely as perhaps we've been able to in the past. And so I think this is really a large part is just going back and making sure that we are continuing to be in this competitive position as we can, given our scale. And I think in terms of the confidence we feel today versus earlier this year or last, I think, has grown as a consequence of the really very productive nature of the conversations that we've had thus far. We have found significant opportunities for mutual wins. I think just given the way the world is right now, there are some opportunities to work more closely together to find ways that will not only help us ultimately from a cost of goods standpoint, but also help our vendors from a production efficiency standpoint. And those are the conversations that have really yielded the greatest fruit thus far. Bob, do you want to take that? Jake, it's Andrew. First of all, I think it's important to say that our net new versus lost in chain is actually up slightly. So I wouldn't necessarily characterize this as a net negative. And it certainly doesn't signal in any way a move away from the right kind of chain business, which is where we've seen the growth coming from, chains that have more of a urban presence, as well as more of an independent restaurant-type offering, have been proven to be very attractive customers and the ones that we are quite happily brought on board. And in addition, as I said, exit is the last resort. We've typically worked with them to find opportunities for the vast majority of our existing customers that has been the outcome. Yes. Jeff, it's Andrew. The other, I think, we would say is that we haven't -- we've been watching carefully for it, but have not seen any meaningful sort of trading down within menu types either. And that's something that, again, when we say no meaningful change in behavior, that's one of the things we look at very closely. Yes, I think we would describe it as a rational market right now for sure. There is obviously the volatility that continues as well as the ongoing inflation have both been real challenges. We have not seen any significant sort of irrational behavior at this point. Yes, Alex, it's Andrew. We're very pleased with the progress the team has made on freight. And we would say actually been a slight acceleration versus the very strong progress we saw in Q1 and Q2. And it's a function of really just getting underneath the arrangements we have in place to look not only to take over lanes where they're appropriate, but also to push them back when the profitability equation just doesn't make sense. We've also, I think, made really strong progress. And this is an important, I think, catalyst here is that we've made great progress engaging our vendors on a more regular basis, just given the way in which the freight markets have been volatile of late -- really over the last 2 or 3 years. Finding ways to kind of get more flexibility in the rate adjustments that our vendors are making, which used to be only really once a year as, I think, been a really important contributor to the progress that we've made. Mark, it's Andrew. I would say we haven't seen a really significant change in customer behavior in terms of the composition of it nor the categories they're shopping. That's been pretty consistent really throughout. And in terms of between the legacy foods CHEF'STORE versus Foodservice stores again, I wouldn't see a big a big gap in their behavior. We are very pleased since we're on the topic to welcome [indiscernible] to the team. He's now leading that organization, and he comes with a tremendous retail background and has a ton of great ideas and first among them is, as I mentioned in my remarks, is to find an opportunity to really accelerate the rate at which we roll out new CHEF'STORE because we really are extremely pleased with the performance of that business and really are looking for opportunities to continue to expand it. Well, as I mentioned, we saw an 80 basis point improvement year-over-year in exclusive brands. We think that is, in part, a function of the better value proposition that it offers our customers. And we are continuing to make sure we are driving that business as aggressively forward as we can. Supply challenges have been a bit of an issue in the past, but we are starting to see that ease up pretty considerably as we've been able to source as needed additional sources of supply for our exclusive brand products. So yes, definitely, we believe an opportunity in this environment and one we will continue to pursue aggressively. Kelly, it's Andrew. As we said previously, we have not seen a meaningful change in behavior over the last couple of quarters in spite of the inflation levels that we're seeing. So it's hard to predict what will happen. It's hard to predict how any moderation will occur in which categories. So unfortunately, I don't have a great answer for you on that. But I think in the main, we feel -- what we do feel good about is our ability even in an inflationary environment to continue to drive market share gains through our great sales organization, as well as the great existing relationships, finding ways to build our share of wallet within those customers."

We're pleased to have reached an agreement with Sachem Head and bring an end to the proxy contest. The board welcomes Scott Ferguson, David Toy and Jim Barber as new Independent Directors and looks forward to their insights and input as we focus on the continued execution of our long range plan. And as we do, our Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Iacobucci has agreed to step into the Interim CEO role as the Board conducts a search for a permanent successor to Pietro Satriano who left the company. On behalf of the entire board, I want to thank Pietro for his dedication and leadership to US Foods over the last 11 years and for guiding the company through the pandemic. We will work with urgency on the search for a permanent CEO successor, but take the time needed to find the right person. Andrew joined US Food in 2017 and has been integral to our efforts around driving profitable markets hare gains and optimizing gross margin, which are two pillars of our long range plan. He also has worked extensively with Bill Hancock on our supply chain efficiency initiatives in the third optimization pillar. He's a proven leader, and the Board and I are confident that business is in great hands with Andrew at the helm. In my new role as Executive Chair, I look forward to working alongside Andrew and the rest of the management team to ensure that we build on our momentum and maintain our strong execution of our strategic initiatives. On today's call, Dirk will discuss our first quarter results, capital structure and macroeconomic environment before Andrew walks you through the progress we're making on our long-range plans as well as our outlook. And as Snehal mentioned, Bill Hancock will join for Q&A session. Finally, I want to thank all of our associates for their focus and commitment to serving our customers and driving U.S. Foods performance. With that, I'll turn it over to Dirk.\nDirk Locascio: Thanks, Bob, and good morning. As we outlined a few weeks ago, we delivered strong sales and adjusted EBITDA growth in the first quarter, which reflects the early progress we are making on our initiatives to drive profitable growth, expand margins and improve operational efficiencies. Both our results and progress underscore our confidence in our ability to deliver 2022 and our balanced long-range plan. Our industry is resilient and is in the midst of a strong recovery. The work we've done over the past few years has positioned us well to drive continued growth as we leverage our scale and innovation. We will also continue to benefit from new talent we have added to better serve customers and optimize cost, specifically to the supply chain team. By delivering against our plan, we have a clear opportunity to create significant value for shareholders through earnings growth and a disciplined approach to capital allocation, which after investing the business is focused on debt reduction, return of capital to shareholders and opportunistically pursuing tuck-in M&A. I'll spend a few minutes on our first quarter results and capital structure, although I won't go into as much detail as normal since we previously released our preliminary results on April 21. I'll also speak to several macro considerations that remain a focus for this year. I'm on Slide 5. We're very pleased with the strength of our first quarter financial results. Q1 adjusted EBITDA was one of our best quarters relative to 2019 since the pandemic began and demonstrates the early progress of our long-range plan initiatives and our commitment to return to and then surpass 2019 results. Q1 net sales were $7.8 billion, which was an increase of 24% over the prior year. Total case volume increased 4%, and food cost inflation was 17%. Within volume, we had 9% independent case growth, 64% hospitality growth and 1% health care growth. Our year-over-year case growth was negatively impacted roughly 400 basis points by the mid-2021 exit of the grocery retail business we temporarily added during the pandemic. As you'd expect, January volume meaningfully slowed due to Omicron and then we saw a significant improvement in February and March. So far, during the second quarter, we've seen continued improvement in demand. As a reference, our independent case growth in recent weeks has been trending up mid-single digits compared to 2019. Hospitality case growth has continued to improve as well and in recent weeks has been mid-teens below 2019. As hospitality and health care improved from a macro recovery perspective and our expected new business is realized, combined with the accelerated restaurant case growth, we expect legacy volume to strengthen the 2019 levels later in this year. We produced very strong gross profit dollar growth again this quarter. Our adjusted gross profit dollars increased 24% from the prior year, which was more than the 20% increase in adjusted operating expense dollars. We progressed on many of our long-range plan initiatives that did and will enable share growth, increased gross margins and drive OpEx efficiency, which Andrew will talk more about shortly. The progress of our initiatives as well as benefit from food cost inflation resulted in a 40% increase in adjusted EBITDA and a 40 basis point increase in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to prior year first quarter. And finally, our adjusted diluted EPS increased to $0.36 per share. The macro environment remains a challenge for our industry and our customers. Thankfully, Omicron is largely in the rearview mirror, and severe COVID cases have declined significantly. Omicron played out in Q1 largely as expected from both the volume and cost impacts. And with summer approaching, we expect demand recovery to continue. Moving to labor. The labor market is better than it was in 2021, however, remains challenging. We continue to hire across our network to address staffing needs resulting from expected continued volume growth. With labor, the primary challenges retention, which is definitely not unique to us. Turnover is higher than it's been historically, and we've taken several actions to address this, such as limiting hours worked for new hires to ease them into the job, and retraining our frontline supply chain managers and supervisors on effective employee management engagement practices and processes. We're also finishing the deployment of our new selection technology in our warehouses and revising processes, leveraging our continuous improvement team to make the jobs a little easier. Retention remains a key focus for us. Moving to productivity. We are making progress as Q1 was better than Q4 and we remain focused on getting back to 2019 levels, along with increasing retention. Food cost inflation continued in the quarter with year-over-year inflation of 17.3% and sequential inflation of just under 3%, which is relevant to our entire industry. The sequential inflation is similar to last quarter and lower than the two quarters before that, which is a positive. Inflation is fairly broad-based across most categories, and we have been successful in passing it through to customers. The \"experts\" don't seem to have consensus on how inflation plays out over the balance of the year. Hopefully, the lower sequential inflation is a signal of stabilization. Supply challenges that remain for our industry more broadly don't appear as though they'll be resolved in the near term, but rather it is expected more likely later this year or into 2023. We haven't seen an impact on our demand at this point and are committed to helping our customers manage through this inflationary environment. Higher fuel costs is another form of inflation facing our industry. Fuel is not an insignificant cost for us. However, it's not nearly as significant as some of the other costs we incur. As a reference, we spent approximately $125 million in diesel fuel for outbound deliveries in 2021. We mitigate some of the fuel cost risk through locking in costs on a portion of our fuel, which right now is about a quarter of our estimated diesel fuel needs through Q1 of 2023. We also recover a portion of the increases through fuel surcharges to customers. We typically offset approximately 40% of our total fuel cost changes through customer fuel surcharges, and those surcharge amounts vary based on diesel fuel costs. This all means fuel cost is important, however, likely isn't going to be the single item that makes or breaks a year, and any impact is likely temporary as fuel costs normalize over time. The macro environment has its challenges. However, our business and our industry have strong recovery tailwinds. We are pleased with the strength of our Q1 results. And we expect that our continued progress on our strategic initiatives, combined with the macro recovery, will lead to further improvement in Q2 EBITDA and a strong fiscal year 2022. We are reaffirming our fiscal 2022 earnings guidance that we provided in February. I talked at Q1 on Slide 6, discussing our capital structure. We reduced our net debt dollars and leverage compared to both first quarter and fourth quarters of 2021. Our net leverage was 4.3 times at the end of the first quarter, which was a 3.2 turn reduction from a year ago and a 0.3 turn reduction from the end of 2021. Leverage reduction is one of the four components we outlined as part of our capital strategy I noted earlier. We continue to make progress toward our leverage goal of 2.5 times to 3 times net leverage and are committed to achieving it. In summary, I'm pleased with the progress in Q1 and optimistic about our balanced long-range plan, which Andrew will discuss next. Andrew, over to you.\nAndrew Iacobucci: Thanks, Dirk, and it's great to be here with everyone this morning. I'm truly honored to step into the Interim CEO role, and I look forward to working closely with Bob the management team and our associates to continue moving our business forward and to build on the success of our first quarter. For the past five years, I've led the company's merchandising operations and more recently our broader commercial team, which has allowed me to develop an in-depth knowledge of our customers and of our operations. And as Bob mentioned, I have focused heavily during that time on driving market share and optimizing gross margins and have worked very closely with Bill Hancock and this entire supply chain team throughout. This has given me a great perspective on our team, on our capabilities and on our opportunities going forward. I have to say I could not be more excited about our position in the market and our ability to capitalize on what lies ahead. My focus as interim CEO will be ensuring that we relentlessly focus on executing the plan and continue to build the momentum and not miss a beat in the process. With that, let me walk you through the progress we're making to drive profitable growth, expand margins and improve our operational efficiencies. I'm now on Page 8, which is a recall slide from our February presentation and provides an overview of the long-range plan that we presented. Our plan, which we expect will generate $1.7 billion of adjusted EBITDA in 2024, is balanced across all three pillars: first, profitably growing market share; second, optimizing gross profit; and third, improving operational efficiency. This plan builds on our solid track record leading up to COVID, especially in market share and gross margins, and brings additional focus to improving operational efficiency, thanks to a number of significant changes we made coming out of COVID. First, we brought in considerable new talent. The head of supply chain, head of IT and the head of our newly created program office are all new and all three are outstanding additions to our team. Inside supply chain, three quarters of the leadership team is new and brings considerable experience from the outside. Second, we introduced a new operating model in April of 2021 with excellence teams whose sole mandate is to drive standardization and bring additional focus to underperforming markets. These excellence teams are staffed with our best talent and have been an integral part of our success. And third, late last year, we introduced customer prioritization or tiering as a way to provide a differentiated service to our best customers while simultaneously removing waste and inefficiency in our operations. This approach to customer tiering has been proven in other industries, and we are beginning to see the benefits of it. Taken together, these three changes represent considerable differences compared to the way we operated in 2018 and 2019, and they undergird our conviction around the long-range plan. I'm now moving to Page 9, initiatives to grow market share. Each of Pages 9 through 11 is set up in the same way with a recall on the long-range plan goals for this pillar on the top left, Q1 progress on the bottom left and the key initiatives over the three years on the right. Recall that our goal is to grow 1.5 times the market with restaurants, and this pillar is expected to generate approximately $290 million of incremental EBITDA over the three-year plan. Progress in the first quarter was good, as illustrated by market share gains in key customer types and a 9% increase in independent case volume. I will now highlight a few of the key initiatives that will continue to drive the three-year plan for market share. First, we will drive market share gains by creating a more differentiated service and fresh experience, which our research tells us is a meaningful opportunity. We are using our customer prioritization framework I mentioned earlier to further improve service and to remove waste via our routing initiative. On fresh and, in particular, produce, we spent all of 2021, enhancing our quality control processes and are now turning our attention to activating this great quality promise with our customers. Early results in our test markets have been very positive. On the larger customer side of the house, our pipeline so far is close to the new business we brought on over the last two years, and these gains are being driven in part by our service model and our technology. An example of this technology is our recently introduced Vitals, which helps hospitals manage their menus and their overall cost and has allowed them to gain a 5% improvement in their operating budget in many instances. In addition, our omnichannel strategy will continue to fuel market share gains in the coming years, and we are on track to open four new -- four to six new CHEF'S STOREs this year. Now turning to Page 10 for a review of our recent results and future initiatives driving our second pillar, optimizing gross margins. Recall that this pillar is expected to contribute approximately $325 million of EBITDA growth over the long-range plan. And as you can see on the bottom left, we've made good progress on all elements of the plan, including pricing, exclusive brand penetration, freight and passing on inflation. We continue to have good success resetting terms with select less profitable large customers, which is in part the result of a more attractive industry structure than historically. Moreover, new customers are coming in at margins that are much closer to independent restaurants. And lastly, we see continued opportunity to increase private brand penetration. On the cost of goods, we are optimizing our vendor relationships to ensure our terms are in line with our scale. On the freight side, in addition to the progress we've made optimizing vendor allowances and carriers, which is contributing to our first quarter results, we are taking advantage of the opportunity to use our scale to reap greater benefits from backhaul opportunities. Freight income per case was above 2019 in Q1, which is a first since COVID began. Let's move now to Page 11 to cover some highlights on improving operational efficiency. Recall that this pillar is expected to contribute approximately $235 million of EBITDA growth over the long-range plan. In the first quarter, we made progress as we gained operating leverage by increasing OpEx less than great -- gross profit, increased our selective productivity from Q4 levels and implemented our warehouse selection technology at additional facilities and are on track to be complete by early Q3. We are currently engaged in Phase 1 of our routing optimization initiative. Customer order patterns and mix have changed significantly throughout the recovery, and we are in the process of removing ways of miles from our routes while maintaining on-time delivery as indicated by industry-leading net promoter scores. While we are early in the process, our leading markets are achieving a nearly 10% improvement in cases per mile when compared to the same period in 2019. And later this year, we will begin remapping -- the remapping component of Phase 1, which will ensure that our customers are serviced by the distribution center that can serve them most efficiently. Later this year, we will begin Phase 2, and that work will replace our current routing platform with dynamic routing technology and will further drive out wasted miles and improve the customer experience. Our continuous improvement work is focused on aggressively standardizing process, including how we plan for our work, how we execute our work and how we create the right environment for our associates and leaders to drive safety, service and cost improvements. As we continue to navigate a competitive labor environment, we are making progress on our network plan that includes analyzing brownfield and greenfield automated solutions. We expect to begin testing brownfield prototypes later this year, and we'll continue to pursue more comprehensive greenfield solutions in parallel with that work. In conclusion, our results are promising affirmation of our strong early progress in implementing our long-range plan, and I want to thank all of our associates for their continued focus and commitment to our business. Despite continuing challenges impacting our industry, we delivered one of our strongest quarters since the pandemic began, a testament to strong execution by our entire team. I'm excited to lead this great company during this interim period, and I am confident we have a great plan and a great future ahead. Operator, please open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Lauren Silberman from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nLauren Silberman: I wanted to ask about how you see the opportunities to narrow the margin gap to your closest competitor. So the initiatives that you've laid out across gross margin and OpEx. I guess, one, how much of that margin gap do you see is addressable? And two, what do you see as low-hanging fruit or more near term versus longer term?\nDirk Locascio: Sure. Lauren, this is Dirk. Good question. So we're absolutely focused on understanding our competitors, their performance and benchmark. We're actively working, as we talked about, to further expand our margins. And I think the key drivers of that are the things that Andrew has talked about and we've talked about our long-range plan, whether it's the cost of goods improvement, the logistics improvement, the supply chain efficiency items we've noted, it's really the key levers there that we've talked about. And we're focused on that balance of expanding the margins and maximizing our EBITDA dollars. We think that, especially during this time when the industry is in the state of recovery that, that balance of expanding margins and profitably growing share is critically important. And overall, our plan may or may not look exactly like competitors, large industry still collective small share for both of us and a lot of room to run. And we would expect to significantly grow EBITDA over this period, create significant shareholder value with a lot of it coming from improved margins.\nLauren Silberman: And I just want to follow up on inflation. You guys are -- it seems like having a lot of success pushing through that inflation. What are you watching in the consumer environment or more broadly to see whether you might decide to delay pushing any of the inflation that you're seeing?\nAndrew Iacobucci: Thanks, Lauren, it's Andrew. Thanks for the question. Yes, we are paying very close attention to the impact of inflation in our world. We're seeing it everywhere, not just obviously in our industry. So far, we are not seeing any meaningful impact on demand. We also are, I think, being buoyed by what continues to be a post-COVID sort of recovery and the pent-up demand that comes with that. But we are expecting it to continue, and we are continuing to monitor it very closely. We are also taking pretty aggressive steps to manage and help our customers, that is, manage through this difficult time. Our rocks and our food-fanatic chefs have spent a great deal of time with our customers, helping them understand how to rebuild their menus to get away from heavily inflation-impacted categories, rejigging their recipes in the process and also looking at opportunities to engineer their menus to pass along that inflation to the customers. And those have had significant positive impact on our customers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nEdward Kelly: Bob, I wanted to ask you a question just to start. Change looks to be coming right because you're embarking on a new CEO search. I'm just curious, what's the Board looking for in an ideal candidate? What's important in that decision? And then things look to be in capable hands of Andrew at the moment. Does anything change in terms of implementation of the strategy that's out there?\nBob Dutkowsky: Thanks, Ed. So I'll answer your questions in reverse order. I would say, first off, one of the reasons the Board has so much confidence and Andrew taking over is he was integral in the building of the long-range plan, and so our view right now is we just want to execute against the plan that's in place. The strategy is sound and the planned metrics are sound, and the first quarter validates that we're on the right track. So in the short term, I wouldn't look for anything other than Andrew focusing on execution of the strategy and the plan that's in place. The second question about the ideal candidate. I'll tell you that we've already formed the search committee. The search committee has already engaged, and it's a top priority of the Board and of mine to find the next good leader for this company. You could write down the specs as easily as I could. The person needs to have some industry experience. They need to have been in the supply chain business. And the experience of leadership and C-suite experience is an important element that we'll look for. But at this moment, it's an open pallet in terms of the person that will step in. We have some very, very experienced directors on the search committee, and we're excited to bring in the next great leader of this company.\nEdward Kelly: And then just one quick follow-up for Dirk. Both your peers raised guidance this quarter, Dirk, albeit they have one quarter to go. You reiterate it, despite, I think, what was probably a little bit better than expected Q1 results. Any thoughts or has anything changed about your expectation for the remainder of the year?\nDirk Locascio: Thanks, Ed. So as I said earlier, pleased with Q1 and the progress. And our expectation still is to be at the high end of the range, assuming another -- that we don't have another Omicron-like wave. Really, for us, it's what you said, it's early in the year. We're one quarter in. Also, it's relative to other quarters, a relatively lower earning quarter. There are still some macro uncertainties, and we have three quarters, others have one quarter. So it's -- there's nothing to be read into there on our confidence. We remain very confident, and we'll adjust as appropriate going forward, but bullish on the momentum.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jake Bartlett from Truist Securities. Your line is now open.\nJake Bartlett: Mine is about a little more detail, if you could, about just the cost buckets within operating expense. I think going back to the 2018 Investor Day, you mentioned that 15% was administrative, 55% was supply chain, 30% selling. I wonder if you can just give us an updated buckets now. And then also any other detail within that supply chain of how much is labor? Or any other detail just as we kind of assess your ability to cut some of those costs?\nDirk Locascio: Sure, Jake, good question. So our overall percentage isn't all that different than it was a few years ago, so those are still good proxies to use. And I think the other piece that I would add within supply chain that we've talked about in the past is we do spend more on delivery than we do warehouse. So the lion's share of those costs are people costs and then it is -- delivery is bigger. I think the only other thing I'd go back to is in supply chain. If you look at historically, I talked earlier about using 2021 as an example of how much we spend on fuel. I think that's just important because that is a piece that is not labor that helps you tease that part out there. And that's the part that, I think, it's important to understand that it's meaningful, but it's not near as significant as other expense buckets, and it would likely normalize over time.\nJake Bartlett: And just a quick follow-up. You gave us the expected savings over the next few years in gross margins and operating efficiencies. Which would you say come first? Just any clarity on kind of what's the most low-hanging fruit? Is it on the on the gross margin side or on the operating expense efficiencies that you're targeting?\nAndrew Iacobucci: Yes, Jake, thanks. It's Andrew. Thanks for the question. Look, we've built this plan quite intentionally to be balanced across all three pillars. And what I think is most encouraging about our first quarter is that we saw really strong improvement across all three, and our plan is to continue to drive all three and equal. So I would not say there is a first among equals on this list, and we are working actually very closely together to ensure that, that balance continues.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Alex Slagle from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nAlex Slagle: Just wanted to ask about the resiliency of your business and sort of if you could frame the landscape for independent restaurants and your exposure to this category in the event of a material slowdown in consumer spending. Just curious how things have changed since past big downturns in terms of the capabilities these operators have, leveraging what US Foods offers now. And then the position of your business has even more important and in-demand suppliers just given the broader issues getting product and reliable service and to the extent you think that share gain there could help offset the potential slowdown in spending.\nAndrew Iacobucci: Yes. I think to answer the last part of your question first, I think that is a big opportunity regardless of the environment that we're in. As Dirk mentioned, it's a large market we play in and quite fragmented, and we continue to see opportunity to grow market share, and we'll pursue that. As far as the resiliency goes, we've seen some data from Technomic and others that show that consumer spending even during downturn tends to stay quite consistent. What you see instead is a change in the mix of their spending behavior. That food out of home, those stays at a relatively consistent level. The good news about our business is we've got such diversification across all segments in our industry. And that diversification, I think, puts us in a very good position to manage through if there is a change in that -- those demand behaviors. The other thing I would say is that COVID has taught us a lot about moving nimbly into where the market is moving. And we, I think, are very, very well positioned to take advantage of that should we see a slowdown.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Nicole Miller from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nNicole Miller: A couple of quick ones. So there's been some hires that you mentioned, and that was helpful to review that. And obviously, a new CEO can sense some tone and tenor. But that being said, can you just talk about like where everybody sits today, how they interact day-to-day? Is everybody together under the headquarter facility building? How is that coming together?\nAndrew Iacobucci: Yes. Thanks, Nicole, for the question. So we are in the process of returning to work in a sort of hybrid fashion. So physically, we are together on a regular basis throughout the month. But the team is -- in terms of the coherence and the sort of working-together attitude of the organization, I think we've seen a real step-up with the new additions. We've had, as I mentioned, not only really, I think, strong improvements to our IT with the addition of John Tonnison; as well as our Chief Supply Chain Officer, Bill Hancock; and then the program office, I mentioned. All three have made, I think, a very meaningful impact, not only on their functions but also on our coherent and cohesiveness as a team. I also mentioned in my remarks that Bill has made very significant supply chain additions. He has an extensive network from his time in retail and in tire distribution that he's tapped incredibly effectively into. And all -- every single one of the hires that he has made has meaningfully improved our capabilities in those areas. So we're very, very excited about the team and its ability to move forward.\nBob Dutkowsky: And Nicole, this is Bob. I'll just add you've seen that we added two supply chain deeply rooted supply chain skills to our Board in Jim Barber and Quentin Roach. Both of them bring extensive skills, extensive experience and an extensive Rolodex, and so we're excited to have that additional capability at the Board level to enhance Bill's efforts around the supply chain.\nNicole Miller: Maybe switching gears to capital deployment. This is an excellent plan. At least on paper, at the very least, we can put all the pieces together, right, and thinking specifically about capital deployment and the deleveraging effect of the plan. But at which phase do you start to think about share repurchase and dividend with a permanent CEO or after Phase 1, 2 or 3? How are you thinking about that?\nDirk Locascio: Sure. Thank you. Good question. So as you know, we have four very clearly defined capital priorities that I talked about earlier, and one of them is share repurchase. So our near term is really focused on investing in the business for growth and delevering, making very good progress. And as I talked about before, we expect to reach that range of 2.5 times to 3 times leverage next year. And so what we will be doing over the course of this year is doing the work to get ready and evaluate the different options for share -- return of capital to shareholders and would expect to talk further about that later this year and into early next year. So excited about the opportunity. We have strong growing cash flow in our business that allows us to really deploy that capital in different ways, including back to shareholders.\nNicole Miller: And then just a final one. This is more of a curiosity. On the Cash & Carry business, what trends are you seeing there? I'm trying to think through, does that business go up because of recession? Is there any signal with that business, that piece of business?\nAndrew Iacobucci: Yes. Thanks, Nicole, for the question. We certainly saw a sizable bump in their business during the early and mid-stages of COVID. And that was a combination of factors, obviously driving that. It's a very well-priced, very cost-effective option for many of our customers. And I think what you'll see in the event of slowdown is that, that becomes a more and more viable option for our customer base, and so we expect it to be very resilient in whatever macro environment we're playing in.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein: One, just on the market share opportunity, which I think is the first bucket of the -- seemingly the funnel that helps with the other two from the EBITDA expansion opportunity. Just wondering if you were to flash forward three years, it would seem like the current period as we move through COVID would offer significant opportunity from a market share perspective. So I'm just wondering, as you look at your business, how you prioritize the buckets in terms of picking up new accounts, further penetrating existing accounts, maybe M&A of smaller competitors or, in fact, closure of those competitors? Like how would you prioritize the biggest opportunities to drive that first bucket in terms of market share growth?\nAndrew Iacobucci: Yes, Jeff, it's Andrew. Thanks for the question. The short answer is we actually want to be looking at both penetrating existing customers as well as driving new. When we are in balance across those two priorities, we see very, very strong growth and market share performance. Obviously, the more we can build share of wallet of our existing customers, that's a very -- those are very profitable cases given that we're not stopping the truck anymore, and the marginal cost to deliver is very, very low. But we also need to be always on the lookout for new opportunities to grow our business through new. And one of the things, I think, was most promising about our Q1 results is that we saw both of those in balance in Q1.\nJeffrey Bernstein: And in terms of the smaller competitive set, I mean it seems like we're hearing about all the challenges of the best years or so of the biggest players. I'm just wondering the ability for the small and midsized players to survive and thrive through this period, it would seem like they would be under significant pressure. I'm just wondering if that's something you can see whether there's any industry data that would demonstrate that.\nAndrew Iacobucci: Thanks for the question. We don't really have a clear sense of that, obviously, Jeff. It's -- we -- our shared data tells us how we're doing relative to the market, doesn't give us the specifics around where it's coming from. But we certainly have seen a pretty strong balance in where we believe that growth is coming from, from both smaller players, but also from our larger competitors. It's been very, very balanced.\nDirk Locascio: I think the other thing, Jeff, what we see is a large customers, it really has raised over these last couple of years the importance of scaled, solid, reliable distribution partner, and that's really one of the things combined with our service model and technology that has really opened the door to a lot of this growth on the larger national customers and even on the independents, the resilience, the ability to manage through a far less an ideal vendor supply situation with independents. Andrew talked about Q1 that we gained share with our target customer types. Our early read on April is with independents. We had very good share growth again. So I think as Andrew talked about in his prepared comments, just very good momentum building on that.\nJeffrey Bernstein: And just lastly, you gave good color from a commodity inflation standpoint and an outlook there. Just wondering if I can get your thoughts from a labor standpoint. I think you made mention of the environment improving. I'm just wondering whether there's any quantification in terms of shortages or maybe basket inflation that you might be seeing or the turnover or hiring? Any kind of metrics you can provide to demonstrate that maybe things have topped out and you're starting to see some improvement?\nBill Hancock: Yes, Jeffrey, this is Bill. I appreciate the question. In our industry, the best way to offset the labor challenges is to get more productive, and we've done that from the fourth quarter into the first. And we're continuing to see consistent month-over-month improvement on that. Turnover is the biggest headwind, I think, any company has right now in terms of driving additional productivity. And that's why, like Andrew mentioned earlier, our CI efforts, continuous improvement are focused on how we onboard associates, how we schedule that team and the technology that they interface with. We finished a very large proof-of-delivery device deployment for our drivers. It helps onboard them faster, helps them be more productive. And then inside the warehouse by midpoint this year, we'll have fully deployed a new selection technology, both software and hardware, that both helps onboard faster and help that team be more productive. We are seeing stabilization in the labor markets. The one call out I would have there is Class A drivers. That challenge is not going away for anyone anytime soon, which is why we're continuing to invest into training our own, building our own pipeline. We are offering new jobs to folks that don't have a Class A today. We'll put them through a school. We'll make sure they get full training and then offer them that full-time job right after that so they can join the team.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Brian Mullan from Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Mullan: Just a question on vendor management. Presentation talks about optimizing terms in line with your purchasing scale. I'm just wondering if you could build on that a little bit. It kind of makes it sounds like your current terms with vendors are perhaps not in line with where they should be today, but I'm not sure if that's right or what the magnitude is. So if you could just speak to the magnitude of that opportunity and maybe what the time line is to start to realize the benefits.\nAndrew Iacobucci: Yes. Thanks, Brian. It's Andrew. Yes. So we see it really more as a hygiene play to continue to make sure that we're examining our cost of goods. With all the supply disruptions and the demand volatility that we've seen, we have a very different looking mix of products than we have in the past. We think there's an opportunity to make sure that we are really focused around our cost of goods in those new categories and segments to make sure that we are consistent with where we believe we should be. But there's also a bigger opportunity there, which is to find real win-win opportunities for both ourselves and our supplier community. So it's really more in the spirit of partnership that we entered these conversations to find ways, to make ourselves a lower cost to serve and in return achieve a much better cost of goods.\nBrian Mullan: And just a follow-up on another initiative, the routing improvements. It looks like it expanded from a pilot to enterprise-wide implementation. Just give a little bit of history there. When do those pilots start? What did you see that encourage you to move forward enterprise-wide? And then just a sense of the magnitude of that opportunity and the time line until when you feel like it's fully deployed and you're seeing the full benefits?\nBill Hancock: Yes. Like Andrew mentioned earlier -- this is Bill, by the way. It's kind of a two-phase project. Phase 1 is looking at our current routing system and what waste exists. As we\u2019ve taken new share and customer patterns have changed throughout COVID, it\u2019s created opportunities where there\u2019s waste inside of our routing. So that first phase that we\u2019re in right now is focused on ripping out those wasted miles. Our leading markets are seeing 10% or greater improvement on cases per mile versus that same time period in 2019, and we think there\u2019s additional upside on top of that. So that work is ongoing right now, delivering results to the bottom line. That remapping effort, that kicks off here in just a couple of months. We\u2019ll have that fully deployed by the close of this year, and that\u2019s an opportunity to make sure that as we brought on those new customers, they\u2019re mapped to the most efficient DC in terms of mileage in service levels. Both our internal and NPS data validates that the service levels we\u2019re providing as we go through this are as good, if not better, than they were in 2019.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Peter Ssaleh from BTIG.\nPeter Ssaleh: I want to come back to the conversation around the hospitality business. I guess at least in the first quarter, I think that's still down in terms of case volumes, maybe 15%, 20% versus pre-pandemic. Can you give us a sense on how many of your customers pre-pandemic maybe have reordered? Is this just a function of -- is this a function of lost customers or just smaller basket sizes from the customers that are ordering? Just trying to understand how that segment recovers back to pre-pandemic levels.\nDirk Locascio: Peter, I think that you're right, it's down in the mid-teens and have seen continued improvement there. You probably remember that this business was down 70%, 80% right after COVID, so it's taken a little longer but seeing steady. Leisure had returned a little sooner. I think the encouraging thing is seeing business travel return. A number of the airlines, cruise lines, et cetera, all had comments on both leisure and business that were positive. So we feel good about that trajectory. I think that we're not seeing so much fewer customers as opposed to as customers, a few things, as you have conferences and things like that haven't fully returned from a business perspective, as you have operators that are working to get their staffing levels to the right place so they can open all of their dining venues and expand hours, et cetera. So I would expect that to continue to improve. And at this point, it appears as though the demand remains quite robust and the improvement to continue likely from a macro perspective, and then our sales team continues to focus on onboarding new customers, and that's really across each of our customer types. So we're bullish on the continued recovery for hospitality.\nPeter Ssaleh: And then just on the private label mix. Can you just provide an update on where you are today? And are you seeing any more shift as your restaurant partners maybe trying to avoid some of the higher inflation? Are they considering more private label brands? Or what's the dynamic going on there?\nAndrew Iacobucci: Yes. Thanks, Peter. It's Andrew. The -- we see our private label mix is roughly where we were in 2019. We've seen a nice recovery back to that. We've had obviously significant supply issues during the pandemic that resulted in order to ensure we were getting product in us consolidating some of our private label offering. We are seeing that coming back very, very quickly. And we are absolutely seeing the trend that you anticipated, which is as a result of inflation, there is even greater value in our private label brands than there was before, which is seeing a really strong move into those brands. The other factor that's an important contributor to that is it because supply has been so difficult throughout the pandemic, many of our customers are much more willing to try alternatives than they were before, and so we are seeing that as a real enabler of those conversions.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Partners.\nJohn Heinbockel: So let me start maybe for both Andrew and Bill. How far can you push the envelope on existing warehouse automation, right, from a cost and disruption standpoint? And then secondly, it's much easier, right, with greenfield to put it in, in the first place. What do you think the network looks like, I don't know, three to five years from now? Maybe a few fewer, but you also want to stay close to the -- to your customers. So how does the network evolve?\nBill Hancock: Yes, John, this is Bill. Great question. When we think about automation, it really is a dual path, both brownfield and greenfield. Andrew mentioned earlier, our work on the brownfield side is coming first. We see the biggest opportunity to retrofit existing facilities versus greenfield. And that's why we're bringing our first brownfield testing online by the close of this year, and we look forward to sharing some additional results with that later on. On the greenfield side, that work is happening in parallel. With our network plan, we've identified those focus markets where we feel like we're going to be capacity constrained in the years to come and creates really good opportunity for us to invest in a greenfield site. And if we're going to invest in a greenfield site, we want to fully explore what an automated solution looks like.\nJohn Heinbockel: And then secondly, right, you talked about fresh leadership. Maybe some sense of fresh market share versus nonfresh, right? And I know one of the challenges has been perception-wise, right, taking share from specialty operators on the perception, this is not just you, it's all the broad liners, on product quality. So talk about getting over that hurdle and where your share is and how fast that business can grow.\nAndrew Iacobucci: Yes. Thanks, John. You hit on what I think is a really big opportunity for us. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, one of the things we took the better part of last year to focus on was just getting our produce quality consistent day in and day out. We have put in a quite significant process as well as technology enablement that I think has allowed us to be as good as anyone out there. And we have now started to stand behind that through a customer activation pilot we have going in a couple of our markets, and that is showing really, really strong results. We have slightly lower share in produce but actually slightly higher share in center of plate. So there's a big opportunity to grow that produce business, but both will benefit from that relentless focus on quality. Customers, if they can count on getting high-quality product day in and day out, really, really is a huge source of loyalty and a great way to onboard new business. And so we're very -- feeling very good about the progress we've made on that front.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania from BMO Capital.\nKelly Bania: I wanted to just maybe ask about the long-range plan. Clearly, this was outlined in February, and it sounds like you're happy with the early progress and are backing today but with a lot of leadership changes. I'm just wondering if you can comment, should investors take comfort that this plan is the best route forward for the company? Is there a broad support for the long-range plan? Does it need to be more aggressive? Or it's just a new leadership to execute that at the highest level? Just anything you can comment there.\nBob Dutkowsky: Sure, Kelly, it's Bob. I'll try to answer that question. The long-range plan took almost a year to come together. We waited until we got outside the impacts of COVID, where we felt comfortable to articulate it. But it was a very much of an iterative, bottoms-up base plan. And so consequently, its impact and it's rooted all the way down through the organization. Having said that, we're also going to remain very flexible to adjust it as the markets change, as the dynamics change. As Dirk described the fuel issues that exist today, they weren't on the radar when we were building the plan. We've adjusted, and so we'll continue to adjust to the realities of the market and the realities of the environment. And we're comfortable that the way it's built, it gives us the flexibility to adapt. As well as now we have some new voices in the boardroom that can have an influence and an impact on and really add value to the formation and the execution of the plan. So we're comfortable that we will remain very agile as the time unfolds, but we believe the three fundamental pillars of the plan are exactly the right ones to grow this business and create shareholder value.\nKelly Bania: And maybe just to follow up. The new operating model, it sounds like that's been in place for over a year now. Maybe just can you help us understand how that's been working? Any examples, any tweaks along the way as you have gotten feedback on how that's working? And maybe just bigger picture, how does that new operating model compare to the industry if there is any industry standard or norm?\nAndrew Iacobucci: Yes, Kelly, thanks for the question. I guess I'd answer that in a couple of ways. The first -- really the core to this adjustment that we made in implementing the new model was to create these excellence organizations on both the commercial team as well as on Bill's supply chain team. And they are seasoned pros, mostly from the field who really understand the field and how it operates. And what they are allowing us to do in a way that we've not been able to do anywhere near successfully before is that they identify, they document and then they deploy best practices from around the country across the country. So a really good example of that has been a big part of why we've seen such strong market share growth as something we call the recipe, which is our focused attention around where growth is in the market and allowing us to direct our sellers' focus into the menu types that are growing in their area and go after those with relentless execution. Another good example, Bill, you may want to talk about is around some of the work we did on the supply chain side.\nBill Hancock: Yes. Kelly, when you think about this new operating model, you pull that expertise from the field, you identify what market in the field is best-in-class at a specific function, and you try to replicate that for the organization. Two quick examples, one being our assortment work. We identified our market that's most efficient with their assortment, and that ultimately led to driving a 15% reduction in SKUs across the network. Much more efficient on the supply chain side. We reduced spoilage. We reduced that redundancy, makes it easier to execute the business. And then flipping over to the routing side, that routing initiative was built by these excellence teams. We identified the market that is best in class inside of our network, and we've replicated that behavior to get that 10% improvement we addressed.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Carden from UBS.\nMark Carden: So it sounds like there's been minimal demand disruption to date with inflation. Do you guys think this is more due to consumers simply wanting to get out more now that COVID restrictions have softened? Or is it still more of a factor of pent-up demand from restaurants, just not having enough labor to operate at desired capacities?\nAndrew Iacobucci: It's Andrew. Thanks for the question, Mark. No, I think it's more the former than the latter. I think what we're seeing is a strong desire from consumers to get back to normal in many aspects of their life, and dining out is a big part of that.\nMark Carden: And then as a follow-up, how is the current environment impacting demand for some of your specialized consulting services? Could these be materially accretive to margins? Or is the bigger benefit just coming from customer loyalty?\nAndrew Iacobucci: It's both. It's probably more on the customer loyalty side. We have done, I think, just some incredible work over the course of the pandemic of both identifying sort of major challenges that our operators are facing and then quickly deploying support and resources against those. The examples abound, whether it's Ghost Kitchens, whether it's navigating the CARES Act. And then most recently, the tools I mentioned around managing inflation, all of those things I have no hesitation saying is our industry-leading both in terms of their value but also in terms of how quickly we've been able to get them up and running. It's a big part of, I think, what our advantage is in the market and something we're going to continue to leverage.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass: My question goes back to comments a couple of questions ago about operating performance in best practices. Is there a big operating performance difference among regions or among sites? In other words, when you look at the system, are there regions that are lower and therefore it can be brought up to the system average? And maybe inside of that, can you just talk about SG&A and their margins? And are they -- where are they relative to when you purchased them? And is that an opportunity still?\nAndrew Iacobucci: Sure. Thanks, John. I'll touch quickly on -- from a commercial standpoint. We've seen is not so much systematic differences but just opportunities to get better. There's -- in any large group, there's going to be a pro distribution, and that's what we see in our markets. So the opportunity really is to take those strong performers, learn what they're doing differently and deploy those to the markets that are not performing as strongly.\nDirk Locascio: So on that question. So the SGA or Food Group, so their EBITDA margins were a little bit lower than the broad line when we first bought them. That business, I would say, it's performing well in light of the current environment. So from the northwest and west, it's been a little slower to recovery, but we expect that to continue to recover. And in those markets, Food Group has been predominantly number one or number two in share, and we expect to build upon that as we go ahead. I think the other thing is we've talked a lot about. So our integration from a system perspective is done. We've completed our last facility here in the first quarter. That's going very well. Synergies are well on track for the $65 million that we talked about, we achieved. We talked about more than $40 million last year. So all in, pleased with how that progress is going on that key strategic assets. And just as the team continues to work there through the macro recovery, plus really driving share gains, we think that's going to continue to be an increased value driver for us.\nJohn Glass: And where are you on this pricing tool implementation? It sounded like there was maybe some activity-based pricing such that you could charge customers differently, depending on how much labor and trucking is required. Where are you rolling that out? And is that the right way to think about this pricing tool?\nAndrew Iacobucci: Thanks, John. So we are on track for deployment starting later this year and into early next, and we're feeling very good about the capabilities that will provide us with.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Andrew Wolf from CL King.\nAndrew Wolf: Can you provide some more color around the better pricing and terms you spoke about earlier in the call? I think you said with existing large customers, new large customers, presume that's change or maybe others. Why this is happening now and how durable you think this is?\nDirk Locascio: Sure. This is Dirk. I'll take that one. So it is -- so that comment is geared sort of more to some of the larger customers. And as we've talked about really for the last number of quarters, so it's not really a new specifically, it's really making sure that a number of those customers that tend to be at the lower end of the profitability that we're aligning their margins with the current operating environment. And so it's working closely with those customers. And in a number of cases, it can be increases in what we charge them. But there's also -- it's a pretty complete work with them. It can be things like adjusting delivery frequency. It can be having them align on more of our own private brands, which saves them money. So things like that, they're all about the dynamics. We think it is pretty durable. The sort of the demand and capacity in the industry is very different than it was three or four years ago. And in each case, really what it's doing is I could think of a few larger customers where this environment has built some of the best relationships collaboratively between the two teams that we've had historically, and it's sort of geared around success for both. So I think it's durable and expect to continue to work with customers on that.\nAndrew Wolf: I just have a slight follow-up, different question though. If I did my math right, it looks like mix contributed maybe a couple of percent or 3% to sales. I just want to check that. And it's interesting that in an inflationary environment, where there's a contribution from mix. I presume it's -- well, I actually want to ask you why it is, but I think there's some sense that restaurants are getting more confident in adding more fancy items. But could you give us some color on that? And also like a lot of that could -- normally in an inflationary environment, you see mix go the other way. So it's just kind of a confounding trend.\nDirk Locascio: Yes. So this is similar to what we've seen in the last few quarters. You're right it is about 3% and lot of had to do with just our independent case growth, as you continue to see that outpace the business and the success we've had, and that's a place where it shows up as a proof point that it is real, and we are growing faster than the market on that. Andrew commented earlier in his -- either one of his answers or a prepared comment that we really haven't seen systemic trade downs in there, yes, we see demand remain robust. And so overall, I feel good about the demand environment. And yes, that's really what's driving a lot of the mix benefit.\nOperator: There are no questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to Bob Dutkowsky.\nBob Dutkowsky: Thank you, operator. So let me just quickly summarize. Thank you for your interest and your questions this morning. I would summarize on a couple of points. The first is we're pleased with the quarter that we just announced. But much more importantly, we're excited about the opportunity to continue to drive our long-range plan. We believe our strategy is correct, and this quarter just begins to validate that our actions are going to deliver shareholder creation and shareholder value. And that's really what we're focused on as we move forward. So a large thanks to my colleagues in US Food for their great work, and thank you again for your time this morning.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Bob Dutkowsky",
            "content": "Thanks Snehal and good morning to everyone. Before we dive into the quarter and the progress on our plan, I want to spend a few minutes on the two announcements we shared earlier this week. We're pleased to have reached an agreement with Sachem Head and bring an end to the proxy contest. The board welcomes Scott Ferguson, David Toy and Jim Barber as new Independent Directors and looks forward to their insights and input as we focus on the continued execution of our long range plan. And as we do, our Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Iacobucci has agreed to step into the Interim CEO role as the Board conducts a search for a permanent successor to Pietro Satriano who left the company. On behalf of the entire board, I want to thank Pietro for his dedication and leadership to US Foods over the last 11 years and for guiding the company through the pandemic. We will work with urgency on the search for a permanent CEO successor, but take the time needed to find the right person. Andrew joined US Food in 2017 and has been integral to our efforts around driving profitable markets hare gains and optimizing gross margin, which are two pillars of our long range plan. He also has worked extensively with Bill Hancock on our supply chain efficiency initiatives in the third optimization pillar. He's a proven leader, and the Board and I are confident that business is in great hands with Andrew at the helm. In my new role as Executive Chair, I look forward to working alongside Andrew and the rest of the management team to ensure that we build on our momentum and maintain our strong execution of our strategic initiatives. On today's call, Dirk will discuss our first quarter results, capital structure and macroeconomic environment before Andrew walks you through the progress we're making on our long-range plans as well as our outlook. And as Snehal mentioned, Bill Hancock will join for Q&A session. Finally, I want to thank all of our associates for their focus and commitment to serving our customers and driving U.S. Foods performance. With that, I'll turn it over to Dirk. Thanks, Ed. So I'll answer your questions in reverse order. I would say, first off, one of the reasons the Board has so much confidence and Andrew taking over is he was integral in the building of the long-range plan, and so our view right now is we just want to execute against the plan that's in place. The strategy is sound and the planned metrics are sound, and the first quarter validates that we're on the right track. So in the short term, I wouldn't look for anything other than Andrew focusing on execution of the strategy and the plan that's in place. The second question about the ideal candidate. I'll tell you that we've already formed the search committee. The search committee has already engaged, and it's a top priority of the Board and of mine to find the next good leader for this company. You could write down the specs as easily as I could. The person needs to have some industry experience. They need to have been in the supply chain business. And the experience of leadership and C-suite experience is an important element that we'll look for. But at this moment, it's an open pallet in terms of the person that will step in. We have some very, very experienced directors on the search committee, and we're excited to bring in the next great leader of this company. And Nicole, this is Bob. I'll just add you've seen that we added two supply chain deeply rooted supply chain skills to our Board in Jim Barber and Quentin Roach. Both of them bring extensive skills, extensive experience and an extensive Rolodex, and so we're excited to have that additional capability at the Board level to enhance Bill's efforts around the supply chain. Sure, Kelly, it's Bob. I'll try to answer that question. The long-range plan took almost a year to come together. We waited until we got outside the impacts of COVID, where we felt comfortable to articulate it. But it was a very much of an iterative, bottoms-up base plan. And so consequently, its impact and it's rooted all the way down through the organization. Having said that, we're also going to remain very flexible to adjust it as the markets change, as the dynamics change. As Dirk described the fuel issues that exist today, they weren't on the radar when we were building the plan. We've adjusted, and so we'll continue to adjust to the realities of the market and the realities of the environment. And we're comfortable that the way it's built, it gives us the flexibility to adapt. As well as now we have some new voices in the boardroom that can have an influence and an impact on and really add value to the formation and the execution of the plan. So we're comfortable that we will remain very agile as the time unfolds, but we believe the three fundamental pillars of the plan are exactly the right ones to grow this business and create shareholder value. Thank you, operator. So let me just quickly summarize. Thank you for your interest and your questions this morning. I would summarize on a couple of points.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Dirk Locascio",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob, and good morning. As we outlined a few weeks ago, we delivered strong sales and adjusted EBITDA growth in the first quarter, which reflects the early progress we are making on our initiatives to drive profitable growth, expand margins and improve operational efficiencies. Both our results and progress underscore our confidence in our ability to deliver 2022 and our balanced long-range plan. Our industry is resilient and is in the midst of a strong recovery. The work we've done over the past few years has positioned us well to drive continued growth as we leverage our scale and innovation. We will also continue to benefit from new talent we have added to better serve customers and optimize cost, specifically to the supply chain team. By delivering against our plan, we have a clear opportunity to create significant value for shareholders through earnings growth and a disciplined approach to capital allocation, which after investing the business is focused on debt reduction, return of capital to shareholders and opportunistically pursuing tuck-in M&A. I'll spend a few minutes on our first quarter results and capital structure, although I won't go into as much detail as normal since we previously released our preliminary results on April 21. I'll also speak to several macro considerations that remain a focus for this year. I'm on Slide 5. We're very pleased with the strength of our first quarter financial results. Q1 adjusted EBITDA was one of our best quarters relative to 2019 since the pandemic began and demonstrates the early progress of our long-range plan initiatives and our commitment to return to and then surpass 2019 results. Q1 net sales were $7.8 billion, which was an increase of 24% over the prior year. Total case volume increased 4%, and food cost inflation was 17%. Within volume, we had 9% independent case growth, 64% hospitality growth and 1% health care growth. Our year-over-year case growth was negatively impacted roughly 400 basis points by the mid-2021 exit of the grocery retail business we temporarily added during the pandemic. As you'd expect, January volume meaningfully slowed due to Omicron and then we saw a significant improvement in February and March. So far, during the second quarter, we've seen continued improvement in demand. As a reference, our independent case growth in recent weeks has been trending up mid-single digits compared to 2019. Hospitality case growth has continued to improve as well and in recent weeks has been mid-teens below 2019. As hospitality and health care improved from a macro recovery perspective and our expected new business is realized, combined with the accelerated restaurant case growth, we expect legacy volume to strengthen the 2019 levels later in this year. We produced very strong gross profit dollar growth again this quarter. Our adjusted gross profit dollars increased 24% from the prior year, which was more than the 20% increase in adjusted operating expense dollars. We progressed on many of our long-range plan initiatives that did and will enable share growth, increased gross margins and drive OpEx efficiency, which Andrew will talk more about shortly. The progress of our initiatives as well as benefit from food cost inflation resulted in a 40% increase in adjusted EBITDA and a 40 basis point increase in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to prior year first quarter. And finally, our adjusted diluted EPS increased to $0.36 per share. The macro environment remains a challenge for our industry and our customers. Thankfully, Omicron is largely in the rearview mirror, and severe COVID cases have declined significantly. Omicron played out in Q1 largely as expected from both the volume and cost impacts. And with summer approaching, we expect demand recovery to continue. Moving to labor. The labor market is better than it was in 2021, however, remains challenging. We continue to hire across our network to address staffing needs resulting from expected continued volume growth. With labor, the primary challenges retention, which is definitely not unique to us. Turnover is higher than it's been historically, and we've taken several actions to address this, such as limiting hours worked for new hires to ease them into the job, and retraining our frontline supply chain managers and supervisors on effective employee management engagement practices and processes. We're also finishing the deployment of our new selection technology in our warehouses and revising processes, leveraging our continuous improvement team to make the jobs a little easier. Retention remains a key focus for us. Moving to productivity. We are making progress as Q1 was better than Q4 and we remain focused on getting back to 2019 levels, along with increasing retention. Food cost inflation continued in the quarter with year-over-year inflation of 17.3% and sequential inflation of just under 3%, which is relevant to our entire industry. The sequential inflation is similar to last quarter and lower than the two quarters before that, which is a positive. Inflation is fairly broad-based across most categories, and we have been successful in passing it through to customers. The \"experts\" don't seem to have consensus on how inflation plays out over the balance of the year. Hopefully, the lower sequential inflation is a signal of stabilization. Supply challenges that remain for our industry more broadly don't appear as though they'll be resolved in the near term, but rather it is expected more likely later this year or into 2023. We haven't seen an impact on our demand at this point and are committed to helping our customers manage through this inflationary environment. Higher fuel costs is another form of inflation facing our industry. Fuel is not an insignificant cost for us. However, it's not nearly as significant as some of the other costs we incur. As a reference, we spent approximately $125 million in diesel fuel for outbound deliveries in 2021. We mitigate some of the fuel cost risk through locking in costs on a portion of our fuel, which right now is about a quarter of our estimated diesel fuel needs through Q1 of 2023. We also recover a portion of the increases through fuel surcharges to customers. We typically offset approximately 40% of our total fuel cost changes through customer fuel surcharges, and those surcharge amounts vary based on diesel fuel costs. This all means fuel cost is important, however, likely isn't going to be the single item that makes or breaks a year, and any impact is likely temporary as fuel costs normalize over time. The macro environment has its challenges. However, our business and our industry have strong recovery tailwinds. We are pleased with the strength of our Q1 results. And we expect that our continued progress on our strategic initiatives, combined with the macro recovery, will lead to further improvement in Q2 EBITDA and a strong fiscal year 2022. We are reaffirming our fiscal 2022 earnings guidance that we provided in February. I talked at Q1 on Slide 6, discussing our capital structure. We reduced our net debt dollars and leverage compared to both first quarter and fourth quarters of 2021. Our net leverage was 4.3 times at the end of the first quarter, which was a 3.2 turn reduction from a year ago and a 0.3 turn reduction from the end of 2021. Leverage reduction is one of the four components we outlined as part of our capital strategy I noted earlier. We continue to make progress toward our leverage goal of 2.5 times to 3 times net leverage and are committed to achieving it. In summary, I'm pleased with the progress in Q1 and optimistic about our balanced long-range plan, which Andrew will discuss next. Andrew, over to you. Sure. Lauren, this is Dirk. Good question. So we're absolutely focused on understanding our competitors, their performance and benchmark. We're actively working, as we talked about, to further expand our margins. And I think the key drivers of that are the things that Andrew has talked about and we've talked about our long-range plan, whether it's the cost of goods improvement, the logistics improvement, the supply chain efficiency items we've noted, it's really the key levers there that we've talked about. And we're focused on that balance of expanding the margins and maximizing our EBITDA dollars. We think that, especially during this time when the industry is in the state of recovery that, that balance of expanding margins and profitably growing share is critically important. And overall, our plan may or may not look exactly like competitors, large industry still collective small share for both of us and a lot of room to run. And we would expect to significantly grow EBITDA over this period, create significant shareholder value with a lot of it coming from improved margins. Thanks, Ed. So as I said earlier, pleased with Q1 and the progress. And our expectation still is to be at the high end of the range, assuming another -- that we don't have another Omicron-like wave. Really, for us, it's what you said, it's early in the year. We're one quarter in. Also, it's relative to other quarters, a relatively lower earning quarter. There are still some macro uncertainties, and we have three quarters, others have one quarter. So it's -- there's nothing to be read into there on our confidence. We remain very confident, and we'll adjust as appropriate going forward, but bullish on the momentum. Sure, Jake, good question. So our overall percentage isn't all that different than it was a few years ago, so those are still good proxies to use. And I think the other piece that I would add within supply chain that we've talked about in the past is we do spend more on delivery than we do warehouse. So the lion's share of those costs are people costs and then it is -- delivery is bigger. I think the only other thing I'd go back to is in supply chain. If you look at historically, I talked earlier about using 2021 as an example of how much we spend on fuel. I think that's just important because that is a piece that is not labor that helps you tease that part out there. And that's the part that, I think, it's important to understand that it's meaningful, but it's not near as significant as other expense buckets, and it would likely normalize over time. Sure. Thank you. Good question. So as you know, we have four very clearly defined capital priorities that I talked about earlier, and one of them is share repurchase. So our near term is really focused on investing in the business for growth and delevering, making very good progress. And as I talked about before, we expect to reach that range of 2.5 times to 3 times leverage next year. And so what we will be doing over the course of this year is doing the work to get ready and evaluate the different options for share -- return of capital to shareholders and would expect to talk further about that later this year and into early next year. So excited about the opportunity. We have strong growing cash flow in our business that allows us to really deploy that capital in different ways, including back to shareholders. I think the other thing, Jeff, what we see is a large customers, it really has raised over these last couple of years the importance of scaled, solid, reliable distribution partner, and that's really one of the things combined with our service model and technology that has really opened the door to a lot of this growth on the larger national customers and even on the independents, the resilience, the ability to manage through a far less an ideal vendor supply situation with independents. Andrew talked about Q1 that we gained share with our target customer types. Our early read on April is with independents. We had very good share growth again. So I think as Andrew talked about in his prepared comments, just very good momentum building on that. Peter, I think that you're right, it's down in the mid-teens and have seen continued improvement there. You probably remember that this business was down 70%, 80% right after COVID, so it's taken a little longer but seeing steady. Leisure had returned a little sooner. I think the encouraging thing is seeing business travel return. A number of the airlines, cruise lines, et cetera, all had comments on both leisure and business that were positive. So we feel good about that trajectory. I think that we're not seeing so much fewer customers as opposed to as customers, a few things, as you have conferences and things like that haven't fully returned from a business perspective, as you have operators that are working to get their staffing levels to the right place so they can open all of their dining venues and expand hours, et cetera. So I would expect that to continue to improve. And at this point, it appears as though the demand remains quite robust and the improvement to continue likely from a macro perspective, and then our sales team continues to focus on onboarding new customers, and that's really across each of our customer types. So we're bullish on the continued recovery for hospitality. So on that question. So the SGA or Food Group, so their EBITDA margins were a little bit lower than the broad line when we first bought them. That business, I would say, it's performing well in light of the current environment. So from the northwest and west, it's been a little slower to recovery, but we expect that to continue to recover. And in those markets, Food Group has been predominantly number one or number two in share, and we expect to build upon that as we go ahead. I think the other thing is we've talked a lot about. So our integration from a system perspective is done. We've completed our last facility here in the first quarter. That's going very well. Synergies are well on track for the $65 million that we talked about, we achieved. We talked about more than $40 million last year. So all in, pleased with how that progress is going on that key strategic assets. And just as the team continues to work there through the macro recovery, plus really driving share gains, we think that's going to continue to be an increased value driver for us. Sure. This is Dirk. I'll take that one. So it is -- so that comment is geared sort of more to some of the larger customers. And as we've talked about really for the last number of quarters, so it's not really a new specifically, it's really making sure that a number of those customers that tend to be at the lower end of the profitability that we're aligning their margins with the current operating environment. And so it's working closely with those customers. And in a number of cases, it can be increases in what we charge them. But there's also -- it's a pretty complete work with them. It can be things like adjusting delivery frequency. It can be having them align on more of our own private brands, which saves them money. So things like that, they're all about the dynamics. We think it is pretty durable. The sort of the demand and capacity in the industry is very different than it was three or four years ago. And in each case, really what it's doing is I could think of a few larger customers where this environment has built some of the best relationships collaboratively between the two teams that we've had historically, and it's sort of geared around success for both. So I think it's durable and expect to continue to work with customers on that. Yes. So this is similar to what we've seen in the last few quarters. You're right it is about 3% and lot of had to do with just our independent case growth, as you continue to see that outpace the business and the success we've had, and that's a place where it shows up as a proof point that it is real, and we are growing faster than the market on that. Andrew commented earlier in his -- either one of his answers or a prepared comment that we really haven't seen systemic trade downs in there, yes, we see demand remain robust. And so overall, I feel good about the demand environment. And yes, that's really what's driving a lot of the mix benefit."

            "name": "Andrew Iacobucci",
            "content": "Thanks, Dirk, and it's great to be here with everyone this morning. I'm truly honored to step into the Interim CEO role, and I look forward to working closely with Bob the management team and our associates to continue moving our business forward and to build on the success of our first quarter. For the past five years, I've led the company's merchandising operations and more recently our broader commercial team, which has allowed me to develop an in-depth knowledge of our customers and of our operations. And as Bob mentioned, I have focused heavily during that time on driving market share and optimizing gross margins and have worked very closely with Bill Hancock and this entire supply chain team throughout. This has given me a great perspective on our team, on our capabilities and on our opportunities going forward. I have to say I could not be more excited about our position in the market and our ability to capitalize on what lies ahead. My focus as interim CEO will be ensuring that we relentlessly focus on executing the plan and continue to build the momentum and not miss a beat in the process. With that, let me walk you through the progress we're making to drive profitable growth, expand margins and improve our operational efficiencies. I'm now on Page 8, which is a recall slide from our February presentation and provides an overview of the long-range plan that we presented. Our plan, which we expect will generate $1.7 billion of adjusted EBITDA in 2024, is balanced across all three pillars: first, profitably growing market share; second, optimizing gross profit; and third, improving operational efficiency. This plan builds on our solid track record leading up to COVID, especially in market share and gross margins, and brings additional focus to improving operational efficiency, thanks to a number of significant changes we made coming out of COVID. First, we brought in considerable new talent. The head of supply chain, head of IT and the head of our newly created program office are all new and all three are outstanding additions to our team. Inside supply chain, three quarters of the leadership team is new and brings considerable experience from the outside. Second, we introduced a new operating model in April of 2021 with excellence teams whose sole mandate is to drive standardization and bring additional focus to underperforming markets. These excellence teams are staffed with our best talent and have been an integral part of our success. And third, late last year, we introduced customer prioritization or tiering as a way to provide a differentiated service to our best customers while simultaneously removing waste and inefficiency in our operations. This approach to customer tiering has been proven in other industries, and we are beginning to see the benefits of it. Taken together, these three changes represent considerable differences compared to the way we operated in 2018 and 2019, and they undergird our conviction around the long-range plan. I'm now moving to Page 9, initiatives to grow market share. Each of Pages 9 through 11 is set up in the same way with a recall on the long-range plan goals for this pillar on the top left, Q1 progress on the bottom left and the key initiatives over the three years on the right. Recall that our goal is to grow 1.5 times the market with restaurants, and this pillar is expected to generate approximately $290 million of incremental EBITDA over the three-year plan. Progress in the first quarter was good, as illustrated by market share gains in key customer types and a 9% increase in independent case volume. I will now highlight a few of the key initiatives that will continue to drive the three-year plan for market share. First, we will drive market share gains by creating a more differentiated service and fresh experience, which our research tells us is a meaningful opportunity. We are using our customer prioritization framework I mentioned earlier to further improve service and to remove waste via our routing initiative. On fresh and, in particular, produce, we spent all of 2021, enhancing our quality control processes and are now turning our attention to activating this great quality promise with our customers. Early results in our test markets have been very positive. On the larger customer side of the house, our pipeline so far is close to the new business we brought on over the last two years, and these gains are being driven in part by our service model and our technology. An example of this technology is our recently introduced Vitals, which helps hospitals manage their menus and their overall cost and has allowed them to gain a 5% improvement in their operating budget in many instances. In addition, our omnichannel strategy will continue to fuel market share gains in the coming years, and we are on track to open four new -- four to six new CHEF'S STOREs this year. Now turning to Page 10 for a review of our recent results and future initiatives driving our second pillar, optimizing gross margins. Recall that this pillar is expected to contribute approximately $325 million of EBITDA growth over the long-range plan. And as you can see on the bottom left, we've made good progress on all elements of the plan, including pricing, exclusive brand penetration, freight and passing on inflation. We continue to have good success resetting terms with select less profitable large customers, which is in part the result of a more attractive industry structure than historically. Moreover, new customers are coming in at margins that are much closer to independent restaurants. And lastly, we see continued opportunity to increase private brand penetration. On the cost of goods, we are optimizing our vendor relationships to ensure our terms are in line with our scale. On the freight side, in addition to the progress we've made optimizing vendor allowances and carriers, which is contributing to our first quarter results, we are taking advantage of the opportunity to use our scale to reap greater benefits from backhaul opportunities. Freight income per case was above 2019 in Q1, which is a first since COVID began. Let's move now to Page 11 to cover some highlights on improving operational efficiency. Recall that this pillar is expected to contribute approximately $235 million of EBITDA growth over the long-range plan. In the first quarter, we made progress as we gained operating leverage by increasing OpEx less than great -- gross profit, increased our selective productivity from Q4 levels and implemented our warehouse selection technology at additional facilities and are on track to be complete by early Q3. We are currently engaged in Phase 1 of our routing optimization initiative. Customer order patterns and mix have changed significantly throughout the recovery, and we are in the process of removing ways of miles from our routes while maintaining on-time delivery as indicated by industry-leading net promoter scores. While we are early in the process, our leading markets are achieving a nearly 10% improvement in cases per mile when compared to the same period in 2019. And later this year, we will begin remapping -- the remapping component of Phase 1, which will ensure that our customers are serviced by the distribution center that can serve them most efficiently. Later this year, we will begin Phase 2, and that work will replace our current routing platform with dynamic routing technology and will further drive out wasted miles and improve the customer experience. Our continuous improvement work is focused on aggressively standardizing process, including how we plan for our work, how we execute our work and how we create the right environment for our associates and leaders to drive safety, service and cost improvements. As we continue to navigate a competitive labor environment, we are making progress on our network plan that includes analyzing brownfield and greenfield automated solutions. We expect to begin testing brownfield prototypes later this year, and we'll continue to pursue more comprehensive greenfield solutions in parallel with that work. In conclusion, our results are promising affirmation of our strong early progress in implementing our long-range plan, and I want to thank all of our associates for their continued focus and commitment to our business. Despite continuing challenges impacting our industry, we delivered one of our strongest quarters since the pandemic began, a testament to strong execution by our entire team. I'm excited to lead this great company during this interim period, and I am confident we have a great plan and a great future ahead. Operator, please open up the line for questions. Thanks, Lauren, it's Andrew. Thanks for the question. Yes, we are paying very close attention to the impact of inflation in our world. We're seeing it everywhere, not just obviously in our industry. So far, we are not seeing any meaningful impact on demand. We also are, I think, being buoyed by what continues to be a post-COVID sort of recovery and the pent-up demand that comes with that. But we are expecting it to continue, and we are continuing to monitor it very closely. We are also taking pretty aggressive steps to manage and help our customers, that is, manage through this difficult time. Our rocks and our food-fanatic chefs have spent a great deal of time with our customers, helping them understand how to rebuild their menus to get away from heavily inflation-impacted categories, rejigging their recipes in the process and also looking at opportunities to engineer their menus to pass along that inflation to the customers. And those have had significant positive impact on our customers. Yes, Jake, thanks. It's Andrew. Thanks for the question. Look, we've built this plan quite intentionally to be balanced across all three pillars. And what I think is most encouraging about our first quarter is that we saw really strong improvement across all three, and our plan is to continue to drive all three and equal. So I would not say there is a first among equals on this list, and we are working actually very closely together to ensure that, that balance continues. Yes. I think to answer the last part of your question first, I think that is a big opportunity regardless of the environment that we're in. As Dirk mentioned, it's a large market we play in and quite fragmented, and we continue to see opportunity to grow market share, and we'll pursue that. As far as the resiliency goes, we've seen some data from Technomic and others that show that consumer spending even during downturn tends to stay quite consistent. What you see instead is a change in the mix of their spending behavior. That food out of home, those stays at a relatively consistent level. The good news about our business is we've got such diversification across all segments in our industry. And that diversification, I think, puts us in a very good position to manage through if there is a change in that -- those demand behaviors. The other thing I would say is that COVID has taught us a lot about moving nimbly into where the market is moving. And we, I think, are very, very well positioned to take advantage of that should we see a slowdown. Yes. Thanks, Nicole, for the question. So we are in the process of returning to work in a sort of hybrid fashion. So physically, we are together on a regular basis throughout the month. But the team is -- in terms of the coherence and the sort of working-together attitude of the organization, I think we've seen a real step-up with the new additions. We've had, as I mentioned, not only really, I think, strong improvements to our IT with the addition of John Tonnison; as well as our Chief Supply Chain Officer, Bill Hancock; and then the program office, I mentioned. All three have made, I think, a very meaningful impact, not only on their functions but also on our coherent and cohesiveness as a team. I also mentioned in my remarks that Bill has made very significant supply chain additions. He has an extensive network from his time in retail and in tire distribution that he's tapped incredibly effectively into. And all -- every single one of the hires that he has made has meaningfully improved our capabilities in those areas. So we're very, very excited about the team and its ability to move forward. Yes. Thanks, Nicole, for the question. We certainly saw a sizable bump in their business during the early and mid-stages of COVID. And that was a combination of factors, obviously driving that. It's a very well-priced, very cost-effective option for many of our customers. And I think what you'll see in the event of slowdown is that, that becomes a more and more viable option for our customer base, and so we expect it to be very resilient in whatever macro environment we're playing in. Yes, Jeff, it's Andrew. Thanks for the question. The short answer is we actually want to be looking at both penetrating existing customers as well as driving new. When we are in balance across those two priorities, we see very, very strong growth and market share performance. Obviously, the more we can build share of wallet of our existing customers, that's a very -- those are very profitable cases given that we're not stopping the truck anymore, and the marginal cost to deliver is very, very low. But we also need to be always on the lookout for new opportunities to grow our business through new. And one of the things, I think, was most promising about our Q1 results is that we saw both of those in balance in Q1. Thanks for the question. We don't really have a clear sense of that, obviously, Jeff. It's -- we -- our shared data tells us how we're doing relative to the market, doesn't give us the specifics around where it's coming from. But we certainly have seen a pretty strong balance in where we believe that growth is coming from, from both smaller players, but also from our larger competitors. It's been very, very balanced. Yes. Thanks, Brian. It's Andrew. Yes. So we see it really more as a hygiene play to continue to make sure that we're examining our cost of goods. With all the supply disruptions and the demand volatility that we've seen, we have a very different looking mix of products than we have in the past. We think there's an opportunity to make sure that we are really focused around our cost of goods in those new categories and segments to make sure that we are consistent with where we believe we should be. But there's also a bigger opportunity there, which is to find real win-win opportunities for both ourselves and our supplier community. So it's really more in the spirit of partnership that we entered these conversations to find ways, to make ourselves a lower cost to serve and in return achieve a much better cost of goods. Yes. Thanks, Peter. It's Andrew. The -- we see our private label mix is roughly where we were in 2019. We've seen a nice recovery back to that. We've had obviously significant supply issues during the pandemic that resulted in order to ensure we were getting product in us consolidating some of our private label offering. We are seeing that coming back very, very quickly. And we are absolutely seeing the trend that you anticipated, which is as a result of inflation, there is even greater value in our private label brands than there was before, which is seeing a really strong move into those brands. The other factor that's an important contributor to that is it because supply has been so difficult throughout the pandemic, many of our customers are much more willing to try alternatives than they were before, and so we are seeing that as a real enabler of those conversions. Yes. Thanks, John. You hit on what I think is a really big opportunity for us. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, one of the things we took the better part of last year to focus on was just getting our produce quality consistent day in and day out. We have put in a quite significant process as well as technology enablement that I think has allowed us to be as good as anyone out there. And we have now started to stand behind that through a customer activation pilot we have going in a couple of our markets, and that is showing really, really strong results. We have slightly lower share in produce but actually slightly higher share in center of plate. So there's a big opportunity to grow that produce business, but both will benefit from that relentless focus on quality. Customers, if they can count on getting high-quality product day in and day out, really, really is a huge source of loyalty and a great way to onboard new business. And so we're very -- feeling very good about the progress we've made on that front. Yes, Kelly, thanks for the question. I guess I'd answer that in a couple of ways. The first -- really the core to this adjustment that we made in implementing the new model was to create these excellence organizations on both the commercial team as well as on Bill's supply chain team. And they are seasoned pros, mostly from the field who really understand the field and how it operates. And what they are allowing us to do in a way that we've not been able to do anywhere near successfully before is that they identify, they document and then they deploy best practices from around the country across the country. So a really good example of that has been a big part of why we've seen such strong market share growth as something we call the recipe, which is our focused attention around where growth is in the market and allowing us to direct our sellers' focus into the menu types that are growing in their area and go after those with relentless execution. Another good example, Bill, you may want to talk about is around some of the work we did on the supply chain side. It's Andrew. Thanks for the question, Mark. No, I think it's more the former than the latter. I think what we're seeing is a strong desire from consumers to get back to normal in many aspects of their life, and dining out is a big part of that. It's both. It's probably more on the customer loyalty side. We have done, I think, just some incredible work over the course of the pandemic of both identifying sort of major challenges that our operators are facing and then quickly deploying support and resources against those. The examples abound, whether it's Ghost Kitchens, whether it's navigating the CARES Act. And then most recently, the tools I mentioned around managing inflation, all of those things I have no hesitation saying is our industry-leading both in terms of their value but also in terms of how quickly we've been able to get them up and running. It's a big part of, I think, what our advantage is in the market and something we're going to continue to leverage. Sure. Thanks, John. I'll touch quickly on -- from a commercial standpoint. We've seen is not so much systematic differences but just opportunities to get better. There's -- in any large group, there's going to be a pro distribution, and that's what we see in our markets. So the opportunity really is to take those strong performers, learn what they're doing differently and deploy those to the markets that are not performing as strongly. Thanks, John. So we are on track for deployment starting later this year and into early next, and we're feeling very good about the capabilities that will provide us with."

            "name": "Bill Hancock",
            "content": "Yes, Jeffrey, this is Bill. I appreciate the question. In our industry, the best way to offset the labor challenges is to get more productive, and we've done that from the fourth quarter into the first. And we're continuing to see consistent month-over-month improvement on that. Turnover is the biggest headwind, I think, any company has right now in terms of driving additional productivity. And that's why, like Andrew mentioned earlier, our CI efforts, continuous improvement are focused on how we onboard associates, how we schedule that team and the technology that they interface with. We finished a very large proof-of-delivery device deployment for our drivers. It helps onboard them faster, helps them be more productive. And then inside the warehouse by midpoint this year, we'll have fully deployed a new selection technology, both software and hardware, that both helps onboard faster and help that team be more productive. We are seeing stabilization in the labor markets. The one call out I would have there is Class A drivers. That challenge is not going away for anyone anytime soon, which is why we're continuing to invest into training our own, building our own pipeline. We are offering new jobs to folks that don't have a Class A today. We'll put them through a school. We'll make sure they get full training and then offer them that full-time job right after that so they can join the team. Yes. Like Andrew mentioned earlier -- this is Bill, by the way. It's kind of a two-phase project. Phase 1 is looking at our current routing system and what waste exists. As we've taken new share and customer patterns have changed throughout COVID, it's created opportunities where there's waste inside of our routing. So that first phase that we're in right now is focused on ripping out those wasted miles. Our leading markets are seeing 10% or greater improvement on cases per mile versus that same time period in 2019, and we think there's additional upside on top of that. So that work is ongoing right now, delivering results to the bottom line. That remapping effort, that kicks off here in just a couple of months. We'll have that fully deployed by the close of this year, and that's an opportunity to make sure that as we brought on those new customers, they're mapped to the most efficient DC in terms of mileage in service levels. Both our internal and NPS data validates that the service levels we're providing as we go through this are as good, if not better, than they were in 2019. Yes, John, this is Bill. Great question. When we think about automation, it really is a dual path, both brownfield and greenfield. Andrew mentioned earlier, our work on the brownfield side is coming first. We see the biggest opportunity to retrofit existing facilities versus greenfield. And that's why we're bringing our first brownfield testing online by the close of this year, and we look forward to sharing some additional results with that later on. On the greenfield side, that work is happening in parallel. With our network plan, we've identified those focus markets where we feel like we're going to be capacity constrained in the years to come and creates really good opportunity for us to invest in a greenfield site. And if we're going to invest in a greenfield site, we want to fully explore what an automated solution looks like. Yes. Kelly, when you think about this new operating model, you pull that expertise from the field, you identify what market in the field is best-in-class at a specific function, and you try to replicate that for the organization. Two quick examples, one being our assortment work. We identified our market that's most efficient with their assortment, and that ultimately led to driving a 15% reduction in SKUs across the network. Much more efficient on the supply chain side. We reduced spoilage. We reduced that redundancy, makes it easier to execute the business. And then flipping over to the routing side, that routing initiative was built by these excellence teams. We identified the market that is best in class inside of our network, and we've replicated that behavior to get that 10% improvement we addressed."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the US Foods Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mike Neese, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMike Neese: Thank you Eric. Good morning and welcome to US Foods fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2023 earnings call. On today's call, we have David Flitman, our CEO; and Dirk Locascio, our CFO. We will take your questions after our prepared remarks conclude. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Our earnings release issued earlier this morning in today's presentation can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at ir.usfoods.com. During today's call and unless otherwise stated, we're comparing our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results to the same period in fiscal year 2022. In addition to historical information, certain statements made during today's call are considered forward-looking statements. Please review the risk factors in our Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of the potential factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from as anticipated in those results.

We are not providing reconciliations to forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to David.\nDavid Flitman: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to today's agenda. I'll start by sharing highlights from my first year at US Foods and progress against our key strategy pillars and long-range plan. Before I hand it over to Dirk to review our fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results as well as fiscal 2024 guidance. 2023 was an exciting year at US Foods to execution of our strategy and long-range plan which underpins our company's transformation, we accomplished many of our goals, including capturing profitable market share and enhancing margins. Following this past year's success, I am even more confident in our ability to continue to gain profitable market share with independent restaurants, health care and hospitality customers, improved productivity, drive margin expansion and deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth. We achieved record full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA of $1.56 billion, driven by strong case growth, including independent case growth of nearly 7% and market share gains with target customer types. This was combined with 53 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion which came as a result of the implementation of key operational initiatives we outlined at the beginning of the year. Our proprietary digital platforms, MOXe and VITALS were key drivers of our top line performance in 2023 and are enablers of further growth in 2024 and beyond. We also deployed our strong operating cash flow to reduce net leverage to 2.8x which is within our target range, repurchased approximately $300 million in shares and completed 2 accretive tuck-in acquisitions, all while investing in the business for continued organic growth. We continue to lead the industry in the digital customer experience by constantly innovating and adding new capabilities to meet our customers' needs. Our differentiated business model, digital expertise and sustainable competitive advantages will enable us to drive continued market outperformance. The structural improvements we made in 2023 position us to win in any macro environment. My confidence comes from the strong momentum we've built, delivering against our long-range plan and from our 30,000 dedicated associates who bring their expertise and tireless dedication to work every day. Turning to Slide 4; our strategy guides how we operate and what we are focused on to win and comprises 4 pillars: culture, service, growth and profit. I believe these are the right areas of focus to ensure continued service improvements and sustainable top and bottom line growth. We're excited about the progress we've made to accelerate each of these coming into this year. Moving to Slide 5; let's take a look at some of our key accomplishments in 2023 that our team delivered under our 4 pillars. Our first pillar is culture. The safety of our associates remains our number 1 priority and we made significant strides in 2023 to reduce the number of vehicle accidents and associated entries across our facilities. Our injury and accident frequency rates improved from the prior year by 23% and importantly, our fourth quarter and full year 2023 safety results were our best in recent history. Additionally, creating a supportive and inclusive workplace is key to our success and we enhanced our diverse talent pipeline by filling 47% of new or open leadership roles with women or people of color, exceeding our 40% goal. We also remain responsible stewards of our planet. And in 2023, reported reducing absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 13% during the previous year, 40% of the way toward achieving our 2032 target. We continue to make progress on infrastructure design and construction to support electric vehicles and took delivery of 40 electric trucks and 8 electric yard tractors in addition to completing the delivery of 42 compressed natural gas trucks. We also continue to innovate and offer our customers more sustainable private label products many of which come under our Serve Good product portfolio. In 2023, as part of our strategic focus on fighting hunger, we donated more than $13 million in food and supplies to hunger and disaster relief partners which is the equivalent of roughly 5 million meals for more than 225 drug loads of food. As a Feeding America mission partner, US Foods provides year-round support to food banks across the country through financial and product donations. This work is supported by our associates who volunteer their time and resources to fight hunger through annual company-wide engagement campaigns. Since 2007, US Foods has donated more than 170 million pounds of product to a national hunger relief efforts. Turning to our service pillar; we continue to focus on providing a best-in-class delivery experience. We are proud to report our on-time and in-full customer service levels are now back to pre-COVID levels. We delivered the best cases per mile in our company's history again in the fourth quarter, improving over our prior third quarter record. We launched the Dicard [ph] routing pilot in 2 markets in the fourth quarter and have taken away early learnings to apply to our national launch this year. Our routing initiative provided us with more than 5% improvement in routing effectiveness in 2023, while also focusing on further improvements in on-time deliveries enabled by the Dicard [ph] platform. As I mentioned earlier, we are also transforming the experience for our customers through our MOXe digital solutions platform that enables customers to easily place orders, manage inventory and pay bills while freeing up time for our sales teams to further accelerate growth. In short, it puts our supply chain in the hands of our customers. which will generate tremendous efficiency for both our customers and U.S. fees. MOXe is now fully embedded with our independent restaurant business and approximately 50% of our national chain business with full deployment anticipated by the second half of 2024. Our digital penetration is at an all-time high of 73% for independent restaurants. Our Net Promoter Score which is the highest in the industry among top foodservice distributors continues to increase since the launch of MOXe. We want to help our customers succeed and are giving them digital tools to make it easier for them to do business with us which we believe is a key differentiating factor in our success. Now let's turn to our growth pillar. In 2023, we had net sales growth of 4.5% to $35.6 billion, driven by our 4.4% growth in total case volume led by a 6.9% increase in independent restaurant case volume, a 7.2% increase in health care volumes and an 8.9% increase in hospitality volumes. We exceeded our 1.5x restaurant market growth goal and have now gained market share with independent restaurants for 11 consecutive quarters. We anticipate this will continue over the course of 2024. Our volume gains in both health care and hospitality were driven largely by converting our pipeline of customers into new business through our service model and innovation, such as our highly differentiated VITALS platform for acute care and senior living facilities. This platform allows customers to increase patient satisfaction and reduce labor and staffing costs. This improves revenue flow and bolsters operations through more effective pricing strategies, staff training and menu planning. We also continue to differentiate ourselves through our fresh, on-trend and labor savings Scoop product innovations, such as our recently launched Chef's Line exclusive brand of Kim Chi Fried Rice and a unique team-based selling model featuring our expert chefs and restaurant operation consultants, these are significant competitive differentiators that our customers have grown to value. Our hard work and commitment to constantly innovate was recognized as one of Fortune's most innovative companies that are transforming industries from the inside out. Companies were ranked based on an assessment of 4 dimensions of innovation, product, process, culture and revenue growth. We believe our products will continue to be industry-leading as we use our in-house expertise, market research and supplier relationships to deliver value to our customers. We also expanded Pronto which is our differentiated and flexible small truck delivery model aimed at improving customer service in targeted dense geographies. Today, Pronto has the presence in 35 markets and we plan to launch it in another 5 markets in 2024. Pronto has been a great addition to our customer service model and has accelerated independent restaurant case growth in markets where we have added it. Much opportunity remains for continued growth in both existing and new markets. The real machine behind our growth pillar is our sellers. Last quarter, I highlighted that we were working on revisions to our territory manager sales compensation plan. I want to provide a bit more context on the changes that we've made. Why change now? We had our current sales compensation trends for several years and last made modifications during the early portion of the pandemia. We wanted to ensure our sales teams are aligned and accelerating profitable growth and that requires effectively incentivizing our sellers for that profitable growth. A few highlights; we made more of our sellers compensation variable with a variable component now uncapped and focused on accelerating profitable growth and private label penetration. We have signed individual volume targets and higher-margin private label targets for sellers that roll up to our company business plan. ensuring we are all working together to achieve our profit and market share growth goals. Finally, we have implemented a more disciplined approach to route splitting to ensure our territory sizes are manageable. We are confident this plan better positions us for success and ensures we are growing together across the organization. In 2023, we increased seller head count by 6%. We're having great success in finding the right sales talent to ensure that our profitable growth continues well into the future. We continue to believe adding sales head count in the low to mid-single digits is the right model for US Foods going forward. Turning to M&A; to bolster our local footprint in select markets, we executed two tuck-in acquisitions last year, renting foodservice and Saladino's food service. And this morning, we're excited to announce that we've signed an agreement to purchase IWC Food Service which serves the greater Nashville area, one of the fastest-growing markets in the country. This acquisition fills an important gap in our footprint and allows us to expand into the Central Tennessee market. IWC has approximately 220 associates and $200 million in annual sales. More than half of their business is in the growing independent restaurant space. We're excited to welcome the IWC associates to the US Foods team and are targeting to close the transaction in the second quarter. Finally, let's move to our profit pillar. Driving margin, productivity and optimization of our business are the key tenets of this pillar, addressing cost of goods sold proactively managing pricing to help neutralize commodity volatility and healthy volume growth with target customer types all contributed to enhancing our margins. As a result of our improving execution, we grew adjusted EBITDA 19% to a record $1.56 billion and delivered record EBITDA per case, while expanding adjusted EBITDA margin by over 50 basis points to 4.4% and growing adjusted EPS by 23% to $2.63. Adjusted gross profit grew 9% in 2023 to $6.1 billion. We drove further progress on initiatives such as cost of goods sold by working collaboratively with additional vendors. We addressed approximately 60% of COGS last year and continue to look for additional cost savings in 2024 as we deliver on the remaining 40% of our vendor spend that has not yet been addressed. We are also focused on growing our private label brands where our penetration was up 40 basis points to over 50% with independent restaurants. Adjusted operating expenses grew less than gross profit, resulting in operating leverage. Our flexible scheduling initiative is now live at over half of our locations and we continue to receive positive feedback. We will roll out the remaining appropriate locations in 2024. We continue to see significant improvements across our network, especially in our pilots, including year-over-year reduction in turnover that is approximately twice the rate of improvement versus our other locations. 33% improvement in safety and continued improvement in productivity. As a result of our supply chain initiatives, we delivered more than 5% improvement in both delivery and warehouse productivity. We began to see early results with our indirect spending initiative late last year and expect to accelerate those savings in 2024. We have identified a number of opportunities which will favorably and permanently impact operating expenses. This work is an important enabler to achieving our target of 3% to 5% overall annual productivity savings in 2024. Before I hand it over to Dirk, I would like to highlight one of our talented associates. Soon, we will be celebrating associates who ignite excellence in our first-ever CEO awards. Out of hundreds of associates nominated across the company, Mike Talmadge, our night warehouse manager in Albany is 1 of our 25 semi-finalist nominations. Mike's leadership has driven significant improvements in safety, associated engagement, quality and profit at the local level. His efforts have quickly become a benchmark for excellence within the company, influencing customer service and our ability to grow profitably. Mike has one of thousands of our associates who strive for greatness within US Foods and we appreciate his leadership and the dedication of each of our associates. I am pleased with our progress in 2023 as we gained momentum, executing against the 4 pillars of our strategy which is driving improved safety, service, productivity and profitability. Even considering this tremendous progress, we have a long runway of profitable growth. The team and I look forward to sharing our next long-range plan during our Investor Day in June and we hope you will join us. Let me now turn the call over to Dirk to discuss our fourth quarter results and our 2024 guidance.\nDirk Locascio: Thank you, Dave and good morning, everyone. I'll cover 3 topics with you this morning. First, I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. Second, I'll provide an update on capital deployment. And finally, I'll discuss our first quarter and full year 2024 guidance. Turning to Slide 7. I'll walk you through our fourth quarter results in greater detail. The fourth quarter was a strong finish to 2023 as our full year adjusted EBITDA margins increased double digits and we continue to grow our margins. Net sales increased 4.9% to $8.9 billion, driven by total case volume growth of 5.6%. Food cost inflation was essentially flat, while mix was a headwind of 70 basis points. We drove strong volume growth in each of our target customer types again this quarter. Volume increased 7.3% for independent restaurants, including approximately 100 basis points of growth from acquisitions. Healthcare growth was 8.1% and hospitality was 5%. Health care and hospitality continued to deliver strong profitable growth, driven in large part by healthy net new business. We remain focused on expanding within our target customer types and expect to continue that momentum in 2024. Chef store volume in November and December had low single-digit case growth which was in line with our expectations. We continue to expect accelerated growth in 2024. This quarter, we moved Chef store cases to all other and thus, they are no longer included in independence. We made this change to be consistent with how third-party providers such as Carcano, formerly known as MPD, report market share data and it better aligns with how peers communicate their broadline growth. All periods have been up for consistency. During the fourth quarter, adjusted gross profit increased 6% to $1.5 billion, while adjusted operating expenses increased 4% to $1.2 billion. Our adjusted gross profit continues to grow faster than adjusted OpEx. Adjusted EBITDA was $388 million or 11% growth from the prior year. We expanded adjusted EBITDA margins by nearly 25 basis points to 4.3%. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 16.4% to $0.64 per share, demonstrating our continued growth of EPS faster than adjusted EBITDA. Turning to Slide 8; we made significant progress on a per case basis in 2023 which we believe emphasizes the strong execution of our strategy. Our adjusted gross profit per case increased 4.5% in 2023, while our adjusted operating expense per case was up 1%. Importantly, our adjusted EBITDA per case was $1.93 for the full year. up 14% year-over-year and represents 4.3% compound annual growth rate since 2019. We have demonstrated strong leverage through the P&L with operating expense per case growing at a slower rate than gross profit per case and we expect to maintain that operational discipline in 2024 and beyond. Moving to Slide 9; our strong operating cash flow creates flexibility to deploy capital strategically to enable growth. Our 2023 operating cash flow was $1.1 billion with free cash flow of over $800 million. We invested $309 million in cash CapEx. We continue to focus on -- to expand our fleet and invest in capacity and technology to enable organic growth. Our ongoing cash CapEx target is approximately 1% of net sales and we will remain disciplined in our approach. Following the successful closing of [indiscernible] in Q3, we closed the Saladino's acquisition in December for a purchase price of $56 million. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders as we repurchased 1.6 million shares in the fourth quarter for $65 million. We have $192 million remaining on our $500 million share repurchase program. Before moving on to guidance, I want to highlight the significant progress we made in reducing our leverage in 2023. We ended the year at 2.8x levered which is a 0.7 turn reduction versus 2022. We were steadfast in our approach to lowering our leverage last year which we accomplished through disciplined debt paydowns and EBITDA growth. We expect to remain in our net target leverage range between 2.5x and 3x for 2024. Our balance sheet is in solid shape which informs our capital allocation framework. We will continue to invest in the business, repurchase shares given the current valuation of our stock price and evaluate tuck-in M&A opportunities. Now, I'll discuss our guidance on Slide 11. Importantly, there are several assumptions on this slide. For full year 2024, we expect total company net sales to be $37.5 billion to $38.5 billion. an increase of approximately 5% to 8%. We believe we can grow our total cases by 4% to 6% and we expect slight inflation of 0.5% to 1.5%. Our tuck-in M&A from last year, combined with the IWC announcement will add approximately 2 percentage points to our case growth. We expect our independent restaurant case growth to continue running higher than our overall case growth. As a result of good faith barging efforts, our agreement with the union Investa bill that represents our drivers was gratified at February 3. US Foods has a long-standing record of our being in good faith and reaching agreements with the union. From the start, we took a principal approach and provided a fair offer to the union before and after the expiration of the contract on December 29th. We are pleased that the agreed upon proposal largely reflects the economics outlined in that offer. The 5-year agreement provides wage and benefit increases that builds on the highly competitive offerings are drivers [indiscernible] currently receive. It also includes safety enhancements aligned with the very high priority we place on associate safety. There was an increased cost to us for business continuity and labor relations to serve our customers. as well as weather-related issues across the country which have been noted by several others in our industry. As a result, we expect an approximate $20 million negative impact to adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter, primarily driven by incremental costs during the labor disruptions. We believe the first quarter adjusted EBITDA will be in a range of $340 million to $355 million. Even with the labor disruption and the weather-related issues that we experienced in January, we remain confident in achieving our full year guidance. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be $1.69 billion to $1.74 billion and adjusted diluted EPS to be $3.20. This translates into double-digit growth on the bottom line from the combination of profitable growth and margin expansion as we expect gross profit per case to grow faster than OpEx. In closing, 2023 was a strong year. I feel very good about the opportunity in front of us. the momentum we are generating and our growth potential this year, as outlined in our 2024 guidance. I'll now pass it back to Dave for his closing remarks.\nDavid Flitman: Thanks, Dirk. As we move into 2024, we will continue to execute our strategy and maintain our disciplined approach to capital deployment to drive long-term value creation for our shareholders. Before we head into Q&A, I would like to comment on our long-term growth prospects. As I've said before, our 2024 adjusted EBITDA target is not a ceiling for this company. and we are confident that we will continue to grow adjusted EBITDA in the high single to low double-digit range over the next several years. And we will continue to grow adjusted EPS even faster through a combination of earnings growth and share repurchases. Stay tuned. There's more to come at our Investor Day on June 5. We are in a great position today and I believe we have sustainable competitive advantages to outperform the market well into the future as we continue to do what we do best, helping our customers make it every day. Thank you for your continued trust and confidence in US Foods. I have never been more excited about our future. With that, Eric, please open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank.\nLauren Silberman: Congrats on the quarter. If I could just start with capital allocation. It looks like you'll get close to $1 billion in free cash flow this year. not your target leverage, even with acquisitions, it looks like you have a lot of cash left over. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about capital allocation appetite to further pay down debt versus buybacks or even the potential for a dividend?\nDirk Locascio: This is Dirk. So yes, we were excited to strong cash flow. We do expect that to meaningfully grow as you point out, as we grow earnings. And as our debt is already well within our target range, what we expect in 2024 as to have a reduction in leverage but more from earnings growth as opposed to much more on debt pay down. So that means that in addition to investing in the business, it will be around share repurchases and opportunistic M&A. So we're very excited about the IWC announcement this morning and we would expect over the course of the year to increase the amount that we allocate for share repurchases.\nLauren Silberman: Great. Very helpful. And then if I could just ask on case growth. And there's a lot of noise is whether in some of the idiosyncratic factors you called out in 1Q. Any color on what you're seeing more recently as things began to normalize and just the confidence in the 4% to 6% case growth for the year?\nDavid Flitman: Yes. Thanks for the question, Lauren. As you've heard from others, there were a few other disruptions across the country in January. That's no surprise. But we were pleased actually with the recovery that we've seen since we've got past the labor disruption and those weather events, notwithstanding what happened on the West Coast last week and a little northeastern earlier this week. And really, really pleased with the team's work around the labor disruption. I've been doing this for a long time in many industries and I've seen labor disruptions before. I will tell you that we are as well prepared going into that event, as I've ever seen. We came out with a very strong plan to go get our volume back. And so I'm pleased to see the progress that we've made and largely in those non-labor disrupted markets, we've seen our volumes get back to basically the trajectory we saw in the fourth quarter which was very strong, as you heard this morning. So really feeling good about that. And just a little bit more color I can give you is the early read on the [indiscernible], formerly MPD, as Dirk said, we maintained our market share in January and I was quite pleased to hear that. So all in all, more work to do but feel really good about our trajectory and certainly our team's focus to continue to drive that growth.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Harbour: When you think about sort of the productivity and OpEx opportunity this year, what do you think will be most impactful kind of that's different than what you did in '23?\nDavid Flitman: Well, I think largely, Brian, you will see us continue to lean in on the areas that we've been focused on and I was pleased. It's kind of the tale of 2 halves last year. We spent a lot of time in the first half of the year really honing our focus in on the needle-moving activities and really pleased with the trajectory that you saw us deliver in the back half of the year resulting in those productivity improvements that I quoted. And look, there's more work to do in all of those areas, whether it's in COGS and the work we've done with our suppliers the pricing optimization work and certainly the supply chain productivity. Really pleased with the progress we're making at routing but there's a lot more to do there. So largely the same. You heard my comments earlier about indirect spend. that's a piece of work that we started to talk about in the back half of last year and really started to see some traction really in the back half of the fourth quarter. So that was very good to see. And I think we will ramp up that effort significantly in the first half of this year and deliver significant productivity improvement there as well. So largely a lot of the same work, just a lot more to do and a few new things.\nBrian Harbour: Okay. And when you kind of talk about low to mid-single-digit increases in headcount, as I think it sounds like the typical rate, how does that usually flow through to case growth? Or do you have like a certain target that like this should drive ex flow-through to case growth?\nDavid Flitman: Yes. I think largely it depends on the mix of talent that you're bringing in. We have had great success in finding strong sales talent with industry experience and not all that's coming directly from competition. Others in foodservice that understand the market and the industry and have a sales background fit really well in our model. We spend a lot of time training people, as you know. And I think long term, Brian, the right way to think about that is we should be able to grow our cases 30% to 50% faster than our head count additions. But again, there's a ramp-up period for that. So as we get into the cycle of kind of a stable single to mid -- low to mid-single-digit growth, that's what you should expect over the long run.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets.\nKelly Bania: Just wanted to ask, as we think about that 2% to 4% organic case growth target for '24, can you talk about the channels in more detail? It sounds like you're definitely still planning for those independents to outpace the total. But maybe within health care and hospitality, are there -- is there any outsized growth left there for those channels? Or maybe just help us think about what you're seeing in terms of the new business pipelines for health care hospitality?\nDavid Flitman: Yes. For sure, we will continue to maintain our focus in the independent space. It's the most profitable segment of the business. It plays to our strengths in terms of our product and sales portfolio. So that's clearly a very strong focus for us. And what we saw last year, to your question, in hospitality and health care, largely a strong recovery from an industry perspective which provided some tailwinds. And importantly, as we talked about last year, we believe we're differentiated in health care with our VITALS platform and some of the other things we have on the technology front. We've got a very strong pipeline in both health care and hospitality that we expect will deliver outsized growth again this year. Maybe not at the rate that we saw last year, just given the recovery is largely intact but we expect to continue to drive growth at or above market in both of those segments.\nKelly Bania: Great, that is helpful. Can I just also ask about the sales compensation. It sounds like you're making some tweaks there. Can you just remind us the timing of that change? And -- and what you're seeing across the -- across the space from kind of the other private players? Is this kind of a broad change happiness across the industry as we've kind of normalized in growth? Or is this just maybe unique to US Foods and a couple of others?\nDavid Flitman: Yes. I really can't comment on what others are doing relative to their sales comp. I think my color this morning largely gave in our prepared remarks where we really haven't made any significant changes to our plan since some tweaks that were made in the pandemic which was largely aimed at maintaining our sales head count and providing what we needed to, to keep folks in the company as volumes decline. And as we get back on this aggressive profitable growth plan, those tweaks that we talked about there are really [indiscernible] giving our sellers the incentive they need to accelerate growth. The couple of things around shifting to more variable compensation, uncapping that portion of their pay, I want our sellers to make as much money as they possibly can if that means great things for our growth and for the company's future. So again, I kind of foreshadowed this last quarter saying these were tweaks, not significant overhauls of our comp plan and it's been well received. Answer your question, that all went into effect here in the first quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.\nJohn Heinbockel: Dave, I wanted to start with the investment in account facing folks, when you think about business managers, territorial guys specialists. Where do you want to -- how do you want that investment to shake out? And then curious the impact that would have on new account additions versus wallet share, right? Is there -- what's your strategic thrust there?\nDavid Flitman: Yes, good question, John. We're focused on adding territory managers to continue to drive growth. But to your point, we have to have the right support around them. So the right number of specialists new business managers go out and target new opportunities, sometimes on their own, largely in parallel in partnership with our TMs. And then as we continue to grow our size and scale the sales force, we've got to make sure we've got the right management team in place as well. And the right number of districts and we add district managers when that makes sense, too, to make sure that we don't overload our leadership. So all that is embedded in that 6% growth number, some of those pieces are growing at a slower rate, obviously, than the TMs. But when I think about that low to mid-single digits, that's really comprehensive of all those rules.\nJohn Heinbockel: Okay. And then maybe as a follow-up, right? So when you think about -- and obviously, you'll lay this out in June but when you think about the biggest low-hanging fruit, where do you think that is functionally right? I don't know if that's productivity. You talked about stem miles. There is productivity in the warehouse. And as you roll out the day cart, how much do you think you can further improve cases per mile?\nDavid Flitman: Yes. So the first part of your question, I think we largely believe that the existing long [indiscernible] plan that we're finishing up this year, feel really good about our progress. As we commented previously, I think we had outsized improvement in the first couple of pillars of that, the profit and the growth pillars and largely supply chain activity has lagged since the pandemic. I was pleased with the progress that we made in the back half of the year. However, I think largely that portion of our improvement has still lagged the other 2 areas. And so I see the greatest opportunity for productivity gains largely coming out of the supply chain. That's why I get so excited about our flex scheduling the card platform despite all the improvements that we've made in routing efficiencies last year with some record cases per mile. There's a lot more to do and we'll get a lot of benefit once we get the card spread across the country here. So a lot more work to do in all those areas, John but I would say productivity is the one area we're ramping up most aggressively.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Slagle with Jefferies.\nAlexander Slagle: Yes, I was going to ask sort of along the same lines, I mean, the longer-term opportunities around flex scheduling. I mean now, I guess, more than half of [indiscernible]. It just seems like you've gotten productivity levels mostly back to pre-COVID levels and sort of normalizing levels of turnover and over time but improvements lately in turnover and safety over time all suggests there could be a good bit more room to go beyond just getting back to [indiscernible] levels of all that? And just -- is that accurate and just a little bit more on the sense of kind of where it could go generally before you kind of consider other things like automation and whatnot?\nDavid Flitman: Yes. I think generally, Alex, you're thinking about it right. I think there's a lot more runway there and as excited as I am about flex scheduling and my comments in the prepared remarks there, said we've seen outsized improvement in our pilot markets. So even where we've expanded it -- expanded it across the half of our markets, we haven't yet gotten the productivity uplift that we've seen in the pilot and it just takes time, right? It takes the local team time to -- to work in the new operating model as well as our associates and we expect continued productivity gains there over time. So we'll have a lot more to say about long-term productivity targets in June. But just suffice it to say, we're excited about the work. We think we're working on the right areas of improvement to drive the focus for the company going forward. And I'm bullish of our ability to continue to lean in and drive productivity.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh with BTIG.\nPeter Saleh: Congrats on a strong finish to the year. I did want to come back and talk about the compensation for the sales force. You mentioned several changes, variable compensation, more variable focused on private label targets and removing the cap on compensation. Dave, I think you also mentioned this was well received. I'm just curious, have you seen any attrition as this has gone into place? Or are you expecting any attrition from the sales force in 2024 as these changes go into place?\nDavid Flitman: So the gate answer is no. We haven't seen any nor do I expect any. I think our team did a very good job preparing for this rollout. We had a thoughtful approach to that. Any time you make change even if it's positive, you've got a change management process. You've got to leave through and that starts with robust communications. So we did a very nice job of that starting actually very early in the fall last year. So we had plenty of time to not only give our sales team a heads up but kind of model their compensation in the old model and the new model. so they could see what that looks like and importantly, understand what actions, if any, they had to take differently to maintain or actually increase their compensation. And so as we got further and closer to that date, what we saw was our sellers got excited about it because they see the opportunity to make more money lined up with what we've done here. So, I don't expect any attrition from this with something that we look at very closely all the time, every week, as you would expect. And we haven't yet seen anything nor do I expect to.\nPeter Saleh: Great. And then just on MOXe, I believe you have mentioned 50% of national chains now on MOXe. And I think last quarter, we were somewhere in the 30% range or pretty sizable step-up. Can you just talk about how -- how or what you're seeing in terms of behavior change as more and more of these chains are on this platform? Are you seeing increased case count? Just trying to understand the behavior change post this implementation.\nDavid Flitman: I think it's actually a little early on the national side to see anything significant change yet. We're still in the ramp-up phase. We're pleased that customers are liking it and the bracing it similar to have -- the way they have in independent restaurants. And remember, what we said that's going on in independents is that those customers are buying more and they're stickier. They stick with us longer. We would expect to see those same sort of benefits through the course of time in the national area, just like we have in independents.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jake Bartlett with Truist Securities.\nJake Bartlett: My first was on product cost inflation. You gave the guidance of 0.5 to 1.5 [ph] were flat in the fourth quarter. Looking back, I think you were actually -- it was positive in October if my notes are right. So it looks like it decelerated. And so my question is just about the cadence. What do you expect? Do you expect to start the first quarter out with deflation going to inflation? Just help out on the cadence there? Then I have a follow-up.\nDirk Locascio: Jake, this is Dirk. So I would expect us to see inflation. We saw inflation in the fourth quarter. Actually, in January, we saw some modest inflation again, likely increasing as the year goes on. just I think the overall message embedded within that range is we're not assuming sort of strong levels of inflation throughout the year. That's not that different than the last couple of years. We've tried to be a little more conservative and drive more of our results through our overall things that we control within our business. But inflation through probably most of the period.\nJake Bartlett: Got it. So the comment of flat with, I guess, for the year as a whole. So another question on just your confidence on continuing to drive gross profit per case in '24. You mentioned there's still 40% of your vendors you're talking with you have some modest inflation. But if you could just talk about what kind of gross profit per case increase you expect what's embedded in? And maybe how much of that 40% that you think you're going to be able to hit in '24 and drive that forward?\nDirk Locascio: Sure. Maybe just back to your deflation question. So the reason we talked about essentially flat. I think it was 15 basis points or so of inflation in the quarter. So very, very important level but it was importantly, a positive. So we're not going to talk about specifically within the per case increases. I think the important thing though is if you look at really the last 3 years, we've continued to drive gross profit and a lot of that's going to come from a lot of the same initiatives that we talked about maturing as well as some additional things coming on board. But in the cost of goods, we do expect to get through the rest of the tail this year and there are some other activities that we will be doing. In the cost of goods, the thing that we continue to have an advantage versus a lot of others is with our rate of growth and especially our rate of growth with our target customer types. So, we -- as we partner with vendors, we're bringing them growth in these customer types that they can have more influence in, so we think that it's a great win-win opportunity. And then as we get some of those savings, we can, again, make sure we're priced fairly with our customers. We're going to continue on things like managed cases within logistics. And then at the same time, on OpEx, really striving through our efficiency, whether it's supply chain Dave talked about, the indirect and other to mitigate most of the cost inflation that we see. So therefore, expecting the GP per case growth to continue to flow through. That message from us of EBITDA growth coming from a combo of profitable growth and margin expansion. You're going to continue to hear us beat that drum. We think that's important and that's a healthy way to continue to grow over time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo.\nEdward Kelly: Dave, I wanted to ask you first about M&A. Your [indiscernible] strategy is ramping nicely. You'll get 2 points of case growth from M&A in '24. Can you talk about the quality of the business you're taking on from a margin standpoint? And then how does the pipeline look like moving forward? And is the contribution that you'll see in '24? Is that sort of a good placeholder for the run rate as we think about this over time?\nDavid Flitman: Yes. We're excited about what we've done in M&A, Ed and certainly the latest one we talked about here this morning with IWC. And as we said, the majority of their business is in the independent space which is -- fits right in our wheelhouse, exactly the type of strategy we want to deploy. And IWC in particular, I didn't say this on the call but we're serving that market today but we're coming through 2 other distribution centers that are probably 3 hours away from the market. So we're not getting there very efficiently. So in all 3 of the acquisitions, they've solved that problem for us and have the right mix of business to help us to continue to drive growth on that platform. So we're pleased with it. These are accretive and make great sense. We're not overpaying for these acquisitions. And to the last part of your question, M&A is hard to predict. We don't know when deals are coming to the market. We've been opportunistic on all 3 of these. We will continue to be but I'd be hard-pressed to predict how the rest of the year may or may not play out. But what you're seeing us do is drive these tuck-ins in a way that just makes absolute sense for our business over the long haul and that's what we'll continue to look for. We think there's still opportunities out there.\nEdward Kelly: Great. And just a follow-up, I guess, for Dirk. Gross profit per case this quarter, Dirk was up a lot less than what it's been year-over-year. And I think there are some year-end sort of like some of the year-end timing stuff. Maybe could you talk about that? And then as we think about '24, how do you think about the relationship of GP per case versus OpEx per case in terms of how you grow EBITDA per case. OpEx per case this quarter was actually down a little bit. I'm just kind of curious as to how you think about that relationship in '24 as well.\nDirk Locascio: Sure. Well, as you pointed out for the fourth quarter, not a real surprise. We've talked about this for the last few quarters that you're going to have different cadence things that play out in gross profit, you're right, it still stayed at a very strong level that we've been at the last couple of quarters. So we're pleased and I think that demonstrates also again that the benefits are coming and the durability from the things that we're doing as opposed to whether it's inflation or deflation. And you're right. So we talked about that a year ago, there were a few benefits in the fourth quarter and then over the course of this year, we've recognized them over the years. So there's nothing really new or beyond that, as we go into 2024 and less about the specific number but we are very focused on continuing to grow gross profit faster than we do OpEx. And we believe we have a lot of opportunity and let's come back to my comment on the durability, right? We think that the gross profit that we continue to grow year after year after year through the actions that we're driving from our initiatives that we think they're still a runway there over the course of 2024. So I'm not going to give you a specific magnitude but clearly, we do expect that to grow faster than OpEx.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Two questions. The first one, just on the invested EBITDA, Dave, I think you mentioned or maybe you gave a little teaser ahead of the June Investor Day. But you put you'd grow adjusted EBITDA in the high single digit to low double-digit range the next several years. the low double digit was of our expectation. I know consensus is in kind of that 7% to 8% range. But just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the biggest driver of that potential growth acceleration. Whether or not it's more from upside to sales or whether you have increasing confidence or greater confidence in the margin opportunity that would allow you to get into that north of single-digit range? And then, I have one follow-up.\nDavid Flitman: Well, first of all, I'll say we'll say a lot more about all that up in June. But having said that, I think what you've seen us deliver, particularly in 2023 was a great balance in our P&L. We've got very good top line growth. We're leveraging that quite well based on some of the comments you heard from Dirk and our control of operating expenses. We're leveraging that quite well through the P&L. And so that model is working quite well for us. I'm excited about our top line growth, we're investing in the right areas, both to drive top line growth and continue to drive productivity and efficiency in the business. And I think that will continue for a long time to come. So think balance, I think just equal opportunity in the top line as well as the leverage areas of GP and expense control.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Understood. And then, just a follow-up. I wanted because you talked about well, the very strong EBITDA margin expansion of, I think it was 50-plus basis points in 2023. I just think about that expansion in 2024 and longer term, I know you talked about supply chain being perhaps the lagging factor. But should we assume steady increases kind of in the theme of what you just said balanced? Or is it more lumpy? I'm just wondering if could prioritize the greatest opportunities to drive that EBITDA margin expansion.\nDirk Locascio: I think steadier would be a better way to mention about it versus one. Obviously, every quarter is the same winning [ph] is the right way to think about it. And we've demonstrated that ability to drive the leverage with a couple of pandemic and post years aside for a long time. And so it may not be at the 50 basis points but we think there's still plenty of room for year-after-year opportunity for margin expansion.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Carden with UBS.\nMark Carden: So to start, you guys talked a bit about your expansion of Pronto and that you're now in 35 markets today. when you guys add Pronto to a new market, is the vast majority of the independent case growth lift capture in year 1? Do you see much of a waterfall benefit there? And then just more broadly speaking, what inning do you think you're in for the initiative before its maturity?\nDavid Flitman: Great question. We're excited about Pronto, where we penetrated the market with that. We see a great uplift in independent growth, particularly with new customers there. and that comes fairly early. It gives us additional tool in our tool kit to service customers, particularly in those dense geographies where it's hard to get to or they may need more frequent deliveries than we do with our larger deliveries. I would say we're not mature in that yet but we've got 5 more markets we're going to penetrate this year. I will say that not all markets are right for Pronto, particularly those larger dense geography markets make the most sense. We still have plenty of opportunity there. And I'd be remiss to not reiterate that we see plenty of growth where we've already penetrated the market with Pronto and continue to add new trucks and capabilities there where we've had success. So I see probably an equal balance for new market penetration as well as existing market growth.\nMark Carden: Got it, that's helpful. And then as a follow-up, how are you guys thinking about the labor environment in the year ahead? You gave some really helpful color about the recent strike. Your largest competitor had a few of these as well in recent years. Has there been any underlying changes here? Or do you see it just being more or less of a nice issue?\nDavid Flitman: Yes. We see this as an isolated issue. We pride ourselves on having very strong relations with our associates, whether they're represented or not. We've got a long history of reaching positive win-win outcomes with our labor unions across the country. We had a disruption. And as I said, we're well prepared for it. We got through it in a few weeks and settled largely on the offer that we put forward at the end of last year. So those things come and go over time. You don't expect them to happen but you need to be planned and ready for it and we were. We've got a number, just like we do every year, we've got a number of new agreements that are up for negotiations this year and we expect those to go well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.\nJohn Ivankoe: Maybe your fourth quarter results and your overall '23 results speak to this but just want to get a sense of the underlying health of the independent restaurant segment. There has been I mean, I think some debate or discussion in terms of whether this is actually still a growing industry and the fundamentals are still positive for independent restaurants to put new capital in the ground and for them to get new capital in the ground as we kind of think about '24 -- in the '25 but let's just focus on '24. So as you talk to your territory managers, what are they telling you about this important addressable customer set? Are they seeing even more sales opportunities out there relative to what you're currently serving?\nDavid Flitman: Yes. They are excited about it. I'm excited about it. I think the healthy operator is really strong. I think there's been a nice recovery since the pandemic in terms of actual units that have come back online or new restaurants. But importantly, the thing that I always tell our team, even given the health of the industry, it's going to ebb and flow, we think it's very robust right now. But we have ample share gain opportunities regardless of what's going on with the macro. And let's stay focused on the things we can control, our model works, our team-based selling model works. We have great products and services for our customers. And let's not look left or right, let's just stay focused on running our plays that are working. And I think we've got a long runway of growth ahead of us.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Wolf with CL King.\nAndrew Wolf: Dave, you've consistently kind of emphasized worker safety, almost like a mantra. I was kind of wondering given your experience, not just in this industry but others, have you -- is there a correlation between improved safety and other key metrics across the enterprise more broadly, productivity, on time, et cetera? I mean I'm just trying to get to the bottom of why you lead with workers.\nDavid Flitman: Well, the reason I lead with it is it's the right thing to do for our associates and for our company. And I say this all the time to our team Andy, if we can't keep our people safe working for us every day, then nothing else we're going to accomplish matters. I'm that passionate about it. And when I got here, we didn't have actually the focus I felt we needed on safety and that's why I'm so excited about our 23% improvement last year. We will continue to focus on it because it's the right thing. Now having said that, to your question, Yes. I think safety performance is a good indicator of overall operating discipline that you have in areas like quality, productivity, how you think about the customer. I worked with DuPont for 20 years, you might remember. And I used to be able to walk into an operation and just observe and look around. And if I saw a good housekeeping and safety behavior you can kind of get a good sense for how that operation was run top to bottom. So it's the right thing for our people. It's the right thing for our company and for our business and we'll stay focused on it.\nAndrew Wolf: Okay, that's good color. Appreciate it. And just a last follow-up on the sales compensation changes. You've had a bunch of questions but do you think having an untapped compensation can help you recruit better or territory managers? Is there a recruitment advantage to that? Or more of a...\nDavid Flitman: I think it will be. That's not really the driver of it. But I think folks coming in from the outside that are hungry great salespeople and we tell them that that's the way the comp is structured. I think that will be a real benefit. We just want to [indiscernible] our folks in the right way to drive as much profitable growth as they can for themselves and for the company and we thought that made sense.\nOperator: I will now turn the call back over to Dave Flitman for closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nDavid Flitman: Thank you and thank you all for joining us today. We have very strong momentum in our business. We're excited about the future. We look forward to seeing all of you on June 5, we'll talk before then. Have a great rest of the week.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining and you may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Dirk Locascio",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave and good morning, everyone. I'll cover 3 topics with you this morning. First, I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. Second, I'll provide an update on capital deployment. And finally, I'll discuss our first quarter and full year 2024 guidance. Turning to Slide 7. I'll walk you through our fourth quarter results in greater detail. The fourth quarter was a strong finish to 2023 as our full year adjusted EBITDA margins increased double digits and we continue to grow our margins. Net sales increased 4.9% to $8.9 billion, driven by total case volume growth of 5.6%. Food cost inflation was essentially flat, while mix was a headwind of 70 basis points. We drove strong volume growth in each of our target customer types again this quarter. Volume increased 7.3% for independent restaurants, including approximately 100 basis points of growth from acquisitions. Healthcare growth was 8.1% and hospitality was 5%. Health care and hospitality continued to deliver strong profitable growth, driven in large part by healthy net new business. We remain focused on expanding within our target customer types and expect to continue that momentum in 2024. Chef store volume in November and December had low single-digit case growth which was in line with our expectations. We continue to expect accelerated growth in 2024. This quarter, we moved Chef store cases to all other and thus, they are no longer included in independence. We made this change to be consistent with how third-party providers such as Carcano, formerly known as MPD, report market share data and it better aligns with how peers communicate their broadline growth. All periods have been up for consistency. During the fourth quarter, adjusted gross profit increased 6% to $1.5 billion, while adjusted operating expenses increased 4% to $1.2 billion. Our adjusted gross profit continues to grow faster than adjusted OpEx. Adjusted EBITDA was $388 million or 11% growth from the prior year. We expanded adjusted EBITDA margins by nearly 25 basis points to 4.3%. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 16.4% to $0.64 per share, demonstrating our continued growth of EPS faster than adjusted EBITDA. Turning to Slide 8; we made significant progress on a per case basis in 2023 which we believe emphasizes the strong execution of our strategy. Our adjusted gross profit per case increased 4.5% in 2023, while our adjusted operating expense per case was up 1%. Importantly, our adjusted EBITDA per case was $1.93 for the full year. up 14% year-over-year and represents 4.3% compound annual growth rate since 2019. We have demonstrated strong leverage through the P&L with operating expense per case growing at a slower rate than gross profit per case and we expect to maintain that operational discipline in 2024 and beyond. Moving to Slide 9; our strong operating cash flow creates flexibility to deploy capital strategically to enable growth. Our 2023 operating cash flow was $1.1 billion with free cash flow of over $800 million. We invested $309 million in cash CapEx. We continue to focus on -- to expand our fleet and invest in capacity and technology to enable organic growth. Our ongoing cash CapEx target is approximately 1% of net sales and we will remain disciplined in our approach. Following the successful closing of [indiscernible] in Q3, we closed the Saladino's acquisition in December for a purchase price of $56 million. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders as we repurchased 1.6 million shares in the fourth quarter for $65 million. We have $192 million remaining on our $500 million share repurchase program. Before moving on to guidance, I want to highlight the significant progress we made in reducing our leverage in 2023. We ended the year at 2.8x levered which is a 0.7 turn reduction versus 2022. We were steadfast in our approach to lowering our leverage last year which we accomplished through disciplined debt paydowns and EBITDA growth. We expect to remain in our net target leverage range between 2.5x and 3x for 2024. Our balance sheet is in solid shape which informs our capital allocation framework. We will continue to invest in the business, repurchase shares given the current valuation of our stock price and evaluate tuck-in M&A opportunities. Now, I'll discuss our guidance on Slide 11. Importantly, there are several assumptions on this slide. For full year 2024, we expect total company net sales to be $37.5 billion to $38.5 billion. an increase of approximately 5% to 8%. We believe we can grow our total cases by 4% to 6% and we expect slight inflation of 0.5% to 1.5%. Our tuck-in M&A from last year, combined with the IWC announcement will add approximately 2 percentage points to our case growth. We expect our independent restaurant case growth to continue running higher than our overall case growth. As a result of good faith barging efforts, our agreement with the union Investa bill that represents our drivers was gratified at February 3. US Foods has a long-standing record of our being in good faith and reaching agreements with the union. From the start, we took a principal approach and provided a fair offer to the union before and after the expiration of the contract on December 29th. We are pleased that the agreed upon proposal largely reflects the economics outlined in that offer. The 5-year agreement provides wage and benefit increases that builds on the highly competitive offerings are drivers [indiscernible] currently receive. It also includes safety enhancements aligned with the very high priority we place on associate safety. There was an increased cost to us for business continuity and labor relations to serve our customers. as well as weather-related issues across the country which have been noted by several others in our industry. As a result, we expect an approximate $20 million negative impact to adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter, primarily driven by incremental costs during the labor disruptions. We believe the first quarter adjusted EBITDA will be in a range of $340 million to $355 million. Even with the labor disruption and the weather-related issues that we experienced in January, we remain confident in achieving our full year guidance. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be $1.69 billion to $1.74 billion and adjusted diluted EPS to be $3.20. This translates into double-digit growth on the bottom line from the combination of profitable growth and margin expansion as we expect gross profit per case to grow faster than OpEx. In closing, 2023 was a strong year. I feel very good about the opportunity in front of us. the momentum we are generating and our growth potential this year, as outlined in our 2024 guidance. I'll now pass it back to Dave for his closing remarks. This is Dirk. So yes, we were excited to strong cash flow. We do expect that to meaningfully grow as you point out, as we grow earnings. And as our debt is already well within our target range, what we expect in 2024 as to have a reduction in leverage but more from earnings growth as opposed to much more on debt pay down. So that means that in addition to investing in the business, it will be around share repurchases and opportunistic M&A. So we're very excited about the IWC announcement this morning and we would expect over the course of the year to increase the amount that we allocate for share repurchases. Jake, this is Dirk. So I would expect us to see inflation. We saw inflation in the fourth quarter. Actually, in January, we saw some modest inflation again, likely increasing as the year goes on. just I think the overall message embedded within that range is we're not assuming sort of strong levels of inflation throughout the year. That's not that different than the last couple of years. We've tried to be a little more conservative and drive more of our results through our overall things that we control within our business. But inflation through probably most of the period. Sure. Maybe just back to your deflation question. So the reason we talked about essentially flat. I think it was 15 basis points or so of inflation in the quarter. So very, very important level but it was importantly, a positive. So we're not going to talk about specifically within the per case increases. I think the important thing though is if you look at really the last 3 years, we've continued to drive gross profit and a lot of that's going to come from a lot of the same initiatives that we talked about maturing as well as some additional things coming on board. But in the cost of goods, we do expect to get through the rest of the tail this year and there are some other activities that we will be doing. In the cost of goods, the thing that we continue to have an advantage versus a lot of others is with our rate of growth and especially our rate of growth with our target customer types. So, we -- as we partner with vendors, we're bringing them growth in these customer types that they can have more influence in, so we think that it's a great win-win opportunity. And then as we get some of those savings, we can, again, make sure we're priced fairly with our customers. We're going to continue on things like managed cases within logistics. And then at the same time, on OpEx, really striving through our efficiency, whether it's supply chain Dave talked about, the indirect and other to mitigate most of the cost inflation that we see. So therefore, expecting the GP per case growth to continue to flow through. That message from us of EBITDA growth coming from a combo of profitable growth and margin expansion. You're going to continue to hear us beat that drum. We think that's important and that's a healthy way to continue to grow over time. Sure. Well, as you pointed out for the fourth quarter, not a real surprise. We've talked about this for the last few quarters that you're going to have different cadence things that play out in gross profit, you're right, it still stayed at a very strong level that we've been at the last couple of quarters. So we're pleased and I think that demonstrates also again that the benefits are coming and the durability from the things that we're doing as opposed to whether it's inflation or deflation. And you're right. So we talked about that a year ago, there were a few benefits in the fourth quarter and then over the course of this year, we've recognized them over the years. So there's nothing really new or beyond that, as we go into 2024 and less about the specific number but we are very focused on continuing to grow gross profit faster than we do OpEx. And we believe we have a lot of opportunity and let's come back to my comment on the durability, right? We think that the gross profit that we continue to grow year after year after year through the actions that we're driving from our initiatives that we think they're still a runway there over the course of 2024.

            "name": "David Flitman",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to today's agenda. I'll start by sharing highlights from my first year at US Foods and progress against our key strategy pillars and long-range plan. Before I hand it over to Dirk to review our fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results as well as fiscal 2024 guidance. 2023 was an exciting year at US Foods to execution of our strategy and long-range plan which underpins our company's transformation, we accomplished many of our goals, including capturing profitable market share and enhancing margins. Following this past year's success, I am even more confident in our ability to continue to gain profitable market share with independent restaurants, health care and hospitality customers, improved productivity, drive margin expansion and deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth. We achieved record full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA of $1.56 billion, driven by strong case growth, including independent case growth of nearly 7% and market share gains with target customer types. This was combined with 53 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion which came as a result of the implementation of key operational initiatives we outlined at the beginning of the year. Our proprietary digital platforms, MOXe and VITALS were key drivers of our top line performance in 2023 and are enablers of further growth in 2024 and beyond. We also deployed our strong operating cash flow to reduce net leverage to 2.8x which is within our target range, repurchased approximately $300 million in shares and completed 2 accretive tuck-in acquisitions, all while investing in the business for continued organic growth. We continue to lead the industry in the digital customer experience by constantly innovating and adding new capabilities to meet our customers' needs. Our differentiated business model, digital expertise and sustainable competitive advantages will enable us to drive continued market outperformance. The structural improvements we made in 2023 position us to win in any macro environment. My confidence comes from the strong momentum we've built, delivering against our long-range plan and from our 30,000 dedicated associates who bring their expertise and tireless dedication to work every day. Turning to Slide 4; our strategy guides how we operate and what we are focused on to win and comprises 4 pillars: culture, service, growth and profit. I believe these are the right areas of focus to ensure continued service improvements and sustainable top and bottom line growth. We're excited about the progress we've made to accelerate each of these coming into this year. Moving to Slide 5; let's take a look at some of our key accomplishments in 2023 that our team delivered under our 4 pillars. Our first pillar is culture. The safety of our associates remains our number 1 priority and we made significant strides in 2023 to reduce the number of vehicle accidents and associated entries across our facilities. Our injury and accident frequency rates improved from the prior year by 23% and importantly, our fourth quarter and full year 2023 safety results were our best in recent history. Additionally, creating a supportive and inclusive workplace is key to our success and we enhanced our diverse talent pipeline by filling 47% of new or open leadership roles with women or people of color, exceeding our 40% goal. We also remain responsible stewards of our planet. And in 2023, reported reducing absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 13% during the previous year, 40% of the way toward achieving our 2032 target. We continue to make progress on infrastructure design and construction to support electric vehicles and took delivery of 40 electric trucks and 8 electric yard tractors in addition to completing the delivery of 42 compressed natural gas trucks. We also continue to innovate and offer our customers more sustainable private label products many of which come under our Serve Good product portfolio. In 2023, as part of our strategic focus on fighting hunger, we donated more than $13 million in food and supplies to hunger and disaster relief partners which is the equivalent of roughly 5 million meals for more than 225 drug loads of food. As a Feeding America mission partner, US Foods provides year-round support to food banks across the country through financial and product donations. This work is supported by our associates who volunteer their time and resources to fight hunger through annual company-wide engagement campaigns. Since 2007, US Foods has donated more than 170 million pounds of product to a national hunger relief efforts. Turning to our service pillar; we continue to focus on providing a best-in-class delivery experience. We are proud to report our on-time and in-full customer service levels are now back to pre-COVID levels. We delivered the best cases per mile in our company's history again in the fourth quarter, improving over our prior third quarter record. We launched the Dicard [ph] routing pilot in 2 markets in the fourth quarter and have taken away early learnings to apply to our national launch this year. Our routing initiative provided us with more than 5% improvement in routing effectiveness in 2023, while also focusing on further improvements in on-time deliveries enabled by the Dicard [ph] platform. As I mentioned earlier, we are also transforming the experience for our customers through our MOXe digital solutions platform that enables customers to easily place orders, manage inventory and pay bills while freeing up time for our sales teams to further accelerate growth. In short, it puts our supply chain in the hands of our customers. which will generate tremendous efficiency for both our customers and U.S. fees. MOXe is now fully embedded with our independent restaurant business and approximately 50% of our national chain business with full deployment anticipated by the second half of 2024. Our digital penetration is at an all-time high of 73% for independent restaurants. Our Net Promoter Score which is the highest in the industry among top foodservice distributors continues to increase since the launch of MOXe. We want to help our customers succeed and are giving them digital tools to make it easier for them to do business with us which we believe is a key differentiating factor in our success. Now let's turn to our growth pillar. In 2023, we had net sales growth of 4.5% to $35.6 billion, driven by our 4.4% growth in total case volume led by a 6.9% increase in independent restaurant case volume, a 7.2% increase in health care volumes and an 8.9% increase in hospitality volumes. We exceeded our 1.5x restaurant market growth goal and have now gained market share with independent restaurants for 11 consecutive quarters. We anticipate this will continue over the course of 2024. Our volume gains in both health care and hospitality were driven largely by converting our pipeline of customers into new business through our service model and innovation, such as our highly differentiated VITALS platform for acute care and senior living facilities. This platform allows customers to increase patient satisfaction and reduce labor and staffing costs. This improves revenue flow and bolsters operations through more effective pricing strategies, staff training and menu planning. We also continue to differentiate ourselves through our fresh, on-trend and labor savings Scoop product innovations, such as our recently launched Chef's Line exclusive brand of Kim Chi Fried Rice and a unique team-based selling model featuring our expert chefs and restaurant operation consultants, these are significant competitive differentiators that our customers have grown to value. Our hard work and commitment to constantly innovate was recognized as one of Fortune's most innovative companies that are transforming industries from the inside out. Companies were ranked based on an assessment of 4 dimensions of innovation, product, process, culture and revenue growth. We believe our products will continue to be industry-leading as we use our in-house expertise, market research and supplier relationships to deliver value to our customers. We also expanded Pronto which is our differentiated and flexible small truck delivery model aimed at improving customer service in targeted dense geographies. Today, Pronto has the presence in 35 markets and we plan to launch it in another 5 markets in 2024. Pronto has been a great addition to our customer service model and has accelerated independent restaurant case growth in markets where we have added it. Much opportunity remains for continued growth in both existing and new markets. The real machine behind our growth pillar is our sellers. Last quarter, I highlighted that we were working on revisions to our territory manager sales compensation plan. I want to provide a bit more context on the changes that we've made. Why change now? We had our current sales compensation trends for several years and last made modifications during the early portion of the pandemia. We wanted to ensure our sales teams are aligned and accelerating profitable growth and that requires effectively incentivizing our sellers for that profitable growth. A few highlights; we made more of our sellers compensation variable with a variable component now uncapped and focused on accelerating profitable growth and private label penetration. We have signed individual volume targets and higher-margin private label targets for sellers that roll up to our company business plan. ensuring we are all working together to achieve our profit and market share growth goals. Finally, we have implemented a more disciplined approach to route splitting to ensure our territory sizes are manageable. We are confident this plan better positions us for success and ensures we are growing together across the organization. In 2023, we increased seller head count by 6%. We're having great success in finding the right sales talent to ensure that our profitable growth continues well into the future. We continue to believe adding sales head count in the low to mid-single digits is the right model for US Foods going forward. Turning to M&A; to bolster our local footprint in select markets, we executed two tuck-in acquisitions last year, renting foodservice and Saladino's food service. And this morning, we're excited to announce that we've signed an agreement to purchase IWC Food Service which serves the greater Nashville area, one of the fastest-growing markets in the country. This acquisition fills an important gap in our footprint and allows us to expand into the Central Tennessee market. IWC has approximately 220 associates and $200 million in annual sales. More than half of their business is in the growing independent restaurant space. We're excited to welcome the IWC associates to the US Foods team and are targeting to close the transaction in the second quarter. Finally, let's move to our profit pillar. Driving margin, productivity and optimization of our business are the key tenets of this pillar, addressing cost of goods sold proactively managing pricing to help neutralize commodity volatility and healthy volume growth with target customer types all contributed to enhancing our margins. As a result of our improving execution, we grew adjusted EBITDA 19% to a record $1.56 billion and delivered record EBITDA per case, while expanding adjusted EBITDA margin by over 50 basis points to 4.4% and growing adjusted EPS by 23% to $2.63. Adjusted gross profit grew 9% in 2023 to $6.1 billion. We drove further progress on initiatives such as cost of goods sold by working collaboratively with additional vendors. We addressed approximately 60% of COGS last year and continue to look for additional cost savings in 2024 as we deliver on the remaining 40% of our vendor spend that has not yet been addressed. We are also focused on growing our private label brands where our penetration was up 40 basis points to over 50% with independent restaurants. Adjusted operating expenses grew less than gross profit, resulting in operating leverage. Our flexible scheduling initiative is now live at over half of our locations and we continue to receive positive feedback. We will roll out the remaining appropriate locations in 2024. We continue to see significant improvements across our network, especially in our pilots, including year-over-year reduction in turnover that is approximately twice the rate of improvement versus our other locations. 33% improvement in safety and continued improvement in productivity. As a result of our supply chain initiatives, we delivered more than 5% improvement in both delivery and warehouse productivity. We began to see early results with our indirect spending initiative late last year and expect to accelerate those savings in 2024. We have identified a number of opportunities which will favorably and permanently impact operating expenses. This work is an important enabler to achieving our target of 3% to 5% overall annual productivity savings in 2024. Before I hand it over to Dirk, I would like to highlight one of our talented associates. Soon, we will be celebrating associates who ignite excellence in our first-ever CEO awards. Out of hundreds of associates nominated across the company, Mike Talmadge, our night warehouse manager in Albany is 1 of our 25 semi-finalist nominations. Mike's leadership has driven significant improvements in safety, associated engagement, quality and profit at the local level. His efforts have quickly become a benchmark for excellence within the company, influencing customer service and our ability to grow profitably. Mike has one of thousands of our associates who strive for greatness within US Foods and we appreciate his leadership and the dedication of each of our associates. I am pleased with our progress in 2023 as we gained momentum, executing against the 4 pillars of our strategy which is driving improved safety, service, productivity and profitability. Even considering this tremendous progress, we have a long runway of profitable growth. The team and I look forward to sharing our next long-range plan during our Investor Day in June and we hope you will join us. Let me now turn the call over to Dirk to discuss our fourth quarter results and our 2024 guidance. Thanks, Dirk. As we move into 2024, we will continue to execute our strategy and maintain our disciplined approach to capital deployment to drive long-term value creation for our shareholders. Before we head into Q&A, I would like to comment on our long-term growth prospects. As I've said before, our 2024 adjusted EBITDA target is not a ceiling for this company. and we are confident that we will continue to grow adjusted EBITDA in the high single to low double-digit range over the next several years. And we will continue to grow adjusted EPS even faster through a combination of earnings growth and share repurchases. Stay tuned. There's more to come at our Investor Day on June 5. We are in a great position today and I believe we have sustainable competitive advantages to outperform the market well into the future as we continue to do what we do best, helping our customers make it every day. Thank you for your continued trust and confidence in US Foods. I have never been more excited about our future. With that, Eric, please open up the line for questions. Yes. Thanks for the question, Lauren. As you've heard from others, there were a few other disruptions across the country in January. That's no surprise. But we were pleased actually with the recovery that we've seen since we've got past the labor disruption and those weather events, notwithstanding what happened on the West Coast last week and a little northeastern earlier this week. And really, really pleased with the team's work around the labor disruption. I've been doing this for a long time in many industries and I've seen labor disruptions before. I will tell you that we are as well prepared going into that event, as I've ever seen. We came out with a very strong plan to go get our volume back. And so I'm pleased to see the progress that we've made and largely in those non-labor disrupted markets, we've seen our volumes get back to basically the trajectory we saw in the fourth quarter which was very strong, as you heard this morning. So really feeling good about that. And just a little bit more color I can give you is the early read on the [indiscernible], formerly MPD, as Dirk said, we maintained our market share in January and I was quite pleased to hear that. So all in all, more work to do but feel really good about our trajectory and certainly our team's focus to continue to drive that growth. Well, I think largely, Brian, you will see us continue to lean in on the areas that we've been focused on and I was pleased. It's kind of the tale of 2 halves last year. We spent a lot of time in the first half of the year really honing our focus in on the needle-moving activities and really pleased with the trajectory that you saw us deliver in the back half of the year resulting in those productivity improvements that I quoted. And look, there's more work to do in all of those areas, whether it's in COGS and the work we've done with our suppliers the pricing optimization work and certainly the supply chain productivity. Really pleased with the progress we're making at routing but there's a lot more to do there. So largely the same. You heard my comments earlier about indirect spend. that's a piece of work that we started to talk about in the back half of last year and really started to see some traction really in the back half of the fourth quarter. So that was very good to see. And I think we will ramp up that effort significantly in the first half of this year and deliver significant productivity improvement there as well. So largely a lot of the same work, just a lot more to do and a few new things. Yes. I think largely it depends on the mix of talent that you're bringing in. We have had great success in finding strong sales talent with industry experience and not all that's coming directly from competition. Others in foodservice that understand the market and the industry and have a sales background fit really well in our model. We spend a lot of time training people, as you know. And I think long term, Brian, the right way to think about that is we should be able to grow our cases 30% to 50% faster than our head count additions. But again, there's a ramp-up period for that. So as we get into the cycle of kind of a stable single to mid -- low to mid-single-digit growth, that's what you should expect over the long run. Yes. For sure, we will continue to maintain our focus in the independent space. It's the most profitable segment of the business. It plays to our strengths in terms of our product and sales portfolio. So that's clearly a very strong focus for us. And what we saw last year, to your question, in hospitality and health care, largely a strong recovery from an industry perspective which provided some tailwinds. And importantly, as we talked about last year, we believe we're differentiated in health care with our VITALS platform and some of the other things we have on the technology front. We've got a very strong pipeline in both health care and hospitality that we expect will deliver outsized growth again this year. Maybe not at the rate that we saw last year, just given the recovery is largely intact but we expect to continue to drive growth at or above market in both of those segments. Yes. I really can't comment on what others are doing relative to their sales comp. I think my color this morning largely gave in our prepared remarks where we really haven't made any significant changes to our plan since some tweaks that were made in the pandemic which was largely aimed at maintaining our sales head count and providing what we needed to, to keep folks in the company as volumes decline. And as we get back on this aggressive profitable growth plan, those tweaks that we talked about there are really [indiscernible] giving our sellers the incentive they need to accelerate growth. The couple of things around shifting to more variable compensation, uncapping that portion of their pay, I want our sellers to make as much money as they possibly can if that means great things for our growth and for the company's future. So again, I kind of foreshadowed this last quarter saying these were tweaks, not significant overhauls of our comp plan and it's been well received. Answer your question, that all went into effect here in the first quarter. Yes, good question, John. We're focused on adding territory managers to continue to drive growth. But to your point, we have to have the right support around them. So the right number of specialists new business managers go out and target new opportunities, sometimes on their own, largely in parallel in partnership with our TMs. And then as we continue to grow our size and scale the sales force, we've got to make sure we've got the right management team in place as well. And the right number of districts and we add district managers when that makes sense, too, to make sure that we don't overload our leadership. So all that is embedded in that 6% growth number, some of those pieces are growing at a slower rate, obviously, than the TMs. But when I think about that low to mid-single digits, that's really comprehensive of all those rules. Yes. So the first part of your question, I think we largely believe that the existing long [indiscernible] plan that we're finishing up this year, feel really good about our progress. As we commented previously, I think we had outsized improvement in the first couple of pillars of that, the profit and the growth pillars and largely supply chain activity has lagged since the pandemic. I was pleased with the progress that we made in the back half of the year. However, I think largely that portion of our improvement has still lagged the other 2 areas. And so I see the greatest opportunity for productivity gains largely coming out of the supply chain. That's why I get so excited about our flex scheduling the card platform despite all the improvements that we've made in routing efficiencies last year with some record cases per mile. There's a lot more to do and we'll get a lot of benefit once we get the card spread across the country here. So a lot more work to do in all those areas, John but I would say productivity is the one area we're ramping up most aggressively. Yes. I think generally, Alex, you're thinking about it right. I think there's a lot more runway there and as excited as I am about flex scheduling and my comments in the prepared remarks there, said we've seen outsized improvement in our pilot markets. So even where we've expanded it -- expanded it across the half of our markets, we haven't yet gotten the productivity uplift that we've seen in the pilot and it just takes time, right? It takes the local team time to -- to work in the new operating model as well as our associates and we expect continued productivity gains there over time. So we'll have a lot more to say about long-term productivity targets in June. But just suffice it to say, we're excited about the work. We think we're working on the right areas of improvement to drive the focus for the company going forward. And I'm bullish of our ability to continue to lean in and drive productivity. So the gate answer is no. We haven't seen any nor do I expect any. I think our team did a very good job preparing for this rollout. We had a thoughtful approach to that. Any time you make change even if it's positive, you've got a change management process. You've got to leave through and that starts with robust communications. So we did a very nice job of that starting actually very early in the fall last year. So we had plenty of time to not only give our sales team a heads up but kind of model their compensation in the old model and the new model. so they could see what that looks like and importantly, understand what actions, if any, they had to take differently to maintain or actually increase their compensation. And so as we got further and closer to that date, what we saw was our sellers got excited about it because they see the opportunity to make more money lined up with what we've done here. So, I don't expect any attrition from this with something that we look at very closely all the time, every week, as you would expect. And we haven't yet seen anything nor do I expect to. I think it's actually a little early on the national side to see anything significant change yet. We're still in the ramp-up phase. We're pleased that customers are liking it and the bracing it similar to have -- the way they have in independent restaurants. And remember, what we said that's going on in independents is that those customers are buying more and they're stickier. They stick with us longer. We would expect to see those same sort of benefits through the course of time in the national area, just like we have in independents. Yes. We're excited about what we've done in M&A, Ed and certainly the latest one we talked about here this morning with IWC. And as we said, the majority of their business is in the independent space which is -- fits right in our wheelhouse, exactly the type of strategy we want to deploy. And IWC in particular, I didn't say this on the call but we're serving that market today but we're coming through 2 other distribution centers that are probably 3 hours away from the market. So we're not getting there very efficiently. So in all 3 of the acquisitions, they've solved that problem for us and have the right mix of business to help us to continue to drive growth on that platform. So we're pleased with it. These are accretive and make great sense. We're not overpaying for these acquisitions. And to the last part of your question, M&A is hard to predict. We don't know when deals are coming to the market. We've been opportunistic on all 3 of these. We will continue to be but I'd be hard-pressed to predict how the rest of the year may or may not play out. But what you're seeing us do is drive these tuck-ins in a way that just makes absolute sense for our business over the long haul and that's what we'll continue to look for. We think there's still opportunities out there. Well, first of all, I'll say we'll say a lot more about all that up in June. But having said that, I think what you've seen us deliver, particularly in 2023 was a great balance in our P&L. We've got very good top line growth. We're leveraging that quite well based on some of the comments you heard from Dirk and our control of operating expenses. We're leveraging that quite well through the P&L. And so that model is working quite well for us. I'm excited about our top line growth, we're investing in the right areas, both to drive top line growth and continue to drive productivity and efficiency in the business. And I think that will continue for a long time to come. So think balance, I think just equal opportunity in the top line as well as the leverage areas of GP and expense control. Great question. We're excited about Pronto, where we penetrated the market with that. We see a great uplift in independent growth, particularly with new customers there. and that comes fairly early. It gives us additional tool in our tool kit to service customers, particularly in those dense geographies where it's hard to get to or they may need more frequent deliveries than we do with our larger deliveries. I would say we're not mature in that yet but we've got 5 more markets we're going to penetrate this year. I will say that not all markets are right for Pronto, particularly those larger dense geography markets make the most sense. We still have plenty of opportunity there. And I'd be remiss to not reiterate that we see plenty of growth where we've already penetrated the market with Pronto and continue to add new trucks and capabilities there where we've had success. So I see probably an equal balance for new market penetration as well as existing market growth. Yes. We see this as an isolated issue. We pride ourselves on having very strong relations with our associates, whether they're represented or not. We've got a long history of reaching positive win-win outcomes with our labor unions across the country. We had a disruption. And as I said, we're well prepared for it. We got through it in a few weeks and settled largely on the offer that we put forward at the end of last year. So those things come and go over time. You don't expect them to happen but you need to be planned and ready for it and we were. We've got a number, just like we do every year, we've got a number of new agreements that are up for negotiations this year and we expect those to go well. Yes. They are excited about it. I'm excited about it. I think the healthy operator is really strong. I think there's been a nice recovery since the pandemic in terms of actual units that have come back online or new restaurants. But importantly, the thing that I always tell our team, even given the health of the industry, it's going to ebb and flow, we think it's very robust right now. But we have ample share gain opportunities regardless of what's going on with the macro. And let's stay focused on the things we can control, our model works, our team-based selling model works. We have great products and services for our customers. And let's not look left or right, let's just stay focused on running our plays that are working. And I think we've got a long runway of growth ahead of us. Well, the reason I lead with it is it's the right thing to do for our associates and for our company. And I say this all the time to our team Andy, if we can't keep our people safe working for us every day, then nothing else we're going to accomplish matters. I'm that passionate about it. And when I got here, we didn't have actually the focus I felt we needed on safety and that's why I'm so excited about our 23% improvement last year. We will continue to focus on it because it's the right thing. Now having said that, to your question, Yes. I think safety performance is a good indicator of overall operating discipline that you have in areas like quality, productivity, how you think about the customer. I worked with DuPont for 20 years, you might remember. And I used to be able to walk into an operation and just observe and look around. And if I saw a good housekeeping and safety behavior you can kind of get a good sense for how that operation was run top to bottom. So it's the right thing for our people. It's the right thing for our company and for our business and we'll stay focused on it. I think it will be. That's not really the driver of it. But I think folks coming in from the outside that are hungry great salespeople and we tell them that that's the way the comp is structured. I think that will be a real benefit. We just want to [indiscernible] our folks in the right way to drive as much profitable growth as they can for themselves and for the company and we thought that made sense. Thank you and thank you all for joining us today. We have very strong momentum in our business. We're excited about the future. We look forward to seeing all of you on June 5, we'll talk before then. Have a great rest of the week."

And I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Neese, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nMike Neese: Thank you, Lisa. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the US Foods third quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call. On today's call, we have Dave Flitman, CEO; and Dirk Locascio, our CFO. We will take your questions after our prepared remarks conclude. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Our earnings release issued earlier this morning and today's presentation slides can be found on the Investor Relations page at our website at ir.usfoods.com. During today's call, unless otherwise stated, we are comparing our third quarter results to the same period in fiscal year 2022. In addition to historical information, certain statements made during today's call are considered forward-looking statements. Please review the risk factors in our 2022 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of these potential factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in those statements. We are excited to announce that we will host an Investor Day here in the Chicago area on June 5th of next year, where we will outline our strategy and the key drivers of our new long-range plan beyond 2024, along with our cash flow generation and capital deployment plan. More details will be sent in the following months. Lastly, during today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. All reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the schedules on our earnings press release as well as in the presentation slides posted on our website, except that we are not providing reconciliation to forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I'd like to turn over the call over to Dave.\nDavid Flitman: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before jumping into our Q3 highlights, I want to officially welcome Mike Neese as our new Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mike brings 25 years of Investor Relations experience to US Foods, including time with Performance Food Group and Builders FirstSource. I'm thrilled to team up with him one more time. Additionally, Martha Ha joined US Foods in late September as Executive Vice President and General Counsel. With more than 30 years of experience, Martha is a seasoned business advisor with exceptional expertise in corporate governance, commercial and M&A transactions and leading high performing teams. I look forward to Martha's many contributions to the company. And now, let's turn to today's agenda. I'll start by sharing highlights for the quarter and our progress against our strategy and long-range plan before I hand it over to Dirk to review our financial results and updated fiscal 2023 guidance. In the third quarter, we continue to make significant progress against our long-range plan broadly across the business. We are improving the safety of our associates, growing our independent cases, while accelerating market share gains, enhancing our margins, driving increased cash flow, and meaningfully reducing our net leverage. Our strong third quarter and year-to-date performance are a result of our continued growth and market share gains on our target customer types, accelerating operational efficiencies, and the dedication of our 29,000 associates. I am proud of their relentless focus on delivering best-in-class service to our customers and executing strategic initiatives under our long-range plan. Building on our differentiated team-based selling model, industry-leading digital innovation and continuing momentum, our team delivered strong case volume growth. Each of our target customer types, independent restaurants, healthcare and hospitality, had year-over-year market share gains. Importantly, we accelerated our independent share gains and exclusive brand penetration sequentially, resulting in our 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year share gains in this important customer type. We demonstrated profitable growth and margin expansion during the quarter with meaningful improvement in operating leverage. We delivered adjusted EBITDA growth of 15% and expanded our adjusted EBITDA margin by 50 basis points. Finally, we accelerated cash flow generation, allowing us to invest more in the business, paydown debt, repurchase shares, and execute tuck-in M&A. Turning to Slide 4. Our strategy guides how we operate and what we focus on to win at US Foods under our four pillars of culture, service, growth and profit. We continue to reap benefits from the inclusion of our four regional Presidents on my Executive Leadership team. We are communicating better and aligning our teams more effectively to ensure faster execution. One important example is a recent decision I made to further streamline the organization and address feedback from the field by having our local sales teams report into the Regional Presidents versus a centralized corporate commercial function. Also, Jim Sturgell, our EVP and Chief Commercial Officer, has informed me of his decision to retire effective December 1. Jim has been a trusted leader and voice on my Executive Leadership team. During his more than 31 years with the company, Jim has made countless contributions to propel our company forward. I want to thank him for his steadfast leadership and his many contributions to our company and our people. After much thought and careful consideration, given Jim's pending retirement, I've decided to not backfill Jim's role. Instead, we have restructured our commercial team to create even greater collaboration, a more streamlined structure, and the platform for accelerated execution of our strategy. As a result, Randy Taylor, our EVP of Field Operations, has taken on additional responsibilities for sales excellence and marketing. In addition, Dave Poe has been promoted to EVP, Chief Merchant reporting to me. Dave is a seasoned foodservice veteran with more than 25 years of merchandising experience within distribution. In Dave's expanded role, he will continue to be responsible for ensuring the US Foods product value proposition exceeds our customer expectations, that we are competitive on cost of goods, and that we have the right product portfolio through his leadership of our merchandising function. In addition to the organization changes we are making, we continue to place increased emphasis on accelerating profitable growth, and we want to ensure that we reward our sellers for delivering on that growth. We are currently working on some likely revisions to our territory manager sales compensation plan, which will even more closely link their compensation to the key elements of our profitable growth plan. We will share more about any potential modifications during our fourth quarter call. We are also accelerating our investment in our local selling capacity. In fact, we increased our local seller headcount each month in the third quarter. We plan to continue those additions in the low-to-mid single digits into 2024 and beyond, which has already been contemplated in our long-range plan. We will be more focused than ever on profitable growth with the right tools and support processes to ensure our sales teams are successful. Collectively, these changes will ensure better alignment between the field and corporate teams while reducing handoffs and creating additional organization efficiencies. Most importantly, they will further propel our company with the right focus on serving and supporting our customers and driving profitable organic growth. Turning to Slide 5. I'll now briefly discuss our third quarter progress against our culture and service pillars, and then Dirk will talk about the growth and profit pillars a bit later. The safety and wellbeing of our associates is paramount at US Foods and is critical to our success. Since day one, I have stressed the importance of improving our performance to provide an even safer operating environment for all of our associates. Our strong results have been driven by our actions to execute more effectively on fewer, but more impactful initiatives, while reinforcing safety as a personal value. One example is our safety leadership training where we will provide behavior-based safety process training to approximately 1,300 operation leaders by the end of this year. This example, combined with other initiatives, has led to steady improvement in our safety performance. Our results improved in the third quarter compared to both the second quarter of this year, as well as the third quarter of last year. In fact, the third quarter was our best safety result since the first quarter of 2021 with our injury and accident frequency rates both better than the prior year by 25% to 30%. However, there is more work to be done and we won't rest until we are zero accidents and injuries. Turning to the responsible portion of our cultural pillar, through our recently published Fall Scoop, we rolled out a new climate conscious product innovation category within our Serve Good portfolio. Serve Good features products that meet our sustainability criteria, including products that are responsibly sourced or contribute to waste reduction. When asked, nearly two-thirds of our customers say that it is important to them to make sustainable choices that limit their impact on the environment. One example is our newly unveiled Monogram Carbon-Negative Cutlery that utilizes greenhouse gas derived biomaterial to create a negative carbon footprint. These climate conscious innovative products aim to support our plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We are excited to have nearly 1,000 products in our Serve Good portfolio, which spans multiple product categories. Additionally, we are focused on winning center-of-the-plate proteins and fresh produce, and over the last several years, we have upgraded our assortment in these key product categories. Importantly, our fresh produce category is our fastest-growing category year-to-date, and we estimate we have captured approximately 400 basis points of market share over the last two years within our target customer types of independent restaurants, healthcare, and hospitality. I am proud of our sustainable and healthy offerings that will ensure we continue to meet our customer's current and evolving needs. Moving to Slide 6. We continue to focus on best-in-class delivery, specifically on time and in full service levels to our customers. We continue to improve our customer service levels for product availability, and we are essentially now at pre-COVID levels. On-time service to customers is also a key focus area for us and our new routing system pilot as part of the broader routing optimization work we have had underway is a prime example of how we can further improve service. We launched a Descartes routing pilot in our first market. We continue to learn from this pilot and intend to pilot a second location before year-end with national implementation planned for 2024. Our routing improvement initiative, combined with our move to Descartes, will enable us to improve service levels to our customers, while also reducing miles driven and fuel consumption as highlighted by our third-quarter performance where we delivered the best cases per mile in our company's history. In addition, our flexible scheduling initiative is making solid progress as we have moved from the pilot phase to broader deployment across our network and it is now live in 16 locations. We continue to see significant improvements across our network and especially in our pilots, including year-over-year reduction in turnover that is approximately twice the rate of improvement versus our other locations, 30% improvement in safety and continued improvement in productivity. We remain on track for half of our locations to be live on flex scheduling by year-end. Finally, we also continue to invest in our market-leading customer-facing digital technology with MOX\u0113. Our agile development has delivered many improvements to make it even faster for customers to place orders and manage their business. Our deployment to local customers is complete and we now have 30% of our national customers on MOX\u0113, with full deployment planned in the first half of next year. In terms of the digital customer experience, we believe we continue to lead the industry. Our Net Promoter Score has been strong since our launch and has improved even further recently. From an e-commerce penetration perspective, we are at 84% for the total company and our locally managed business improved 50 basis points to 73%. MOX\u0113 is well on its way to being the premier all-in one digital toolset for our customers to order, track deliveries, pay bills, and manage inventory. And as we continue to focus on the customer experience, we further expanded Pronto in the quarter, which is our small truck delivery service focused within targeted dense geographies. Today, Pronto has a presence in 35 markets. I am pleased with our progress and the return on the investments we are making to provide best-in-class service to our customers. Turning to Slide 7. I'll walk through some third quarter highlights, and Dirk will go into a little more detail later. Total case volume growth was 4% and we drove growth in each of our target customer types again this quarter, with volume increasing nearly 6% for independent restaurants, 8% for healthcare and 6% for hospitality. Adjusted EBITDA grew double digits and margins further increased. We remain focused on increasing our gross profit per case faster than operating expense per case and accelerating profitable share growth as we did this quarter. Both healthcare and hospitality continued to deliver strong growth, driven in large part by healthy net new business. We remain focused on growing in our target customer types and expect to continue that momentum. I've already spoken about several of the good progress points with our customer experience and supply chain, so I won't be repetitive here. Moving on, we continue to strengthen our capital structure and prudently allocate capital to fuel long-term growth. We further reduced our net leverage to 2.9x and we repurchased more than 700,000 shares for $29 million. We expect to remain below 3x levered for the remainder of the year with further improvement into next year. Finally, we closed the Renzi acquisition earlier in the third quarter. And this morning, we announced the acquisition of Saladino's, our second tuck-in acquisition this year. Saladino's is an independent foodservice distributor in Central California with approximately $600 million in annual revenue that will provide additional scale for us in Central California. We expect to close the transaction by year-end. We have strong momentum as we finish out 2023, and we expect that momentum to carry us into 2024. Before I hand it over to Dirk, I would like to acknowledge the brave men and women who have served in the armed forces. On Veterans Day, this Saturday, we will celebrate our 1,500 associates who have so courageously served our country. And you can see some of their faces on Slide 8. We are grateful for their service and celebrate them and all veterans on this important day. We are committed to supporting veterans in their transition back to civilian life. They offer skills that are remarkably competitive and transferable to the work we do in food distribution, including drivers, selectors, supervisors and corporate roles. We have an employee resource group dedicated to educating our associates on the value of a veteran, recruiting veterans, supporting and recognizing our US Foods veterans and providing volunteer and community engagement opportunities. I would like to recognize Jennifer Castillo, who is President of the THOSE WHO SERVE Employee Resource Group. Jennifer is a senior manager in merchandising excellence who served in the U.S. Navy and successfully transferred her skills and mass communications to the corporate world. We thank Jennifer for her efforts in leading this valuable employee resource group and all veterans for their service to our country. And we wish all of those who have made personal sacrifices to protect our freedoms in a very happy Veterans Day. With that, I'll hand it over to Dirk to go over our financial performance and guidance in further detail.\nDirk Locascio: Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 10. The execution of our strategy is driving sustainable operating leverage improvement as we deliver strong adjusted EBITDA growth again this quarter. Net sales were $9.1 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 2.1% over the prior year, driven by total case volume growth of 4%, partially offset by year-over-year food cost deflation and product mix impact of 1.9%. Our independent customer case growth was nearly 6% for the quarter. Renzi added approximately 80 basis points of growth for our independents. CHEF'STORE volume negatively impacted our total independent cases by about 80 basis points. The system conversion is largely behind us. We are laser focused on driving volumes back into our stores. We expect CHEF'STORE volume to be flat to modest growth as we exit 2023 and accelerate that growth in 2024. We saw modest year-over-year product cost deflation of approximately 1.3%, which continues to be driven by center-of-the-plate as grocery still show year-over-year inflation in the quarter. We continue to make progress executing our long-range plan initiatives. Our gross profit per case increased 3.6% during the quarter compared to the prior year. Our adjusted gross profit dollars grew 7.7% from the prior year, driven by an increase in total case volume and cost of goods sold optimization. Adjusted gross profit as a percent of sales was up nearly 90 basis points to 17.3%. Our adjusted operating expense per case was only up 1.1% for the quarter which is our best per case year-over-year performance this year. The 5.2% increase in adjusted OpEx dollars was largely driven by increased volume. Adjusted operating expenses as a percent of net sales were up approximately 40 basis points to 12.9%. We are pleased with our gross profit per case growth exceeding OpEx per case growth as we drive profitability and seek way to be more efficient. All of this led to 15% adjusted EBITDA growth, and we expanded adjusted EBITDA margins by nearly 50 basis points. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 17% to $0.70 per share. We have demonstrated strong leverage through the P&L with operating expense per case growing at about one-thirds of the rate of gross profit per case. And we expect to maintain an operational discipline. Turning to Slide 11 for our growth pillar. Our digital capabilities and unique product portfolio are attracting new customers and driving sales. In addition, our differentiated service model and focus on operational excellence is leading to profitable growth. With our solid independent case growth, we are on track to significantly exceed our 1.5x goal for restaurant volume growth for the full-year. We drove year-over-year share gains in each of our target customer types, improved our independent private label mix by 140 basis points and continue to develop and convert strong healthcare and hospitality new business pipeline. We are seeing improved mix and margin expansion as we outgrow the industry and focus on more profitable customer types. We are focused on profitable share growth as evidenced by our third quarter gross margin improvement and our 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year share gains in independents. As we focus on our digital innovations, MOX\u0113 has saved our sellers over 50,000 hours with its new self-service capabilities in addition to the significantly improved customer experience. This frees up hours for our sellers to accelerate growth and help our customers succeed. Next to profit on Slide 12. In addition to profitable growth, we continue to make progress on our initiatives to increase EBITDA margins. We drove further progress on initiatives such as cost of goods sold improvements by working jointly with additional vendors. We remain on track to address a total of 60% of cost of goods by the end of the year. We continue to advance our efforts to drive operational efficiencies as productivity improved year-over-year from both delivery and warehouse. Now I'll turn to cash flow. Turning to Slide 13. We continue to increase our cash flow and expect to build upon this as we grow earnings and effectively manage working capital. Our strong cash flow means we will continue reinvesting for growth and further strengthen our capital structure. Our year-to-date operating cash flow was $935 million. We invested approximately $270 million in CapEx and on fleet leases, including projects to expand fleet, enhanced analytic insights and improve technology and supply chain and sales to enable further organic growth. Our ongoing CapEx target is approximately 1.3% of net sales. As a rule of thumb, over time, we spend about one-third of CapEx on fleet, one-third for maintenance and one-third for growth, which included advancing our technology capabilities. We also paid $142 million for Renzi in the quarter. We will continue to remain opportunistic in selectively pursuing tuck-in M&A like Saladino's where it makes sense and at reasonable valuations. In addition, we repurchased 727,000 shares in the third quarter for a total of $29 million. And so far in the fourth quarter, we have repurchased an additional $20 million leaving $237 million remaining on our $500 million share repurchase program. Moving to Slide 14. Leveraging our free cash flow and timely debt paydowns, we reduced our leverage from 3.7x to 2.9x over the past 12 months. We are now within our target range of 2.5x to 3x and expect to remain there. In August, we reduced the margin on our term loan due 2028 by 25 basis points. In September, we refinanced the 2025 senior notes by completing a $1 billion offering. The market was constructive for us. As we move $1 billion from secured to unsecured debt and extended our maturities. Our overall debt structure is in solid shape, we don't have any maturities until 2026. We remain focused on creating value for shareholders and allocating capital prudently against the four parts of our capital allocation strategy. Now turning to guidance on Slide 15. As a result of our solid year-to-date results and outlook for the full-year, we are raising our full-year adjusted EBITDA range to $1.54 billion to $1.56 billion, and our adjusted diluted EPS range $2.60 to $2.70 per share. We are delivering on our long-range plan, and we are growing adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins. We reduced our leverage within our target range and are deploying capital to deliver strong returns. We believe we have the right strategies in place to deliver strong profitability this year and into the next several years. I'll now pass it back to Dave for his closing remarks.\nDavid Flitman: Thanks, Dirk. The continued improvement in our results reflects our team's hard work over the past few years to build a differentiated platform that positions us to win in any environment. I am pleased with the progress we are making as we execute the four pillars of our strategy, which is driving improved safety, productivity and profitable growth despite the lack of market tailwinds. And we'll continue to be at the forefront of technology with our MOX\u0113 platform and our overall digital strategy. Our focus on continuing to improve our customer value proposition has resulted in strong case growth and consistent market share gains, specifically within independent restaurants, healthcare and hospitality. We are growing our adjusted EBITDA and enhancing our margins. Our leverage is now below 3x. Even with this tremendous progress, we have a long runway of profitable growth and shareholder returns in front of us. Assuming stable macro backdrop, we believe our long-range plan will lead to further margin expansion over time, and we remain committed to be at or near $1.7 billion of adjusted EBITDA in 2024. And I want to be very clear, this is not the ceiling for future earnings growth. We have a lot more sales and earnings growth potential in 2024 and beyond, and we look forward to highlighting our exciting future at the upcoming Investor Day on June 5. We are just getting started, and we will continue to execute our strategy, gain profitable market share within our target customer types, enhance our margins and strategically deploy capital. We are in a great position today, and we believe we have sustainable competitive advantages to outperform the market well into the future. It's an exciting time at US Foods, and we appreciate your interest. With that, Lisa, please open up the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim.\nJohn Heinbockel: Hey. Dave, let me start the sales force investment or the investment you're making in sales, right. How would you parse that out between the various pieces of team-based selling, right? You've got different positions. And then secondly, the org change having those guys report to the Regional VPs, what do you think that will do operationally?\nDavid Flitman: Great. Well, let me take the first question that you asked there, John and good morning. We're excited about the investments we're making in the sales force as we've been doing that for a while. And we continue to accelerate that investment, and we'll be at that low-to-mid single digits for a long time to come. It's mostly TMs. But I'm excited about our team-based selling model, where we have our consultants and specialists as well as our chefs teaming up in front of the customer. We'll make fractional investments in those other two groups relative to TMs just to continue to make sure they have the support they need in front of the customer. And then in terms of the org changes, really excited about where we're going. Jim, his retirement just gave me the opportunity to think about differently how I want to think about the organization and efficiencies. And as you know, any time there's handoffs between corporate and the field, it creates slower decision-making opportunities for inefficiency, and we just need to continue to move faster. So it's an opportunity for me to rethink it and moving our local sales organization back into the field where the customer interfaces just make all sorts of sense. So a small change, but I think it will prove meaningful through the course of time.\nJohn Heinbockel: All right. And then my follow-up, the three target types, how would you parse out the case growth between new accounts and drop size, right? And my guess is it's different independent versus healthcare and hospitality, the composition is different, correct?\nDavid Flitman: Yes. No, I think that's right. And on the independent side, let me start with that first. our cases per line are relatively flat, given what you've heard broadly about some of the foot traffic, but we are continuing to increase our lines per drop up in the low single digits. So we continue to penetrate those customers both when we get them initially, but also through the course of time, and that's an exciting opportunity for us to continue to drive in terms of growth. And as I mentioned, in hospitality and healthcare, we're generating a lot of net new customers and new business. And as we've talked in the past, we believe we've got a highly differentiated model there. Particularly in healthcare, we've got great technology differentiation to help our customers, not only in their back office from a cost productivity standpoint. But also with our customers and the folks that are seeking the care to help manage their nutritionals to be efficient in how they bring in inventory and to do that automatically. No one else has the capability that we have there. And then the same-store sales, I would say, contribute more that growth to healthcare and hospitality relative to independents. So we've got a differentiated model. We're winning in all those places as we continue to tell you, we're taking share in all of them. And we've got a long runway of growth ahead of us. And I think this really speaks to the power of the differentiated model that we have. We've got all these target customer types that many of our competitors don't have. And I think that will prove to be a very resilient model for us through the course of time.\nJohn Heinbockel: Thank you.\nDavid Flitman: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets.\nKelly Bania: Good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. Just wanted to touch a little bit more on gross margin, obviously, quite strong. Can you just help us break out maybe the inflation, deflation impact? And then also just talk more broadly about strategic vendor management and your cost of goods initiatives, your reduction initiatives there and what you're learning as you work through this initiative with your suppliers?\nDavid Flitman: Let me start, and I'll ask Dirk to fill in the details here. But the point I want to make, Kelly, and I appreciate the question. As we've been through periods of large inflation here and now two consecutive quarters of deflation and what you've seen us continue to do regardless of what's going on there is continue to expand our gross margins and particularly our gross margin per case. And as Dirk highlighted, we're going that at a much faster rate than our operating expense per case is growing. That's a winning model. We expect that, that will continue. Specific to your SVM question, it's a piece of work that the company has been doing for quite some time. As we said, we'd be through about 60% of our COGS by the end of this year. We're maintaining that. And we're making very good progress. So that element of the gross margin improvement, along with our penetration of exclusive brands, which we said were up 140 basis points in independents this quarter, along with our work to continue to optimize our freight lanes and improve our mix. That's the winning formula to continue to expand our gross margins. And as we say, we control our own destiny in that regard, and we're doing a nice job of it.\nDirk Locascio: Hi, Kelly. The only thing I would add is just to reinforce Dave\u2019s point that inflation, deflation, really a moot point when we think of year-over-year, as he said, it's been relatively flat to some modest deflation, but those are in categories that aren't impacting earnings. So the improvement you're seeing is really all back to our point of control and controllable things that we're doing in our four walls as opposed to the external marketplace.\nKelly Bania: Great. Thanks. And then just wanted to give you an opportunity to maybe touch a little bit more on the $1.7 billion long-range planned target. And as you get closer to 24 how those different components of that may be working towards reaching that, whether parts of it are ahead or behind or where there's maybe more opportunity. Just wanted to give you the opportunity to kind of talk through that a little bit more?\nDirk Locascio: Yes, great question. And I'll just say we'll say more about our guidance for next year on our fourth quarter call, obviously, but I'm very confident to be at or near that $1.7 billion. And just through the course of time here in my first 10 months, I've gained nothing, but increased confidence Kelly. And the momentum and what I love about the way we're delivering our results is we've got great balance across the P&L. We're working in the right target customer types. We're delivering the right amount of growth profitably. We're improving our expense ratios and importantly, driving the outcomes that our customers need. So there's not one area that's outsized, I would say, in terms of the impact there. We've got great balance. I expect that balance to continue into 2024 and beyond.\nKelly Bania: Thank you.\nDavid Flitman: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Peter Saleh with BTIG.\nPeter Saleh: Great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. I wanted to ask maybe first on the independent restaurants. The environment is changing a little bit here. We're starting to see a couple of quarters now of deflation that you guys are seeing. Restaurants have taken a lot of price, and we're seeing some more discounting among the larger chains. Are you seeing any change in behavior among your independent restaurants? Or just help us out in terms of their health and their trajectory going forward?\nDavid Flitman: Yes. I think the health is very solid. We've had some foot traffic challenges through the course of the third quarter there, particularly with the chains, which continued to see lower foot traffic sequentially, while our results improved. I think the health of the independent is very stable. And as you've heard me say in the past, I believe they're going to win out in the long run here. And importantly, we continue to have a differentiated model that enables us to continue to take market share and support their businesses, not only with our great products and service with our people, but also our technology. So we think we're differentiated there and regardless of what's going on in the macro, we're going to continue to penetrate that healthy customer base. And importantly, I think overall, there's less restaurants out there than there were pre-pandemic. But we've seen sequentially new openings of restaurants. And I would say our penetration is largely probably equally split between new openings of locations, as well as penetration and taking share from others in the marketplace. So it's a pretty well-balanced approach at this point. I would expect to see continued openings in locations through the course of the next few quarters here. So we're seeing that part of the customer base pretty healthy and stable.\nPeter Saleh: Great. Very helpful. And then just on the indirect spending. I think you guys have mentioned past couple of quarters, some cuts that you would be making there. Can you just talk to us a little bit about where the progress is on some of those indirect spending cuts? Is that more of a 2024 event? Or have you started cutting some of those expenses? Thanks.\nDirk Locascio: Good morning, Peter. We have started to see some small savings begin to accrue already. We do expect that to accelerate as we go through 2024. But that's moving along well and really as we planned. So it's good to see some things come to fruition now, but more to come next year.\nPeter Saleh: Thank you very much.\nDavid Flitman: Thanks.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Alex Slagle with Jefferies.\nAlexander Slagle: Thanks. Congrats. I wanted to follow-up, it looks like the gap between the chains and independents slightly narrowed a bit quarter-over-quarter. I mean, is there any stabilization or relative improvement in the chains that you're seeing or any more improvements to come, you think?\nDavid Flitman: Well, I think just broadly in the market, the foot traffic was slightly down sequentially Q3 to Q2. And as I've said in the past, really the performance is relative to who you have in your portfolio relative to the winners and the folks who are going as well. We outperformed what was going on with foot traffic this quarter. I think that's relatively stable. We have some things in the pipeline and I think we'll continue to show improvement through the course of time and into next year, middle of next year. We're targeting the right change that we believe are going to win. And as we've said in the past, we'll continue to look for optimization opportunities within our portfolio.\nAlexander Slagle: A question on Pronto. I guess it's grown to cover about 35 markets now. What's the broader TAM of this opportunity sort of where it can go and timeline to think about?\nDirk Locascio: Yes. We made aggressive investments in Pronto. You'll continue to see us do that as an opportunity to serve our customers better. The frequency of deliveries, particularly in these urban areas that are difficult to reach. Customers want fresh products delivered more frequently, and that's the great platform for us to do that. So we'll continue to be thoughtful about where we take it but we see a long runway of opportunity there to continue to penetrate across our portfolio with Pronto. We love that model. We're excited about it, and it's getting great traction.\nAlexander Slagle: All right. Thank you.\nDavid Flitman: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank.\nLauren Silberman: Thank you. And congrats on the quarter. I wanted to ask about capital allocation. So $250 million or so in buybacks year-to-date, stock trading at a big discount to history, had really strong fundamental momentum. So can you expand on your willingness to further lean in how you're thinking about capital deployment and allocation of buybacks versus M&A or debt paydown? And then specific to M&A, just how you think about the most accretive opportunities for the business.\nDavid Flitman: Yes. So let me start to say we will always invest in organic growth in our company first. We think that's the highest return and supporting our customers is paramount. We continue to look at expansion opportunities across our network, and we'll be thoughtful about those, but we'll continue to drive that first. And as you heard me say, we don't need to do any acquisitions in this company. I love our footprint. We'll take opportunities like we did with Renzi and the one we announced this morning to help us with efficiencies, taking miles out of the system and local market density. So let me just say a word about Saladino's since you brought up M&A and the way we think about it. We're very excited about that acquisition. We said $600 million in revenue. It gives us an opportunity in the Central Valley where Saladino's is roughly half chain and half independent, where we don't have a footprint to serve the independent customer in that Central Valley, really none of our competitors do. So we're excited about it from that standpoint. We're excited about it from the standpoint of helping us optimize the chain business that we have in that Central and Northern California footprint. So we'll take miles out and serve that part of the customer base better. But I guess I would say I'm most excited about the multiple we're paying for that, which is a fraction of what we paid for Renzi, and a fraction of our trading multiple. So as we said, we will be thoughtful and disciplined about any acquisitions, and we won't do any that don't make sense, and we won't overpay for them. And Saladino's is another great example of that. In terms of your question around share repurchases, we're obviously under trading our potential and hugely undervalued in my view. You've seen us ramp up our share repurchases. I think we'll be thoughtful about that going forward. Returning capital to shareholders is important. After we do the things we need to make sure we're growing and supporting our customers well. Obviously, more to come on that through the course of time. But we've been leaning in hard on share repurchases, and we'll continue to do that.\nLauren Silberman: Great. Thank you for that. And then just a follow-up, really impressive case growth trends. Can you talk about anything around the cadence of trends you saw throughout the quarter? And to the extent you're willing to provide any color on October? And similarly, anything you can provide on \u2013 you saw inflation throughout the quarter and trends into October? Thank you.\nDavid Flitman: Yes. Thank you. I think sequentially through the quarter, we saw things soften a bit in the market, as I said earlier. And that's why I'm so excited that our independent case growth actually accelerated sequentially from Q2 to Q3, and we continue to accelerate our market share gains. So it underscores the importance of the differentiated model and the differentiation that we have actually in the marketplace. And in terms of the start to the fourth quarter, I think it's largely in line with what we saw in Q3. I would say October started a little slower for us as we were lapping a strike from one of our large competitors in the first couple of weeks of October. We saw that volume bounce back as we would expect in the back half of the quarter, and we expect to be relatively in line with Q3 and importantly continue to take market share in those target customer types.\nDirk Locascio: Okay. On deflation. So we actually saw the year-over-year deflation improved or lessen as we went through the quarter. And in October, we actually saw a modest year-over-year inflation. And the improvements are primarily coming from center-of-the-plate. So as that begins to become modestly inflationary and then grocery is still very modest, but levels of inflation. So we think that's encouraging.\nLauren Silberman: Thank you guys very much.\nDirk Locascio: Thanks.\nDavid Flitman: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Harbour: Yes. Thanks. Good morning guys. Dirk, just on that comment, would you expect that there is now going to be kind of modest inflation across the business in 4Q and then into early 2024?\nDirk Locascio: Good morning, Brian. Well, I\u2019ll use P10 as a good indicator that at least it's back into the black or some modest inflation. I think as we see since it's been more driven by proteins, which can be more volatile, I think that's the part that's harder to predict. But I think what's encouraging is you see the stabilization of proteins, you see still modest inflation in grocery. And so I think that indicates more likelihood of some level of inflation here in the quarter I think that the most important part that I had come back to is what we talked about earlier that even with really modest deflation that our gross profit still remain quite strong. It just, I think, demonstrates the durability we've talked a lot about and why we are so bullish in our GP being able to stay strong and an expectation that in future years, we continue to expand further.\nBrian Harbour: Yes. Okay. Makes sense. And then OpEx per case, like you talked about in keeping that in check. How would you kind of rank the main drivers of that at this point? Do you think it's mostly about just kind of continued improvements in productivity. And are you seeing much yet from kind of digital expansion, flex scheduling, et cetera? Like how do we think about which of those drivers might become more important as you go into the subsequent quarters.\nDirk Locascio: Well, I'll just start with, we're quite pleased with the performance. As I said in my prepared comments, our best year-over-year per case performance that we've had, and that's really driven by distribution to supply chain costs. And so I think that is a key unlock. I think when you think across other parts, yes, we'll get some leverage. We'll continue to take some actions on productivity. But the \u2013 I think all the things also what you see when we talk about the improvement as flex scheduling is coming to life as year-over-year productivity continues to improve for delivery and warehouse. All those are translating into per case improvements. And so that gives us good confidence that we are making traction. We still have plenty of runway ahead, but ultimately are pleased with that and see a lot of opportunity remaining.\nOperator: All right. And we'll take our next question from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo.\nEdward Kelly: Hi, guys. Good morning. Nice quarter. Just a follow-up on OpEx per case. Obviously, very good results. But productivity on a worker standpoint, I don't think it's back to 2019 levels. You talked about things like the routing, the flex scheduling. How do we think about the growth in OpEx per case going forward on a sustained basis in terms of modeling? And then specifically, as you think about Q4, you look OpEx doesn't increase very much Q4 versus Q3, which would suggest that it might actually be down year-over-year. I don't know if that's too aggressive an assumption, but maybe speak to that as well.\nDirk Locascio: Hi, Ed. So ultimately, I think with distribution and the productivity, so we actually \u2013 for the third quarter, our delivery productivity was about 2019. Warehouse isn't quite there, but it's making progress. So we're pretty encouraged. And I think the \u2013 whether it's a flex scheduling, you heard Dave talk about our cases per mile from the routing work we've done over the best in the company history. And what I think we each like about the work we're doing is it's not all just about taking costs out. It's about the customer experience, customer service and things that then are taking \u2013 are making our company more productive. So it really is a good balance there. I think the \u2013 as you look ahead to the fourth quarter, whether it's sort of in line with prior year, a little bit higher, a little lower. I think the encouraging part is that we're seeing very modest levels of increase in per case. And I think that comes back to what you've heard us say from the beginning of this year is when if we have inflation, cost inflation of 3% to 5% a year, our goal is to offset as much of all of that as we can. And I think you're seeing that as we make progress coming more and more to fruition. So our goal remains that from quarter-to-quarter, that could bounce around a little bit. I'll use an example for OpEx you may end up with a little better performance in the fourth quarter and \u2013 but we're pleased with the progress we're making.\nEdward Kelly: Okay. And then, Dave, just a follow-up for you. You are making some adjustments to the sales compensation model, hiring salespeople. We're hearing this from competition as well. Obviously, the large players seem to be a bit more focused on gains with higher margin customers. My question for you is can everyone win in that environment, meaning the larger players. And how confident are you in the differentiation of what US Foods is doing that allows you to continue what we're seeing today in that type of backdrop?\nDavid Flitman: Yes. Great question. I'll take your second part first. I'm highly confident in the differentiation of our model. And it's the winning model, I believe we can drive growth effectively and productively with our sales team. But that team-based selling model, as you continue to hear me say is a real differentiator. I see it working every single day for our customers. And we're going to continue to drive it hard. And I think that's why you may hear us talk about sales head count growth at a slightly lower level than you hear from some of our competitors. I think that really is a differentiation in our model, and we'll continue to lean in around that. And the first part of your question, remind me again.\nEdward Kelly: Well, it's just \u2013 I guess it really pertains to the idea that the large three players are all sort of investing in salespeople. Is there enough opportunity beyond that everybody can win? If the market looks at this as you versus your other publicly traded players or some game, how inaccurate is that at the end of the day?\nDavid Flitman: I think this is still a very highly fragmented market, as you know. The big three have 40% nominally roughly plus or minus of share. So that's still very highly fragmented. I think you continue to see us take share collectively from some of the smaller players. When I think about our business relative to others, we still have a relatively small share of the independent market space. So the runway is long, I think, for growth. We all have different models. They all have their pluses and minuses, but I think there's room for everybody to continue to win in this market.\nDirk Locascio: Hey, guys. One other thing just that I'd highlight that I think is a differentiator in our go-to-market and our focus is with our three customer types that we're targeting. I mean what you see is it's not just about the independence. We had 8% growth almost in healthcare. We're at 6% hospitality. We've continued to do that. We continue to have an excellent new business pipeline and converts in healthcare and hospitality. So if you look at how that translates into in those most attractive or key customer types, that led to overall the strongest case growth out of any of the competitors, and we're pleased that we have with the model we have, the ability to continue to grow at accelerated and gained share in all three of those types leading to overall solid case growth.\nEdward Kelly: Great. Thank you.\nDavid Flitman: Thanks, Ed.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Two questions. The first one, David, I think we've confirmed the industry data and the restaurant commentary showed that there was a slowdown to close maybe this summer, maybe August, September. And I think you confirmed that the chains foot traffic slowed in the third quarter. The question we've been getting a lot is just why? I think a lot of people immediately jump on the idea that the headwinds on the consumer are finally taking hold. But then many of our restaurants have actually said less of consumer concerns and more does a return to normal historical seasonality in terms of month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter. In fact, some have actually said the industries recovered somewhat in October. So I'm just wondering your thoughts. One, are you surprised that maybe you're not seeing a similar uptick in October? And do you think there's any credence to the thesis of a return to seasonality. Just wondering your thoughts on whether or not we should be concerned of a broader consumer slowdown or whether the seasonality does hold some water? And then I have a follow-up.\nDavid Flitman: Yes, I think that probably is something to the seasonality piece, although we don't spend a lot of time thinking about that, Jeff, because relative to our model and the things that we're winning in around \u2013 we actually telling our team to focus on the things we can control and whether there's a broader slowdown in the market. There's still a lot of cases out there for us to go get. People are still going out to eat. It's going to ebb and flow just like it always has. It's been a difficult time to get a handle on things with the rebound since COVID and restaurants that have gone offline and then coming back. It's really \u2013 it's been a little bit helter-skelter here, as you know, for the last year or so. But regardless of all of that, I think what I'm seeing and what I said earlier is stability. I think that's the key right now is stability and our ability to lean in where we want to in those three target customer types to continue to support our customers to share.\nJeffrey Bernstein: And on that note, it seems like you've got strong momentum across your business lines. I'm just wondering you kind of blessed the \u2013 at or near $1.7 billion for next year. But what's your greatest concern as we look to 2024 I'm assuming maybe it's more macro versus your internal plans, but what are you looking at to get a gauge for your outlook for 2024? What's the biggest concern you have or among your team?\nDavid Flitman: I think from a macro standpoint, that would probably be it, but it would have to be a major significant macro thing to give me a lot of concern. I've got a lot of confidence and our ability to hit that target for next year, given the momentum that we have and what I can see coming in the future in terms of continued share gains, productivity work that we have underway in our ability to control that outcome. So yes, I guess I'd have to point to a macro, but it would have to be more than just a minor slowdown.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Got it. And then just lastly, the M&A, just a follow-up. It seems like the discussions maybe are a little bit more productive. You've completed a couple of them. I know peers are talking a little bit more about it. Do you think both sides are coming to more reasonable terms in terms of valuation? And how do you think about it in terms of your opportunity? Is it more of a geographic opportunity? Or is it just a particular line of business that you'd be interested in focusing on? Just trying to get your sense?\nDavid Flitman: Yes. Ours have been more geographic focused in both cases, both with Renzi and Saladino's now where we're serving those markets in some capacity, but not very efficiently. So there's still ample opportunity for that across our network to strengthen our position in local markets. There may be something that we do product portfolio-wise, that's opportunistic. I don't see any major gaps in it. But if the right thing comes along at the right time, we'll certainly take a look at it. But I think you can think about it in a similar fashion than what you've seen us do with the two that we've talked about so far this year. And in terms of valuations, what you heard me say is that Saladino's was extremely reasonable, and a fraction of what we paid and elsewhere. So we're going to do the things that make sense because we don't have to do M&A. We really don't. So it's going to be thoughtful. It's going to be the right one for us to solve a problem for us. And at valuations that make sense for us every time.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Thank you.\nDavid Flitman: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jake Bartlett with Truist Securities.\nJake Bartlett: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Mine was on \u2013 it pertains to you, but as well as your larger competitors. You're all increasing your sales forces pretty aggressively. And I guess I'm wondering, it seems like there's a disconnect, the overall market growth, macro pressures are there, it doesn't seem like the market's gotten much bigger than expected. So how should we interpret the kind of the wide scale increase in the sales force given the macro background that doesn't seem to be better than expected?\nDavid Flitman: Yes, I think you can interpret at least \u2013 I can only speak for us and how we're thinking about it, Jake, but I think it speaks to the underlying opportunity that we see in terms of growth. And look, as we continue to take share, we're going to grow somewhat with the market. That's going to be very low-single digits. We're going to continue to penetrate the market and take share, and that's going to drive an incremental growth in that low to single-digit \u2013 low to mid-single-digit headcount increase, we'll add another incremental growth on top of that. And so that's the way we're thinking about the algorithm. Given the relatively fractured nature of this market and this industry, there's still ample opportunity for us to take share regardless of the macro.\nDirk Locascio: I think, Jake the other thing, keep in mind, if we're growing independent at 6% on a regular basis as we have for the last number of quarters, you do want us to be adding sellers because that's also \u2013 we're getting good leverage as we're adding sellers by growing cases faster than that, but at the same time, making sure that we're reinvesting and reinvesting, especially in those areas where we're growing faster.\nJake Bartlett: Got it. Great. That's really helpful. And then in the context, and I know it doesn't \u2013 certainly doesn't seem like it's happening so far as gross profits per case remain robust and have been robust for your larger competitors as well. But with a lot of these salespeople coming on industry-wide the macro is still somewhat under pressure. Do you expect price competition to increase? It seems like that's still a risk to the gross profit per case story out there. It hasn't come to fruition. But how much of a risk do you think that is that all these sales guys, people hitting the market are going to have to start competing a little bit more on price?\nDavid Flitman: Yes. I think this has always been a competitive industry, and it always will be. And things changed during COVID. And I think I would describe the competitiveness out there now is back to pre-COVID levels. It's very fragmented. There's a lot of competitors out there. Jake, that doesn't deter us at all. We've got a differentiated model. But I think it underscores the importance of two things. One is all the initiatives that we have underway that we control to continue to drive that improvement in gross profit per case and then looking at ways to continually get more productive and take cost and waste out of our system. That's why this 3% to 5% productivity target is so important to us. That's why the MOX\u0113 penetration is important because it allows our sales team to be much more productive in front of the customer. Not chasing the back office stuff, but selling the value that we bring, selling great products and importantly, helping our customers solve the problems.\nJake Bartlett: Great. Appreciated.\nDavid Flitman: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Mark Carden with UBS.\nMark Carden: Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the questions. So CHEF'STORE was a bit of a headwind in 3Q to a slightly greater extent than it was in 2Q. Is this simply being driven by residual effects from the systems conversion issue and the need to win back some of these customers? And then how should we think about the impact here over the course of the next few quarters?\nDavid Flitman: Yes, I think you're hitting right in the center of the target there, Mark. As we've said now, the systems change is largely behind us. We've had some lingering effects in terms of lost business through the course of that, which started in the third quarter of last year. Encouragingly, we are seeing month-over-month sequential improvement and more recently, week-over-week improvement. So I'm encouraged by the ramp-up. As you heard Dirk say, we expect to be in a position to flat to growth by the end of this year, exiting the year with the goal of driving strong topline growth next year. And I think largely, we're on track to do that. So I'm very encouraged by what I see. We continue to invest in the business. We've opened one new location already in the fourth quarter in Virginia, and we've got a couple of more planned in the Carolinas here before the end of the fourth quarter. So progress continues, and I expect that, that ramp rate will continue here as we exit 2023.\nMark Carden: Okay. Great. And then on Renzi, I know it's still early, but how is the integration fare relative to your expectations? And then in context with Saladino's, do you think you may have capacity to acquire at a faster pace while also, of course, understanding that you don't necessarily need to lean on M&A?\nDavid Flitman: Yes. I think Renzi has gone even better than I could have imagined. It's gone extremely well on the integration front. We put a very strong leader in place there. We've had a great cultural fit. Importantly, we haven't lost any key talent, and it's been very transparent and a non-event for the customers in the market. So we love it. There's not enough good, I can say about how Renzi has gone. It's all very, very positive. And then the second part of your question again?\nMark Carden: Just the second part, basically, with your new acquisition, do you guys think that you might have the capacity to acquire at a faster pace, again, understanding that you don't necessarily have to acquire?\nDavid Flitman: Yes. I think, as I said, it filled a geographic void for us, particularly on the independent side there where we were serving that market. It's kind of hard to get to the Central Valley from San Francisco or L.A. very efficiently. So it solves that problem for us. And importantly, we have plenty of chain business in that part of the country and the half of that business that we're acquiring that was chain related will help us serve that segment of the customer base also more effectively. So we're excited about it from all those angles. It just makes sense at the right time. And importantly, as I've said a number of times this morning, a great multiple that we paid for.\nMark Carden: Great. Thanks so much. Good luck.\nDavid Flitman: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Andrew Wolf with CL King.\nAndrew Wolf: Thanks. Good morning. I'd like to follow-up on some of the questioning on the labor productivity. And you've experienced accelerating case growth in the quarter and sort of for the year as well. You're in a tight labor market and you had good results. So that's pretty impressive. But to what extent can you measure or just anecdotally talk about to what extent hiring more fresh people who've obviously come in relatively low in terms of productivity as you're growing. How much of that impacts the labor productivity metrics that we're able to discern.\nDavid Flitman: Well, I think attracting talent is important. And I would say the inflow of applicants for our jobs has increased to the point where I would say it's relatively the same as it was pre-COVID. It's always been the challenge to retain those folks through the course of time. And that's why we leaned in so hard around this flex scheduling pilot. And while initially as you start those pilots, you need to add a little bit of headcount, it actually hurts your productivity. What we're seeing is double-digit improvements in turnover. Obviously, that leads to reduce overtime and improve productivity in the long run. And we're seeing that everywhere we've taken that model. So I think we've got a unique approach that makes a lot of sense for us and will help us retain people, which is the key here to driving productivity over the long haul. And as Dirk said, we're pleased with our driver results, both in terms of turnover and productivity being back to pre-pandemic levels, and we'll continue to drive improvement from there.\nAndrew Wolf: Okay. And just regarding the guidance, I think because you mentioned Saladino's is going to close late in the year. Does the guidance update exclude Saladino's?\nDirk Locascio: Would be a very insignificant amount for the fourth quarter. So at this point, it really demonstrates the core strength of the overall business.\nAndrew Wolf: Okay. Great. Thank you. That's it for me.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi. Thank you. The question is actually on current price competition, if you're seeing any, the current slow restaurant case volume environment, COGS, which obviously have moderated the labor market, cost of distribution, which has moderated. I mean it would seem that if there was going to be a time for price competition, we would probably already be seeing it. So I just wanted to get your comments, anything that you're hearing on a specific market level to maybe there's been a change in recent times. Thank you.\nDavid Flitman: Yes. I would say that there's been a change since the pandemic getting back to pre-pandemic competitiveness. And as I said, it's always competitive. I wouldn't point to any market or geographic area of the country where it's more or less competitive than it was pre-pandemic. It's always competitive. It's a thing we all have to deal with every day. And that's why we work so hard to sell the value that US Foods brings to our customers.\nJohn Ivankoe: Thank you.\nDavid Flitman: Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave Flitman for any additional or closing remarks.\nDavid Flitman: Well, thank you all for joining us today. We are excited about the momentum in the business and importantly, the exciting future that we have. We look forward to talking to you again and importantly, our Investor Day on June 5th. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. And that does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation today, and please disconnect.",

            "name": "Dirk Locascio",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 10. The execution of our strategy is driving sustainable operating leverage improvement as we deliver strong adjusted EBITDA growth again this quarter. Net sales were $9.1 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 2.1% over the prior year, driven by total case volume growth of 4%, partially offset by year-over-year food cost deflation and product mix impact of 1.9%. Our independent customer case growth was nearly 6% for the quarter. Renzi added approximately 80 basis points of growth for our independents. CHEF'STORE volume negatively impacted our total independent cases by about 80 basis points. The system conversion is largely behind us. We are laser focused on driving volumes back into our stores. We expect CHEF'STORE volume to be flat to modest growth as we exit 2023 and accelerate that growth in 2024. We saw modest year-over-year product cost deflation of approximately 1.3%, which continues to be driven by center-of-the-plate as grocery still show year-over-year inflation in the quarter. We continue to make progress executing our long-range plan initiatives. Our gross profit per case increased 3.6% during the quarter compared to the prior year. Our adjusted gross profit dollars grew 7.7% from the prior year, driven by an increase in total case volume and cost of goods sold optimization. Adjusted gross profit as a percent of sales was up nearly 90 basis points to 17.3%. Our adjusted operating expense per case was only up 1.1% for the quarter which is our best per case year-over-year performance this year. The 5.2% increase in adjusted OpEx dollars was largely driven by increased volume. Adjusted operating expenses as a percent of net sales were up approximately 40 basis points to 12.9%. We are pleased with our gross profit per case growth exceeding OpEx per case growth as we drive profitability and seek way to be more efficient. All of this led to 15% adjusted EBITDA growth, and we expanded adjusted EBITDA margins by nearly 50 basis points. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 17% to $0.70 per share. We have demonstrated strong leverage through the P&L with operating expense per case growing at about one-thirds of the rate of gross profit per case. And we expect to maintain an operational discipline. Turning to Slide 11 for our growth pillar. Our digital capabilities and unique product portfolio are attracting new customers and driving sales. In addition, our differentiated service model and focus on operational excellence is leading to profitable growth. With our solid independent case growth, we are on track to significantly exceed our 1.5x goal for restaurant volume growth for the full-year. We drove year-over-year share gains in each of our target customer types, improved our independent private label mix by 140 basis points and continue to develop and convert strong healthcare and hospitality new business pipeline. We are seeing improved mix and margin expansion as we outgrow the industry and focus on more profitable customer types. We are focused on profitable share growth as evidenced by our third quarter gross margin improvement and our 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year share gains in independents. As we focus on our digital innovations, MOXe\u0304 has saved our sellers over 50,000 hours with its new self-service capabilities in addition to the significantly improved customer experience. This frees up hours for our sellers to accelerate growth and help our customers succeed. Next to profit on Slide 12. In addition to profitable growth, we continue to make progress on our initiatives to increase EBITDA margins. We drove further progress on initiatives such as cost of goods sold improvements by working jointly with additional vendors. We remain on track to address a total of 60% of cost of goods by the end of the year. We continue to advance our efforts to drive operational efficiencies as productivity improved year-over-year from both delivery and warehouse. Now I'll turn to cash flow. Turning to Slide 13. We continue to increase our cash flow and expect to build upon this as we grow earnings and effectively manage working capital. Our strong cash flow means we will continue reinvesting for growth and further strengthen our capital structure. Our year-to-date operating cash flow was $935 million. We invested approximately $270 million in CapEx and on fleet leases, including projects to expand fleet, enhanced analytic insights and improve technology and supply chain and sales to enable further organic growth. Our ongoing CapEx target is approximately 1.3% of net sales. As a rule of thumb, over time, we spend about one-third of CapEx on fleet, one-third for maintenance and one-third for growth, which included advancing our technology capabilities. We also paid $142 million for Renzi in the quarter. We will continue to remain opportunistic in selectively pursuing tuck-in M&A like Saladino's where it makes sense and at reasonable valuations. In addition, we repurchased 727,000 shares in the third quarter for a total of $29 million. And so far in the fourth quarter, we have repurchased an additional $20 million leaving $237 million remaining on our $500 million share repurchase program. Moving to Slide 14. Leveraging our free cash flow and timely debt paydowns, we reduced our leverage from 3.7x to 2.9x over the past 12 months. We are now within our target range of 2.5x to 3x and expect to remain there. In August, we reduced the margin on our term loan due 2028 by 25 basis points. In September, we refinanced the 2025 senior notes by completing a $1 billion offering. The market was constructive for us. As we move $1 billion from secured to unsecured debt and extended our maturities. Our overall debt structure is in solid shape, we don't have any maturities until 2026. We remain focused on creating value for shareholders and allocating capital prudently against the four parts of our capital allocation strategy. Now turning to guidance on Slide 15. As a result of our solid year-to-date results and outlook for the full-year, we are raising our full-year adjusted EBITDA range to $1.54 billion to $1.56 billion, and our adjusted diluted EPS range $2.60 to $2.70 per share. We are delivering on our long-range plan, and we are growing adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins. We reduced our leverage within our target range and are deploying capital to deliver strong returns. We believe we have the right strategies in place to deliver strong profitability this year and into the next several years. I'll now pass it back to Dave for his closing remarks. Hi, Kelly. The only thing I would add is just to reinforce Dave's point that inflation, deflation, really a moot point when we think of year-over-year, as he said, it's been relatively flat to some modest deflation, but those are in categories that aren't impacting earnings. So the improvement you're seeing is really all back to our point of control and controllable things that we're doing in our four walls as opposed to the external marketplace. Yes, great question. And I'll just say we'll say more about our guidance for next year on our fourth quarter call, obviously, but I'm very confident to be at or near that $1.7 billion. And just through the course of time here in my first 10 months, I've gained nothing, but increased confidence Kelly. And the momentum and what I love about the way we're delivering our results is we've got great balance across the P&L. We're working in the right target customer types. We're delivering the right amount of growth profitably. We're improving our expense ratios and importantly, driving the outcomes that our customers need. So there's not one area that's outsized, I would say, in terms of the impact there. We've got great balance. I expect that balance to continue into 2024 and beyond. Good morning, Peter. We have started to see some small savings begin to accrue already. We do expect that to accelerate as we go through 2024. But that's moving along well and really as we planned. So it's good to see some things come to fruition now, but more to come next year. Yes. We made aggressive investments in Pronto. You'll continue to see us do that as an opportunity to serve our customers better. The frequency of deliveries, particularly in these urban areas that are difficult to reach. Customers want fresh products delivered more frequently, and that's the great platform for us to do that. So we'll continue to be thoughtful about where we take it but we see a long runway of opportunity there to continue to penetrate across our portfolio with Pronto. We love that model. We're excited about it, and it's getting great traction. Okay. On deflation. So we actually saw the year-over-year deflation improved or lessen as we went through the quarter. And in October, we actually saw a modest year-over-year inflation. And the improvements are primarily coming from center-of-the-plate. So as that begins to become modestly inflationary and then grocery is still very modest, but levels of inflation. So we think that's encouraging. Thanks. Good morning, Brian. Well, I'll use P10 as a good indicator that at least it's back into the black or some modest inflation. I think as we see since it's been more driven by proteins, which can be more volatile, I think that's the part that's harder to predict. But I think what's encouraging is you see the stabilization of proteins, you see still modest inflation in grocery. And so I think that indicates more likelihood of some level of inflation here in the quarter I think that the most important part that I had come back to is what we talked about earlier that even with really modest deflation that our gross profit still remain quite strong. It just, I think, demonstrates the durability we've talked a lot about and why we are so bullish in our GP being able to stay strong and an expectation that in future years, we continue to expand further. Well, I'll just start with, we're quite pleased with the performance. As I said in my prepared comments, our best year-over-year per case performance that we've had, and that's really driven by distribution to supply chain costs. And so I think that is a key unlock. I think when you think across other parts, yes, we'll get some leverage. We'll continue to take some actions on productivity. But the \u2013 I think all the things also what you see when we talk about the improvement as flex scheduling is coming to life as year-over-year productivity continues to improve for delivery and warehouse. All those are translating into per case improvements. And so that gives us good confidence that we are making traction. We still have plenty of runway ahead, but ultimately are pleased with that and see a lot of opportunity remaining. Hi, Ed. So ultimately, I think with distribution and the productivity, so we actually \u2013 for the third quarter, our delivery productivity was about 2019. Warehouse isn't quite there, but it's making progress. So we're pretty encouraged. And I think the \u2013 whether it's a flex scheduling, you heard Dave talk about our cases per mile from the routing work we've done over the best in the company history. And what I think we each like about the work we're doing is it's not all just about taking costs out. It's about the customer experience, customer service and things that then are taking \u2013 are making our company more productive. So it really is a good balance there. I think the \u2013 as you look ahead to the fourth quarter, whether it's sort of in line with prior year, a little bit higher, a little lower. I think the encouraging part is that we're seeing very modest levels of increase in per case. And I think that comes back to what you've heard us say from the beginning of this year is when if we have inflation, cost inflation of 3% to 5% a year, our goal is to offset as much of all of that as we can. And I think you're seeing that as we make progress coming more and more to fruition. So our goal remains that from quarter-to-quarter, that could bounce around a little bit. I'll use an example for OpEx you may end up with a little better performance in the fourth quarter and \u2013 but we're pleased with the progress we're making. Hey, guys. One other thing just that I'd highlight that I think is a differentiator in our go-to-market and our focus is with our three customer types that we're targeting. I mean what you see is it's not just about the independence. We had 8% growth almost in healthcare. We're at 6% hospitality. We've continued to do that. We continue to have an excellent new business pipeline and converts in healthcare and hospitality. So if you look at how that translates into in those most attractive or key customer types, that led to overall the strongest case growth out of any of the competitors, and we're pleased that we have with the model we have, the ability to continue to grow at accelerated and gained share in all three of those types leading to overall solid case growth. I think, Jake the other thing, keep in mind, if we're growing independent at 6% on a regular basis as we have for the last number of quarters, you do want us to be adding sellers because that's also \u2013 we're getting good leverage as we're adding sellers by growing cases faster than that, but at the same time, making sure that we're reinvesting and reinvesting, especially in those areas where we're growing faster. Would be a very insignificant amount for the fourth quarter. So at this point, it really demonstrates the core strength of the overall business."

Before jumping into our Q3 highlights, I want to officially welcome Mike Neese as our new Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mike brings 25 years of Investor Relations experience to US Foods, including time with Performance Food Group and Builders FirstSource. I'm thrilled to team up with him one more time. Additionally, Martha Ha joined US Foods in late September as Executive Vice President and General Counsel. With more than 30 years of experience, Martha is a seasoned business advisor with exceptional expertise in corporate governance, commercial and M&A transactions and leading high performing teams. I look forward to Martha's many contributions to the company. And now, let's turn to today's agenda. I'll start by sharing highlights for the quarter and our progress against our strategy and long-range plan before I hand it over to Dirk to review our financial results and updated fiscal 2023 guidance. In the third quarter, we continue to make significant progress against our long-range plan broadly across the business. We are improving the safety of our associates, growing our independent cases, while accelerating market share gains, enhancing our margins, driving increased cash flow, and meaningfully reducing our net leverage. Our strong third quarter and year-to-date performance are a result of our continued growth and market share gains on our target customer types, accelerating operational efficiencies, and the dedication of our 29,000 associates. I am proud of their relentless focus on delivering best-in-class service to our customers and executing strategic initiatives under our long-range plan. Building on our differentiated team-based selling model, industry-leading digital innovation and continuing momentum, our team delivered strong case volume growth. Each of our target customer types, independent restaurants, healthcare and hospitality, had year-over-year market share gains. Importantly, we accelerated our independent share gains and exclusive brand penetration sequentially, resulting in our 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year share gains in this important customer type. We demonstrated profitable growth and margin expansion during the quarter with meaningful improvement in operating leverage. We delivered adjusted EBITDA growth of 15% and expanded our adjusted EBITDA margin by 50 basis points. Finally, we accelerated cash flow generation, allowing us to invest more in the business, paydown debt, repurchase shares, and execute tuck-in M&A. Turning to Slide 4. Our strategy guides how we operate and what we focus on to win at US Foods under our four pillars of culture, service, growth and profit. We continue to reap benefits from the inclusion of our four regional Presidents on my Executive Leadership team. We are communicating better and aligning our teams more effectively to ensure faster execution. One important example is a recent decision I made to further streamline the organization and address feedback from the field by having our local sales teams report into the Regional Presidents versus a centralized corporate commercial function. Also, Jim Sturgell, our EVP and Chief Commercial Officer, has informed me of his decision to retire effective December 1. Jim has been a trusted leader and voice on my Executive Leadership team. During his more than 31 years with the company, Jim has made countless contributions to propel our company forward. I want to thank him for his steadfast leadership and his many contributions to our company and our people. After much thought and careful consideration, given Jim's pending retirement, I've decided to not backfill Jim's role. Instead, we have restructured our commercial team to create even greater collaboration, a more streamlined structure, and the platform for accelerated execution of our strategy. As a result, Randy Taylor, our EVP of Field Operations, has taken on additional responsibilities for sales excellence and marketing. In addition, Dave Poe has been promoted to EVP, Chief Merchant reporting to me. Dave is a seasoned foodservice veteran with more than 25 years of merchandising experience within distribution. In Dave's expanded role, he will continue to be responsible for ensuring the US Foods product value proposition exceeds our customer expectations, that we are competitive on cost of goods, and that we have the right product portfolio through his leadership of our merchandising function. In addition to the organization changes we are making, we continue to place increased emphasis on accelerating profitable growth, and we want to ensure that we reward our sellers for delivering on that growth. We are currently working on some likely revisions to our territory manager sales compensation plan, which will even more closely link their compensation to the key elements of our profitable growth plan. We will share more about any potential modifications during our fourth quarter call. We are also accelerating our investment in our local selling capacity. In fact, we increased our local seller headcount each month in the third quarter. We plan to continue those additions in the low-to-mid single digits into 2024 and beyond, which has already been contemplated in our long-range plan. We will be more focused than ever on profitable growth with the right tools and support processes to ensure our sales teams are successful. Collectively, these changes will ensure better alignment between the field and corporate teams while reducing handoffs and creating additional organization efficiencies. Most importantly, they will further propel our company with the right focus on serving and supporting our customers and driving profitable organic growth. Turning to Slide 5. I'll now briefly discuss our third quarter progress against our culture and service pillars, and then Dirk will talk about the growth and profit pillars a bit later. The safety and wellbeing of our associates is paramount at US Foods and is critical to our success. Since day one, I have stressed the importance of improving our performance to provide an even safer operating environment for all of our associates. Our strong results have been driven by our actions to execute more effectively on fewer, but more impactful initiatives, while reinforcing safety as a personal value. One example is our safety leadership training where we will provide behavior-based safety process training to approximately 1,300 operation leaders by the end of this year. This example, combined with other initiatives, has led to steady improvement in our safety performance. Our results improved in the third quarter compared to both the second quarter of this year, as well as the third quarter of last year. In fact, the third quarter was our best safety result since the first quarter of 2021 with our injury and accident frequency rates both better than the prior year by 25% to 30%. However, there is more work to be done and we won't rest until we are zero accidents and injuries. Turning to the responsible portion of our cultural pillar, through our recently published Fall Scoop, we rolled out a new climate conscious product innovation category within our Serve Good portfolio. Serve Good features products that meet our sustainability criteria, including products that are responsibly sourced or contribute to waste reduction. When asked, nearly two-thirds of our customers say that it is important to them to make sustainable choices that limit their impact on the environment. One example is our newly unveiled Monogram Carbon-Negative Cutlery that utilizes greenhouse gas derived biomaterial to create a negative carbon footprint. These climate conscious innovative products aim to support our plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We are excited to have nearly 1,000 products in our Serve Good portfolio, which spans multiple product categories. Additionally, we are focused on winning center-of-the-plate proteins and fresh produce, and over the last several years, we have upgraded our assortment in these key product categories. Importantly, our fresh produce category is our fastest-growing category year-to-date, and we estimate we have captured approximately 400 basis points of market share over the last two years within our target customer types of independent restaurants, healthcare, and hospitality. I am proud of our sustainable and healthy offerings that will ensure we continue to meet our customer's current and evolving needs. Moving to Slide 6. We continue to focus on best-in-class delivery, specifically on time and in full service levels to our customers. We continue to improve our customer service levels for product availability, and we are essentially now at pre-COVID levels. On-time service to customers is also a key focus area for us and our new routing system pilot as part of the broader routing optimization work we have had underway is a prime example of how we can further improve service. We launched a Descartes routing pilot in our first market. We continue to learn from this pilot and intend to pilot a second location before year-end with national implementation planned for 2024. Our routing improvement initiative, combined with our move to Descartes, will enable us to improve service levels to our customers, while also reducing miles driven and fuel consumption as highlighted by our third-quarter performance where we delivered the best cases per mile in our company's history. In addition, our flexible scheduling initiative is making solid progress as we have moved from the pilot phase to broader deployment across our network and it is now live in 16 locations. We continue to see significant improvements across our network and especially in our pilots, including year-over-year reduction in turnover that is approximately twice the rate of improvement versus our other locations, 30% improvement in safety and continued improvement in productivity. We remain on track for half of our locations to be live on flex scheduling by year-end. Finally, we also continue to invest in our market-leading customer-facing digital technology with MOXe\u0304. Our agile development has delivered many improvements to make it even faster for customers to place orders and manage their business. Our deployment to local customers is complete and we now have 30% of our national customers on MOXe\u0304, with full deployment planned in the first half of next year. In terms of the digital customer experience, we believe we continue to lead the industry. Our Net Promoter Score has been strong since our launch and has improved even further recently. From an e-commerce penetration perspective, we are at 84% for the total company and our locally managed business improved 50 basis points to 73%. MOXe\u0304 is well on its way to being the premier all-in one digital toolset for our customers to order, track deliveries, pay bills, and manage inventory. And as we continue to focus on the customer experience, we further expanded Pronto in the quarter, which is our small truck delivery service focused within targeted dense geographies. Today, Pronto has a presence in 35 markets. I am pleased with our progress and the return on the investments we are making to provide best-in-class service to our customers. Turning to Slide 7. I'll walk through some third quarter highlights, and Dirk will go into a little more detail later. Total case volume growth was 4% and we drove growth in each of our target customer types again this quarter, with volume increasing nearly 6% for independent restaurants, 8% for healthcare and 6% for hospitality. Adjusted EBITDA grew double digits and margins further increased. We remain focused on increasing our gross profit per case faster than operating expense per case and accelerating profitable share growth as we did this quarter. Both healthcare and hospitality continued to deliver strong growth, driven in large part by healthy net new business. We remain focused on growing in our target customer types and expect to continue that momentum. I've already spoken about several of the good progress points with our customer experience and supply chain, so I won't be repetitive here. Moving on, we continue to strengthen our capital structure and prudently allocate capital to fuel long-term growth. We further reduced our net leverage to 2.9x and we repurchased more than 700,000 shares for $29 million. We expect to remain below 3x levered for the remainder of the year with further improvement into next year. Finally, we closed the Renzi acquisition earlier in the third quarter. And this morning, we announced the acquisition of Saladino's, our second tuck-in acquisition this year. Saladino's is an independent foodservice distributor in Central California with approximately $600 million in annual revenue that will provide additional scale for us in Central California. We expect to close the transaction by year-end. We have strong momentum as we finish out 2023, and we expect that momentum to carry us into 2024. Before I hand it over to Dirk, I would like to acknowledge the brave men and women who have served in the armed forces. On Veterans Day, this Saturday, we will celebrate our 1,500 associates who have so courageously served our country. And you can see some of their faces on Slide 8. We are grateful for their service and celebrate them and all veterans on this important day. We are committed to supporting veterans in their transition back to civilian life. They offer skills that are remarkably competitive and transferable to the work we do in food distribution, including drivers, selectors, supervisors and corporate roles. We have an employee resource group dedicated to educating our associates on the value of a veteran, recruiting veterans, supporting and recognizing our US Foods veterans and providing volunteer and community engagement opportunities. I would like to recognize Jennifer Castillo, who is President of the THOSE WHO SERVE Employee Resource Group. Jennifer is a senior manager in merchandising excellence who served in the U.S. Navy and successfully transferred her skills and mass communications to the corporate world. We thank Jennifer for her efforts in leading this valuable employee resource group and all veterans for their service to our country. And we wish all of those who have made personal sacrifices to protect our freedoms in a very happy Veterans Day. With that, I'll hand it over to Dirk to go over our financial performance and guidance in further detail. Thanks, Dirk. The continued improvement in our results reflects our team's hard work over the past few years to build a differentiated platform that positions us to win in any environment. I am pleased with the progress we are making as we execute the four pillars of our strategy, which is driving improved safety, productivity and profitable growth despite the lack of market tailwinds. And we'll continue to be at the forefront of technology with our MOXe\u0304 platform and our overall digital strategy. Our focus on continuing to improve our customer value proposition has resulted in strong case growth and consistent market share gains, specifically within independent restaurants, healthcare and hospitality. We are growing our adjusted EBITDA and enhancing our margins. Our leverage is now below 3x. Even with this tremendous progress, we have a long runway of profitable growth and shareholder returns in front of us. Assuming stable macro backdrop, we believe our long-range plan will lead to further margin expansion over time, and we remain committed to be at or near $1.7 billion of adjusted EBITDA in 2024. And I want to be very clear, this is not the ceiling for future earnings growth. We have a lot more sales and earnings growth potential in 2024 and beyond, and we look forward to highlighting our exciting future at the upcoming Investor Day on June 5. We are just getting started, and we will continue to execute our strategy, gain profitable market share within our target customer types, enhance our margins and strategically deploy capital. We are in a great position today, and we believe we have sustainable competitive advantages to outperform the market well into the future. It's an exciting time at US Foods, and we appreciate your interest. With that, Lisa, please open up the line for questions. Great. Well, let me take the first question that you asked there, John and good morning. We're excited about the investments we're making in the sales force as we've been doing that for a while. And we continue to accelerate that investment, and we'll be at that low-to-mid single digits for a long time to come. It's mostly TMs. But I'm excited about our team-based selling model, where we have our consultants and specialists as well as our chefs teaming up in front of the customer. We'll make fractional investments in those other two groups relative to TMs just to continue to make sure they have the support they need in front of the customer. And then in terms of the org changes, really excited about where we're going. Jim, his retirement just gave me the opportunity to think about differently how I want to think about the organization and efficiencies. And as you know, any time there's handoffs between corporate and the field, it creates slower decision-making opportunities for inefficiency, and we just need to continue to move faster. So it's an opportunity for me to rethink it and moving our local sales organization back into the field where the customer interfaces just make all sorts of sense. So a small change, but I think it will prove meaningful through the course of time. Yes. No, I think that's right. And on the independent side, let me start with that first. our cases per line are relatively flat, given what you've heard broadly about some of the foot traffic, but we are continuing to increase our lines per drop up in the low single digits. So we continue to penetrate those customers both when we get them initially, but also through the course of time, and that's an exciting opportunity for us to continue to drive in terms of growth. And as I mentioned, in hospitality and healthcare, we're generating a lot of net new customers and new business. And as we've talked in the past, we believe we've got a highly differentiated model there. Particularly in healthcare, we've got great technology differentiation to help our customers, not only in their back office from a cost productivity standpoint. But also with our customers and the folks that are seeking the care to help manage their nutritionals to be efficient in how they bring in inventory and to do that automatically. No one else has the capability that we have there. And then the same-store sales, I would say, contribute more that growth to healthcare and hospitality relative to independents. So we've got a differentiated model. We're winning in all those places as we continue to tell you, we're taking share in all of them. And we've got a long runway of growth ahead of us. And I think this really speaks to the power of the differentiated model that we have. We've got all these target customer types that many of our competitors don't have. And I think that will prove to be a very resilient model for us through the course of time. Thank you. Let me start, and I'll ask Dirk to fill in the details here. But the point I want to make, Kelly, and I appreciate the question. As we've been through periods of large inflation here and now two consecutive quarters of deflation and what you've seen us continue to do regardless of what's going on there is continue to expand our gross margins and particularly our gross margin per case. And as Dirk highlighted, we're going that at a much faster rate than our operating expense per case is growing. That's a winning model. We expect that, that will continue. Specific to your SVM question, it's a piece of work that the company has been doing for quite some time. As we said, we'd be through about 60% of our COGS by the end of this year. We're maintaining that. And we're making very good progress. So that element of the gross margin improvement, along with our penetration of exclusive brands, which we said were up 140 basis points in independents this quarter, along with our work to continue to optimize our freight lanes and improve our mix. That's the winning formula to continue to expand our gross margins. And as we say, we control our own destiny in that regard, and we're doing a nice job of it. Thank you. Yes. I think the health is very solid. We've had some foot traffic challenges through the course of the third quarter there, particularly with the chains, which continued to see lower foot traffic sequentially, while our results improved. I think the health of the independent is very stable. And as you've heard me say in the past, I believe they're going to win out in the long run here. And importantly, we continue to have a differentiated model that enables us to continue to take market share and support their businesses, not only with our great products and service with our people, but also our technology. So we think we're differentiated there and regardless of what's going on in the macro, we're going to continue to penetrate that healthy customer base. And importantly, I think overall, there's less restaurants out there than there were pre-pandemic. But we've seen sequentially new openings of restaurants. And I would say our penetration is largely probably equally split between new openings of locations, as well as penetration and taking share from others in the marketplace. So it's a pretty well-balanced approach at this point. I would expect to see continued openings in locations through the course of the next few quarters here. So we're seeing that part of the customer base pretty healthy and stable. Thanks. Well, I think just broadly in the market, the foot traffic was slightly down sequentially Q3 to Q2. And as I've said in the past, really the performance is relative to who you have in your portfolio relative to the winners and the folks who are going as well. We outperformed what was going on with foot traffic this quarter. I think that's relatively stable. We have some things in the pipeline and I think we'll continue to show improvement through the course of time and into next year, middle of next year. We're targeting the right change that we believe are going to win. And as we've said in the past, we'll continue to look for optimization opportunities within our portfolio. Thank you. Yes. So let me start to say we will always invest in organic growth in our company first. We think that's the highest return and supporting our customers is paramount. We continue to look at expansion opportunities across our network, and we'll be thoughtful about those, but we'll continue to drive that first. And as you heard me say, we don't need to do any acquisitions in this company. I love our footprint. We'll take opportunities like we did with Renzi and the one we announced this morning to help us with efficiencies, taking miles out of the system and local market density. So let me just say a word about Saladino's since you brought up M&A and the way we think about it. We're very excited about that acquisition. We said $600 million in revenue. It gives us an opportunity in the Central Valley where Saladino's is roughly half chain and half independent, where we don't have a footprint to serve the independent customer in that Central Valley, really none of our competitors do. So we're excited about it from that standpoint. We're excited about it from the standpoint of helping us optimize the chain business that we have in that Central and Northern California footprint. So we'll take miles out and serve that part of the customer base better. But I guess I would say I'm most excited about the multiple we're paying for that, which is a fraction of what we paid for Renzi, and a fraction of our trading multiple. So as we said, we will be thoughtful and disciplined about any acquisitions, and we won't do any that don't make sense, and we won't overpay for them. And Saladino's is another great example of that. In terms of your question around share repurchases, we're obviously under trading our potential and hugely undervalued in my view. You've seen us ramp up our share repurchases. I think we'll be thoughtful about that going forward. Returning capital to shareholders is important. After we do the things we need to make sure we're growing and supporting our customers well. Obviously, more to come on that through the course of time. But we've been leaning in hard on share repurchases, and we'll continue to do that. Yes. Thank you. I think sequentially through the quarter, we saw things soften a bit in the market, as I said earlier. And that's why I'm so excited that our independent case growth actually accelerated sequentially from Q2 to Q3, and we continue to accelerate our market share gains. So it underscores the importance of the differentiated model and the differentiation that we have actually in the marketplace. And in terms of the start to the fourth quarter, I think it's largely in line with what we saw in Q3. I would say October started a little slower for us as we were lapping a strike from one of our large competitors in the first couple of weeks of October. We saw that volume bounce back as we would expect in the back half of the quarter, and we expect to be relatively in line with Q3 and importantly continue to take market share in those target customer types. Thank you. Yes. Great question. I'll take your second part first. I'm highly confident in the differentiation of our model. And it's the winning model, I believe we can drive growth effectively and productively with our sales team. But that team-based selling model, as you continue to hear me say is a real differentiator. I see it working every single day for our customers. And we're going to continue to drive it hard. And I think that's why you may hear us talk about sales head count growth at a slightly lower level than you hear from some of our competitors. I think that really is a differentiation in our model, and we'll continue to lean in around that. And the first part of your question, remind me again. I think this is still a very highly fragmented market, as you know. The big three have 40% nominally roughly plus or minus of share. So that's still very highly fragmented. I think you continue to see us take share collectively from some of the smaller players. When I think about our business relative to others, we still have a relatively small share of the independent market space. So the runway is long, I think, for growth. We all have different models. They all have their pluses and minuses, but I think there's room for everybody to continue to win in this market. Thanks, Ed. Yes, I think that probably is something to the seasonality piece, although we don't spend a lot of time thinking about that, Jeff, because relative to our model and the things that we're winning in around \u2013 we actually telling our team to focus on the things we can control and whether there's a broader slowdown in the market. There's still a lot of cases out there for us to go get. People are still going out to eat. It's going to ebb and flow just like it always has. It's been a difficult time to get a handle on things with the rebound since COVID and restaurants that have gone offline and then coming back. It's really \u2013 it's been a little bit helter-skelter here, as you know, for the last year or so. But regardless of all of that, I think what I'm seeing and what I said earlier is stability. I think that's the key right now is stability and our ability to lean in where we want to in those three target customer types to continue to support our customers to share. I think from a macro standpoint, that would probably be it, but it would have to be a major significant macro thing to give me a lot of concern. I've got a lot of confidence and our ability to hit that target for next year, given the momentum that we have and what I can see coming in the future in terms of continued share gains, productivity work that we have underway in our ability to control that outcome. So yes, I guess I'd have to point to a macro, but it would have to be more than just a minor slowdown. Yes. Ours have been more geographic focused in both cases, both with Renzi and Saladino's now where we're serving those markets in some capacity, but not very efficiently. So there's still ample opportunity for that across our network to strengthen our position in local markets. There may be something that we do product portfolio-wise, that's opportunistic. I don't see any major gaps in it. But if the right thing comes along at the right time, we'll certainly take a look at it. But I think you can think about it in a similar fashion than what you've seen us do with the two that we've talked about so far this year. And in terms of valuations, what you heard me say is that Saladino's was extremely reasonable, and a fraction of what we paid and elsewhere. So we're going to do the things that make sense because we don't have to do M&A. We really don't. So it's going to be thoughtful. It's going to be the right one for us to solve a problem for us. And at valuations that make sense for us every time. Thank you. Yes, I think you can interpret at least \u2013 I can only speak for us and how we're thinking about it, Jake, but I think it speaks to the underlying opportunity that we see in terms of growth. And look, as we continue to take share, we're going to grow somewhat with the market. That's going to be very low-single digits. We're going to continue to penetrate the market and take share, and that's going to drive an incremental growth in that low to single-digit \u2013 low to mid-single-digit headcount increase, we'll add another incremental growth on top of that. And so that's the way we're thinking about the algorithm. Given the relatively fractured nature of this market and this industry, there's still ample opportunity for us to take share regardless of the macro. Yes. I think this has always been a competitive industry, and it always will be. And things changed during COVID. And I think I would describe the competitiveness out there now is back to pre-COVID levels. It's very fragmented. There's a lot of competitors out there. Jake, that doesn't deter us at all. We've got a differentiated model. But I think it underscores the importance of two things. One is all the initiatives that we have underway that we control to continue to drive that improvement in gross profit per case and then looking at ways to continually get more productive and take cost and waste out of our system. That's why this 3% to 5% productivity target is so important to us. That's why the MOXe\u0304 penetration is important because it allows our sales team to be much more productive in front of the customer. Not chasing the back office stuff, but selling the value that we bring, selling great products and importantly, helping our customers solve the problems. Thank you. Yes, I think you're hitting right in the center of the target there, Mark. As we've said now, the systems change is largely behind us. We've had some lingering effects in terms of lost business through the course of that, which started in the third quarter of last year. Encouragingly, we are seeing month-over-month sequential improvement and more recently, week-over-week improvement. So I'm encouraged by the ramp-up. As you heard Dirk say, we expect to be in a position to flat to growth by the end of this year, exiting the year with the goal of driving strong topline growth next year. And I think largely, we're on track to do that. So I'm very encouraged by what I see. We continue to invest in the business. We've opened one new location already in the fourth quarter in Virginia, and we've got a couple of more planned in the Carolinas here before the end of the fourth quarter. So progress continues, and I expect that, that ramp rate will continue here as we exit 2023. Yes. I think Renzi has gone even better than I could have imagined. It's gone extremely well on the integration front. We put a very strong leader in place there. We've had a great cultural fit. Importantly, we haven't lost any key talent, and it's been very transparent and a non-event for the customers in the market. So we love it. There's not enough good, I can say about how Renzi has gone. It's all very, very positive. And then the second part of your question again? Yes. I think, as I said, it filled a geographic void for us, particularly on the independent side there where we were serving that market. It's kind of hard to get to the Central Valley from San Francisco or L.A. very efficiently. So it solves that problem for us. And importantly, we have plenty of chain business in that part of the country and the half of that business that we're acquiring that was chain related will help us serve that segment of the customer base also more effectively. So we're excited about it from all those angles. It just makes sense at the right time. And importantly, as I've said a number of times this morning, a great multiple that we paid for. Thank you. Well, I think attracting talent is important. And I would say the inflow of applicants for our jobs has increased to the point where I would say it's relatively the same as it was pre-COVID. It's always been the challenge to retain those folks through the course of time. And that's why we leaned in so hard around this flex scheduling pilot. And while initially as you start those pilots, you need to add a little bit of headcount, it actually hurts your productivity. What we're seeing is double-digit improvements in turnover. Obviously, that leads to reduce overtime and improve productivity in the long run. And we're seeing that everywhere we've taken that model. So I think we've got a unique approach that makes a lot of sense for us and will help us retain people, which is the key here to driving productivity over the long haul. And as Dirk said, we're pleased with our driver results, both in terms of turnover and productivity being back to pre-pandemic levels, and we'll continue to drive improvement from there. Yes. I would say that there's been a change since the pandemic getting back to pre-pandemic competitiveness. And as I said, it's always competitive. I wouldn't point to any market or geographic area of the country where it's more or less competitive than it was pre-pandemic. It's always competitive. It's a thing we all have to deal with every day. And that's why we work so hard to sell the value that US Foods brings to our customers. Thank you. Well, thank you all for joining us today. We are excited about the momentum in the business and importantly, the exciting future that we have. We look forward to talking to you again and importantly, our Investor Day on June 5th. Have a great day."

Thank you for your interest in Food, and I'll now turn over the call to Dave. \nDavid Flitman : Thanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. It's hard to believe that I've already been at US Foods for seven months. During this time, I have continued my focused effort to get deeper into the business and interact with more of our associates, customers, suppliers and investors. I'll start today by sharing highlights for the quarter and progress against our strategy and long-range plan before I hand it over to Dirk to review our financial results and updated fiscal 2023 guidance.  We remain intensely focused on executing our long-range plan, and it showed in our strong financial results again this quarter as we delivered record adjusted EBITDA of $432 million. We achieved 17% adjusted EBITDA growth through a combination of profitable volume growth and margin expansion. Additionally, we delivered healthy total case growth of 3%, led by 5% independent case growth, underpinned by 5.5% growth with broadline independent restaurant customers, along with 7% healthcare and hospitality growth. This is the ninth consecutive quarter our team has gained independent market share.  Finally, we accelerated cash flow generation through our earnings growth and working capital improvement. Our strong cash flow year-to-date has allowed us to invest in the business for organic growth, prepay additional term loan debt and return capital to shareholders via share repurchases. As a result of our strong performance for the first half of the fiscal year and continued momentum, we are increasing our full year earnings guidance, which Dirk will share leader. My expectation is that we will continue to execute our plan and build upon our strong momentum.  Now let's turn to Slide 4. Our strategy guides how we operate and what we focus on to win at US Foods under our four pillars of culture, service, growth and profit. Last quarter, I introduced the simplified model, which is much clearer for our associates, so we can be more action and outcome-oriented across the company. These changes are resonating with our organization and are helping us remain focused, which contributed to our strong second quarter results. The other key change I made was to our organizational structure, bringing our four region presidents on to my management team, and that change has been outstanding. Having them at the table has improved communication between our functions in the field and streamlined our decision-making regarding execution of our broader strategy. I'm going to briefly focus on second quarter progress points against the culture and service pillars, and then Dirk will talk about the growth and profit pillars later.  Turning to Slide 5. The first pillar is culture because our culture and our people fuel our strategy. Instilling a stronger safety culture has been a focus since the day I arrived at US Foods. I am pleased to say that we have made very good progress in just seven months. Our second quarter year-over-year results improved approximately 20% compared to the prior year through a combination of tone from the top and focused programs to drive results. We have good early momentum with significant opportunity remaining.  On a related note, I would like to recognize the 13 US Foods drivers who were recently named to the International Foodservice Distributors Association Truck Driver Hall of Fame. This prestigious accolade is only awarded to those who have exceptional safety records, including 25 years of service without an accident. What makes this year even more special is that Alicia Seyler, one of our drivers based in Loveland, Colorado, with 27 years of service was the first-ever female driver elected to the IFDA Hall of Fame. We are proud to have these world-class drivers dedicated to safety at US Foods as we strive to provide our associates, customers, business partners and the communities we operate in with a safe and hazard-free environment.  Additionally, we recently published our 2022 Corporate Social Responsibility Report and I am proud that we have made continued improvement across our three focus areas of people, product and planet. I encourage you to go to our website to read about our progress from our sustainable products, the US Foods scholar program to our compressed natural gas trucks and Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction.  Moving to service on Slide 6. As a reminder, our research tells us that the most important services to our customers are on time, correct orders and high-quality fresh products. Our product service levels to our customers are back in line with pre-COVID levels. Vendor service levels to US Foods have also steadily improved. However, they remain slightly below pre-COVID levels. This progress is yielding positive results from a service level perspective and is also helping us reduce our working capital.  Our routing initiative continues to make progress. And in the second quarter, we delivered the best cases per mile metric in the last three years. We are also preparing for a pilot of our new routing software later this year, which will significantly increase our capabilities. I look forward to our learnings and the progress we will continue to make.  Finally, MOX\u0113, our digital customer platform has now been fully rolled out among our local customers and feedback continues to be very positive as are our Net Promoter Score results.  Turning to Slide 7. I'll walk through our second quarter highlights in a bit more detail. We grew adjusted EBITDA by 17% despite essentially no sequential inflation and, in fact, modest year-over-year product cost deflation, driven by center-of-the-plate categories. Our adjusted EBITDA margins also increased 60 basis points from the prior year as our initiatives continue to ramp up, and we gained operating leverage this quarter. Year-over-year, total case volume growth was healthy at 3%. Case growth was led by 5% growth in independent restaurants and 7% growth in both healthcare and hospitality while chain cases were down 4%.  Our independent case growth was negatively impacted about 70 basis points from slower growth in our CHEF'STOREs as we work through a systems conversion which is largely behind us now. This means our broadline independent customer case growth was 5.5% for the quarter. The software chain results this quarter are primarily due to no longer lapping Omicron, the softer macro and the impact on same-store sales across most of our chain customers.  Healthcare and hospitality continues to demonstrate strong growth, driven in large part by helping net new business. We are pleased with how our target customer types continue to outperform the industry, resulting in share gains. With that said, we still have opportunity to improve performance as we focus on more consistent execution. We have good momentum and expected to further accelerate.  Moving to our customer experience. We, again, gained year-over-year market share in our target customer types as we remain focused on executing our differentiated strategy. For independence, this is the ninth consecutive quarter of share gains, which demonstrates the progress we continue to make. I am happy to report that MOX\u0113 is fully rolled out to our local customers, reactions continue to be very positive, and we are releasing regular updates based on customer and seller feedback to improve this industry-leading platform. We are now beginning to roll out MOX\u0113 to our national customers.  This platform, combined with our other leading digital tools and service model will enable us to continue to service our national customers well and build it and convert a strong new business pipeline, especially in our target customer types. We also actively expanded customer usage of VITALS, our technology suite for healthcare customers to leverage added capabilities and help our customers more effectively manage their overall costs.  Very importantly, we continue to make progress on our supply chain excellence journey during the second quarter. In addition to our improved momentum in safety, our productivity performance also improved year-over-year and sequentially for both delivery and warehouse, which is very encouraging. I am pleased with the progress we are making and expect us to further accelerate that progress in the back half of this year and into 2024.  Our flexible scheduling and seven-day delivery pilots are progressing well, demonstrating results in line with our expectations, including a double-digit percent reduction in turnover in each of our pilot markets. As I called out last quarter, our near-term focus will be to expand flexible scheduling broadly.  We only roll out seven-day delivery opportunistically where capacity is constrained. Our team is actively working to expand the flex scheduling approach and we expect to have more than half of our locations live on flex scheduling by year-end, which we believe will further improve associate satisfaction and retention.  Finally, we continue to strengthen our capital structure and prudently allocate capital to fuel long-term growth. Through earnings growth and additional debt reduction, we lowered our net leverage to 3x, which is the first time we've been in our target range since it was established. Our debt ratings were upgraded by both rating agencies, demonstrating our strong progress and underlying business momentum.  In parallel to the continued leverage reduction, we spent $166 million on share repurchases. Shortly after the end of the quarter, we closed on our first tuck-in acquisition in six years, Renzi Foodservice. As part of our continued investment in Renzi, we are slated to break ground on the expansion of our Renzi distribution center this month, which includes approximately 10,000 square feet of construction, providing additional loading dock space for 8 new refrigerated loading base to support our growing customer base in the area. We are excited to welcome the Renzi associates, and I look forward to working closely with this high-quality team to drive future growth.  Each of the actions we've taken on deploying capital in a balanced manner reinforces our commitment to being responsible stewards of capital to drive long-term shareholder value creation.  With that, I'll hand it over to Dirk to go over our financial performance and guidance in further detail. \nDirk Locascio : Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 9. We are very pleased with what we accomplished in the second quarter and the strong momentum we continue to have at US Foods. Adjusted EBITDA grew $64 million or 17% from the prior year to $432 million, which was a record quarter for US Foods. In addition to strong EBITDA dollars, we expanded our adjusted EBITDA margin 60 basis points from the prior year as our gross profit grew significantly more than OpEx. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 18%, which is also a record.  Within our results, net sales were $9 billion in the second quarter, an increase of 2.1% over the prior year. Total case volume increased 2.7%, partially offset by year-over-year food cost deflation and product mix impact of 0.6%. As Dave mentioned, case growth was healthy overall and especially in our target customer types. Case growth slowed from the first quarter, largely as expected, since we no longer had a year-over-year benefit from Omicron lapping in the second quarter. We faced a headwind to case growth in the second quarter, primarily from a system conversion at CHEF'STORE. However, we have largely worked through it at this point and are seeing sales improve. We are pleased with the 5.5% broadline independent case growth.  We did see modest year-over-year product cost deflation, and it was driven by center of the plate as groceries still showed year-over-year inflation in the quarter. Essentially, we had no sequential inflation and still are not seeing deflation in grocery categories, which is encouraging. Since grocery categories are predominantly a percent markup and more impacted by deflation compared to center-of-the-plate categories, which are largely fixed markups and not as impacted by deflation.  We continued our strong gross profit performance this quarter as our adjusted gross profit dollars increased 9% from the prior year. Most of the strength is due to the excellent progress we have made over the past year on our long-range plan initiatives across cost of goods, logistics management and pricing. Our initiatives have been critical in mitigating the increased operating cost we and the broader industry have faced.  OpEx was above the prior year for the second quarter, albeit significantly less than the increases we saw in the past two years. The second quarter year-over-year increase in OpEx per case was largely driven by increased seller compensation and higher incentive compensation costs as distribution cost per case was better than the prior year.  We continued our progress against both the growth and profit pillars, and I'll spend a few minutes on each of these. We are focused on profitable growth and share gains in our target customer types, by leveraging our differentiated service model, digital capabilities and unique products. We are on track to exceed our 1.5x goal for restaurant volume growth for the full year led by strong independent case growth.  In the second quarter, we drove year-over-year share gains in each of our target customer types and continue to develop a strong healthcare and hospitality new business pipeline. As Dave mentioned, this was our ninth quarter in a row of independent share gains. As we grow faster with our target customer types, it helps our customer mix and drives profitability.  Next to profit on Slide 11. In addition to profitable growth, we continue to make progress on our initiatives to increase EBITDA margins. Our team effectively managed a relatively volatile quarter for commodity categories as we leverage our processes and maintain our strong gross profit per case. At the same time, we further progress on initiatives such as cost of goods or COGS improvement by working jointly with additional vendors. We remain on track to address a total of 60% of COGS by the end of fiscal 2023. We continue to advance our efforts to drive operational efficiencies as productivity improved year-over-year and sequentially for both delivering warehouse.  Our flex schedule and pilots are progressing well and demonstrating good results. This powerful initiative has a twofold impact. It gives associates more scheduled flexibility and provides US Foods with better associate engagement and retention. Ultimately, this adds up to a win for our customers through stronger service.  Finally, we are progressing with our indirect procurement work and have identified a number of opportunities, which we are pursuing and will ramp up further value creation in 2024. I'm now going to pivot from earnings to cash flow.  Turning to Slide 12. We continue to increase our strong cash flow and expect to build upon this as we grow earnings. Our strong cash flow allows us to continue reinvesting for growth and to further strengthen our capital structure. We have and will continue to prudently allocate capital against our core priorities to invest in the business, reduce leverage return capital to shareholders and pursue accretive tuck-in M&A to strategically expand our distribution network.  Year-to-date, we have invested approximately $200 million of cash CapEx and fleet leases, including projects to expand fleet, improved analytic insights and improved technology and supply chain and sales to enable further organic growth. I'll talk further in a moment on reducing leverage. In parallel with the debt reduction, we repurchased $166 million of shares in the second quarter, $150 million of which came from the KKR stock sale. Following this repurchase, we have $286 million remaining on our $500 million share repurchase program.  In early July, we completed the acquisition of Renzi Foodservice, and are excited to welcome the Renzi team to the US Foods family. This is our first tuck-in acquisition since 2017, and we are thrilled about the quality of this business and associates.  Moving to Slide 13. We meaningfully reduced our net leverage compared to year-end 2022 through a combination of net debt reduction and earnings growth. You can also see on the slide the significant progress over the past 12 months. Our net leverage ratio was 3x at the end of the second quarter, which is the top end of our target leverage range.  We continue to prioritize debt paydown and prepaid an additional $60 million of term loan in the second quarter, bringing us to $125 million of prepayment year-to-date. Our overall debt structure is in good shape if we don't have any maturities until 2025. That said, we're looking ahead to the 2025 maturity and expect to proactively address that in the next quarter or two.  Actions this quarter resulted in credit upgrades from both rating agencies. We remain focused on creating value for shareholders and allocating our capital prudently across the four parts of our capital allocation strategy.  Now turning to guidance on Slide 14. As a result of our strong year-to-date results and outlook for the full year, we are raising our full year adjusted EBITDA range to $1.51 billion to $1.54 billion and our adjusted diluted EPS range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share. We remain on track to reduce leverage to below 3x by the end of the year.  We are well positioned to deliver against this guidance and expect to be at the higher end of the earnings guidance if the macro remains similar to what we're seeing currently.  With that, I'll pass it back to Dave for his closing remarks. \nDavid Flitman : Thanks, Dirk. I will close where I started. Seven months into my role, I couldn't be more excited about US Foods and the opportunity ahead for our business.  Slide 15 summarizes our investment thesis and why I am so bullish. US Foods is a strong company, and we continue to get stronger. We are a leader in a highly fragmented industry in a pure-play U.S.-only based distributor focused on broadline distribution. Our business is resilient across various macro backdrops and US Foods offers further stability through our laser focus on controlling the controllables and executing against our long-range plan.  We are targeting independents, healthcare and hospitality for growth where we believe our differentiation adds even more value and we are seeing the results in our outsized growth and continued share gains. This progress has been driven by the quality of our strong team, our service model and our digital capabilities, including MOX\u0113. I believe these are all compelling reasons to invest in US Foods. We are focused on building on the company's core strengths while finding ways to more effectively execute our strategy and accelerate our rate of improvement.  I am confident this combination will lead to a very bright future for US Foods and all of our stakeholders.  Finally, I would like to thank our 29,000 associates for their continued dedication and the excellent work they do each day to help our customers make it. Our associates are critical to our success which underscores why you matter is a very important one of our cultural beliefs.  With that, Rob, please open up the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Mark Carden from UBS. \nMark Carden : So to start, it looks like you took meaningful market share in the independent channel, albeit with a bit of a slowdown in case growth relative to last quarter. Outside of some of the disruption with CHEF'STORE, which it sounds like you've largely worked your way through, what are you seeing with respect to the health of this customer overall? And any changes on how you're thinking about the channel's contribution to your growth in the coming periods? \nDavid Flitman: Yes, I appreciate the question, Mark. We are seeing strong health of the operator and independents. And if you recall, I mean, we were expecting the performance that we had in the second quarter. If you recall, we had the Omicron lap go away here in the second quarter. And as we provided color last quarter, we saw some softness in the March that led into April. May and June got sequentially stronger. And while we don't give quarterly guidance, I can tell you the start to the third quarter has been at or slightly above what we saw exiting the second quarter trajectory. So we feel very good about the health of the operator, but more importantly, our ability based on our differentiation to continue to take share in that segment of the business. And then besides that, healthcare and hospitality remained very, very strong. We're taking share in both of them, and we have very strong pipelines across the board. \nMark Carden : That's great. And as a follow-up, just on deflation, how much did deflation intensify as the quarter progressed? How much risk do you see it ultimately impacting your grocery category sales? And then when you think about next year and the $1.7 billion EBITDA target, is that contingent upon a return to a more normalized inflation backdrop? Or do you have enough with your initiatives to get that in a variety of scenarios? \nDirk Locascio : Mark, this is Dirk. So overall, the inflation deflation picture was pretty similar across the quarter. So you saw it changing really as you were lapping prior year. But if I think of it through the quarter, grocery overall still continued to see for the quarter a little bit of inflation. So we still haven't seen deflation popping up there. And in the proteins, a lot of that is coming from the lapping of much more inflation a year ago. And as I said in my prepared comments, we'll take that because those tend to be more fixed markups and our teams have very good processes to manage through it. So even in this environment of very little inflation or modest deflation, we think we're very well positioned to manage through it. And as you've heard me say a number of times, as we focus on controlling the controllable, gross profit -- the strong gross profit growth we driven is really predominantly been from a number of the initiatives we've executed. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. \nEdward Kelly : Nice quarter. I wanted to start with -- I wanted to start on the cost side. You mentioned distribution cost per case better than 2019. I think we look at the progress in OpEx per case and the progress is very good. As we look out the next couple of quarters, I mean, it seems like OpEx per case maybe year-over-year is minimal growth at that seems like you might be entering a period. Can you just talk a bit more about what's driving the cost per case on the distribution side down? Are we thinking about this rate going forward? Obviously, there's puts and takes around wage inflation. Just any help there would be great. \nDavid Flitman : Yes. I appreciate the question. I'll start at the higher level and give Dirk a chance to win in any of the specifics. But as we've said the last couple of quarters, we feel very good about the momentum we're getting on productivity, both in our warehouse and delivery. And you heard me say on the call there, we had sequential improvement as well as year-over-year improvement in both. And so the initiatives we're driving, we're very excited about. We expect those to continue to get traction in the back half of this year. And I would point out to your point, this is five or six quarters in a row where our operating expense growth that continues to decline. And that's based in large part by the good work our team is doing, particularly in supply chain. \nDirk Locascio : And the only thing I would add is, in the quarter, as I commented, overall distribution cost per case was lower than it was a year ago. And the two areas that really drove our increase were seller compensation, which is driven by the strong gross profit results we've had. And then secondly, incentive compensation, which is a good place you're going to have higher costs because it drives team to continue to perform at a stronger level. So we feel, as Dave said, very good about the progress and the path ahead and our ability to effectively manage costs and gain leverage. \nEdward Kelly : And then just a follow-up on gross profit per case. The 6% gain this quarter with some deflation is obviously very encouraging. As we think about the quarters ahead, is there any reason that you shouldn't at least be gaining in that gross profit per case? I mean, just where you stand today, it doesn't seem unreasonable at all that you had at least a low single-digit year-over-year gain there continuing. But maybe just some color there and where do you think you stand in terms of like the innings in terms of the upside here? \nDavid Flitman : Sure. Good question. So for the second quarter, adjusted gross profit dollars were up about 9%. So pleased with that. And I think the -- if I think of the year-over-year, you may see some lesser year-over-year increases just because we've had such strong gains as we're lapping those. We get to your point, get back to a more normalized environment, but continue to feel very good about the durability and strength of our gross profit per case. And I think the way we continue to look at it is there's not an end. We're going to continue to focus on the gross profit gains. And our goal here is to continue to run the play to pro gross profit faster to OpEx to drive margin because as you know, our overall EBITDA growth is a balance of profitable growth, especially in those target customer types. And we think we have -- we're happy with the progress we've made and we have a lot of runway ahead. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Harbour from Morgan Stanley. \nBrian Harbour: Yes. Can you maybe just comment also on the chain restaurants? I know it's kind of not the customer focus at this point, but any change in trends with case volumes for chains? \nDavid Flitman : Yes, I'll take you back, Brian -- good question. I'll take you back to some of the commentary we had in the last quarter. And if you recall, one of the things I said when we were down a little bit less than the market was don't read too much into that. It has in large part to do with the portfolio change each of the competition has, number one.  Number two, we weren't surprised at all because of the lapping of the Omicron effect that we pointed to in the first quarter. And then the second thing is the backdrop within the chain segment has gotten softer as the year has progressed. I'd point to two things. One is the Technomic data that said the change, we're going to be up about 200 basis points back in January. They adjusted that to flat for the year in May. And then the recent Black Box data had the second quarter for changes down anywhere between 2% and 3%. And I think they pointed to about 2.7% in July. So it's really a traffic issue in chains. And as you point out, that's not our focus. We're going to be opportunistic on change, and we're going to lean in hard on healthcare, hospitality independents and continue to run our playbook. \nDirk Locascio : I think, Brian, hopefully what you continue to see here in the second quarter is in a pretty normalized operating environment has recovered. The fact that our overall independent is still growing at 5.5% in the broadline which, as I said in the first quarter call, we think sort of in the mid-5s, that's a very strong case growth. We're taking share. Healthcare and hospitality is not by chance that we're growing still at 7%, well above market. And so those are the things that we're going to continue to control the controllables despite the macro backdrop, we feel good about where we stand and our outlook. \nBrian Harbour : Okay. Great. The deflation rate you saw, if that was sort of steady through the second quarter, is it -- do you think it will be something similar in the second half? Or how are you thinking about that? And then also just you had kind of the LIFO benefit from lower inventory values. Will that still be kind of a factor in the third and fourth quarter? \nDavid Flitman : Sure. Maybe I'll take them in reverse. So LIFO is hard to predict based on deflation or inflation, what happens there. I mean, I'll remind you that the way we reported adjusted, it's backed out of there. So that is not a help for us in our adjusted EBITDA numbers. It does help in our overall GAAP numbers. And the second part is the -- in the second half year, yes, it was pretty stable in the second quarter. I think in the second half of the year if we continue to see some deflation at this point based on what we're seeing. I expect it to be -- continue to be driven primarily by the center-of-the-plate categories. As grocery, as I mentioned before, still really hasn't shown signs of deflation there. And even if we see some modest additional deflation in proteins, we feel very good about our ability to continue to drive our strong results. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. \nJeffrey Bernstein : Great. Two questions. The first one, just on the follow-up for the total case growth. I know we dissected and the independents were better and the chains were worse. But in total, I guess, a little bit of a slowdown. I'm just wondering whether there's a concern of a slowing macro or maybe what your expectation is for the back half total case growth within your updated '23 guidance. I mean, Dave, you mentioned the upper -- or Dirk, you mentioned the upper end of earnings guidance of the macro holds. I'm just wondering what that assumes for total case growth for the second half or the full year? \nDavid Flitman : Yes, I appreciate the questions. I would point to the comments I made earlier around the stability in the independent space and the health of the operator holding up quite well, particularly as we put the calendar here into the early part of the third quarter. Importantly, our ability to continue to take share. I'm getting nothing but more confident around that, given the strength of our team, our ability to lean in, in a local market basis and provide the best value and product offerings and really understand where we can target those independents. That continues to get very, very strong. All that's contemplated in our back half outlook. So we would say we're in a very stable environment, and we will continue to take share there. I already commented on the chain space and our focus there. Dirk? \nDirk Locascio : And you just come back to Dave's comments that he made in his prepared remarks just around the lapping of Omicron. I mean that is 200 basis points or 300 basis points across much of the business. And so when you think of Q2 being a very normalized environment, I think the business is still growing at 3%. When you have a lot of businesses that are really going backwards pretty meaningfully. And the fact that we are growing much faster than that in these target customer types, which are more value-added, more profitable, et cetera, that Dave said we feel very good about. So where we are, what we saw in July and the stability of the overall macro. \nJeffrey Bernstein : Understood. And a follow-up just on the EBITDA margins. I know you talked about the 60 basis points of expansion to the 4.8%. I think you previously noted that for full year '24, so a year from now, you would hope to get back to at least 4.6%, which was pre-COVID levels. I know the seasonality at play and it's difficult to compare the second quarter of this year to kind of a full year guidance for next year. But Dave, if you were just taking a step back, I mean, how do you assess the ultimate potential for those margins over time? Whether you look at comparable peers or whether you're looking at historical trends, just trying to get a sense because, again, at least this quarter, you're already above kind of that pre-COVID level, again, stripping out seasonality, but just your thoughts on the EBITDA margin going forward. \nDavid Flitman : I feel good about our ability to control what we can control, not so much concern to your point around what our peers are doing, but what we're doing inside our company. And as you've heard Dirk say here a couple of times this morning, we're focused on initiatives and things that we can control, and we think there's still a lot of juice in the squeeze. And so I'm feeling increasingly positive about my comments last quarter around our ability to deliver against that $1.7 billion plus or minus in 2024. And obviously, we'll have to say about that as we get further into the year and provide guidance for next year. But nothing gives me a reason to pause. I have just continued to gain confidence around our ability to execute and ramp up both our growth and profitability. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania from BMO Capital Markets. \nKelly Bania : I just wanted to talk about EBITDA margins. I guess, historically, your second half EBITDA margins in total are a little stronger than your first half, but your guidance, I think, seems to imply a little bit of the opposite, maybe a little bit lower in the second half. So just curious if you can talk about how much of that is conservatism or other factors that might be impacting the margins in the second half or any change in maybe seasonality that we should be thinking about as we think about the second half? \nDirk Locascio : Sure. Kelly, this is Dirk. So overall, pleased with the progress we've made on the overall margins. I think as we think about the outlook for the year, even what's embedded in there, especially in my commentary about the higher end that includes being in a normalized environment, a pretty healthy EBITDA growth rate still in the second half of the year of high single to low double digits. So I feel good about ability there. I'm not going to comment on specifics within the different lines. But what we do expect is we do expect to continue to still make progress on our EBITDA margins. And I think there's still, as Dave commented, plenty of opportunity ahead. We feel good about where we stand at the halfway point and our outlook for the balance of the year. \nKelly Bania : Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just to follow up. I don't think we have your sales outlook for this year or have had that. But I guess, just curious if or to what magnitude deflation has impacted the outlook for this year and next? Or is that really was already in your expectation for the year? Or if you kind of had to internally make any changes to your outlook given kind of where food pricing is? Help us kind of understand how that evolved into your expectations for this year and next? \nDavid Flitman : Sure. I think that just because inflation and deflation have been harder to predict. So it may impact the sales dollars, but it doesn't really impact overall given it's come primarily in the protein categories our strategy and what we've executed against. So there's not been a whole lot we've had to adjust. What we are focused on, as you know, is really the case growth and the strong case growth that we have and continue to have across the business. I think that we do watch the different categories very closely and where we may see inflation and deflation is showing up. But in the current environment, we're going to stay the course and we think that will generate the continued momentum that you've seen over the last four or five quarters. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. \nJohn Heinbockel : I wanted to start with the broadline independent growth, right? If you think about growth in distribution points, right, growth in locations served versus drop size. I'm curious how they relate to each other? Which one is bigger? And then maybe, Dave, your thought on wallet share. And we're not giving numbers, I guess, but thoughts on how high is up? Because it still seems that for you and others, it's way too low versus what it should be. \nDirk Locascio : Yes. John, we feel good about it, again, with the backdrop of the health of the operator that I mentioned earlier. Our ability to take share is strong. I'm pleased with our rate currently of new account generation. But I do believe there's an ample opportunity for us to continue to penetrate our existing customers while we're bringing on new ones. And then ramp up the penetration of those new customers through the course of time. Our team gets that algorithm very, very well and is extremely focused on it. And in the quarter, I would say the new account generation was a bit stronger in that penetration to the first part of your question, but we're squarely focused on both and have a lot of confidence in both going forward. \nJohn Heinbockel : And then maybe a totally different topic. Obviously, gross margin was healthy when we had inflation, it should be also right healthy with deflation. But if I look at the vendor management or procurement that set of opportunities versus mix, both product and customer, which one do you think is bigger, let's say, looking out 12 to 18 months, is not vendor management piece larger? Or you think they're equally sized? \nDavid Flitman : I'm not sure I've given not to either one of those at this point. To your point, John, we've got a lot of activity going on in both areas and there's still a lot of room for improvement in both. \nDirk Locascio : And I think, John, if you think about -- you think of both really a continuous journey. And that's -- when you think about the customer mix piece, that's why we have relentlessly been focused on outgrowing with these target customer types because of the value add. And we think we can bring the overall profitability mix that comes with that. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. \nJohn Ivankoe : I know in previous calls, we've kind of talked about maybe some opportunities around indirect spend, low-hanging fruit, I think maybe some unaddressed previously was previously used. Where are we in that journey? I guess how much is kind of showing up that you actually might want to consider? And is this just maybe getting more out of your current spend? Or is actually reducing total dollar spend part of the opportunity? \nDirk Locascio : John, Dirk. Thanks for the question. So it really is -- we've progressed where we've now identified a number of opportunities. We've begun to go after them. Expect to see some modest dollars show up later this year and then ramp up over the course of next year. So good progress since we talked about it last quarter and it really is a lot about optimizing our current spend. And so in these cases, as you've heard us talk about, we're targeting typically trying to offset our cost inflation as much as we can with productivity. And this would be one of those levers as we try to do that. So good progress and we think there's plenty of opportunity ahead. \nJohn Ivankoe : And Dave, from your perspective as you've kind of come in and have kind of seen the way that US Foods was previously structured? Are there any kind of thoughts that are emerging, the longer that you get on -- spend time in the seat or just maybe things other than just some of the regional structures that you've done and things that can be differently? And your continued exposure to the CHEF'STORE, is that a business that we should expect increased capital and over time? Or is that under evaluation? \nDavid Flitman : Yes. So I feel very good about the momentum that we've got. CHEF'STORE. I'll just take that one quickly. Obviously, the complication around the systems conversion that we've had here has made it a little difficult to get a handle on underlying volumes and those sort of things. Still believe very much in the value of the business case and the synergies with broadline and we'll be looking as we get the system stuff behind us to get the right data leakage to prove that to ourselves. But opportunistically, going forward, as I've said last quarter, I see a lot of opportunity really in all areas of the P&L. Importantly, I'd point you to what I said last quarter, is that we ramp up this thinking around continuous improvement in productivity and efficiency in that 3% to 5% range. We'll have more to say about that. But as Dirk just highlighted, the intent to offset inflation by getting more efficient and productive every year is a constant theme that you will see us talk about here going forward in the business. And I believe that's a fairly significant change in the organizational thought process here. But more to come on that in the future. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Slagle from Jefferies. \nAlex Slagle : Just a couple of follow-up questions. One, I wonder if you could clarify how the new routing software benefit to come, I guess, in '24? Is that already contemplated in your views of being able to get toward that previous $1.7 billion EBITDA target for '24? Or could there be upside relative to that or related to this? \nDavid Flitman : Yes, there always could be upside, but that was contemplated as part of the long-range plan when the company put that out in the $1.7 billion target for next year. \nAlex Slagle : Got you. And on turnover and retention, I guess any additional color there on the progress through the 2Q, I guess, driver turnover you've gotten that back toward '19 levels already and warehouse turnover was still above. But maybe just some updates on how far you've gotten, where that goes next? \nDavid Flitman : Really good progress in both areas. The turnover in the warehouse and on the outbound side continues to persist a little stronger than delivery. To your point, we're not quite back to where we hope to be at this point in 2019 levels. However, we've got three quarters in a row now of continued reduction in turnover and improvement in productivity, both in delivery and warehouse and to our discussions around things like our flexible scheduling initiative and the significant ramp-up that we've got on that in the back half of the year being in more than half of our markets after this pilot phase here in the first half gives me a lot of confidence that we will continue to drive significant improvement there and at getting back to where we hope to be. So really good momentum and more to come. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Wolf from CL King. \nAndrew Wolf : Taking the -- the market share you're taking with independents, what are you facing that -- could you share with us what your belief is the independent sector for foodservice distribution is growing or not growing? Like what are you comparing that to? \nDirk Locascio : Sure. Andrew, this is Dirk. So as we've talked about it externally, we relative to Technomic because that's what you guys and many other investors have more access to. Internally, we use -- on a month-to-month basis, we use an NPD data set because it's much more granular and actionable. And so when we talk about the share gains, on a regular quarterly basis, that's using NPD data. So 80% or 90% of the industry provides them. So we're seeing share gains using that. So it's an independent, they measure everybody the same and please to have followed that. If you look at Technomic, that Dave said, the Technomic outlook, I believe, for this year calls for independents to be down a couple of percent, and I think change to be flattish kind of overall restaurant yourself. So if you think of where we are relative to that of the strong independents continuing to grow at 5% to 6%. And again, then in chain a little bit slower. But again, that hasn't been our focus. And we will take all day continuing to grow at a much faster pace with independent healthcare and hospitality, and that remains the focus. \nAndrew Wolf : Okay. On your sales associates, obviously, with an increase in -- they're selling more, they're going to make more money. But could you talk about sales product -- the associate sales associate productivity versus hiring new folks as the driver of the market share. \nDirk Locascio : So overall, the way we think about it when we look at market share, it's overall just how we're doing in markets, how we're doing by categories, how are we doing by restaurant types. And then underneath there, there's -- as you expect, there would be -- we have a performance management process of how individual sales reps are performing. But in parallel, we do continue to actively hire especially in those markets that are growing at a faster rate. So it really is a blend. And as we think about share gains, we expect that to be driven by both performance management, but definitely on continued adding of sellers in those markets that are growing faster. \nAndrew Wolf : Okay. Well, I guess more of the same and it's working right now. And lastly, following up on your lower cost per case and distribution. That includes fuel and mileage, right? So as we unpack different things, we look at from the warehouse to delivery, it sounds like it would be more on the delivery side, given some of the progress you're already making on the routing, some income on bringing stuff back and obviously, fuel. Is that -- on a dollar basis, is that the way to think about where most of this better results are coming versus not incrementally just sort of like for the quarter? \nDirk Locascio : I'll come back to where Dave talked about earlier in his comments on this is, while we're pleased with this, we're seeing productivity improvement in both warehouse and delivery. So they're both contributors. They each have impacts on, yes, on fuel, on routing, et cetera, and they each contribute. So without parsing out the individual, I think the more important takeaway is when we think upstream on the retention of the turnover, et cetera, seeing the improvement, and that's leading to overall lower cost per case and that's demonstrating what we're doing is working, and we expect to do more of that. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Jake Bartlett from Truist Securities. \nJake Bartlett : My question is about gross profit per case and the ability to maintain that. And you understand that protein in center-of-the-plate are generally priced on a dollar markup, so the deflation doesn't impact it. But my question is whether that could allow for greater price competition? So it seems to be the biggest risk is that competitors try to drive business more with price than service levels as they have over the last few years. So how would you assess that risk? Are you seeing any kind of more aggressive pricing out there? How do you expect to approach pricing going forward? \nDavid Flitman : Overall, we feel good about the durability of our gross profit. I think for the last few quarters, we've been asked how we thought we would fare with lapping large inflation a year ago. And hopefully, what people have seen as we've demonstrated still strong gross profit results despite that. And that comes back to the focus we've had on our own execution of initiatives driving the results that we're seeing. I think that from a macro and competitive environment, it continues to be stable. It's really back to a pre-proven world where it's a competitive industry. And that's where we operate in, but we haven't seen a level of irrationality that any different than you would see in a normal environment. So quite healthy and we expect to continue with strong gross profit, driving solid very good EBITDA growth. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh from BTIG. \nPeter Saleh : Great. I just wanted to come back to the CHEF'STORE conversion issue. Can you just elaborate on what that system issue was? And is the 70 basis point impact fully consigned to the second quarter? Or do you think any of that will bleed into 3Q? \nDirk Locascio : Peter, this is Dirk. So overall, we think through there is we had to convert off of a system under a new system by earlier this year as part of our purchase agreement, which we did. So all markets are converted. And it's not uncommon, unfortunately, for -- when you have conversions of this magnitude to have some challenges, which we did see. Let me just put it into context. So when we talk about some sales challenges there, it's down low single digits. But when you compare that to independents that are in the broadline are up 5.5%, it has a more meaningful impact there. And some of the challenges there were around us we do conversions resulted in issues where orders weren't fully going through, et cetera. So we had less product on shelves, et cetera. That's all been remediated. It has been for a few months, and we've been focusing on continuing to get customers back in the store to recoup that and do expect to get back to growth in the second half of the year. \nPeter Saleh : Great. And then just on the leverage being around 3x. Currently, how are you thinking about capital allocation kind of going forward? Is it more debt pay down? Or do you think you'll shift a little bit more to share repurchase at this point in time as EBITDA continues to grow and the leverage kind of comes down naturally? \nDirk Locascio : Well, I expect -- as you know, Dave's comments that we did close early in the third quarter on the Renzi Foodservice acquisition. So that is a Q3 use. And then on top of that, I do expect for the near term, a continued balance of debt pay down and share repurchase. We think both are important, and we're going to continue to focus on. I think the good working capital performance this year as the team service levels have improved. Our teams have very methodically gone through and found those opportunities to remove some of the added stock we added when vendor service levels were lower, while still focus on maintaining high customer service levels that's allowed us to generate the even stronger working capital numbers this year, which has helped with the funding of the acquisition, et cetera. So to directly answer your question, I have to, I expect it to be balanced, but you will see our first tuck-in M&A, which we're excited about. \nOperator: And we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Dave Flitman for some final closing remarks. \nDavid Flitman : Thank you all very much for joining us today. Our business is strong, and I have great confidence in our ability to accelerate our momentum. Have a great day. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Dirk Locascio",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 9. We are very pleased with what we accomplished in the second quarter and the strong momentum we continue to have at US Foods. Adjusted EBITDA grew $64 million or 17% from the prior year to $432 million, which was a record quarter for US Foods. In addition to strong EBITDA dollars, we expanded our adjusted EBITDA margin 60 basis points from the prior year as our gross profit grew significantly more than OpEx. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 18%, which is also a record.  Within our results, net sales were $9 billion in the second quarter, an increase of 2.1% over the prior year. Total case volume increased 2.7%, partially offset by year-over-year food cost deflation and product mix impact of 0.6%. As Dave mentioned, case growth was healthy overall and especially in our target customer types. Case growth slowed from the first quarter, largely as expected, since we no longer had a year-over-year benefit from Omicron lapping in the second quarter. We faced a headwind to case growth in the second quarter, primarily from a system conversion at CHEF'STORE. However, we have largely worked through it at this point and are seeing sales improve. We are pleased with the 5.5% broadline independent case growth.  We did see modest year-over-year product cost deflation, and it was driven by center of the plate as groceries still showed year-over-year inflation in the quarter. Essentially, we had no sequential inflation and still are not seeing deflation in grocery categories, which is encouraging. Since grocery categories are predominantly a percent markup and more impacted by deflation compared to center-of-the-plate categories, which are largely fixed markups and not as impacted by deflation.  We continued our strong gross profit performance this quarter as our adjusted gross profit dollars increased 9% from the prior year. Most of the strength is due to the excellent progress we have made over the past year on our long-range plan initiatives across cost of goods, logistics management and pricing. Our initiatives have been critical in mitigating the increased operating cost we and the broader industry have faced.  OpEx was above the prior year for the second quarter, albeit significantly less than the increases we saw in the past two years. The second quarter year-over-year increase in OpEx per case was largely driven by increased seller compensation and higher incentive compensation costs as distribution cost per case was better than the prior year.  We continued our progress against both the growth and profit pillars, and I'll spend a few minutes on each of these. We are focused on profitable growth and share gains in our target customer types, by leveraging our differentiated service model, digital capabilities and unique products. We are on track to exceed our 1.5x goal for restaurant volume growth for the full year led by strong independent case growth.  In the second quarter, we drove year-over-year share gains in each of our target customer types and continue to develop a strong healthcare and hospitality new business pipeline. As Dave mentioned, this was our ninth quarter in a row of independent share gains. As we grow faster with our target customer types, it helps our customer mix and drives profitability.  Next to profit on Slide 11. In addition to profitable growth, we continue to make progress on our initiatives to increase EBITDA margins. Our team effectively managed a relatively volatile quarter for commodity categories as we leverage our processes and maintain our strong gross profit per case. At the same time, we further progress on initiatives such as cost of goods or COGS improvement by working jointly with additional vendors. We remain on track to address a total of 60% of COGS by the end of fiscal 2023. We continue to advance our efforts to drive operational efficiencies as productivity improved year-over-year and sequentially for both delivering warehouse.  Our flex schedule and pilots are progressing well and demonstrating good results. This powerful initiative has a twofold impact. It gives associates more scheduled flexibility and provides US Foods with better associate engagement and retention. Ultimately, this adds up to a win for our customers through stronger service.  Finally, we are progressing with our indirect procurement work and have identified a number of opportunities, which we are pursuing and will ramp up further value creation in 2024. I'm now going to pivot from earnings to cash flow.  Turning to Slide 12. We continue to increase our strong cash flow and expect to build upon this as we grow earnings. Our strong cash flow allows us to continue reinvesting for growth and to further strengthen our capital structure. We have and will continue to prudently allocate capital against our core priorities to invest in the business, reduce leverage return capital to shareholders and pursue accretive tuck-in M&A to strategically expand our distribution network.  Year-to-date, we have invested approximately $200 million of cash CapEx and fleet leases, including projects to expand fleet, improved analytic insights and improved technology and supply chain and sales to enable further organic growth. I'll talk further in a moment on reducing leverage. In parallel with the debt reduction, we repurchased $166 million of shares in the second quarter, $150 million of which came from the KKR stock sale. Following this repurchase, we have $286 million remaining on our $500 million share repurchase program.  In early July, we completed the acquisition of Renzi Foodservice, and are excited to welcome the Renzi team to the US Foods family. This is our first tuck-in acquisition since 2017, and we are thrilled about the quality of this business and associates.  Moving to Slide 13. We meaningfully reduced our net leverage compared to year-end 2022 through a combination of net debt reduction and earnings growth. You can also see on the slide the significant progress over the past 12 months. Our net leverage ratio was 3x at the end of the second quarter, which is the top end of our target leverage range.  We continue to prioritize debt paydown and prepaid an additional $60 million of term loan in the second quarter, bringing us to $125 million of prepayment year-to-date. Our overall debt structure is in good shape if we don't have any maturities until 2025. That said, we're looking ahead to the 2025 maturity and expect to proactively address that in the next quarter or two.  Actions this quarter resulted in credit upgrades from both rating agencies. We remain focused on creating value for shareholders and allocating our capital prudently across the four parts of our capital allocation strategy.  Now turning to guidance on Slide 14. As a result of our strong year-to-date results and outlook for the full year, we are raising our full year adjusted EBITDA range to $1.51 billion to $1.54 billion and our adjusted diluted EPS range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share. We remain on track to reduce leverage to below 3x by the end of the year.  We are well positioned to deliver against this guidance and expect to be at the higher end of the earnings guidance if the macro remains similar to what we're seeing currently.  With that, I'll pass it back to Dave for his closing remarks. Mark, this is Dirk. So overall, the inflation deflation picture was pretty similar across the quarter. So you saw it changing really as you were lapping prior year. But if I think of it through the quarter, grocery overall still continued to see for the quarter a little bit of inflation. So we still haven't seen deflation popping up there. And in the proteins, a lot of that is coming from the lapping of much more inflation a year ago. And as I said in my prepared comments, we'll take that because those tend to be more fixed markups and our teams have very good processes to manage through it. So even in this environment of very little inflation or modest deflation, we think we're very well positioned to manage through it. And as you've heard me say a number of times, as we focus on controlling the controllable, gross profit -- the strong gross profit growth we driven is really predominantly been from a number of the initiatives we've executed. And the only thing I would add is, in the quarter, as I commented, overall distribution cost per case was lower than it was a year ago. And the two areas that really drove our increase were seller compensation, which is driven by the strong gross profit results we've had. And then secondly, incentive compensation, which is a good place you're going to have higher costs because it drives team to continue to perform at a stronger level. So we feel, as Dave said, very good about the progress and the path ahead and our ability to effectively manage costs and gain leverage. I think, Brian, hopefully what you continue to see here in the second quarter is in a pretty normalized operating environment has recovered. The fact that our overall independent is still growing at 5.5% in the broadline which, as I said in the first quarter call, we think sort of in the mid-5s, that's a very strong case growth. We're taking share. Healthcare and hospitality is not by chance that we're growing still at 7%, well above market. And so those are the things that we're going to continue to control the controllables despite the macro backdrop, we feel good about where we stand and our outlook. And you just come back to Dave's comments that he made in his prepared remarks just around the lapping of Omicron. I mean that is 200 basis points or 300 basis points across much of the business. And so when you think of Q2 being a very normalized environment, I think the business is still growing at 3%. When you have a lot of businesses that are really going backwards pretty meaningfully. And the fact that we are growing much faster than that in these target customer types, which are more value-added, more profitable, et cetera, that Dave said we feel very good about. So where we are, what we saw in July and the stability of the overall macro. Sure. Kelly, this is Dirk. So overall, pleased with the progress we've made on the overall margins. I think as we think about the outlook for the year, even what's embedded in there, especially in my commentary about the higher end that includes being in a normalized environment, a pretty healthy EBITDA growth rate still in the second half of the year of high single to low double digits. So I feel good about ability there. I'm not going to comment on specifics within the different lines. But what we do expect is we do expect to continue to still make progress on our EBITDA margins. And I think there's still, as Dave commented, plenty of opportunity ahead. We feel good about where we stand at the halfway point and our outlook for the balance of the year. Yes. John, we feel good about it, again, with the backdrop of the health of the operator that I mentioned earlier. Our ability to take share is strong. I'm pleased with our rate currently of new account generation. But I do believe there's an ample opportunity for us to continue to penetrate our existing customers while we're bringing on new ones. And then ramp up the penetration of those new customers through the course of time. Our team gets that algorithm very, very well and is extremely focused on it. And in the quarter, I would say the new account generation was a bit stronger in that penetration to the first part of your question, but we're squarely focused on both and have a lot of confidence in both going forward. And I think, John, if you think about -- you think of both really a continuous journey. And that's -- when you think about the customer mix piece, that's why we have relentlessly been focused on outgrowing with these target customer types because of the value add. And we think we can bring the overall profitability mix that comes with that. John, Dirk. Thanks for the question. So it really is -- we've progressed where we've now identified a number of opportunities. We've begun to go after them. Expect to see some modest dollars show up later this year and then ramp up over the course of next year. So good progress since we talked about it last quarter and it really is a lot about optimizing our current spend. And so in these cases, as you've heard us talk about, we're targeting typically trying to offset our cost inflation as much as we can with productivity. And this would be one of those levers as we try to do that. So good progress and we think there's plenty of opportunity ahead. Sure. Andrew, this is Dirk. So as we've talked about it externally, we relative to Technomic because that's what you guys and many other investors have more access to. Internally, we use -- on a month-to-month basis, we use an NPD data set because it's much more granular and actionable. And so when we talk about the share gains, on a regular quarterly basis, that's using NPD data. So 80% or 90% of the industry provides them. So we're seeing share gains using that. So it's an independent, they measure everybody the same and please to have followed that. If you look at Technomic, that Dave said, the Technomic outlook, I believe, for this year calls for independents to be down a couple of percent, and I think change to be flattish kind of overall restaurant yourself. So if you think of where we are relative to that of the strong independents continuing to grow at 5% to 6%. And again, then in chain a little bit slower. But again, that hasn't been our focus. And we will take all day continuing to grow at a much faster pace with independent healthcare and hospitality, and that remains the focus. So overall, the way we think about it when we look at market share, it's overall just how we're doing in markets, how we're doing by categories, how are we doing by restaurant types. And then underneath there, there's -- as you expect, there would be -- we have a performance management process of how individual sales reps are performing. But in parallel, we do continue to actively hire especially in those markets that are growing at a faster rate. So it really is a blend. And as we think about share gains, we expect that to be driven by both performance management, but definitely on continued adding of sellers in those markets that are growing faster. I'll come back to where Dave talked about earlier in his comments on this is, while we're pleased with this, we're seeing productivity improvement in both warehouse and delivery. So they're both contributors. They each have impacts on, yes, on fuel, on routing, et cetera, and they each contribute. So without parsing out the individual, I think the more important takeaway is when we think upstream on the retention of the turnover, et cetera, seeing the improvement, and that's leading to overall lower cost per case and that's demonstrating what we're doing is working, and we expect to do more of that. Peter, this is Dirk. So overall, we think through there is we had to convert off of a system under a new system by earlier this year as part of our purchase agreement, which we did. So all markets are converted. And it's not uncommon, unfortunately, for -- when you have conversions of this magnitude to have some challenges, which we did see. Let me just put it into context.

            "name": "David Flitman",
            "content": "Thanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. It's hard to believe that I've already been at US Foods for seven months. During this time, I have continued my focused effort to get deeper into the business and interact with more of our associates, customers, suppliers and investors. I'll start today by sharing highlights for the quarter and progress against our strategy and long-range plan before I hand it over to Dirk to review our financial results and updated fiscal 2023 guidance.  We remain intensely focused on executing our long-range plan, and it showed in our strong financial results again this quarter as we delivered record adjusted EBITDA of $432 million. We achieved 17% adjusted EBITDA growth through a combination of profitable volume growth and margin expansion. Additionally, we delivered healthy total case growth of 3%, led by 5% independent case growth, underpinned by 5.5% growth with broadline independent restaurant customers, along with 7% healthcare and hospitality growth. This is the ninth consecutive quarter our team has gained independent market share.  Finally, we accelerated cash flow generation through our earnings growth and working capital improvement. Our strong cash flow year-to-date has allowed us to invest in the business for organic growth, prepay additional term loan debt and return capital to shareholders via share repurchases. As a result of our strong performance for the first half of the fiscal year and continued momentum, we are increasing our full year earnings guidance, which Dirk will share leader. My expectation is that we will continue to execute our plan and build upon our strong momentum.  Now let's turn to Slide 4. Our strategy guides how we operate and what we focus on to win at US Foods under our four pillars of culture, service, growth and profit. Last quarter, I introduced the simplified model, which is much clearer for our associates, so we can be more action and outcome-oriented across the company. These changes are resonating with our organization and are helping us remain focused, which contributed to our strong second quarter results. The other key change I made was to our organizational structure, bringing our four region presidents on to my management team, and that change has been outstanding. Having them at the table has improved communication between our functions in the field and streamlined our decision-making regarding execution of our broader strategy. I'm going to briefly focus on second quarter progress points against the culture and service pillars, and then Dirk will talk about the growth and profit pillars later.  Turning to Slide 5. The first pillar is culture because our culture and our people fuel our strategy. Instilling a stronger safety culture has been a focus since the day I arrived at US Foods. I am pleased to say that we have made very good progress in just seven months. Our second quarter year-over-year results improved approximately 20% compared to the prior year through a combination of tone from the top and focused programs to drive results. We have good early momentum with significant opportunity remaining.  On a related note, I would like to recognize the 13 US Foods drivers who were recently named to the International Foodservice Distributors Association Truck Driver Hall of Fame. This prestigious accolade is only awarded to those who have exceptional safety records, including 25 years of service without an accident. What makes this year even more special is that Alicia Seyler, one of our drivers based in Loveland, Colorado, with 27 years of service was the first-ever female driver elected to the IFDA Hall of Fame. We are proud to have these world-class drivers dedicated to safety at US Foods as we strive to provide our associates, customers, business partners and the communities we operate in with a safe and hazard-free environment.  Additionally, we recently published our 2022 Corporate Social Responsibility Report and I am proud that we have made continued improvement across our three focus areas of people, product and planet. I encourage you to go to our website to read about our progress from our sustainable products, the US Foods scholar program to our compressed natural gas trucks and Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction.  Moving to service on Slide 6. As a reminder, our research tells us that the most important services to our customers are on time, correct orders and high-quality fresh products. Our product service levels to our customers are back in line with pre-COVID levels. Vendor service levels to US Foods have also steadily improved. However, they remain slightly below pre-COVID levels. This progress is yielding positive results from a service level perspective and is also helping us reduce our working capital.  Our routing initiative continues to make progress. And in the second quarter, we delivered the best cases per mile metric in the last three years. We are also preparing for a pilot of our new routing software later this year, which will significantly increase our capabilities. I look forward to our learnings and the progress we will continue to make.  Finally, MOXe\u0304, our digital customer platform has now been fully rolled out among our local customers and feedback continues to be very positive as are our Net Promoter Score results.  Turning to Slide 7. I'll walk through our second quarter highlights in a bit more detail. We grew adjusted EBITDA by 17% despite essentially no sequential inflation and, in fact, modest year-over-year product cost deflation, driven by center-of-the-plate categories. Our adjusted EBITDA margins also increased 60 basis points from the prior year as our initiatives continue to ramp up, and we gained operating leverage this quarter. Year-over-year, total case volume growth was healthy at 3%. Case growth was led by 5% growth in independent restaurants and 7% growth in both healthcare and hospitality while chain cases were down 4%.  Our independent case growth was negatively impacted about 70 basis points from slower growth in our CHEF'STOREs as we work through a systems conversion which is largely behind us now. This means our broadline independent customer case growth was 5.5% for the quarter. The software chain results this quarter are primarily due to no longer lapping Omicron, the softer macro and the impact on same-store sales across most of our chain customers.  Healthcare and hospitality continues to demonstrate strong growth, driven in large part by helping net new business. We are pleased with how our target customer types continue to outperform the industry, resulting in share gains. With that said, we still have opportunity to improve performance as we focus on more consistent execution. We have good momentum and expected to further accelerate.  Moving to our customer experience. We, again, gained year-over-year market share in our target customer types as we remain focused on executing our differentiated strategy. For independence, this is the ninth consecutive quarter of share gains, which demonstrates the progress we continue to make. I am happy to report that MOXe\u0304 is fully rolled out to our local customers, reactions continue to be very positive, and we are releasing regular updates based on customer and seller feedback to improve this industry-leading platform. We are now beginning to roll out MOXe\u0304 to our national customers.  This platform, combined with our other leading digital tools and service model will enable us to continue to service our national customers well and build it and convert a strong new business pipeline, especially in our target customer types. We also actively expanded customer usage of VITALS, our technology suite for healthcare customers to leverage added capabilities and help our customers more effectively manage their overall costs.  Very importantly, we continue to make progress on our supply chain excellence journey during the second quarter. In addition to our improved momentum in safety, our productivity performance also improved year-over-year and sequentially for both delivery and warehouse, which is very encouraging. I am pleased with the progress we are making and expect us to further accelerate that progress in the back half of this year and into 2024.  Our flexible scheduling and seven-day delivery pilots are progressing well, demonstrating results in line with our expectations, including a double-digit percent reduction in turnover in each of our pilot markets. As I called out last quarter, our near-term focus will be to expand flexible scheduling broadly.  We only roll out seven-day delivery opportunistically where capacity is constrained. Our team is actively working to expand the flex scheduling approach and we expect to have more than half of our locations live on flex scheduling by year-end, which we believe will further improve associate satisfaction and retention.  Finally, we continue to strengthen our capital structure and prudently allocate capital to fuel long-term growth. Through earnings growth and additional debt reduction, we lowered our net leverage to 3x, which is the first time we've been in our target range since it was established. Our debt ratings were upgraded by both rating agencies, demonstrating our strong progress and underlying business momentum.  In parallel to the continued leverage reduction, we spent $166 million on share repurchases. Shortly after the end of the quarter, we closed on our first tuck-in acquisition in six years, Renzi Foodservice. As part of our continued investment in Renzi, we are slated to break ground on the expansion of our Renzi distribution center this month, which includes approximately 10,000 square feet of construction, providing additional loading dock space for 8 new refrigerated loading base to support our growing customer base in the area. We are excited to welcome the Renzi associates, and I look forward to working closely with this high-quality team to drive future growth.  Each of the actions we've taken on deploying capital in a balanced manner reinforces our commitment to being responsible stewards of capital to drive long-term shareholder value creation.  With that, I'll hand it over to Dirk to go over our financial performance and guidance in further detail. Thanks, Dirk. I will close where I started. Seven months into my role, I couldn't be more excited about US Foods and the opportunity ahead for our business.  Slide 15 summarizes our investment thesis and why I am so bullish. US Foods is a strong company, and we continue to get stronger. We are a leader in a highly fragmented industry in a pure-play U.S.-only based distributor focused on broadline distribution. Our business is resilient across various macro backdrops and US Foods offers further stability through our laser focus on controlling the controllables and executing against our long-range plan.  We are targeting independents, healthcare and hospitality for growth where we believe our differentiation adds even more value and we are seeing the results in our outsized growth and continued share gains. This progress has been driven by the quality of our strong team, our service model and our digital capabilities, including MOXe\u0304. I believe these are all compelling reasons to invest in US Foods. We are focused on building on the company's core strengths while finding ways to more effectively execute our strategy and accelerate our rate of improvement.  I am confident this combination will lead to a very bright future for US Foods and all of our stakeholders.  Finally, I would like to thank our 29,000 associates for their continued dedication and the excellent work they do each day to help our customers make it. Our associates are critical to our success which underscores why you matter is a very important one of our cultural beliefs.  With that, Rob, please open up the call for questions. Yes, I appreciate the question, Mark. We are seeing strong health of the operator and independents. And if you recall, I mean, we were expecting the performance that we had in the second quarter. If you recall, we had the Omicron lap go away here in the second quarter. And as we provided color last quarter, we saw some softness in the March that led into April. May and June got sequentially stronger. And while we don't give quarterly guidance, I can tell you the start to the third quarter has been at or slightly above what we saw exiting the second quarter trajectory. So we feel very good about the health of the operator, but more importantly, our ability based on our differentiation to continue to take share in that segment of the business. And then besides that, healthcare and hospitality remained very, very strong. We're taking share in both of them, and we have very strong pipelines across the board. Yes. I appreciate the question. I'll start at the higher level and give Dirk a chance to win in any of the specifics. But as we've said the last couple of quarters, we feel very good about the momentum we're getting on productivity, both in our warehouse and delivery. And you heard me say on the call there, we had sequential improvement as well as year-over-year improvement in both. And so the initiatives we're driving, we're very excited about. We expect those to continue to get traction in the back half of this year. And I would point out to your point, this is five or six quarters in a row where our operating expense growth that continues to decline. And that's based in large part by the good work our team is doing, particularly in supply chain. Sure. Good question. So for the second quarter, adjusted gross profit dollars were up about 9%. So pleased with that. And I think the -- if I think of the year-over-year, you may see some lesser year-over-year increases just because we've had such strong gains as we're lapping those. We get to your point, get back to a more normalized environment, but continue to feel very good about the durability and strength of our gross profit per case. And I think the way we continue to look at it is there's not an end. We're going to continue to focus on the gross profit gains. And our goal here is to continue to run the play to pro gross profit faster to OpEx to drive margin because as you know, our overall EBITDA growth is a balance of profitable growth, especially in those target customer types. And we think we have -- we're happy with the progress we've made and we have a lot of runway ahead. Yes, I'll take you back, Brian -- good question. I'll take you back to some of the commentary we had in the last quarter. And if you recall, one of the things I said when we were down a little bit less than the market was don't read too much into that. It has in large part to do with the portfolio change each of the competition has, number one.  Number two, we weren't surprised at all because of the lapping of the Omicron effect that we pointed to in the first quarter. And then the second thing is the backdrop within the chain segment has gotten softer as the year has progressed. I'd point to two things. One is the Technomic data that said the change, we're going to be up about 200 basis points back in January. They adjusted that to flat for the year in May. And then the recent Black Box data had the second quarter for changes down anywhere between 2% and 3%. And I think they pointed to about 2.7% in July. So it's really a traffic issue in chains. And as you point out, that's not our focus. We're going to be opportunistic on change, and we're going to lean in hard on healthcare, hospitality independents and continue to run our playbook. Sure. Maybe I'll take them in reverse. So LIFO is hard to predict based on deflation or inflation, what happens there. I mean, I'll remind you that the way we reported adjusted, it's backed out of there. So that is not a help for us in our adjusted EBITDA numbers. It does help in our overall GAAP numbers. And the second part is the -- in the second half year, yes, it was pretty stable in the second quarter. I think in the second half of the year if we continue to see some deflation at this point based on what we're seeing. I expect it to be -- continue to be driven primarily by the center-of-the-plate categories. As grocery, as I mentioned before, still really hasn't shown signs of deflation there. And even if we see some modest additional deflation in proteins, we feel very good about our ability to continue to drive our strong results. Yes, I appreciate the questions. I would point to the comments I made earlier around the stability in the independent space and the health of the operator holding up quite well, particularly as we put the calendar here into the early part of the third quarter. Importantly, our ability to continue to take share. I'm getting nothing but more confident around that, given the strength of our team, our ability to lean in, in a local market basis and provide the best value and product offerings and really understand where we can target those independents. That continues to get very, very strong. All that's contemplated in our back half outlook. So we would say we're in a very stable environment, and we will continue to take share there. I already commented on the chain space and our focus there. Dirk? I feel good about our ability to control what we can control, not so much concern to your point around what our peers are doing, but what we're doing inside our company. And as you've heard Dirk say here a couple of times this morning, we're focused on initiatives and things that we can control, and we think there's still a lot of juice in the squeeze. And so I'm feeling increasingly positive about my comments last quarter around our ability to deliver against that $1.7 billion plus or minus in 2024. And obviously, we'll have to say about that as we get further into the year and provide guidance for next year. But nothing gives me a reason to pause. I have just continued to gain confidence around our ability to execute and ramp up both our growth and profitability. Sure. I think that just because inflation and deflation have been harder to predict. So it may impact the sales dollars, but it doesn't really impact overall given it's come primarily in the protein categories our strategy and what we've executed against. So there's not been a whole lot we've had to adjust. What we are focused on, as you know, is really the case growth and the strong case growth that we have and continue to have across the business. I think that we do watch the different categories very closely and where we may see inflation and deflation is showing up. But in the current environment, we're going to stay the course and we think that will generate the continued momentum that you've seen over the last four or five quarters. I'm not sure I've given not to either one of those at this point. To your point, John, we've got a lot of activity going on in both areas and there's still a lot of room for improvement in both. Yes. So I feel very good about the momentum that we've got. CHEF'STORE. I'll just take that one quickly. Obviously, the complication around the systems conversion that we've had here has made it a little difficult to get a handle on underlying volumes and those sort of things. Still believe very much in the value of the business case and the synergies with broadline and we'll be looking as we get the system stuff behind us to get the right data leakage to prove that to ourselves. But opportunistically, going forward, as I've said last quarter, I see a lot of opportunity really in all areas of the P&L. Importantly, I'd point you to what I said last quarter, is that we ramp up this thinking around continuous improvement in productivity and efficiency in that 3% to 5% range. We'll have more to say about that. But as Dirk just highlighted, the intent to offset inflation by getting more efficient and productive every year is a constant theme that you will see us talk about here going forward in the business. And I believe that's a fairly significant change in the organizational thought process here. But more to come on that in the future. Yes, there always could be upside, but that was contemplated as part of the long-range plan when the company put that out in the $1.7 billion target for next year. Really good progress in both areas. The turnover in the warehouse and on the outbound side continues to persist a little stronger than delivery. To your point, we're not quite back to where we hope to be at this point in 2019 levels. However, we've got three quarters in a row now of continued reduction in turnover and improvement in productivity, both in delivery and warehouse and to our discussions around things like our flexible scheduling initiative and the significant ramp-up that we've got on that in the back half of the year being in more than half of our markets after this pilot phase here in the first half gives me a lot of confidence that we will continue to drive significant improvement there and at getting back to where we hope to be. So really good momentum and more to come. Overall, we feel good about the durability of our gross profit. I think for the last few quarters, we've been asked how we thought we would fare with lapping large inflation a year ago. And hopefully, what people have seen as we've demonstrated still strong gross profit results despite that. And that comes back to the focus we've had on our own execution of initiatives driving the results that we're seeing. I think that from a macro and competitive environment, it continues to be stable. It's really back to a pre-proven world where it's a competitive industry. And that's where we operate in, but we haven't seen a level of irrationality that any different than you would see in a normal environment. So quite healthy and we expect to continue with strong gross profit, driving solid very good EBITDA growth. Thank you all very much for joining us today. Our business is strong, and I have great confidence in our ability to accelerate our momentum. Have a great day."

        "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the US Foods Q1 2023 Quarterly Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. Adam Dabrowski, Director of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nAdam Dabrowski: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to US Foods First Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. Speaking on the call today, we have Dave Flitman, Chief Executive Officer; and Dirk Locascio, Chief Financial Officer. [Operator Instructions]. Our earnings release issued earlier this morning and today's presentation slides can be accessed on the Investor Relations page of our website.  During today's call, unless otherwise stated, we are comparing our first quarter results to the same period in fiscal year 2022. In addition to historical information, certain statements made during today's call are considered forward-looking statements. Please review the risk factors in our 2022 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of these potential factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in those statements. Lastly, during today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. All reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the schedules on our earnings press release as well as in the appendices to the presentation slides posted on our website, except that we are not providing reconciliations to forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures as indicated therein.  Thank you for your interest in US Foods. And I'll now turn over the call to Dave.\nDavid Flitman: Thanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I've been at US Foods now for about 4 months, and I continue to get more excited about our future each day. I'll start by sharing a few highlights from the quarter followed by my vision for the evolution of our company and then we will go deeper into our Q1 financial results.  After a year of strong market share growth and margin expansion, I'm pleased to report that US Foods remains intensely focused on executing our long-range plan, and it showed in our financial results again this quarter. We increased adjusted EBITDA by 40%, expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 80 basis points and drove case growth of 6%, including 8% independent case growth.  We delivered these strong results by profitably growing share, further optimizing gross margins and improving operational efficiencies. We made progress on key initiatives within our long-range plan while taking actions to execute more effectively on fewer but more impactful initiatives. Finally, we prudently allocated capital and continue to invest in the business as we further reduce debt and opportunistically repurchase shares. We have made significant progress against our long-range plan and have strong momentum, thus are reaffirming our full year 2023 guidance. My clear expectation is that we will maintain that momentum throughout 2023 and beyond.  While we continue to produce strong quarterly results, we've also made meaningful strides to enhance our organizational structure, our strategy and culture of our company. Over the last few months, I've continued to spend time on the road, meeting more of our associates in getting deeper into our operations. During my travels, I've also met with many customers, investors and analysts to hear their feedback about US Foods. As a result, I firmly believe that US Foods long-range plan in the areas within it are broadly the right areas of focus to ensure success. I also have seen, however, that improved and focused execution remains a key opportunity for us to accelerate financial and operational results and ultimately provide an even better customer experience. To enable and drive this improvement, I made 2 important changes to the executive leadership team in early April to better connect the field to our process excellence teams. First, Andrew Iacobucci has been promoted to Senior Executive Vice President of Field Operations and Chief Commercial Officer. While this realignment necessitated the exit of a senior executive team member, it underscores the confidence I have in Andrew's leadership. In Andrew's new role, he leads our field operations, merchandising and commercial excellence teams to drive better connectivity of our go-to-market strategy with the P&L owners.  The second change is that our 4 regional presidents, the P&L owners, are now part of my executive leadership team. They now participate directly in all executive team strategy and operating review discussions. This new structure eliminates any potential miscommunication between our field and functional leaders, increases our speed of decision-making and improves our execution through alignment on fewer initiatives that will drive greater business impact. In addition to our structural changes, we have taken steps to further strengthen our culture and provide excellent service to our customers while remaining intensely focused on profitably increasing market share and improving margins. This shows up in a simplified summary of our strategy on Slide 5. These adjustments are more an evolution than a revolution, but it is important to me that our strategy is simple and absolutely clear for all of our associates, so we can be more action and outcome-oriented across the company. I have also asked our leaders to assess how they are spending their time against these 4 pillars. Our Great Food Made Easy strategy defines what we collectively drive to win in the marketplace. As we've said before, we work to exceed expectations and give our customers the competitive edge they need. With our unrivaled portfolio of exclusive brands, our omnichannel offerings and team-based selling approach, we are well positioned to meet our customers' unique needs. And we will lead with fresh and reliable as we see significant growth and wins coming from these areas. It's intentional that our first pillar is culture because our culture and our people fuel our strategy. This pillar includes safety, which is a key area of focus for us that I will speak about in a moment. Fostering an inclusive culture and being a responsible company are also drivers of business performance and important to our associates, communities and the planet. We recently put these words into action at a meeting with our top leaders where we gave back to the community. Together, we assembled 1,000 gardening kits for underserved students in Chicago, who live in food deserts where access to fresh produce is scarce. Our second pillar is service. Our research tells us that the most important services to customers are on time, correct orders and high-quality fresh products. No single food distribution company is a clear leader in all of these areas, which means there is a great opportunity for us to win on service. Our service pillar focuses on reliability, being efficient across our operations from routing to logistics to replenishment and providing the best experiences to customers through our technology and omnichannel offerings.  Our third pillar is growth. We are focused on gaining profitable market share by targeting the right customers that want to win with us, capitalizing on what differentiates us in driving fresh and produce and center of plate.  Last, but certainly not least, is profit. This strategic pillar highlights initiatives that will expand our margins, drive continuous improvement in productivity and optimize how we spend our resources.  Turning to Slide 6. I'll provide a little more detail on how we are evolving our culture as a company. When I joined US Foods, I was struck by its tremendous culture. It's palpable everywhere I go. While this is a unique strength to build upon, we have evolved our cultural beliefs at US Foods to reinforce the behaviors, including safety, continuous improvement and productivity that will accelerate our ability to deliver on our long-range plan to date and in the future.  Our beliefs are important because they inform the actions we take and our actions drive our results. Specifically, I have focused on 3 key areas where we can improve our business by building an even stronger culture of safety, execution and urgency. In late April, I brought together our top 200 leaders to align them around a shared vision.  We have underscored safety as a top priority and have implemented measures to increase focus on safe operations and hold every one of us accountable to work safely each day. The safety of our 29,000 associates is extremely important to me and is core to the success of any great distribution company. While we began to drive this step-up focus on safety only a few months ago, we are starting to see early signs of significant improvement. Second, we have refocused our supply chain team on the basics of distribution excellence through standardization of best practices and leadership accountability for service and cost. Two examples of how we are putting this into action are standardized labor planning and market-led routing.  Third, we are ingraining a renewed sense of urgency for delivering results throughout the organization. This includes being more decisive and moving more swiftly to put plans into action, while still being thoughtful about implementing initiatives that will most effectively drive success.  I expect each of these areas of focus to be key building blocks as we work together as 1 team at US Foods to improve our execution and increase our effectiveness to generate even stronger and more sustainable outcomes. Together with the executive leadership team, I will continue to review the business and the additional opportunities within it. We expect to pursue other actions as we complete this work through 2023 to achieve further progress against our current long-range plan and beyond. With that, let's turn to our recent business results. Turning to Slide 7. I'll walk through some of our first quarter highlights. We delivered strong financial results again this quarter, continuing to build on the excellent results we delivered throughout fiscal 2022. Net sales for the first quarter grew 10% compared to the same period in 2022. Year-over-year total case volume growth was 6% and strengthened from Q4 to Q1 based on a combination of the Omicron comparison in January and year-over-year market share gains in target customer types.  Case growth was led by 8% growth in independent restaurants, 6% growth in health care and 19% growth in hospitality, while chain cases were down 1%. We grew adjusted EBITDA dollars 40% despite essentially 0 sequential inflation in the first quarter of 2023. Our adjusted EBITDA margins also increased 80 basis points from the prior year as we gained further operating leverage in the quarter.  We remain on track for the 2023 full year guidance we outlined in February, including adjusted EBITDA of $1.45 billion to $1.51 billion.  Turning to our customer experience. We again gained year-over-year market share in target customer types via our customer focus and differentiation strategy. We are seeing continued increases in the adoption of MOXe, our digital customer platform, among local customers and are on track to launch MOXe for national customers later this year.  Finally, Pronto, our small truck delivery service focused on customers within targeted dense geographies, continues to grow organically in both existing and recently added markets. We have established a presence in 29 markets and expect to add 5 to 7 additional markets throughout the remainder of 2023. We continue to make progress in our supply chain operations as well during the quarter. The positive turnover and productivity trends we drove in the third and fourth quarter of 2022 continued in the first quarter with driver turnover further improving. turnover and productivity is now essentially in line with pre-COVID levels, and our warehouse turnover maintained the improvement we experienced in the second half of last year. There is still more work to be done, but I am very encouraged by the progress and strong evidence we are seeing that the actions we are taking are yielding results.  We are actively piloting our flexible employee scheduling and 7-day delivery in 2 additional markets. While it's too early to quantify results, qualitative feedback has been very positive. At the same time, we are planning to expand the flexible scheduling portion of this work to additional markets during the remainder of the year, which we expect to result in further improvement in employee retention and productivity. Lastly, on supply chain. We further improved our customer service levels in the quarter. Our service level to our customers is nearly where it was prior to COVID. While vendor service levels to US Foods are not yet back to pre-COVID levels, they continue to improve, which is very encouraging.  Finally, we continue to improve our capital structure, and we're diligent about prudently allocating capital this quarter. Through a combination of earnings growth and debt reduction, we meaningfully reduced our net leverage from year-end to 3.2x at the end of the first quarter. Each of the actions we've taken reinforces our commitment to being responsible stewards of shareholder value, which Dirk will talk about shortly.  Now let's turn to Slide 8, where you can see the progress we're making on our long-range plan. Starting with profitable market share growth, we drove strong Q1 volume growth, especially in our target customer types. We are on track to exceed our 1.5x goal for restaurant volume growth for the full year led by strong independent case growth. We had year-over-year share gains in each of our target customer types and expect to build on that further throughout the year, including through a strong health care and hospitality new business pipeline. We improved our profitability, as we continue to grow faster in the targeted more profitable customer types of independent restaurants, health care and hospitality.  Moving to margin optimization. Our team effectively managed through a more volatile commodity pricing environment to maintain solid gross profit per case. This was accomplished through the established process we have to specifically focus on volatile commodity categories. We continue to make progress on our COGS improvement by working jointly with additional vendors and remain on track to address a total of 60% of COGS by the end of fiscal 2023. Lastly, as vendor supply improves, we renewed our strong focus on growing private label penetration. This remains a significant opportunity and one where we bring added value to our customers through quality and innovative products at a better price. Lastly, we continue to advance our efforts to drive operational efficiencies. Our routing optimization work continues with further gains via reduced mileage. Turnover, while improving, as I discussed on the prior slide, remains a challenge and one we continue to focus on.  Finally, we began work during the quarter to identify and action savings on indirect or non-COGS spend which is an exciting area of largely untapped opportunity. This work is just beginning, and I expect savings to begin to accrue later this year, ramping up more significantly throughout 2024. US Foods is advancing the initiatives that drive our long-range plan. I am proud of and grateful for the great work of our associates who are key to achieving this important progress.  With that, I'll hand it over to Dirk to go over our financial performance and guidance in further detail.\nDirk Locascio: Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 10. We're very pleased with what we accomplished during the first quarter and the strong momentum we continue to have in our business. This clearly showed in the first quarter results. Net sales were $8.5 billion in Q1, an increase of 9.5% over the prior year. Total case volume increased nearly 6% from the prior year and food cost inflation was approximately 3.5%.  As Dave mentioned earlier, case growth was led by 8% growth in independents, 6% growth in health care and 19% growth in hospitality, while chain cases were down 1%. In the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA grew $96 million or 40% from the prior year to $337 million. It was a very strong quarter, especially given the current year had essentially no sequential inflation while the prior year had more significant sequential inflation. In addition to strong EBITDA dollars, our adjusted EBITDA margin increased 80 basis points from the prior year as our gross profit grew significantly more than OpEx. We continued our strong gross profit growth through the first quarter, which we are quite pleased with, as again, in this quarter, there was essentially no sequential inflation. Our adjusted gross profit dollars increased 14% from the prior year. OpEx remained elevated. However, we saw continued improvement, and thus in Q1, the year-over-year cost increase was much lower than it was all of 2022. The improved turnover and impacts from our other initiatives drove increased productivity and are showing up in our results. We will continue to take actions to build upon this progress and still see significant opportunity for improvement in our supply chain operations. We made further progress against all 3 areas of our plan in 2022 and to date in 2023, and we are excited about what we can achieve this year and beyond.  Moving to Slide 11. We further strengthened our capital structure and reduced leverage in the first quarter. We meaningfully reduced our net leverage compared to both the first and fourth quarter 2022 through a combination of net debt reduction and earnings growth. Our net leverage ratio was 3.2x at the end of the first quarter, which was a 1.1 turn reduction from a year ago and a 0.3 turn reduction from the end of 2022. We remain committed to reducing our leverage and remain on track to reduce net leverage to below 3x by the end of this year. We also repurchased $34 million of shares during the first quarter bringing us to $48 million to date against our $500 million share repurchase program. We remain focused on creating value for shareholders and allocating our capital prudently by continuing to invest in the business, reducing leverage to our target range, returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program and opportunistically pursuing accretive tuck-in acquisitions.  We are reiterating the fiscal 2023 guidance that we released in February 2023 and are pleased with the progress to date. We will continue to focus on controlling the controllables to ensure we are well positioned to deliver against this guidance. I will wrap up my comments today with a few thoughts on Slide 12.  We are generating momentum in our business and executing all 3 areas of our long-range plan. We are driving share gains and improved customer mix as we remain focused on the customer experience and further improving our operations to increase service levels and drive efficiencies.  None of us know exactly what lies ahead in the macro environment. However, US Foods is well positioned to win as a U.S.-focused business with a resilient demand base across a diverse set of customers and with a focus on helping our customers make it.  Finally, we will continue to be prudent with capital through a balanced deployment approach and are very focused on delivering compounded shareholder value.  With that, I'll pass it back to Dave for his closing remarks.\nDavid Flitman: Thanks, Dirk. I will close where I started. Four months into my role, I am more excited about US Foods in our future than I was the day I joined. During one of my recent site visits, I met Christopher Moore, our night warehouse manager, in Austin. In just 5 months with the company, Christopher quickly led his team to becoming one of our most productive night selection crews and has gained the trust of his associates. Struck by his leadership, I asked him about his background. I soon learned that in addition to his 12 years of experience in food distribution, he had spent 23 years in the Army supply chain, supporting operation Iraqi Freedom and Korean Defense where he received 2 bronze stars. Associates like Christopher are one of the many reasons I appreciate being part of US Foods.  As we head into Memorial Day later in the month, I want to thank Christopher, the 120 members of our those who serve Employee Resource Group in all of our military service members across this great country. Additionally, as I have spent more time with our team, I have gained a better understanding of our momentum and areas of opportunity.  While macroeconomic factors will inevitably impact results, I believe we are on track for 2024 adjusted EBITDA at or near $1.7 billion. We are focused on building upon the company's many strengths while finding ways to more effectively execute our strategy and accelerate our rate of improvement. I am highly confident this combination will lead to a very bright future for US Foods and all of our stakeholders. Finally, I would like to thank our 29,000 associates for their unwavering commitment and the work they do each day to serve our customers. It's clear that our strategy is working, and we are continuing to make progress against our long-range plan, which is in very large part due to the talented team we have here at US Foods.  With that, Cheryl, please open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from Kelly Bania of BMO Capital Markets.\nKelly Bania: Congrats on a nice quarter here. Just wanted to ask about, I guess, seasonality. So Q1 is your seasonally weak quarter. And if you look at where this quarter came in from an EBITDA margin perspective, it would seem that you're set up for a pretty strong year here. So maybe can you just help talk about why Q1 might be up 80 basis points, but the rest of the year plan much more conservatively. Any special factors that impacted this quarter versus maybe some conservatism in the outlook?\nDirk Locascio: Sure. Kelly, this is Dirk. I'll take that one. And as you heard both Dave and myself say we're very pleased with Q1. And I think what hopefully everyone sees in the quarter is just all the things we've talked about our initiatives and the strength that we've worked hard over the last year to build really show up in those strong results.  And we do think that sets us up for a very good year and are pleased with the results to date. I think overall, what you see is -- you're right, Q1 is typically a softer margin. We're happy with the improvement. We do expect to continue year-over-year improvements and the specific amounts over the course of the year, but I think we are well set up with all the work we have done.  And I think to your point on the outlook, it's one quarter into the year. And while we're pleased, we'll update our guidance as we see appropriate as we get further into the year. But happy with where the business stands and our outlook for the business.\nKelly Bania: That's very helpful. Dirk, maybe can you just unpack the gross margin a little bit more for us? It seems like you were happy with that in light of no sequential inflation here. But maybe can you help us unpack the impact of just mix on the gross margin, customer mix, in particular, versus some of the internal initiatives?\nDirk Locascio: Sure. Mix is definitely a help, but the lion's share of the improvement is all of the work that we've done over the course of the last year. So mix, as we've talked a lot about, that's why for us, just any growth is not the same and really growing with our target customer types and being thoughtful on other customers that we grow with is so important because mix is a help.  But the lion's share is definitely from the -- all the initiatives we talked about from cost of goods, pricing optimization, logistics, et cetera.\nOperator: Your next question is from Alex Slagle of Jefferies.\nAlexander Slagle: Congrats to the team and Andrew on the promotion. Had a question on customer mix. You provided an update on that mix in the slides, and you can kind of see the profile gradually moving back towards where it was pre-pandemic, but still a good 500 basis points or so off. I mean do you think it eventually gets back to that profile or perhaps the growth during the pandemic or priorities altered that? If you do were to get back to the previous customer mix and how would that alter your margin and growth profile?\nDirk Locascio: It's Dirk. I'll take -- I'll start with this one. So yes, as you pointed out, we saw a very strong growth in those other customer types of health care and hospitality as that is a healthy tailwind that we have that we talked a lot about in the last few quarters, and you saw show up again this quarter as part of our strong case growth, especially with those target customer types. And as you noted, as those continue to recover, those will continue to become a larger portion.  I think as our view hasn't changed, we largely expect them to get back to where they were prior to that, the combination of the recovery in our new business. And we think just through the continued strong growth that we've demonstrated with independents and the continued new business and then recovery in health care and hospitality, that mix will continue to be accretive to our business and really add to our balanced approach to profitably growing volume and margin expansion.\nOperator: Your next question is from Lauren Silberman of Credit Suisse.\nLauren Silberman: Congrats on the quarter. Dave, I wanted to ask about the 2024 guide at or near $1.7 billion. How much of the guide is contingent on the underlying consumer macro environment? And should we see a more challenging environment, how might your strategy change?\nDavid Flitman: Yes. Well, just -- great question. I would just say that as I've leaned in more and understood not only just what the basis was for 2024, but importantly, the underlying momentum in the business, that's where you heard my comment. While we can't control the macro, as you just heard Dirk say, we believe our destiny is completely within our control. We've got great focus on the right target customers.  Obviously, the industry is resilient through ups and downs of economic cycles. But importantly, the diversity of our strategy and our business mix, I believe, sets us up to win. And you've heard me talk about the excitement in things like the productivity initiatives, the profitability work we have going on inside the company.  We've got a long trajectory here of top and bottom line growth. I'm very excited about the momentum, and that's why you heard me reaffirm the 2024 number.\nLauren Silberman: Great. And then is there any additional color that you can provide on the cadence of case growth throughout the quarter? And to the extent you're willing to quarter-to-date just given what we've been hearing in terms of an underlying slowdown?\nDavid Flitman: Yes. Let me just take the second part of your question here, and I'll let Dirk comment. Like you've heard from others, we saw, obviously, the Omicron lapping in January, a little bit of weakness that started towards the end of February, started to bounce back in late March. And we've seen thus far early in the second quarter is recovery and stabilization. And so we're excited about the momentum. We think we have the right focus and we're excited about the future.\nDirk Locascio: Yes, I think the only thing I would add is we do expect sort of a normalized growth environment because of our strong performance and share gains across the 3 customer types and the recovery tailwinds that we've talked about in health care and hospitality, we are and expect to continue to see some healthy growth levels.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. I had one question and then one follow-up. From an inflation standpoint, clearly, everyone is talking about the moderation in cost of goods. I know for you guys, it went from north of 8% last quarter to sub-4% this quarter. Just wondering where you see that going over the next few quarters, whether you see potential for absolute deflation in coming quarters? And what the difference -- what the impact would be to your business, if it's stabilized here versus if it went to some level of deflation, how would that change the way you think about your business? And then I had 1 follow-up.\nDavid Flitman: Yes. Good question. A lot of discussions around this in the industry. And obviously, we've seen the inflation rate decelerate. But as we said in our prepared remarks, we've had essentially no sequential inflation here for a couple of quarters. You've seen us driven in large part by the initiatives we're driving, continue to expand our margins. So we have a great process around managing inflation and deflation in the company. I have absolutely no concerns about wherever that ends up going forward. And as we said last quarter, lapping of what happens in 2022 was already built into our forecast.\nDirk Locascio: Yes. And the only thing, Jeff, that I would add is that similar to last quarter, is the places where we've seen deflation have been in the proteins and commodity as opposed to core grocery. And that's the place that we tend to be more fixed mark up and so, therefore, overall, are still seeing again the strong gross profit rates that we've talked about, and that is the fact that grocery is continuing to hold in as we had talked about and expected. We still see us positive, and our outlook there has not changed.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Understood. And then the follow-up is just on the market share gains, which Dave, I know you mentioned a couple of times, I'm wondering whether you'd be able to quantify that type of metric for the first quarter, where you think maybe it came from? And conceptually, do you think market share gains would accelerate if the economy were to slow? Do you think you're in a position where the bigger players would see even greater gains? Is that a potential offset to this long macro?\nDavid Flitman: Yes, I'll answer the second part of your question first. Unequivocally, yes, as the economy slows, I think those of us with substantial scale, will have the opportunity to continue to lean in and take profitable market share 100%. But as you know, that in our target customer segments, we've been focused on taking profitable market share for a long time. And in fact, this quarter represents the eighth consecutive quarter that we've taken share in the independent restaurant segment. So there's no reason that we would expect that to slow down. We're 100% focused on it. We understand it's a very granular data -- with very granular data where our market share gains are, opportunities are, and our team is aligned around it. So I feel good about the momentum, the focus is right on and more to come.\nOperator: Your next question is from Mark Carden of UBS.\nMark Carden: So first question is for Dave. Just digging a bit more into some of your commentary at the beginning of the call. Now that you've been at US Foods for a few months and have had some more time to really dig below the surface, where do you now see the company's biggest current competitive advantage is relative to the industry as a whole? Has it changed much since last quarter? Do you see opportunities to strengthen those? And then you talked about improved and focused execution being an opportunity case as well if you've been surprised anywhere on some low-hanging fruit on the opportunity side that can really be addressed quite quickly?\nDavid Flitman: Great questions. We have really strong competitive advantages. And I mentioned this on the last quarter call, our team-based selling model is, I believe, a key differentiator for us. The way we pair up our TMs with our restaurant operations consultants and very experienced chefs, many of which have come out of the industry and understand the back-end operations of our customers and actually many were operators, in fact, in restaurants.  That's a real competitive advantage for us. The second one I would point to, and you heard me talk about this earlier as well, is our technology advantage. We are the market leader in technology. In fact, 84% of our transactions are transacted through e-commerce today. Excited about the traction we're getting in MOXe. You need to think about MOXe is putting our entire supply chain in the hands of our operators and our customers. No other company has the capability that we have, anything from ordering to understanding real-time visibility into our inventory, our customers being able to reserve that for their orders. We're second to none. It's great technology. We're rolling it out aggressively across the country. And I really believe that's a strong differentiator for us and one we will continue to invest in.\nMark Carden: That's great. And then at this stage, how are you thinking about your chain business growth relative to your independent growth? Are you expecting to pursue any more strategic exits and chains at this point? Are you largely where you'd like to be? And then how are you thinking about the health of independents relative to chains, if we do see a steeper economic downturn?\nDavid Flitman: Yes. I think we have the right focus on chains. Don't anticipate any other strategic exits at this point. Obviously, the market is very dynamic. We'll make the right decisions for the business going forward. We're opportunistically leaning into chains where it makes sense. Obviously, independents is a more profitable segment for not only us but for the industry and one where we have ample opportunity to gain share.  You heard my excitement about 8 quarters of share gain in independents. I do think people are looking for an experience. So that's why they go to independent restaurants. The unique capability of these operators and local markets tailoring to that need. We have great offerings, particularly in our private label, our exclusive brands.  Our penetration in independents is about 51%, and that's why you heard me say in my prepared remarks, there's more opportunity to penetrate the market with our exclusive brands. And as the manufacturers supply chains have recovered, we expect that growth to continue to accelerate.\nDirk Locascio: I think, Mark, the only thing I would add is I think that back to the independent health is -- there was a lot of speculation of independent weakness heading into COVID, and they were surprisingly resilient. Independent operators are very resilient. And that's also where a lot of the things that Dave talked about with our focus on helping our customers make it and many of them have adapted over these last few years. And so I think they're probably stronger operators than they were even going into COVID.\nOperator: Your next question is from Edward Kelly of Wells Fargo.\nEdward Kelly: Congrats on an impressive start to the year, by the way. Dave, I wanted to ask you about the independent case growth number. I mean certainly very impressive. I don't think we've seen a number of this big out of US Foods since they've gone public except for the COVID recovery. Can you talk a bit more about your dig into the inflection here around this? And then I think taking a step back, U.S. has been sort of a story of lower but focus on profitable case growth. And obviously, these numbers are pretty strong. How do you think about like what the appropriate level of overall case growth is for this business going forward in terms of what you're targeting? How does that differ from what's been happening here previously?\nDavid Flitman: Yes, I think we can grow and we can grow profitably and continue to take share in independents. And what I love about our focus, and I commented on this, I believe, in February, the granularity with which we understand our market share on a local basis is very solid. And our sales teams have rallied around that. They're competitive. They want to win. They understand where the growth opportunities are. We have great brands to take into these independent operators.  And so that is at the heart of the momentum. And again, Q1 is just the culmination of the good work the company has been doing for a long time. You just heard me say 8 consecutive quarters of independent market share gains. And so I think that's an opportunity for us to continue to stay focused on where we can win, where we provide differentiated value for our customers. And so I do expect that will continue. Excited about it. The organization is focused on it, and there's no reason we can't continue to take market share.\nEdward Kelly: Great. And then a quick follow-up just on gross profit per case. I mean Q1 traditionally low point for the year with progress from here. I mean any reason to think that you cannot continue to grow gross profit per case from here despite, let's call it, minimal to no inflation?\nDirk Locascio: This is Dirk. I'll take that one. Yes, pleased with the gross profit in Q1. I'm not going to comment on the specific quarters, but what I will come back to is the comment that we do expect gross profit this year to be above where it was last year. And we think that as we look ahead, we can continue to grow gross profit through the continued execution of our different initiatives. And that's, again, mostly within our control, and we are optimistic and positive about our ability to do that.  In fact, I like to use the word inflection. And so we think that this quarter is an inflection point. We're now it's 2 quarters in a row with essentially no sequential inflation. We've had very strong gross profit. We've continued to not only grow dollars at a very healthy level, but continue to expand EBITDA margins and that balance of profitable growth with those right customer types and margin expansion, we think is a great recipe for a lot of success ahead.\nDavid Flitman: And I would just add that the momentum that we have on improving our mix is strong. You've seen that in the results, and that will continue. But that aside, as Dirk has said, I just want to reinforce the point. The majority of our gross profit per case gains are from initiatives that we're driving.  I continue to see a lot of low-hanging fruit in that area of the business. And we'll continue to stay focused on driving those outcomes in a way that makes sense for our customers and for our company.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jake Bartlett of Truist Securities.\nJake Bartlett: Mine is on the competitive environment and the pricing environment. The largest distributors have been gaining -- all of them seem to be gaining a significant market share and it suggests that the others, smaller distributors, are losing significant market share. So the question is with supply chain constraints and staffing constraints easing should we expect those smaller competitors to start -- trying to compete more aggressively on price. And this just kind of goes back to the question of sustainable gross profits per case. But I guess if you could just chat about what you think the dynamic is there and what the risk that pricing competition is going to increase significantly?\nDavid Flitman: Yes. The first thing I would say is that we always operate in a highly competitive market, right? And I don't really see the macro changing that. The big picture of that. Sure, as things ebb and flow, you may see segments of competitors get more aggressive. But I keep coming back to the things that we tell our team internally is let's stay focused on running our playbook. We have great products that differentiate us. We have tremendous scale. We can be competitive where we need to. And obviously, our customers demand that of us. As we're talking about pricing with our customers, they want to understand how we're getting more efficient as a company before we're talking to them about price. And you heard my excitement about the runway we have to control the things that we're driving from an initiative standpoint that will improve our profitability. So I don't want to discount it, but I just want to say that it's not a distraction, and I don't really see that impacting our results going forward.\nJake Bartlett: Okay. Great. And then I just want to make sure I understood the message on the guidance and in light of the strong first quarter results, you kind of maintain the annual guidance. My impression what I'm hearing is maybe some conservatism, but I want to make sure that you don't also kind of see some incremental headwinds out there. We've heard from others about perception of the markets, demand is slowing, inflation is decreasing, which might be pressuring margins. But as you're kind of maintaining the '23 guidance reflective of conservatism or some sort of incremental negative that you see cropping up?\nDirk Locascio: Jake, Dirk here, I'll take that one. So yes, Q1 came in a little bit ahead of where we had expected. Very pleased with the start. And really, the way I would read into it is it's 1 quarter into the year. And as appropriate, we'll update our guidance as the year goes on. Anything with inflation or otherwise, our outlook hasn't changed there. Any of that was contemplated in our outlook for the business. So I just -- I land on one quarter in and very pleased with the performance to date and the outlook for the business.\nDavid Flitman: And just specifically, we have 0 unstated concerns.\nJake Bartlett: Great. Great. And last question real quick. On the case growth, I think in the last quarter, you had a pretty balanced new account versus share of wallet. But if you could just update us there where the case growth is really come from at this point in the independent side?\nDavid Flitman: Yes. We continue to be excited about our focus on our growth there. In fact, on the independent side of the business, just within the last couple of weeks, we have shipped a record number of customers in the history of the company. So our focus is playing off the success that we've had here for many, many quarters, and the intense focus our organization has on growing that segment of the business. We see new customer generation in the mid-single digits, mid- to upper single digits, and I expect that will continue through the course of time.\nOperator: Your next question is from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Partners.\nJohn Heinbockel: Dave, I wanted to start with maybe your thoughts on, hitting on the last topic there, the existing account penetration opportunity and particularly COP, right? If that is an outsized opportunity, how do you attack that? And then do you think the -- you've got enough sales resources to maybe get more intense, right, with those existing accounts, so you'd like to add some sales resources?\nDavid Flitman: Yes, I think -- John, great question. Look, I'll take the second part of your question first is, we always have room for strong salespeople inside US Foods, and that's something we'll continue to focus on adding the right level and the right number of talent per market where we see the greatest growth opportunities.  There are no barriers to our success being driven by me or anyone else in the organization. Our teams understand that where we can find strong sales talent, competitive talent or not, we've got room for those folks inside the company. So you'll continue to see us add prudently and specifically where we see the growth opportunities.  On the COP side, I mean we have stock . We have great brands inside the company. We have really good momentum there. And I think it's certainly center of plate is always a focus when you're looking at new accounts. And obviously, if we get into an account where we haven't led with COP, we get it in there as fast as we can.  So it's front and center to how we go to market. And as I said, I've got great brands here that the company has built through the course of time. So we lead with confidence in COP.\nJohn Heinbockel: Okay. And then maybe secondly, right, when you think about the supply chain capacity, right? Obviously, you've got 1 ecosystem. How do you think -- or how would you characterize capacity today, right? And I don't know how many expansions you're working on or fold-outs, but do you anticipate bringing new capacity on in the next year or 2, 3?\nDavid Flitman: Yes, we will look opportunistically at that. First of all, what's important to me and I learned this early in my career working for a large chemical company. You got to make sure you can justify that next incremental capacity based on the profitability of that segment of the business, right, and where you're looking at. So that's something we'll make sure we're doing well. But we have no constraints in terms of adding capacity where it's needed.  We understand where our growth opportunities are. There are a few markets where we're pinched on capacity today that we're looking at deciding what to do, but there are no barriers to our success right now driven by capacity limitations.\nDirk Locascio: And that's always an area we're looking at, John, to really -- we brought on 2 facilities in the past year and as Dave said, continue to look ahead. So that's always front and center. And that's also why growing what the target customer types is important because when you think about optimizing inventory, throughput, et cetera, those use your capacity pretty effectively.\nOperator: Your next question is from Brian Harbour of Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Harbour: Yes. I just got a question more on the operating expense side. Maybe if you could talk about labor productivity. Certainly, part of that is just getting more tenure continuing to see improvements in retention. But are there any other specific initiatives you think can continue to drive labor productivity? And then separately, are there any other kind of expenses that you still think are elevated within that line? If there's any sort of maintenance cost or fleet-related type of things that we could think about how those might change for the rest of the year?\nDavid Flitman: First of all, we're quite pleased with the leverage we got in the P&L this quarter, and as you've seen the strength of our GP growth versus our operating expense growth continues to improve. We're not there yet. We're not at the promised land, but I'm really pleased with the work we have and the initiatives going on.  In addition to the couple that you mentioned in terms of turnover and all that, the things that I talked about in the prepared remarks like our flexible scheduling will enable us to get more productive use of our associate base across the company and that's why we've got these additional pilots going on and with plans to further expand that through the back half of the year. Obviously, new employees, the less tenured folks aren't as productive, it takes time for that to happen. And the better we do -- the better job we do at retaining our associates and keeping them with us, the faster that productivity will improve. But beyond that, we have a lot of initiatives going on, just SG&A productivity, getting more efficient at what we do, anything from corporate to the field and the team is aligned around that work. So we feel good about it.\nOperator: Your next question is from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan.\nJohn Ivankoe: Maybe a little bit of a follow-up on that. David, towards the end of your prepared remarks, you talked about indirect spend. I forget the word but maybe that being an untapped or an unrealized or even unpursued opportunity for the company at this point. Total OpEx dollars in the company in '22 are around $4.5 billion. How much of that do you think would classify as indirect spend?  And -- I mean, how big of a prize, if you want to call it that, can you really pursue from an efficiency and effectiveness point of view as we begin to think about '24 and beyond?\nDavid Flitman: Yes, we're excited about that. I'll flip it over to Dirk to answer that because he's knee-deep in that work right now.\nDirk Locascio: John, good question. So as Dave said, really focusing on this. And think of this as the strategic vendor management instead of COGS, it's indirect. And so we haven't given a specific number, but it is a pretty large base. So we think just like we haven't quantified the components of the different areas of the long-range plan, we would not call it out if it's not meaningful. And so that work is underway and expect to begin those savings to accrue later this year and into next year. And it's really an area that we've focused on in limited capacity here and there, and this is a more holistic approach that we're taking.  So excited about the work that will come out of this. And we think that that's part of what will allow us to continue to invest in the business and at the same time, accrue dollars to the bottom line for earnings growth.\nJohn Ivankoe: And strategic vendor management, I mean, that's not new for you guys, but can you talk about maybe some of the newer, bigger ideas that are coming up that maybe you are working on that we might be able to see between now and the end of '23 or is it still too early to name those even if you're working on them?\nDirk Locascio: Strategic vendor management is really -- it's a continuation of the same process that we've talked about over the last year. It's continuing to work with different vendors, though. And it's really a collaborative process with those vendors, and it's all the way from how do we find joint opportunities to grow, are there opportunities to consolidate spend, are there opportunities to for us to be a better customer to those vendors that result in improved cost of goods. So there's not anything new as opposed to it's a very thoughtful and methodical approach to work through our cost of goods base.\nDavid Flitman: Yes, it's really a partnership with them, as Dirk said, to take cost out of the supply chain jointly in a collaborative manner. I think the opportunity there isn't new initiatives. As we said, we plan to be through about 60% of our COGS this year. I think that number through the end of last year was about 40%. So that's really the opportunity.\nJohn Ivankoe: And in terms of addressing the indirect spend, is there anything that we can talk about outside of strategic vendor management, I mean, something that might be new to talk about on this call or is that still behind closed doors?\nDirk Locascio: We'll talk a little more specifically, but the way to think about indirect spend is, whether it's facilities to travel to consulting sort of all those kinds of cost base. So there's not a single as opposed to it's looking at across 15 or 16 different types of categories of spend and being thoughtful those opportunities to spend more effectively. So more to come in the future as we get a little further into that. [indiscernible] was also as a later starting initiative in our long-range plan. That's why we're beginning to talk about it now.\nOperator: Your next question is from Andrew Wolf of CL King.\nAndrew Wolf: I have a couple of follow-ups. First on Dirk, the inflation commentary, you haven't had accelerating or in fact, you've had decelerating product cost inflation for now a few quarters and yet your gross margin has kind of improved against that. Is that -- can we infer from that, that you're -- you've successfully kind of lapped the toughest comparisons of holding gains and periods when inflation was accelerated, inventory holding adds?\nDirk Locascio: Yes, yes, for sure. And I think that, Andrew, to your question is, that's why we have been so deliberate in our commentary last quarter and this quarter and why we focus so much on sequential inflation and talking about sequential because when people -- when you're just looking at year-over-year, the fact of what happened a year ago is less important on what's driving right now.  So back to my earlier comment with the gains that we continue to see is strong gross profit, we continue to see. That's all the initiative work that we've driven through there that is resulting in us continuing to deliver these good results in gross profit. And as we continue to push our initiatives forward, we would expect to continue to have, again, for 2023, a strong gross profit and gains over '22, even though last year had the inventory gains and this year doesn't. That was all contemplated in our outlook and how we think about the business.\nAndrew Wolf: Got it. And on the operating expenses and improving the supply chain and really getting productivity up. Just generally, it's obvious that the whole industry had to increase wages and training and hire new people. I mean so there was a lot of cost before the benefit.  But Dave, I think you mentioned you're close to -- how far away -- I guess the question is, you have pretty impressive operating expense leverage against that much case growth. And how close are you to sort of an optimal supply chain for the things you can manage like getting productivity where you want it to be and so forth?\nDavid Flitman: We have a lot more to do in that regard. I'll just leave it at that. We've got good momentum. We're focused on the right things. The trajectory is good. We've got a lot of positive momentum, but more results to come.\nAndrew Wolf: I realize there's a lot of internal things that were in process, and I'm sure you and others have new ones. But specifically, in terms of like the investment that had to be made just to get capacity where it needed to be in training people and people becoming seasoned. Just adding a microcosm, not all the other stuff, which is on top of that, but just sort of efficiently operating a warehouse and routing, is that also a lot to come? Or are you just more referring to internal initiatives that go beyond that?\nDavid Flitman: I think it's both. I think Omicron through the industry is a curveball. We've all been struggling with that for the past 2, 3 years. You heard me talk about driver productivity and retention is about where it was pre-COVID. We're not quite there yet in the warehouse, so more to come on that sort of stuff. And then you couple that with the initiatives that we have going on that kind of informed my earlier comment about more to come.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Dave Flitman for closing remarks.\nDavid Flitman: Well, thank you all for joining us today. We hope you have a great rest of the week. The company is strong. We have great momentum and a very bright future. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 10. We're very pleased with what we accomplished during the first quarter and the strong momentum we continue to have in our business. This clearly showed in the first quarter results. Net sales were $8.5 billion in Q1, an increase of 9.5% over the prior year. Total case volume increased nearly 6% from the prior year and food cost inflation was approximately 3.5%.  As Dave mentioned earlier, case growth was led by 8% growth in independents, 6% growth in health care and 19% growth in hospitality, while chain cases were down 1%. In the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA grew $96 million or 40% from the prior year to $337 million. It was a very strong quarter, especially given the current year had essentially no sequential inflation while the prior year had more significant sequential inflation. In addition to strong EBITDA dollars, our adjusted EBITDA margin increased 80 basis points from the prior year as our gross profit grew significantly more than OpEx. We continued our strong gross profit growth through the first quarter, which we are quite pleased with, as again, in this quarter, there was essentially no sequential inflation. Our adjusted gross profit dollars increased 14% from the prior year. OpEx remained elevated. However, we saw continued improvement, and thus in Q1, the year-over-year cost increase was much lower than it was all of 2022. The improved turnover and impacts from our other initiatives drove increased productivity and are showing up in our results. We will continue to take actions to build upon this progress and still see significant opportunity for improvement in our supply chain operations. We made further progress against all 3 areas of our plan in 2022 and to date in 2023, and we are excited about what we can achieve this year and beyond.  Moving to Slide 11. We further strengthened our capital structure and reduced leverage in the first quarter. We meaningfully reduced our net leverage compared to both the first and fourth quarter 2022 through a combination of net debt reduction and earnings growth. Our net leverage ratio was 3.2x at the end of the first quarter, which was a 1.1 turn reduction from a year ago and a 0.3 turn reduction from the end of 2022. We remain committed to reducing our leverage and remain on track to reduce net leverage to below 3x by the end of this year. We also repurchased $34 million of shares during the first quarter bringing us to $48 million to date against our $500 million share repurchase program. We remain focused on creating value for shareholders and allocating our capital prudently by continuing to invest in the business, reducing leverage to our target range, returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program and opportunistically pursuing accretive tuck-in acquisitions.  We are reiterating the fiscal 2023 guidance that we released in February 2023 and are pleased with the progress to date. We will continue to focus on controlling the controllables to ensure we are well positioned to deliver against this guidance. I will wrap up my comments today with a few thoughts on Slide 12.  We are generating momentum in our business and executing all 3 areas of our long-range plan. We are driving share gains and improved customer mix as we remain focused on the customer experience and further improving our operations to increase service levels and drive efficiencies.  None of us know exactly what lies ahead in the macro environment. However, US Foods is well positioned to win as a U.S.-focused business with a resilient demand base across a diverse set of customers and with a focus on helping our customers make it.  Finally, we will continue to be prudent with capital through a balanced deployment approach and are very focused on delivering compounded shareholder value.  With that, I'll pass it back to Dave for his closing remarks. Sure. Kelly, this is Dirk. I'll take that one. And as you heard both Dave and myself say we're very pleased with Q1. And I think what hopefully everyone sees in the quarter is just all the things we've talked about our initiatives and the strength that we've worked hard over the last year to build really show up in those strong results.  And we do think that sets us up for a very good year and are pleased with the results to date. I think overall, what you see is -- you're right, Q1 is typically a softer margin. We're happy with the improvement. We do expect to continue year-over-year improvements and the specific amounts over the course of the year, but I think we are well set up with all the work we have done.  And I think to your point on the outlook, it's one quarter into the year. And while we're pleased, we'll update our guidance as we see appropriate as we get further into the year. But happy with where the business stands and our outlook for the business. Sure. Mix is definitely a help, but the lion's share of the improvement is all of the work that we've done over the course of the last year. So mix, as we've talked a lot about, that's why for us, just any growth is not the same and really growing with our target customer types and being thoughtful on other customers that we grow with is so important because mix is a help.  But the lion's share is definitely from the -- all the initiatives we talked about from cost of goods, pricing optimization, logistics, et cetera. It's Dirk. I'll take -- I'll start with this one. So yes, as you pointed out, we saw a very strong growth in those other customer types of health care and hospitality as that is a healthy tailwind that we have that we talked a lot about in the last few quarters, and you saw show up again this quarter as part of our strong case growth, especially with those target customer types. And as you noted, as those continue to recover, those will continue to become a larger portion.  I think as our view hasn't changed, we largely expect them to get back to where they were prior to that, the combination of the recovery in our new business. And we think just through the continued strong growth that we've demonstrated with independents and the continued new business and then recovery in health care and hospitality, that mix will continue to be accretive to our business and really add to our balanced approach to profitably growing volume and margin expansion. Yes, I think the only thing I would add is we do expect sort of a normalized growth environment because of our strong performance and share gains across the 3 customer types and the recovery tailwinds that we've talked about in health care and hospitality, we are and expect to continue to see some healthy growth levels. Yes. And the only thing, Jeff, that I would add is that similar to last quarter, is the places where we've seen deflation have been in the proteins and commodity as opposed to core grocery. And that's the place that we tend to be more fixed mark up and so, therefore, overall, are still seeing again the strong gross profit rates that we've talked about, and that is the fact that grocery is continuing to hold in as we had talked about and expected. We still see us positive, and our outlook there has not changed. I think, Mark, the only thing I would add is I think that back to the independent health is -- there was a lot of speculation of independent weakness heading into COVID, and they were surprisingly resilient. Independent operators are very resilient. And that's also where a lot of the things that Dave talked about with our focus on helping our customers make it and many of them have adapted over these last few years. And so I think they're probably stronger operators than they were even going into COVID. This is Dirk. I'll take that one. Yes, pleased with the gross profit in Q1. I'm not going to comment on the specific quarters, but what I will come back to is the comment that we do expect gross profit this year to be above where it was last year. And we think that as we look ahead, we can continue to grow gross profit through the continued execution of our different initiatives. And that's, again, mostly within our control, and we are optimistic and positive about our ability to do that.  In fact, I like to use the word inflection. And so we think that this quarter is an inflection point. We're now it's 2 quarters in a row with essentially no sequential inflation. We've had very strong gross profit. We've continued to not only grow dollars at a very healthy level, but continue to expand EBITDA margins and that balance of profitable growth with those right customer types and margin expansion, we think is a great recipe for a lot of success ahead. Jake, Dirk here, I'll take that one. So yes, Q1 came in a little bit ahead of where we had expected. Very pleased with the start. And really, the way I would read into it is it's 1 quarter into the year. And as appropriate, we'll update our guidance as the year goes on. Anything with inflation or otherwise, our outlook hasn't changed there. Any of that was contemplated in our outlook for the business. So I just -- I land on one quarter in and very pleased with the performance to date and the outlook for the business. And that's always an area we're looking at, John, to really -- we brought on 2 facilities in the past year and as Dave said, continue to look ahead. So that's always front and center. And that's also why growing what the target customer types is important because when you think about optimizing inventory, throughput, et cetera, those use your capacity pretty effectively. John, good question. So as Dave said, really focusing on this. And think of this as the strategic vendor management instead of COGS, it's indirect. And so we haven't given a specific number, but it is a pretty large base. So we think just like we haven't quantified the components of the different areas of the long-range plan, we would not call it out if it's not meaningful. And so that work is underway and expect to begin those savings to accrue later this year and into next year. And it's really an area that we've focused on in limited capacity here and there, and this is a more holistic approach that we're taking.  So excited about the work that will come out of this. And we think that that's part of what will allow us to continue to invest in the business and at the same time, accrue dollars to the bottom line for earnings growth. Strategic vendor management is really -- it's a continuation of the same process that we've talked about over the last year. It's continuing to work with different vendors, though. And it's really a collaborative process with those vendors, and it's all the way from how do we find joint opportunities to grow, are there opportunities to consolidate spend, are there opportunities to for us to be a better customer to those vendors that result in improved cost of goods. So there's not anything new as opposed to it's a very thoughtful and methodical approach to work through our cost of goods base. We'll talk a little more specifically, but the way to think about indirect spend is, whether it's facilities to travel to consulting sort of all those kinds of cost base. So there's not a single as opposed to it's looking at across 15 or 16 different types of categories of spend and being thoughtful those opportunities to spend more effectively. So more to come in the future as we get a little further into that. [indiscernible] was also as a later starting initiative in our long-range plan. That's why we're beginning to talk about it now. Yes, yes, for sure. And I think that, Andrew, to your question is, that's why we have been so deliberate in our commentary last quarter and this quarter and why we focus so much on sequential inflation and talking about sequential because when people -- when you're just looking at year-over-year, the fact of what happened a year ago is less important on what's driving right now.  So back to my earlier comment with the gains that we continue to see is strong gross profit, we continue to see. That's all the initiative work that we've driven through there that is resulting in us continuing to deliver these good results in gross profit. And as we continue to push our initiatives forward, we would expect to continue to have, again, for 2023, a strong gross profit and gains over '22, even though last year had the inventory gains and this year doesn't. That was all contemplated in our outlook and how we think about the business."

            "name": "David Flitman",
            "content": "Thanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I've been at US Foods now for about 4 months, and I continue to get more excited about our future each day. I'll start by sharing a few highlights from the quarter followed by my vision for the evolution of our company and then we will go deeper into our Q1 financial results.  After a year of strong market share growth and margin expansion, I'm pleased to report that US Foods remains intensely focused on executing our long-range plan, and it showed in our financial results again this quarter. We increased adjusted EBITDA by 40%, expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 80 basis points and drove case growth of 6%, including 8% independent case growth.  We delivered these strong results by profitably growing share, further optimizing gross margins and improving operational efficiencies. We made progress on key initiatives within our long-range plan while taking actions to execute more effectively on fewer but more impactful initiatives. Finally, we prudently allocated capital and continue to invest in the business as we further reduce debt and opportunistically repurchase shares. We have made significant progress against our long-range plan and have strong momentum, thus are reaffirming our full year 2023 guidance. My clear expectation is that we will maintain that momentum throughout 2023 and beyond.  While we continue to produce strong quarterly results, we've also made meaningful strides to enhance our organizational structure, our strategy and culture of our company. Over the last few months, I've continued to spend time on the road, meeting more of our associates in getting deeper into our operations. During my travels, I've also met with many customers, investors and analysts to hear their feedback about US Foods. As a result, I firmly believe that US Foods long-range plan in the areas within it are broadly the right areas of focus to ensure success. I also have seen, however, that improved and focused execution remains a key opportunity for us to accelerate financial and operational results and ultimately provide an even better customer experience. To enable and drive this improvement, I made 2 important changes to the executive leadership team in early April to better connect the field to our process excellence teams. First, Andrew Iacobucci has been promoted to Senior Executive Vice President of Field Operations and Chief Commercial Officer. While this realignment necessitated the exit of a senior executive team member, it underscores the confidence I have in Andrew's leadership. In Andrew's new role, he leads our field operations, merchandising and commercial excellence teams to drive better connectivity of our go-to-market strategy with the P&L owners.  The second change is that our 4 regional presidents, the P&L owners, are now part of my executive leadership team. They now participate directly in all executive team strategy and operating review discussions. This new structure eliminates any potential miscommunication between our field and functional leaders, increases our speed of decision-making and improves our execution through alignment on fewer initiatives that will drive greater business impact. In addition to our structural changes, we have taken steps to further strengthen our culture and provide excellent service to our customers while remaining intensely focused on profitably increasing market share and improving margins. This shows up in a simplified summary of our strategy on Slide 5. These adjustments are more an evolution than a revolution, but it is important to me that our strategy is simple and absolutely clear for all of our associates, so we can be more action and outcome-oriented across the company. I have also asked our leaders to assess how they are spending their time against these 4 pillars. Our Great Food Made Easy strategy defines what we collectively drive to win in the marketplace. As we've said before, we work to exceed expectations and give our customers the competitive edge they need. With our unrivaled portfolio of exclusive brands, our omnichannel offerings and team-based selling approach, we are well positioned to meet our customers' unique needs. And we will lead with fresh and reliable as we see significant growth and wins coming from these areas. It's intentional that our first pillar is culture because our culture and our people fuel our strategy. This pillar includes safety, which is a key area of focus for us that I will speak about in a moment. Fostering an inclusive culture and being a responsible company are also drivers of business performance and important to our associates, communities and the planet. We recently put these words into action at a meeting with our top leaders where we gave back to the community. Together, we assembled 1,000 gardening kits for underserved students in Chicago, who live in food deserts where access to fresh produce is scarce. Our second pillar is service. Our research tells us that the most important services to customers are on time, correct orders and high-quality fresh products. No single food distribution company is a clear leader in all of these areas, which means there is a great opportunity for us to win on service. Our service pillar focuses on reliability, being efficient across our operations from routing to logistics to replenishment and providing the best experiences to customers through our technology and omnichannel offerings.  Our third pillar is growth. We are focused on gaining profitable market share by targeting the right customers that want to win with us, capitalizing on what differentiates us in driving fresh and produce and center of plate.  Last, but certainly not least, is profit. This strategic pillar highlights initiatives that will expand our margins, drive continuous improvement in productivity and optimize how we spend our resources.  Turning to Slide 6. I'll provide a little more detail on how we are evolving our culture as a company. When I joined US Foods, I was struck by its tremendous culture. It's palpable everywhere I go. While this is a unique strength to build upon, we have evolved our cultural beliefs at US Foods to reinforce the behaviors, including safety, continuous improvement and productivity that will accelerate our ability to deliver on our long-range plan to date and in the future.  Our beliefs are important because they inform the actions we take and our actions drive our results. Specifically, I have focused on 3 key areas where we can improve our business by building an even stronger culture of safety, execution and urgency. In late April, I brought together our top 200 leaders to align them around a shared vision.  We have underscored safety as a top priority and have implemented measures to increase focus on safe operations and hold every one of us accountable to work safely each day. The safety of our 29,000 associates is extremely important to me and is core to the success of any great distribution company. While we began to drive this step-up focus on safety only a few months ago, we are starting to see early signs of significant improvement. Second, we have refocused our supply chain team on the basics of distribution excellence through standardization of best practices and leadership accountability for service and cost. Two examples of how we are putting this into action are standardized labor planning and market-led routing.  Third, we are ingraining a renewed sense of urgency for delivering results throughout the organization. This includes being more decisive and moving more swiftly to put plans into action, while still being thoughtful about implementing initiatives that will most effectively drive success.  I expect each of these areas of focus to be key building blocks as we work together as 1 team at US Foods to improve our execution and increase our effectiveness to generate even stronger and more sustainable outcomes. Together with the executive leadership team, I will continue to review the business and the additional opportunities within it. We expect to pursue other actions as we complete this work through 2023 to achieve further progress against our current long-range plan and beyond. With that, let's turn to our recent business results. Turning to Slide 7. I'll walk through some of our first quarter highlights. We delivered strong financial results again this quarter, continuing to build on the excellent results we delivered throughout fiscal 2022. Net sales for the first quarter grew 10% compared to the same period in 2022. Year-over-year total case volume growth was 6% and strengthened from Q4 to Q1 based on a combination of the Omicron comparison in January and year-over-year market share gains in target customer types.  Case growth was led by 8% growth in independent restaurants, 6% growth in health care and 19% growth in hospitality, while chain cases were down 1%. We grew adjusted EBITDA dollars 40% despite essentially 0 sequential inflation in the first quarter of 2023. Our adjusted EBITDA margins also increased 80 basis points from the prior year as we gained further operating leverage in the quarter.  We remain on track for the 2023 full year guidance we outlined in February, including adjusted EBITDA of $1.45 billion to $1.51 billion.  Turning to our customer experience. We again gained year-over-year market share in target customer types via our customer focus and differentiation strategy. We are seeing continued increases in the adoption of MOXe, our digital customer platform, among local customers and are on track to launch MOXe for national customers later this year.  Finally, Pronto, our small truck delivery service focused on customers within targeted dense geographies, continues to grow organically in both existing and recently added markets. We have established a presence in 29 markets and expect to add 5 to 7 additional markets throughout the remainder of 2023. We continue to make progress in our supply chain operations as well during the quarter. The positive turnover and productivity trends we drove in the third and fourth quarter of 2022 continued in the first quarter with driver turnover further improving. turnover and productivity is now essentially in line with pre-COVID levels, and our warehouse turnover maintained the improvement we experienced in the second half of last year. There is still more work to be done, but I am very encouraged by the progress and strong evidence we are seeing that the actions we are taking are yielding results.  We are actively piloting our flexible employee scheduling and 7-day delivery in 2 additional markets. While it's too early to quantify results, qualitative feedback has been very positive. At the same time, we are planning to expand the flexible scheduling portion of this work to additional markets during the remainder of the year, which we expect to result in further improvement in employee retention and productivity. Lastly, on supply chain. We further improved our customer service levels in the quarter. Our service level to our customers is nearly where it was prior to COVID. While vendor service levels to US Foods are not yet back to pre-COVID levels, they continue to improve, which is very encouraging.  Finally, we continue to improve our capital structure, and we're diligent about prudently allocating capital this quarter. Through a combination of earnings growth and debt reduction, we meaningfully reduced our net leverage from year-end to 3.2x at the end of the first quarter. Each of the actions we've taken reinforces our commitment to being responsible stewards of shareholder value, which Dirk will talk about shortly.  Now let's turn to Slide 8, where you can see the progress we're making on our long-range plan. Starting with profitable market share growth, we drove strong Q1 volume growth, especially in our target customer types. We are on track to exceed our 1.5x goal for restaurant volume growth for the full year led by strong independent case growth. We had year-over-year share gains in each of our target customer types and expect to build on that further throughout the year, including through a strong health care and hospitality new business pipeline. We improved our profitability, as we continue to grow faster in the targeted more profitable customer types of independent restaurants, health care and hospitality.  Moving to margin optimization. Our team effectively managed through a more volatile commodity pricing environment to maintain solid gross profit per case. This was accomplished through the established process we have to specifically focus on volatile commodity categories. We continue to make progress on our COGS improvement by working jointly with additional vendors and remain on track to address a total of 60% of COGS by the end of fiscal 2023. Lastly, as vendor supply improves, we renewed our strong focus on growing private label penetration. This remains a significant opportunity and one where we bring added value to our customers through quality and innovative products at a better price. Lastly, we continue to advance our efforts to drive operational efficiencies. Our routing optimization work continues with further gains via reduced mileage. Turnover, while improving, as I discussed on the prior slide, remains a challenge and one we continue to focus on.  Finally, we began work during the quarter to identify and action savings on indirect or non-COGS spend which is an exciting area of largely untapped opportunity. This work is just beginning, and I expect savings to begin to accrue later this year, ramping up more significantly throughout 2024. US Foods is advancing the initiatives that drive our long-range plan. I am proud of and grateful for the great work of our associates who are key to achieving this important progress.  With that, I'll hand it over to Dirk to go over our financial performance and guidance in further detail. Thanks, Dirk. I will close where I started. Four months into my role, I am more excited about US Foods in our future than I was the day I joined. During one of my recent site visits, I met Christopher Moore, our night warehouse manager, in Austin. In just 5 months with the company, Christopher quickly led his team to becoming one of our most productive night selection crews and has gained the trust of his associates. Struck by his leadership, I asked him about his background. I soon learned that in addition to his 12 years of experience in food distribution, he had spent 23 years in the Army supply chain, supporting operation Iraqi Freedom and Korean Defense where he received 2 bronze stars. Associates like Christopher are one of the many reasons I appreciate being part of US Foods.  As we head into Memorial Day later in the month, I want to thank Christopher, the 120 members of our those who serve Employee Resource Group in all of our military service members across this great country. Additionally, as I have spent more time with our team, I have gained a better understanding of our momentum and areas of opportunity.  While macroeconomic factors will inevitably impact results, I believe we are on track for 2024 adjusted EBITDA at or near $1.7 billion. We are focused on building upon the company's many strengths while finding ways to more effectively execute our strategy and accelerate our rate of improvement. I am highly confident this combination will lead to a very bright future for US Foods and all of our stakeholders. Finally, I would like to thank our 29,000 associates for their unwavering commitment and the work they do each day to serve our customers. It's clear that our strategy is working, and we are continuing to make progress against our long-range plan, which is in very large part due to the talented team we have here at US Foods.  With that, Cheryl, please open up the line for questions. Yes. Well, just -- great question. I would just say that as I've leaned in more and understood not only just what the basis was for 2024, but importantly, the underlying momentum in the business, that's where you heard my comment. While we can't control the macro, as you just heard Dirk say, we believe our destiny is completely within our control. We've got great focus on the right target customers.  Obviously, the industry is resilient through ups and downs of economic cycles. But importantly, the diversity of our strategy and our business mix, I believe, sets us up to win. And you've heard me talk about the excitement in things like the productivity initiatives, the profitability work we have going on inside the company.  We've got a long trajectory here of top and bottom line growth. I'm very excited about the momentum, and that's why you heard me reaffirm the 2024 number. Yes. Let me just take the second part of your question here, and I'll let Dirk comment. Like you've heard from others, we saw, obviously, the Omicron lapping in January, a little bit of weakness that started towards the end of February, started to bounce back in late March. And we've seen thus far early in the second quarter is recovery and stabilization. And so we're excited about the momentum. We think we have the right focus and we're excited about the future. Yes. Good question. A lot of discussions around this in the industry. And obviously, we've seen the inflation rate decelerate. But as we said in our prepared remarks, we've had essentially no sequential inflation here for a couple of quarters. You've seen us driven in large part by the initiatives we're driving, continue to expand our margins. So we have a great process around managing inflation and deflation in the company. I have absolutely no concerns about wherever that ends up going forward. And as we said last quarter, lapping of what happens in 2022 was already built into our forecast. Yes, I'll answer the second part of your question first. Unequivocally, yes, as the economy slows, I think those of us with substantial scale, will have the opportunity to continue to lean in and take profitable market share 100%. But as you know, that in our target customer segments, we've been focused on taking profitable market share for a long time. And in fact, this quarter represents the eighth consecutive quarter that we've taken share in the independent restaurant segment. So there's no reason that we would expect that to slow down. We're 100% focused on it. We understand it's a very granular data -- with very granular data where our market share gains are, opportunities are, and our team is aligned around it. So I feel good about the momentum, the focus is right on and more to come. Great questions. We have really strong competitive advantages. And I mentioned this on the last quarter call, our team-based selling model is, I believe, a key differentiator for us. The way we pair up our TMs with our restaurant operations consultants and very experienced chefs, many of which have come out of the industry and understand the back-end operations of our customers and actually many were operators, in fact, in restaurants.  That's a real competitive advantage for us. The second one I would point to, and you heard me talk about this earlier as well, is our technology advantage. We are the market leader in technology. In fact, 84% of our transactions are transacted through e-commerce today. Excited about the traction we're getting in MOXe. You need to think about MOXe is putting our entire supply chain in the hands of our operators and our customers. No other company has the capability that we have, anything from ordering to understanding real-time visibility into our inventory, our customers being able to reserve that for their orders. We're second to none. It's great technology. We're rolling it out aggressively across the country. And I really believe that's a strong differentiator for us and one we will continue to invest in. Yes. I think we have the right focus on chains. Don't anticipate any other strategic exits at this point. Obviously, the market is very dynamic. We'll make the right decisions for the business going forward. We're opportunistically leaning into chains where it makes sense. Obviously, independents is a more profitable segment for not only us but for the industry and one where we have ample opportunity to gain share.  You heard my excitement about 8 quarters of share gain in independents. I do think people are looking for an experience. So that's why they go to independent restaurants. The unique capability of these operators and local markets tailoring to that need. We have great offerings, particularly in our private label, our exclusive brands.  Our penetration in independents is about 51%, and that's why you heard me say in my prepared remarks, there's more opportunity to penetrate the market with our exclusive brands. And as the manufacturers supply chains have recovered, we expect that growth to continue to accelerate. Yes, I think we can grow and we can grow profitably and continue to take share in independents. And what I love about our focus, and I commented on this, I believe, in February, the granularity with which we understand our market share on a local basis is very solid. And our sales teams have rallied around that. They're competitive. They want to win. They understand where the growth opportunities are. We have great brands to take into these independent operators.  And so that is at the heart of the momentum. And again, Q1 is just the culmination of the good work the company has been doing for a long time. You just heard me say 8 consecutive quarters of independent market share gains. And so I think that's an opportunity for us to continue to stay focused on where we can win, where we provide differentiated value for our customers. And so I do expect that will continue. Excited about it. The organization is focused on it, and there's no reason we can't continue to take market share. And I would just add that the momentum that we have on improving our mix is strong. You've seen that in the results, and that will continue. But that aside, as Dirk has said, I just want to reinforce the point. The majority of our gross profit per case gains are from initiatives that we're driving.  I continue to see a lot of low-hanging fruit in that area of the business. And we'll continue to stay focused on driving those outcomes in a way that makes sense for our customers and for our company. Yes. The first thing I would say is that we always operate in a highly competitive market, right? And I don't really see the macro changing that. The big picture of that. Sure, as things ebb and flow, you may see segments of competitors get more aggressive. But I keep coming back to the things that we tell our team internally is let's stay focused on running our playbook. We have great products that differentiate us. We have tremendous scale. We can be competitive where we need to. And obviously, our customers demand that of us. As we're talking about pricing with our customers, they want to understand how we're getting more efficient as a company before we're talking to them about price. And you heard my excitement about the runway we have to control the things that we're driving from an initiative standpoint that will improve our profitability. So I don't want to discount it, but I just want to say that it's not a distraction, and I don't really see that impacting our results going forward. And just specifically, we have 0 unstated concerns. Yes. We continue to be excited about our focus on our growth there. In fact, on the independent side of the business, just within the last couple of weeks, we have shipped a record number of customers in the history of the company. So our focus is playing off the success that we've had here for many, many quarters, and the intense focus our organization has on growing that segment of the business. We see new customer generation in the mid-single digits, mid- to upper single digits, and I expect that will continue through the course of time. Yes, I think -- John, great question. Look, I'll take the second part of your question first is, we always have room for strong salespeople inside US Foods, and that's something we'll continue to focus on adding the right level and the right number of talent per market where we see the greatest growth opportunities.  There are no barriers to our success being driven by me or anyone else in the organization. Our teams understand that where we can find strong sales talent, competitive talent or not, we've got room for those folks inside the company. So you'll continue to see us add prudently and specifically where we see the growth opportunities.  On the COP side, I mean we have stock . We have great brands inside the company. We have really good momentum there. And I think it's certainly center of plate is always a focus when you're looking at new accounts. And obviously, if we get into an account where we haven't led with COP, we get it in there as fast as we can.  So it's front and center to how we go to market. And as I said, I've got great brands here that the company has built through the course of time. So we lead with confidence in COP. Yes, we will look opportunistically at that. First of all, what's important to me and I learned this early in my career working for a large chemical company. You got to make sure you can justify that next incremental capacity based on the profitability of that segment of the business, right, and where you're looking at. So that's something we'll make sure we're doing well. But we have no constraints in terms of adding capacity where it's needed.  We understand where our growth opportunities are. There are a few markets where we're pinched on capacity today that we're looking at deciding what to do, but there are no barriers to our success right now driven by capacity limitations. First of all, we're quite pleased with the leverage we got in the P&L this quarter, and as you've seen the strength of our GP growth versus our operating expense growth continues to improve. We're not there yet. We're not at the promised land, but I'm really pleased with the work we have and the initiatives going on.  In addition to the couple that you mentioned in terms of turnover and all that, the things that I talked about in the prepared remarks like our flexible scheduling will enable us to get more productive use of our associate base across the company and that's why we've got these additional pilots going on and with plans to further expand that through the back half of the year. Obviously, new employees, the less tenured folks aren't as productive, it takes time for that to happen. And the better we do -- the better job we do at retaining our associates and keeping them with us, the faster that productivity will improve. But beyond that, we have a lot of initiatives going on, just SG&A productivity, getting more efficient at what we do, anything from corporate to the field and the team is aligned around that work. So we feel good about it. Yes, we're excited about that. I'll flip it over to Dirk to answer that because he's knee-deep in that work right now. Yes, it's really a partnership with them, as Dirk said, to take cost out of the supply chain jointly in a collaborative manner. I think the opportunity there isn't new initiatives. As we said, we plan to be through about 60% of our COGS this year. I think that number through the end of last year was about 40%. So that's really the opportunity. We have a lot more to do in that regard. I'll just leave it at that. We've got good momentum. We're focused on the right things. The trajectory is good. We've got a lot of positive momentum, but more results to come. I think it's both. I think Omicron through the industry is a curveball. We've all been struggling with that for the past 2, 3 years. You heard me talk about driver productivity and retention is about where it was pre-COVID. We're not quite there yet in the warehouse, so more to come on that sort of stuff. And then you couple that with the initiatives that we have going on that kind of informed my earlier comment about more to come. Well, thank you all for joining us today. We hope you have a great rest of the week. The company is strong. We have great momentum and a very bright future. Have a great day."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the U.S. Foods Holding Corp Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mike Neese, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMike Neese: Thank you, Roschelle. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to U.S. Foods\u2019 third quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings call. On today's call, we have Dave Flitman, our CEO; and Dirk Locascio, our CFO. We will take your questions after our prepared remarks conclude. Our earnings release issued earlier this morning and today's presentation can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at ir.usfoods.com. During today's call, unless otherwise stated, we're comparing our third quarter fiscal year 2024 to the same period in our third quarter fiscal year 2023. In addition to historical information, certain statements made during today's call are considered forward-looking statements. Please review the risk factors in our Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of the potential factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those statements. During today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. All reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the schedules on our earnings press release as well as in the presentation slides posted on our website. We are not providing reconciliations to forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Dave.\nDave Flitman: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, our thoughts are with all of our associates, customers, and communities impacted by Hurricane Helene and Milton, which have each caused catastrophic devastation across parts of the Southeast. We are grateful to our local teams for their unwavering commitment to aiding recovery efforts and continuing to serve the community through countless hours of volunteering and donations during this difficult time. Thankfully, all of our associates are safe, but many suffer damage to their homes and property. I'll briefly highlight one of our associates who have gone above and beyond to make a difference in North Carolina during these trying times. Josh Hoge is a salesman for U.S. Foods and local to Boone County. He gathered volunteers to provide a wide variety of grassroots release support. He and others coordinated a GoFundMe page that raised more than $400,000 in donations for those impacted, deployed 11 truckloads of food donations gathered with the support of local organizations and businesses, including U.S. Foods, organized the purchase and delivery of 40 generators to impacted areas. Thank you, Josh, for your incredible efforts and to all our associates who have helped and continue to help our customers and communities during this challenging time. Now, let's turn our results from the third quarter. I will then update you on core initiatives across each of our four strategic pillars before passing into Dirk to review our financial results and provide an update to our fiscal year 2024 guidance. Turning slide 4, we delivered 13% adjusted EBITDA growth, solid adjusted EBITDA margin expansion and 21% adjusted EPS growth as we continue to deploy our proven operational playbook and execute our strategic initiatives. We delivered another quarter of strong results despite a challenging macro environment and unforeseen weather related impacts, which pressured industry case volumes. This is a real testament to our team's focus, our execution and our ability to control the controllables. We drove volume growth and captured market share in our target customer types of independent restaurants, healthcare and hospitality. Total volume grew 3.8%, while our independent restaurant cases grew 4.1%, which resulted in our 14th consecutive quarter of market share gains. Moving to capital deployment, we were prudently aggressive with share repurchases this quarter, totaling $580 million. We will continue to execute buybacks as we believe our shares remain undervalued. Since initiating our buyback program in late 2022, we have repurchased over $1.1 billion of our shares at an average price of $50.68 and will continue to be good stewards of capital deployment. Let's turn to the broader macro and our focus on our target customer types. In addition to the softer macro environment, there were several large storms in the third quarter that adversely impacted our Southeast business where we over-index on independent restaurant market share. The impact from the slower Southeast growth was nearly a 100-basis point headwind to independent volume growth. In excluding the Southeast, our organic independent volume growth was modestly higher than our second quarter growth rate. Monthly foot traffic was down approximately 3.5% for the third quarter but sequentially improved throughout the quarter. And once we got past the storm impacts in the early part of the fourth quarter, we have seen further improvement, which is translated to an approximately 100 basis point acceleration in our organic independent case growth. We are also seeing a similar improvement in our chain, same store volume. Our go-to-market strategy, including team-based selling, innovation and digital, combined with our operational playbook, enable us to capture profitable market share no matter what external factors come our way. And despite the challenges I just outlined, we were quite pleased to grow independent market share in the third quarter, both sequentially and year-over-year, at a faster rate than we did in the second quarter. Let's move now to our four strategic pillars. I'll discuss our progress on each, starting with slide 5. Our first pillar is culture. Our focus and top priority are always the safety of our associates. During the quarter, our injury and accident rates were 21% better than the prior year. While we continue to make incremental progress each quarter, we will not rest until we have zero injuries for our associates. This year, we supported the American Red Cross with a donation of $300,000 to support disaster relief efforts, including Hurricane Helene and Milton. Our U.S. Foods teams also sent thousands of cases of product to disaster relief organizations across the impacted footprint. Additionally, we announced a national partnership with the Military Family Advisory Network, or MFAN, this July, and made a $250,000 contribution. This organization's mission is to understand and amplify the needs of military-connected families who face food insecurity. Our contribution will help MFAN distribute 500 pantry restock boxes per month, designed to get transferred military families started in their new homes, with essential items typically discarded during a movement. The MFAN collaboration is our first national hunger relief partnership supporting military families, a group disproportionately impacted by food insecurity. Turning to slide 6, our second pillar service. Again this quarter, we delivered year-over-year improvement with on-time and in full service levels. We also remain focused on delivering improved distribution productivity through our Descartes Routing technology, which is now live in 15 markets. By yearend, we expect to launch an additional 11 markets and remain on track to have approximately 50% of our routed miles on the cart. We continue to see this technology produce incremental improvement in cases per month. And we continue to enhance the user experience of our proprietary leading digital platform MOX\u0113, which enables our customers to place orders, track deliveries, pay bills, and seamlessly manage inventory. Given the significant portion of total cost that food represents for our customers, we introduced a new food cost calculator feature embedded into MOX\u0113. This tool tracks and manages food costs over time, providing customers with valuable insights to help them with their menu prices, inventory, and product selection. This innovative solution is available to all U.S. Foods customers and further enhances our digital leadership position. Now let's turn to growth, our growth pillar on slide 7. Pronto, our small truck delivery service, continues to gain steam and is now live in 40 markets. We're excited about this rapidly growing opportunity and its ability to reach hard-to-service customers in dense geographies. Pronto provides these previously untapped customers for U.S. Foods with smaller, more frequent deliveries and later cutoff times. Earlier this year, we launched Pronto penetration in two pilot markets. This service fills in non-routine delivery days for our existing independent restaurant customers, leading to further wallet share for U.S. Foods. In these pilot markets, we are seeing an approximate 20% uplift in case volumes, while showing no cannibalization in broad line delivery size or frequency. The successful launch and early learnings gave us confidence to expand Pronto penetration from two pilot markets to six. We remain on track for Pronto delivered nearly $700 million of annualized sales this year. Moving to national sales, our targeted business development activity drove new wins during the quarter, and we onboarded more than $100 million in annualized sales in healthcare and hospitality. Finally, in September, we launched our Scoop theme to Barn, Grill, and Beyond. Our Fall Scoop highlights 24 new on-trend products designed by U.S. Foods product development experts who leverage a wealth of culinary expertise, industry experience, and data-driven insights to bring new product innovation to our private label brands. Many of you saw this in action on our Investor Day last June. My favorite from the Fall lineup is the Chef's Line Natural Smoked Pork Butt, which tastes amazing and is pre-packaged in a boiling bag and saves customers approximately 40 minutes of labor per case. Turning to slide 8, our profit pillar. Our go-to-market strategy and strong execution drove a 7% increase in adjusted gross profit to $1.7 billion. This was primarily driven by total case volume growth and improved costs of goods sold. We grew adjusted gross profit 240 basis points faster than adjusted operating expense, driving a 27 basis point of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. We also made additional progress on cost of goods through our strategic vendor management efforts, realizing more than $70 million year-to-date. We now expect to deliver more than $230 million in cost of goods savings in our current 2022 to 2024 long range plan, which is nearly complete. On the productivity front, we delivered 3.5% improvement in warehouse productivity in line with our goal of 3% to 5% annual productivity gains to offset wage inflation. Regarding CHEF\u2019STORE, a quick update. As a reminder, we are actively exploring strategic alternatives for this business and have recently begun discussions with several potential buyers. We remain fully committed to supporting the business, our associates, and our customers through this process. And we will continue to keep you informed as we make further progress. As we have previously said, in the event of a sale, we would expect to deploy the majority of the proceeds to repurchasing shares. Before I hand it over to Dirk, in September, the International Food Service Distributors Association inducted 20 US Food drivers into its Truck Driver Hall of Fame. This honor recognizes the food service industry's top drivers that are exceptional safety record and length of service, each with more than 25 years of service at U.S. Foods. It's a highly coveted honor for truck drivers in our industry. With Veterans Day just around the corner, I want to highlight two of the Hall of Fame drivers, both of whom are veterans that serve in the US Armed Forces and hail from our Fort Mill, South Carolina facility. The first is Orlando Smith, who has 30 years of service at U.S. Foods. The second, Larry Boyer, who has been a driver for us for 34 years. I thank them both not only for their decades of service to our company, but especially for the bravery and courage in serving and protecting our great nation. Finally, I also thank all veterans within and outside of U.S. Foods who have served our country and protected our freedom. We owe you all a huge debt of gratitude that can never be repaid. Let me now turn the call over to Dirk to discuss our third quarter results in more detail and our updated 2024 guidance.\nDirk Locascio: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Our double digit adjusted EBITDA growth is the result of consistent execution for our strategy to capture market share and expand margins. Starting on slide 11, third quarter net sales increased 6.8% to $9.7 billion driven by total case volume growth of 3.8% and food cost inflation and mixed impact of 3%. We drove solid case growth and cash flow share gains in each of our target customer types. Our independent restaurant volume grew 4.1% including 170 basis points from acquisitions. Healthcare growth remained strong at 5.7% and hospitality growth accelerated further to 3% as we onboarded new business. Adjusted EBITDA were 13.2% from the prior year to $455 million and we expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 27 basis points to 4.7%. As we continue to execute our profitable growth strategy and proactively manage gross margin and operating expenses, we see these actions drive margin expansion. During the third quarter, as Dave mentioned, we made further progress on our strategic vendor management work and now expect to achieve more than $230 million in cost of goods savings from 2022 through the end of this year. We also remain on track to realize the $120 million of annualized operating expense savings that we highlighted last quarter, and we are on track to deliver more than $20 million in savings this year from the indirect spend work that we previously discussed. This highlights our team's strong ability to execute initiatives regardless of the macro environment. We are pulling the appropriate levels to sustainably grow gross profit rate and drive operating expense productivity. As a reminder, a significant portion of our operating costs are structured as variable to provide us flexibility to match expense to volume in different market scenarios. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS increased 21.4% to $0.85, demonstrating our ability to grow adjusted diluted EPS meaningfully faster than adjusted EBITDA. We expect this to continue as we deploy our strong free cash flow towards share repurchases, which I'll talk more about shortly. Moving to slide 12, we made significant progress in growing adjusted gross profit per case faster than adjusted operating expense per case again this quarter. Adjusted gross profit per case grew by $0.24 or more than 3% versus prior year. This growth was primarily driven by executing initiatives within our control, including our strategic vendor management work and continued focus on private label penetration. Adjusted operating expense per case increased $0.04 or less than 1%. We're offsetting a significant portion of operating cost inflation with productivity, including improving supply chain productivity, streamlining administrative processes and costs, and realizing indirect spend procurement savings. This all led to adjusted EBITDA per case of $2.12, up $0.17 or 8.7% from the prior year. We expect continued adjusted EBITDA per case growth as we execute our initiatives. Moving on to slide 13, our strong cash flow generation was evident again this quarter. Year-to-date, we've generated $891 million of operating cash flow and $658 million of free cash flow driven by increased profitability and disciplined working capital management. Our robust cash flow creates financial flexibility to deploy capital strategically, enabling us to invest in the business for growth and return capital to shareholders via shared purchases. We invested $236 million in cash CapEx for the first nine months, mainly focused on projects to support growth, including information technology, property and equipment, as well as maintenance of our distributing facilities. During the quarter, we significantly accelerated the pace of share repurchases in line with our commentary last quarter and repurchased 10.4 million shares for a total of $580 million. In the fourth quarter today through November 4th, we purchased an additional $160 million of shares. We have $238 million of remaining funds authorized under our $1 billion share repurchase program. We will remain disciplined in continuing to execute our share repurchase program in addition to continued investment in the business for organic growth and opportunistic tuck-in M&A. Turning to net leverage on slide 14, we ended the quarter at 2.8x net leverage within our 2x to 3x target range. Net leverage is unchanged from yearend, even with the significant share repurchases this quarter. Subsequent to quarter end, we addressed the net maturity and our debt structure. We issued $500 million in senior notes due 2033 at 5.75% and use the proceeds to repay a portion of our term loan facilities. We also extended the maturity of the remaining balance of our term loan due 2026 to 2031, lowered the interest rate margin on both of our term loan facilities by 25 basis points, and eliminated the credit spread adjustment of 11 basis points on the facility due 2031. As a result of this, we capture approximately $9 million in annualized interest savings. Our debt structure is strong, and we have no long-term debt maturities until 2028. With that, let me now turn to our updated outlook for 2024 on slide 15. Given our year-to-date performance and outlook for the remainder of the year, we're updating our fiscal year 2024 guidance. We now expect net sales to be in a range of $37.7 billion to $38 billion. We're increasing the bottom end of our adjusted EBITDA range to $1.72 billion to $1.74 billion. Finally, we're tightening our adjusted diluted EPS range to $3.05 to $3.15. Moving to modeling assumptions. For 2024, given the continued soft macro environment and the unanticipated hurricane impacts, we now expect total case growth of 4% to 4.5%. We're also updating our sales inflation assumption, which includes mix, to a range of 2% to 2.5%. Interest expenses projected to be lower than our previous forecast and is now expected to be in the range of $310 million to $320 million. Finally, depreciation and amortization are at the higher end of our range, partially due to M&A, and is now projected to be in the range of $435 million to $445 million. Despite the softer macro backdrop, we continue to strengthen our execution and remain confident in our ability to grow volume, gain share with target customer types, increase profitability, and return capital to shareholders. I'm pleased with our strong progress this year as we've driven balanced profitable growth. We remain well positioned to achieve our current long-range plan in 2024 financial targets, and I look forward to getting off to a strong start to our next long-range plan beginning in 2025. With that, I'll now pass it back to Dave for his closing remarks.\nDave Flitman : Thanks Dirk. Not only are we a market leader, but we have significant, sustainable, competitive advantages that position us well to win in any environment, as we are demonstrating. We are the only, pure play, U.S. only, food service distributor with national scale. Our focus is to grow volume and gain share with the highest value customer types in the industry, independent restaurants, healthcare, hospitality. We are focused on executing and delivering the outcomes of our new long-range plan, which comprehends significant upside from our self-help initiatives. Many of these are in the early innings of deployment and have a long runway of profitable growth. We are the industry leader in digital innovation and have built a strong competitive advantage that we will maintain. And we are confident in achieving our 2025 to 2027 long range plan. As a reminder, our growth algorithm introduced in our June Investor Day includes a 5% sales growth CAGR, 10% adjusted EBITDA growth CAGR, at least 20 basis points of annual adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, and a 20% adjusted diluted EPS growth CAGR. This will generate at least $4 billion of capital to deploy against our capital allocation priorities over the three year period, including approximately half towards buying back stock. Our third quarter results of net sales growth of 6.8%, 13% adjusted EBITDA growth, a 27 basis point increase in adjusted EBITDA margin and a 21% adjusted EPS growth affirm my strong conviction that we have the right strategies in place to deliver our next long-range plan. And our team is 100% aligned and excited about our future and the ability to achieve exactly what we say we're going to do over the next three years. Finally, I sincerely thank each of our 30,000 associates for their dedication for executing and disturbing our customers well as we continue to pursue our ambition to become the undisputed best in the industry. And with that, Roschelle, please open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Harbour: Yes, thank you. Could you talk a little bit more about sort of private label penetration, where that's tracking and just what you continue to see there on both, especially on the independent side?\nDave Flitman : Yes, we're excited about our private label brands. Good morning, Brian. We've had continued increase in penetration there, particularly with our independent restaurants. We're running roughly 52%. And as I say all the time to our team and externally to you guys, there's no barrier to increasing that. I see no near-term ceiling. I talked a little bit here this morning about our new Scoop launch. We're leading in innovation. Very strong adoption in all those products. We continue to take those products really across the portfolio and all of our customer types and we've got great momentum.\nBrian Harbour: Okay, great, thank you. And, maybe talk about just independent health as well, right? It sounded like sort of some of the uplift you've seen recently after the weather impact was similar for independent and changes that, if I understood that correctly, but could you talk about that customer and how do you sort of expect the trend for this quarter and into early next year?\nDave Flitman : Yes, we're encouraged by what we've seen and just a little context. The foot traffic challenges are well-documented, really beginning in the second quarter of this year. Importantly, foot traffic decelerated in the third quarter. You heard me say this morning that our market share gains actually accelerated. We had a hurricane last week in September. We had another one in early October, and once we cleared all of that, I'm very encouraged by the momentum that we've seen more than 100 basis point acceleration in case growth, both, as you mentioned, with our independent restaurants and also chains. And importantly our healthcare and hospitality where we took share again this quarter, and are differentiated portfolio remain very strong, both of those have very strong pipelines and I couldn't be more excited about the way we're going to finish the year and what that means for 2025.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank.\nLauren Silberman: Hi. Thank you very much. First on the guidance, you're guiding to the high end of the full year EBITDA guide, lower end of the case growth guide. So it seems like you're outperforming within the P&L relative to your initial expectations. So can you just talk about where that's coming from? Have you pulled forward any initiatives?\nDave Flitman : No, we really haven't pulled anything forward, Lauren. As we've been doing for a long time now, we're just continuing to execute that portfolio initiative of initiatives that we have which really span the entire spectrum of the P&L from top line to gross profit expansion. You heard Dirk comment this morning on our continued momentum that we're gaining on operating expense and productivity. All of that will continue. I feel like we're in the very early innings of a lot of that work and that's what gives me great confidence and excitement for the new long range plan.\nDirk Locascio: I think, Lauren, what you continue to see is come to fruition this balance of the control the controllable focus that we've had. So solid top line growth not only in independents but healthcare and hospitality and overall growth and then our margin expansion has been sort of very strong and you see us EBITDA growth is one thing and we're very pleased with 13% but be able to get that down to EPS is important and we've leveraged that now for multiple quarters. In this quarter you saw from 13% EBITDA growth to 21% EPS growth. So please with that.\nLauren Silberman: Great, thanks. And just a follow-up on the independent case growth trends outside of the Southeast. Are you also seeing improvements in underlying traffic trends? Just trying to understand, are you communicating that you're currently running close to that super center organic?\nDave Flitman : No, I'd say we're running higher than that, Lauren. And yes, I think we've seen some acceleration really across the country in independent case growth. And I'm actually very encouraged. We talked last quarter about a little bit of the pucker factor, if you will, given the presidential election. We've got that behind us now. I see the consumer being in confidence a bit. And I think that means good things for 2025.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.\nJohn Heinbockel: Hey, Dave, can you talk to salesforce growth or expansion is running what about now, 5% or so? And maybe talk about productivity of recent cohorts. And then I think you're still, right, all of your, is all of the case growth coming from new accounts, do you -- are there any green shoots with regard to drop size?\nDave Flitman : Yes, John, good morning, and we're running in that mid-single digit as we expected to for the year. We'll see how that finishes for the year, but I will tell you, I talked to all of our new incoming sales training classes, we just had another one here Tuesday. We are bringing in very strong sales talent. I'm actually as excited as I've been since I've been here about our ability to bring in high quality new sellers, along with an increase in competitive sales talent here over the past several months. So I'm really excited about that. And yes, the lifeblood of our growth has been, and I think will continue to be new account generation. We're excited about that. But we're also managing loss. Well, penetration has been a challenge with the foot traffic. I wouldn't say we've seen any great acceleration in the penetration yet, although we have seen some green shoots here over the last three weeks, as I mentioned, as the overall case growth has begun to accelerate. So I think the consumer is going to gain more confidence. I think we'll get past those foot traffic challenges here soon and just continue to strengthen that momentum.\nJohn Heinbockel: And then where are we on the UMass rollout, right? And then I know you said warehouse productivity is up 3.5%. I don't know what you're seeing with regard to miles driven productivity. Is that sort of in the same range?\nDave Flitman : Yes, that's a big enabler in the delivery productivity. And I mentioned last quarter that we're basically back to pre-COVID levels with that. We're not quite back there yet in the warehouse, but we did see an acceleration in warehouse productivity from the second quarter to the third quarter. That's why I called that one out this morning in my prepared remarks. Very, very encouraged with what we're seeing, both in terms of reduction in stabilization and turnover and how that's translating to improve productivity. Dirk?\nDirk Locascio: Specific John, good morning, to your UMass, we've got 18 markets. So we've got six more. So it continues to roll out, it'll continue through 2025, continue to be pretty pleased with the results that we're seeing in that. It really is the foundation for a lot of the other things that we're driving in supply chain.\nDave Flitman : And it's having exactly the desired effect in terms of standardizing those operating practices and driving a consistent uplift in productivity across the company.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO.\nKelly Bania: Good morning. And thanks for taking our questions. I wanted to just ask a little bit about the COGS initiative. It sounds like that initiative continued to go quite well. I think you may be slightly exceeded your goals for this last three year plan, but can you just talk about the confidence in the plan there over the next three years, how vendors are reacting to your strategy there and working with you and just how volume dependent the savings could be there in the coming years and just a little bit more detail on that as you look to 2025?\nDave Flitman : Yes, so thanks for the question. Very confident in what we said we would deliver the new long range plan, which was $260 million over the three years. We just heard us wrapping up the year saying we're going to deliver $230 million. And importantly, Kelly, yes, this is a piece of work that we've been at for a very long time inside the company. And as I've commented previously, we do this in a highly collaborative manner with our vendors. We've been doing it for a long time. It's really a win-win approach in terms of our ability to outpace the market with market share gains and not just with independent restaurants, which is the most important piece, but also healthcare and hospitality. They want that volume growth. Everybody's looking for that growth and they're more than willing to engage with us and do this in a way that makes sense for both organizations. In fact, we just had our annual vendor report forum in the last couple of weeks, probably the best ever attended and a lot of excitement coming out of our vendor community about our future. So we feel great about it.\nKelly Bania: Great. That is helpful. And thank you on the healthcare business. You mentioned the new $100 million, I guess that came on during the quarter. Just can you elaborate on that and the pipeline that you have over the next couple of years in healthcare in particular and the capacity to take on those kinds of accounts?\nDirk Locascio: Sure, good morning, Kelly, it's Dirk. So we're pleased with that. We have always had a strong pipeline across both healthcare and hospitality. Healthcare, you're pretty familiar with, we've talked about as our leadership position there, and also largely because of the value that we can bring customers from both the partnership, the service model, as well as the economic value. So I'm confident that we can continue to grow at a rate that's very healthy and above market and gain share in each of those customer types. I think with healthcare you see at the almost 6% that we continue to grow, the thing that is good about growing with healthcare and hospitality is the same versus say over indexing on chain is, typically when you're bringing those customers on, they are buying the same product you already have in your distribution facilities. So they're far more capital effective than bringing on a lot of chain business. And that's why you see us continue to focus on over indexing with independent, healthcare and hospitality and being thoughtful and optimizing around changes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Carden with UBS.\nMark Carden: Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the questions. So I want to start off with Descartes. You're rolling that out now to some of your more impactful markets. How has that rollout gone relative to your expectations and any incremental learnings from your latest batch of markets?\nDave Flitman : Yes, Mark, good morning. It's going extremely well, and we were very thoughtful about how we rolled this out across the company. And that's why we spent a lot of time early on in those pilot markets, and there was a tremendous amount of learnings around that. And just as a recall there, you can't do this work without engaging your customers around delivery windows and all that. We've done a great job of getting ahead of that now as we've rolled Descartes out to new markets and actually doing that work before we bring the technology into the space. And it's really enabled a great dialogue with our customers, actually gotten them a lot more confident that we're going to deliver exactly in the window that they need and when we say we're going to deliver. And so that's why we're confident about rolling this thing out now as aggressively as we are. And we'll have half our miles on Descartes by the end of the year here and finish it up next year. So we're excited about it.\nMark Carden: Great. And then on hospitality, you've been benefiting from some nice new business wins. You guys are taking market share. How did overall hospitality industry demand shake out for 3Q relative to your expectations? Did you guys see much hurricane impact there? And how was your business with your existing customer base?\nDirk Locascio: Good morning, Mark. It's Dirk. So I'd say for the third quarter outside of sort of the underlying demand and the weather, it shook out largely as we expected. It had very similar impacts from the storms, from the overall underlying foot traffic, foot traffic impacts and hospitality often are pretty similar to what you see in the restaurant space. So we saw the same pressures and then similar start to the quarter and have seen the improvement that Dave talked about and independent and chain show up in hospitality as well. So we're encouraged. I think at the same time our team continues to be very active working the pipeline for that new business and again feel good just as I answered previous questions on our ability to grow and take share there as well as in healthcare.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great, thank you very much. Two questions. The first one just trying to clarify the total case growth for the full year is now 4% and 4.5% tempered from the 4% to 6%. I was hoping you could maybe prioritize what drove the reduction. I know weather was clearly a component, but in clarifying an earlier question, I think you said something was running currently greater than 2% case growth. So just trying to get at least directionally, sounds like 3Q is better than 2Q further improvement at 4Q all x the weather, just wanting if you could provide any specifics in terms of numbers to support kind of reacceleration you've seen through the third quarter into the fourth quarter.\nDirk Locascio: All right, Jeff, it\u2019s Dirk. It really the adjustment was a combination of the weather, as you pointed out, which toward the end of the third quarter and then to start of the fourth quarter and given our size in the Southeast, it had an impact on us. The second piece is the overall traffic environment in the third quarter, stay softer for longer, although we did see as we were coming out of the quarter before the storm hit, we saw some positive signs. And as Dave mentioned, we've seen that signs show up again in more recent weeks. So it's a combination of those things. But I think the important part is even during that period, we gain share in the quarter again, in each independent, healthcare and hospitality, which is our sort of a guidepost that it is sort of the macro environment and where the storms versus us losing share. I think the other thing it does is it sets us up to be confident in our ability to deliver what we committed for 2025.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Understood, right. And then in terms of the new wins, I know you highlighted healthcare and hospitality very encouraging. I'm wondering whether there's any big gains or changes, maybe accounts that you've given up with on restaurants or maybe how the pipeline is looking going into next year in terms of new business.\nDirk Locascio: Well, I mean, independent being smaller, that's always a constant pipeline and so that one when Dave talks about net new accounts where we're constantly winning and you're seeking to win a lot more than you lose in that and so our teams are doing that well given that we continue to grow and take share in an environment that the industry tells us is down from a traffic perspective. I think from a chain perspective, we've onboarded and our expectation is to continue to onboard some new business as we head into 2025. Pipeline remains very robust. We are thoughtful in what we're focused on for chain business but feel good about the pipeline there as we head into next year.\nDave Flitman : And the healthcare and hospitality pipelines remain very, very strong.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo.\nEdward Kelly: Hi. Good morning, guys. Nice quarter. I wanted to ask you, if you look at this quarter, right, like volume growth is a little soft because of obviously weather macro-related stuff, but you still delivered EBIT growth that's above the algo. As we think about to go forward into \u201825, and I'm not looking for guidance on \u201825, but what does the gross profit per case and the OpEx per case opportunity look like in \u201825 versus what you saw in \u201924. I want to ask that question because it certainly seems like industry volumes have the potential to get better, and you have clearly the potential to deliver better volume numbers that's shared. I'm just kind of curious, the composition of the P&L in this quarter, what it says about the outlook.\nDave Flitman : Yes, great point, and that's what gives me the excitement about entering 2025. The fact that the well-documented industry challenges, the devastating weather impacts that impacted so many people in the third and early part of the fourth quarter, and we still delivered our new algorithm just gives me great encouragement and confidence, importantly, that our team is ramping up the right activities. To your point on the GP per case and OpEx per case. As I said, we're in the early innings of this work. I think you can expect that work to continue roughly the way it did this year because our team's focused on it, and each quarter that goes by, and as we're ramping up these initiatives and we continue to deliver, just the momentum continues to build. Our team gets more confidence in these pieces of work and the way we're executing them, and I'm very encouraged going into 2025 in all parts of the P&L, including the top one.\nEdward Kelly: Yes, great. Just a quick follow-up on the share repo. I mean, you've talked about half of the $4 billion going to repo, but I mean, you did 25% of that this quarter, and then you're buying back more stock in Q4. How do we think about like the cadence of that repo? I mean it certainly seems like it may be end up being much more front-end loaded, and are you still targeting to take the leverage ratio down to the level that you talked about at the Investor Day?\nDave Flitman : Yes, well, thanks for the question. First of all, we did, we're doing in the back half of the year exactly what we told you we would do, which is lean in to share repurchases, given what we believe is a significant undervaluation in our shares. But importantly, what we delivered and bought back during the quarter doesn't impact the next algorithm at all. That $4 billion is between \u201825 and \u201927, okay. And if we generate above what we said there in terms of capital cash flow, it would just expect us to go roughly with half of what we generate, deploy to share repurchases. If you think about where the stock ought to be as we deliver that algo in 2027, we're still undervalued, significantly undervalued. And you heard me talk about all the confidence in the momentum that we have in the business. We'll lean in. And as we've also said, we'll toggle between M&A and share repurchases depending upon the M&A opportunity. And that pipeline remains strong. But as we said you really can't dictate the timeline of when those things are going to pop out of the pipeline. So what we're doing, we said we're confident in the algorithm we put forward, and we're going to continue to drive that outcome. Dirk, anything to add there?\nDirk Locascio: Just to reiterate what you said on the, again, that's one of the things we like so much about the share repurchase is that ability to toggle as M&A comes up. And in a particular quarter, where you may repurchase more or less depending on that. But we're pleased to have made a significant portion of repurchases given, as Dave said, the share value relative to what we expected to be the future.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Jake Bartlett with Truist Securities.\nJake Bartlett: Great. Thanks for taking the question. My first was just a clarification. I just want to make sure I have the trend right in terms of the near term and the cadence. So in the third quarter, organic independent case codes were 2.4. You're saying that that would have been roughly 3.4 without the impact of the hurricanes. Has the trend improved 100 basis points since that? So basically, you're running 4.4 in October. Is that the right way to think about it?\nDirk Locascio: Good morning, Jake. It's Dirk. Now, what it means is instead of the 2.4, after we got past the first couple of weeks of October with the storm impacts, it's been 100 basis points higher than what we had in Q2. So back to that mid-3.\nJake Bartlett: All right. So October is 100 basis points stronger than 2Q?\nDirk Locascio: The last, yes, three weeks or so.\nDave Flitman : Once we lapse the storms. And we're expecting them to continue to improve.\nJake Bartlett: Okay, got it. Just want to make sure I understood the trajectory, because it looked like you were just kind of benefiting from lapping the storms in the third quarter, but that's helpful. My other question is about just your operating cost efficiencies and productivity improved by 3.5%, which is great. Your long-term guidance is 3% to 5%. So, my question is the path, your visibility on the path towards more the middle or even the higher end of that 3% to 5% range. Is that something you're working towards and might we expect to see in \u201825, maybe some increased productivity gains, increased momentum on that side? What's the trajectory of the productivity gains?\nDirk Locascio: Hi, Jake. It\u2019s Dirk. So I'm not going to give specifics on 2025, but within that 3% to 5% is what our goal is. And the visibility, we have good visibility at what's driving it. And it's really all the things that we talked about on our June Investor Day. And it spans across supply chain people and non-people. It's across admin, across indirect spend savings. So each of those things, we will expect to drive the initiatives that will drive productivity. And our goal is to offset or largely offset the inflation that we face so that the strong growth profit gains that we generate flow through in the form of the 20-plus basis points of margin expansion that we've talked a lot about. And again, it comes back to that the concrete things that we are doing is why we believe it is so sustainable to continue to grow at a very healthy rate that we have and that we've talked about for the next three years.\nOperator: The next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG.\nPeter Saleh: Great. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on a strong quarter. I wanted to ask about the salesforce compensation. I think you guys made some changes earlier this year. It's been called, let's call it three quarters or so since that change. Can you just talk about how that's been received so far and if you're contemplating any other changes to the compensation structure in 2025?\nDave Flitman : Yes, great question. It's been received very well. I think our salesforce is excited. They understand the linkage between what we modified there. And again, the key pieces of those changes were relatively minor, but I think directionally exactly in line with what we expect to happen in terms of performance. That was to variablize more of their pay to increase them being very, very hungry. And secondly, to lean in more aggressively on our exclusive brands. So I always catch these as tweaks, and we didn't fundamentally change the structure. We just made some tweaks here to align with what we expect to have happen in our growth algorithm going forward. It's having the right outcome. The expected behavior changes are there. Our salesforce is excited, and we're growing it. And good things are going to happen here on the top line going forward.\nPeter Saleh: Understood. And then just, Dirk, real quick on the indirect costs, I think you mentioned $20 million of savings, or at least that may be the run rate. Are you still on track to achieve the, I think, $60 million of run rate savings by 2027 that you guys highlighted at the Investor Day?\nDirk Locascio: Good morning, Peter. Yes, we are. We're on track for that, and this work to achieve the $20 million this year has been underway. We've talked about it for, I've talked about it for a number of quarters, and as the, so the actual projects have come to fruition, and the savings have come in, pleased with the early start we have in 2024, and yes, well on our way to that $60 million plus.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Wolf with CL King.\nAndrew Wolf: Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to ask you to drill into the Pronto business a little. So it's a $700 million annualized run rate budget for this year. Obviously, it's still growing and maturing. Could you give us a sense of how much that is incremental, given it was in existence last year, but I'm sure less mature and so on, so we could maybe figure out the growth rate. Also, if you want to speak to your expectations going forward.\nDirk Locascio: Andrew, it\u2019s Dirk. Good morning. I'll start on that. So it's, I'd say, yes, 20% or so of it is incremental, it is a supplement to our existing. And we've talked about that being sort of an opportunity for up to a $1 billion or around $1 billion. But I'll tell you, that is really the penetration piece that we've talked about that Dave mentioned that has moved, just moved from two markets to six markets. It's contemplated pretty conservatively in there. So with the early positive results we're seeing there, I think there's a lot of runway probably potentially north of the $1 billion there. So that business and that opportunity to continue to access more of the new customers, plus our existing customers, we think has a lot of opportunity for growth for a number of years to come.\nDave Flitman : And Andy, as we said before, the [inaudible] is a Pronto penetration, it really opens up a part of the market that we're not able to compete against in our broad line business today that being the smaller delivery, more specialty suppliers. And again, we've got all those great products inside our distribution centers today, but before Pronto, we really didn't have the service model with those more frequent deliveries in those tight urban areas. And so now we've got that, and we were thoughtful about the piloting work that we did on the Pronto, okay, because we wanted to ensure, and that's why I commented this morning, that we weren't cannibalizing our core broadline business in any way, and we've proven that we're not now, and that's why we're excited and ramping up from two to six pilots there. So I couldn't be more excited or pleased with the progress we're making with Pronto.\nAndrew Wolf: Great. I just want to clarify on penetration. So it's your existing broadline customer. It's not really a Pronto customer. And secondly, it's a different kind of product, like a specialty product, not like a fill-in. Like we need more catch-up or something.\nDave Flitman : Well, first of all, it's, we had this model for a few years now and until this year, it was exclusively to go after new customers. We did not allow our existing broad line customers to lean in on Pronto. Now we are, and yes, we compete against, when you think about specialty suppliers, think about produce, think about seafood, think about pure meat specialty suppliers. Again, we've got all those products. But if we've got that truck going to the customer and they run out of core item, that's not a specialty product, we're happy to throw it on the Pronto truck. We're going to be there. So it's really going to open up some additional volume growth that incrementally we weren't able to gain with our existing customers.\nAndrew Wolf: Okay, so the real governors have to be within the route, more or less, to make it economically viable?\nDave Flitman : It's 100% economically viable. And again, the customers who bought from specialty suppliers, they're used to paying a premium for that service. And as we've said before, Andy, Pronto is at or above the margin for all that we've got in our broadline business. So I'm not concerned about profitability at all there.\nOperator: We'll take the final question from John Ivankoe with JP Morgan.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi, great, thank you. I wanted to revisit the underlying assumption of local case volumes, which I think was 2% on a market level. And you guys thought that you would do 5% to 8%, in other words, outperforming kind of the base. So I wanted to ask a couple of questions. One, do you still feel good about that 2%, especially for what we've learned this week? What are the really important macro factors that we should look at that could potentially drive a return to 2% local growth? And as we think about your outperformance is getting back to 5% to 8% type of growth, does that happen regardless of the baseline assumption or should we just focus on 2.5x to 4x to market as we think about our own assumptions over the next couple of years?\nDave Flitman : Yes, John. Thanks for the question. There's a lot to unpack and let me try to do my best. So yes, back in June, we had a core base assumption of about 2% market growth over time. And again, that wasn't aimed at any quarter or any particular year, but we thought over the three year period of time, that was a reasonable assumption because historically that's about what the market growth has been. And so yes, I'm confident in the 5% to 8% range. I'm confident in our ability to do that, even if the market's a little bit size, we're in that 1% to 2% range and market growth, I'm confident of that. And I point to a couple of things as we've talked about all year. First of all, the elections behind us. The consumers had a lot of inflation over the past several years. Interest rates are starting to come down. I think we're going to see continued return to normal kind of consumer activity as we go into the future. And the other thing I just wrap that with, that underscores my confidence. If you look in 2023, in all four quarters of 2023, we were at or above the targeted range, okay. And we hit first quarter of this year. Don't forget we had a strike that impacted more than 20 of our DCs in the first quarter on top of a pretty significant weather impact in January. By the way, we still gained share in the first quarter. We entered second quarter with foot traffic challenges. The foot traffic got worse. We had storms in the third quarter. Been a lot of noise over the last couple of quarters. I'm encouraged by what we're working on. I'm encouraged by the enthusiasm and our additions to the salesforce. I am 100% confident in our 5 %to 8% range in 2025 to 2027.\nOperator: That concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the conference back over to Dave Flitman for the closing remarks.\nDave Flitman : Thanks, Roschelle. Thank you all for joining us today. Look, this was another quarter that underscores the momentum that our team is delivering, regardless of the macro, regardless of what the weather impacts are. I couldn't be more excited about the momentum we have in the company and our ability to deliver what we say we're going to do over the next three years. Thanks for joining us. Have a great week.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dirk Locascio",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Our double digit adjusted EBITDA growth is the result of consistent execution for our strategy to capture market share and expand margins. Starting on slide 11, third quarter net sales increased 6.8% to $9.7 billion driven by total case volume growth of 3.8% and food cost inflation and mixed impact of 3%. We drove solid case growth and cash flow share gains in each of our target customer types. Our independent restaurant volume grew 4.1% including 170 basis points from acquisitions. Healthcare growth remained strong at 5.7% and hospitality growth accelerated further to 3% as we onboarded new business. Adjusted EBITDA were 13.2% from the prior year to $455 million and we expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 27 basis points to 4.7%. As we continue to execute our profitable growth strategy and proactively manage gross margin and operating expenses, we see these actions drive margin expansion. During the third quarter, as Dave mentioned, we made further progress on our strategic vendor management work and now expect to achieve more than $230 million in cost of goods savings from 2022 through the end of this year. We also remain on track to realize the $120 million of annualized operating expense savings that we highlighted last quarter, and we are on track to deliver more than $20 million in savings this year from the indirect spend work that we previously discussed. This highlights our team's strong ability to execute initiatives regardless of the macro environment. We are pulling the appropriate levels to sustainably grow gross profit rate and drive operating expense productivity. As a reminder, a significant portion of our operating costs are structured as variable to provide us flexibility to match expense to volume in different market scenarios. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS increased 21.4% to $0.85, demonstrating our ability to grow adjusted diluted EPS meaningfully faster than adjusted EBITDA. We expect this to continue as we deploy our strong free cash flow towards share repurchases, which I'll talk more about shortly. Moving to slide 12, we made significant progress in growing adjusted gross profit per case faster than adjusted operating expense per case again this quarter. Adjusted gross profit per case grew by $0.24 or more than 3% versus prior year. This growth was primarily driven by executing initiatives within our control, including our strategic vendor management work and continued focus on private label penetration. Adjusted operating expense per case increased $0.04 or less than 1%. We're offsetting a significant portion of operating cost inflation with productivity, including improving supply chain productivity, streamlining administrative processes and costs, and realizing indirect spend procurement savings. This all led to adjusted EBITDA per case of $2.12, up $0.17 or 8.7% from the prior year. We expect continued adjusted EBITDA per case growth as we execute our initiatives. Moving on to slide 13, our strong cash flow generation was evident again this quarter. Year-to-date, we've generated $891 million of operating cash flow and $658 million of free cash flow driven by increased profitability and disciplined working capital management. Our robust cash flow creates financial flexibility to deploy capital strategically, enabling us to invest in the business for growth and return capital to shareholders via shared purchases. We invested $236 million in cash CapEx for the first nine months, mainly focused on projects to support growth, including information technology, property and equipment, as well as maintenance of our distributing facilities. During the quarter, we significantly accelerated the pace of share repurchases in line with our commentary last quarter and repurchased 10.4 million shares for a total of $580 million. In the fourth quarter today through November 4th, we purchased an additional $160 million of shares. We have $238 million of remaining funds authorized under our $1 billion share repurchase program. We will remain disciplined in continuing to execute our share repurchase program in addition to continued investment in the business for organic growth and opportunistic tuck-in M&A. Turning to net leverage on slide 14, we ended the quarter at 2.8x net leverage within our 2x to 3x target range. Net leverage is unchanged from yearend, even with the significant share repurchases this quarter. Subsequent to quarter end, we addressed the net maturity and our debt structure. We issued $500 million in senior notes due 2033 at 5.75% and use the proceeds to repay a portion of our term loan facilities. We also extended the maturity of the remaining balance of our term loan due 2026 to 2031, lowered the interest rate margin on both of our term loan facilities by 25 basis points, and eliminated the credit spread adjustment of 11 basis points on the facility due 2031. As a result of this, we capture approximately $9 million in annualized interest savings. Our debt structure is strong, and we have no long-term debt maturities until 2028. With that, let me now turn to our updated outlook for 2024 on slide 15. Given our year-to-date performance and outlook for the remainder of the year, we're updating our fiscal year 2024 guidance. We now expect net sales to be in a range of $37.7 billion to $38 billion. We're increasing the bottom end of our adjusted EBITDA range to $1.72 billion to $1.74 billion. Finally, we're tightening our adjusted diluted EPS range to $3.05 to $3.15. Moving to modeling assumptions. For 2024, given the continued soft macro environment and the unanticipated hurricane impacts, we now expect total case growth of 4% to 4.5%. We're also updating our sales inflation assumption, which includes mix, to a range of 2% to 2.5%. Interest expenses projected to be lower than our previous forecast and is now expected to be in the range of $310 million to $320 million. Finally, depreciation and amortization are at the higher end of our range, partially due to M&A, and is now projected to be in the range of $435 million to $445 million. Despite the softer macro backdrop, we continue to strengthen our execution and remain confident in our ability to grow volume, gain share with target customer types, increase profitability, and return capital to shareholders. I'm pleased with our strong progress this year as we've driven balanced profitable growth. We remain well positioned to achieve our current long-range plan in 2024 financial targets, and I look forward to getting off to a strong start to our next long-range plan beginning in 2025. With that, I'll now pass it back to Dave for his closing remarks. I think, Lauren, what you continue to see is come to fruition this balance of the control the controllable focus that we've had. So solid top line growth not only in independents but healthcare and hospitality and overall growth and then our margin expansion has been sort of very strong and you see us EBITDA growth is one thing and we're very pleased with 13% but be able to get that down to EPS is important and we've leveraged that now for multiple quarters. In this quarter you saw from 13% EBITDA growth to 21% EPS growth. So please with that. Specific John, good morning, to your UMass, we've got 18 markets. So we've got six more. So it continues to roll out, it'll continue through 2025, continue to be pretty pleased with the results that we're seeing in that. It really is the foundation for a lot of the other things that we're driving in supply chain. Sure, good morning, Kelly, it's Dirk. So we're pleased with that. We have always had a strong pipeline across both healthcare and hospitality. Healthcare, you're pretty familiar with, we've talked about as our leadership position there, and also largely because of the value that we can bring customers from both the partnership, the service model, as well as the economic value. So I'm confident that we can continue to grow at a rate that's very healthy and above market and gain share in each of those customer types. I think with healthcare you see at the almost 6% that we continue to grow, the thing that is good about growing with healthcare and hospitality is the same versus say over indexing on chain is, typically when you're bringing those customers on, they are buying the same product you already have in your distribution facilities. So they're far more capital effective than bringing on a lot of chain business. And that's why you see us continue to focus on over indexing with independent, healthcare and hospitality and being thoughtful and optimizing around changes. Good morning, Mark. It's Dirk. So I'd say for the third quarter outside of sort of the underlying demand and the weather, it shook out largely as we expected. It had very similar impacts from the storms, from the overall underlying foot traffic, foot traffic impacts and hospitality often are pretty similar to what you see in the restaurant space. So we saw the same pressures and then similar start to the quarter and have seen the improvement that Dave talked about and independent and chain show up in hospitality as well. So we're encouraged. I think at the same time our team continues to be very active working the pipeline for that new business and again feel good just as I answered previous questions on our ability to grow and take share there as well as in healthcare. All right, Jeff, it's Dirk. It really the adjustment was a combination of the weather, as you pointed out, which toward the end of the third quarter and then to start of the fourth quarter and given our size in the Southeast, it had an impact on us. The second piece is the overall traffic environment in the third quarter, stay softer for longer, although we did see as we were coming out of the quarter before the storm hit, we saw some positive signs. And as Dave mentioned, we've seen that signs show up again in more recent weeks. So it's a combination of those things. But I think the important part is even during that period, we gain share in the quarter again, in each independent, healthcare and hospitality, which is our sort of a guidepost that it is sort of the macro environment and where the storms versus us losing share. I think the other thing it does is it sets us up to be confident in our ability to deliver what we committed for 2025. Well, I mean, independent being smaller, that's always a constant pipeline and so that one when Dave talks about net new accounts where we're constantly winning and you're seeking to win a lot more than you lose in that and so our teams are doing that well given that we continue to grow and take share in an environment that the industry tells us is down from a traffic perspective. I think from a chain perspective, we've onboarded and our expectation is to continue to onboard some new business as we head into 2025. Pipeline remains very robust. We are thoughtful in what we're focused on for chain business but feel good about the pipeline there as we head into next year. Just to reiterate what you said on the, again, that's one of the things we like so much about the share repurchase is that ability to toggle as M&A comes up. And in a particular quarter, where you may repurchase more or less depending on that. But we're pleased to have made a significant portion of repurchases given, as Dave said, the share value relative to what we expected to be the future. Good morning, Jake. It's Dirk. Now, what it means is instead of the 2.4, after we got past the first couple of weeks of October with the storm impacts, it's been 100 basis points higher than what we had in Q2. So back to that mid-3. The last, yes, three weeks or so. Hi, Jake. It's Dirk. So I'm not going to give specifics on 2025, but within that 3% to 5% is what our goal is. And the visibility, we have good visibility at what's driving it. And it's really all the things that we talked about on our June Investor Day. And it spans across supply chain people and non-people. It's across admin, across indirect spend savings. So each of those things, we will expect to drive the initiatives that will drive productivity. And our goal is to offset or largely offset the inflation that we face so that the strong growth profit gains that we generate flow through in the form of the 20-plus basis points of margin expansion that we've talked a lot about. And again, it comes back to that the concrete things that we are doing is why we believe it is so sustainable to continue to grow at a very healthy rate that we have and that we've talked about for the next three years. Good morning, Peter. Yes, we are. We're on track for that, and this work to achieve the $20 million this year has been underway. We've talked about it for, I've talked about it for a number of quarters, and as the, so the actual projects have come to fruition, and the savings have come in, pleased with the early start we have in 2024, and yes, well on our way to that $60 million plus. Andrew, it's Dirk. Good morning. I'll start on that. So it's, I'd say, yes, 20% or so of it is incremental, it is a supplement to our existing. And we've talked about that being sort of an opportunity for up to a $1 billion or around $1 billion. But I'll tell you, that is really the penetration piece that we've talked about that Dave mentioned that has moved, just moved from two markets to six markets. It's contemplated pretty conservatively in there. So with the early positive results we're seeing there, I think there's a lot of runway probably potentially north of the $1 billion there. So that business and that opportunity to continue to access more of the new customers, plus our existing customers, we think has a lot of opportunity for growth for a number of years to come."

            "name": "Dave Flitman",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, our thoughts are with all of our associates, customers, and communities impacted by Hurricane Helene and Milton, which have each caused catastrophic devastation across parts of the Southeast. We are grateful to our local teams for their unwavering commitment to aiding recovery efforts and continuing to serve the community through countless hours of volunteering and donations during this difficult time. Thankfully, all of our associates are safe, but many suffer damage to their homes and property. I'll briefly highlight one of our associates who have gone above and beyond to make a difference in North Carolina during these trying times. Josh Hoge is a salesman for U.S. Foods and local to Boone County. He gathered volunteers to provide a wide variety of grassroots release support. He and others coordinated a GoFundMe page that raised more than $400,000 in donations for those impacted, deployed 11 truckloads of food donations gathered with the support of local organizations and businesses, including U.S. Foods, organized the purchase and delivery of 40 generators to impacted areas. Thank you, Josh, for your incredible efforts and to all our associates who have helped and continue to help our customers and communities during this challenging time. Now, let's turn our results from the third quarter. I will then update you on core initiatives across each of our four strategic pillars before passing into Dirk to review our financial results and provide an update to our fiscal year 2024 guidance. Turning slide 4, we delivered 13% adjusted EBITDA growth, solid adjusted EBITDA margin expansion and 21% adjusted EPS growth as we continue to deploy our proven operational playbook and execute our strategic initiatives. We delivered another quarter of strong results despite a challenging macro environment and unforeseen weather related impacts, which pressured industry case volumes. This is a real testament to our team's focus, our execution and our ability to control the controllables. We drove volume growth and captured market share in our target customer types of independent restaurants, healthcare and hospitality. Total volume grew 3.8%, while our independent restaurant cases grew 4.1%, which resulted in our 14th consecutive quarter of market share gains. Moving to capital deployment, we were prudently aggressive with share repurchases this quarter, totaling $580 million. We will continue to execute buybacks as we believe our shares remain undervalued. Since initiating our buyback program in late 2022, we have repurchased over $1.1 billion of our shares at an average price of $50.68 and will continue to be good stewards of capital deployment. Let's turn to the broader macro and our focus on our target customer types. In addition to the softer macro environment, there were several large storms in the third quarter that adversely impacted our Southeast business where we over-index on independent restaurant market share. The impact from the slower Southeast growth was nearly a 100-basis point headwind to independent volume growth. In excluding the Southeast, our organic independent volume growth was modestly higher than our second quarter growth rate. Monthly foot traffic was down approximately 3.5% for the third quarter but sequentially improved throughout the quarter. And once we got past the storm impacts in the early part of the fourth quarter, we have seen further improvement, which is translated to an approximately 100 basis point acceleration in our organic independent case growth. We are also seeing a similar improvement in our chain, same store volume. Our go-to-market strategy, including team-based selling, innovation and digital, combined with our operational playbook, enable us to capture profitable market share no matter what external factors come our way. And despite the challenges I just outlined, we were quite pleased to grow independent market share in the third quarter, both sequentially and year-over-year, at a faster rate than we did in the second quarter. Let's move now to our four strategic pillars. I'll discuss our progress on each, starting with slide 5. Our first pillar is culture. Our focus and top priority are always the safety of our associates. During the quarter, our injury and accident rates were 21% better than the prior year. While we continue to make incremental progress each quarter, we will not rest until we have zero injuries for our associates. This year, we supported the American Red Cross with a donation of $300,000 to support disaster relief efforts, including Hurricane Helene and Milton. Our U.S. Foods teams also sent thousands of cases of product to disaster relief organizations across the impacted footprint. Additionally, we announced a national partnership with the Military Family Advisory Network, or MFAN, this July, and made a $250,000 contribution. This organization's mission is to understand and amplify the needs of military-connected families who face food insecurity. Our contribution will help MFAN distribute 500 pantry restock boxes per month, designed to get transferred military families started in their new homes, with essential items typically discarded during a movement. The MFAN collaboration is our first national hunger relief partnership supporting military families, a group disproportionately impacted by food insecurity. Turning to slide 6, our second pillar service. Again this quarter, we delivered year-over-year improvement with on-time and in full service levels. We also remain focused on delivering improved distribution productivity through our Descartes Routing technology, which is now live in 15 markets. By yearend, we expect to launch an additional 11 markets and remain on track to have approximately 50% of our routed miles on the cart. We continue to see this technology produce incremental improvement in cases per month. And we continue to enhance the user experience of our proprietary leading digital platform MOXe\u0304, which enables our customers to place orders, track deliveries, pay bills, and seamlessly manage inventory. Given the significant portion of total cost that food represents for our customers, we introduced a new food cost calculator feature embedded into MOXe\u0304. This tool tracks and manages food costs over time, providing customers with valuable insights to help them with their menu prices, inventory, and product selection. This innovative solution is available to all U.S. Foods customers and further enhances our digital leadership position. Now let's turn to growth, our growth pillar on slide 7. Pronto, our small truck delivery service, continues to gain steam and is now live in 40 markets. We're excited about this rapidly growing opportunity and its ability to reach hard-to-service customers in dense geographies. Pronto provides these previously untapped customers for U.S. Foods with smaller, more frequent deliveries and later cutoff times. Earlier this year, we launched Pronto penetration in two pilot markets. This service fills in non-routine delivery days for our existing independent restaurant customers, leading to further wallet share for U.S. Foods. In these pilot markets, we are seeing an approximate 20% uplift in case volumes, while showing no cannibalization in broad line delivery size or frequency. The successful launch and early learnings gave us confidence to expand Pronto penetration from two pilot markets to six. We remain on track for Pronto delivered nearly $700 million of annualized sales this year. Moving to national sales, our targeted business development activity drove new wins during the quarter, and we onboarded more than $100 million in annualized sales in healthcare and hospitality. Finally, in September, we launched our Scoop theme to Barn, Grill, and Beyond. Our Fall Scoop highlights 24 new on-trend products designed by U.S. Foods product development experts who leverage a wealth of culinary expertise, industry experience, and data-driven insights to bring new product innovation to our private label brands. Many of you saw this in action on our Investor Day last June. My favorite from the Fall lineup is the Chef's Line Natural Smoked Pork Butt, which tastes amazing and is pre-packaged in a boiling bag and saves customers approximately 40 minutes of labor per case. Turning to slide 8, our profit pillar. Our go-to-market strategy and strong execution drove a 7% increase in adjusted gross profit to $1.7 billion. This was primarily driven by total case volume growth and improved costs of goods sold. We grew adjusted gross profit 240 basis points faster than adjusted operating expense, driving a 27 basis point of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. We also made additional progress on cost of goods through our strategic vendor management efforts, realizing more than $70 million year-to-date. We now expect to deliver more than $230 million in cost of goods savings in our current 2022 to 2024 long range plan, which is nearly complete. On the productivity front, we delivered 3.5% improvement in warehouse productivity in line with our goal of 3% to 5% annual productivity gains to offset wage inflation. Regarding CHEF'STORE, a quick update. As a reminder, we are actively exploring strategic alternatives for this business and have recently begun discussions with several potential buyers. We remain fully committed to supporting the business, our associates, and our customers through this process. And we will continue to keep you informed as we make further progress. As we have previously said, in the event of a sale, we would expect to deploy the majority of the proceeds to repurchasing shares. Before I hand it over to Dirk, in September, the International Food Service Distributors Association inducted 20 US Food drivers into its Truck Driver Hall of Fame. This honor recognizes the food service industry's top drivers that are exceptional safety record and length of service, each with more than 25 years of service at U.S. Foods. It's a highly coveted honor for truck drivers in our industry. With Veterans Day just around the corner, I want to highlight two of the Hall of Fame drivers, both of whom are veterans that serve in the US Armed Forces and hail from our Fort Mill, South Carolina facility. The first is Orlando Smith, who has 30 years of service at U.S. Foods. The second, Larry Boyer, who has been a driver for us for 34 years. I thank them both not only for their decades of service to our company, but especially for the bravery and courage in serving and protecting our great nation. Finally, I also thank all veterans within and outside of U.S. Foods who have served our country and protected our freedom. We owe you all a huge debt of gratitude that can never be repaid. Let me now turn the call over to Dirk to discuss our third quarter results in more detail and our updated 2024 guidance. Thanks Dirk. Not only are we a market leader, but we have significant, sustainable, competitive advantages that position us well to win in any environment, as we are demonstrating. We are the only, pure play, U.S. only, food service distributor with national scale. Our focus is to grow volume and gain share with the highest value customer types in the industry, independent restaurants, healthcare, hospitality. We are focused on executing and delivering the outcomes of our new long-range plan, which comprehends significant upside from our self-help initiatives. Many of these are in the early innings of deployment and have a long runway of profitable growth. We are the industry leader in digital innovation and have built a strong competitive advantage that we will maintain. And we are confident in achieving our 2025 to 2027 long range plan. As a reminder, our growth algorithm introduced in our June Investor Day includes a 5% sales growth CAGR, 10% adjusted EBITDA growth CAGR, at least 20 basis points of annual adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, and a 20% adjusted diluted EPS growth CAGR. This will generate at least $4 billion of capital to deploy against our capital allocation priorities over the three year period, including approximately half towards buying back stock. Our third quarter results of net sales growth of 6.8%, 13% adjusted EBITDA growth, a 27 basis point increase in adjusted EBITDA margin and a 21% adjusted EPS growth affirm my strong conviction that we have the right strategies in place to deliver our next long-range plan. And our team is 100% aligned and excited about our future and the ability to achieve exactly what we say we're going to do over the next three years. Finally, I sincerely thank each of our 30,000 associates for their dedication for executing and disturbing our customers well as we continue to pursue our ambition to become the undisputed best in the industry. And with that, Roschelle, please open up the line for questions. Yes, we're excited about our private label brands. Good morning, Brian. We've had continued increase in penetration there, particularly with our independent restaurants. We're running roughly 52%. And as I say all the time to our team and externally to you guys, there's no barrier to increasing that. I see no near-term ceiling. I talked a little bit here this morning about our new Scoop launch. We're leading in innovation. Very strong adoption in all those products. We continue to take those products really across the portfolio and all of our customer types and we've got great momentum. Yes, we're encouraged by what we've seen and just a little context. The foot traffic challenges are well-documented, really beginning in the second quarter of this year. Importantly, foot traffic decelerated in the third quarter. You heard me say this morning that our market share gains actually accelerated. We had a hurricane last week in September. We had another one in early October, and once we cleared all of that, I'm very encouraged by the momentum that we've seen more than 100 basis point acceleration in case growth, both, as you mentioned, with our independent restaurants and also chains. And importantly our healthcare and hospitality where we took share again this quarter, and are differentiated portfolio remain very strong, both of those have very strong pipelines and I couldn't be more excited about the way we're going to finish the year and what that means for 2025. No, we really haven't pulled anything forward, Lauren. As we've been doing for a long time now, we're just continuing to execute that portfolio initiative of initiatives that we have which really span the entire spectrum of the P&L from top line to gross profit expansion. You heard Dirk comment this morning on our continued momentum that we're gaining on operating expense and productivity. All of that will continue. I feel like we're in the very early innings of a lot of that work and that's what gives me great confidence and excitement for the new long range plan. No, I'd say we're running higher than that, Lauren. And yes, I think we've seen some acceleration really across the country in independent case growth. And I'm actually very encouraged. We talked last quarter about a little bit of the pucker factor, if you will, given the presidential election. We've got that behind us now. I see the consumer being in confidence a bit. And I think that means good things for 2025. Yes, John, good morning, and we're running in that mid-single digit as we expected to for the year. We'll see how that finishes for the year, but I will tell you, I talked to all of our new incoming sales training classes, we just had another one here Tuesday. We are bringing in very strong sales talent. I'm actually as excited as I've been since I've been here about our ability to bring in high quality new sellers, along with an increase in competitive sales talent here over the past several months. So I'm really excited about that. And yes, the lifeblood of our growth has been, and I think will continue to be new account generation. We're excited about that. But we're also managing loss. Well, penetration has been a challenge with the foot traffic. I wouldn't say we've seen any great acceleration in the penetration yet, although we have seen some green shoots here over the last three weeks, as I mentioned, as the overall case growth has begun to accelerate. So I think the consumer is going to gain more confidence. I think we'll get past those foot traffic challenges here soon and just continue to strengthen that momentum. Yes, that's a big enabler in the delivery productivity. And I mentioned last quarter that we're basically back to pre-COVID levels with that. We're not quite back there yet in the warehouse, but we did see an acceleration in warehouse productivity from the second quarter to the third quarter. That's why I called that one out this morning in my prepared remarks. Very, very encouraged with what we're seeing, both in terms of reduction in stabilization and turnover and how that's translating to improve productivity. Dirk? And it's having exactly the desired effect in terms of standardizing those operating practices and driving a consistent uplift in productivity across the company. Yes, so thanks for the question. Very confident in what we said we would deliver the new long range plan, which was $260 million over the three years. We just heard us wrapping up the year saying we're going to deliver $230 million. And importantly, Kelly, yes, this is a piece of work that we've been at for a very long time inside the company. And as I've commented previously, we do this in a highly collaborative manner with our vendors. We've been doing it for a long time. It's really a win-win approach in terms of our ability to outpace the market with market share gains and not just with independent restaurants, which is the most important piece, but also healthcare and hospitality. They want that volume growth. Everybody's looking for that growth and they're more than willing to engage with us and do this in a way that makes sense for both organizations. In fact, we just had our annual vendor report forum in the last couple of weeks, probably the best ever attended and a lot of excitement coming out of our vendor community about our future. So we feel great about it. Yes, Mark, good morning. It's going extremely well, and we were very thoughtful about how we rolled this out across the company. And that's why we spent a lot of time early on in those pilot markets, and there was a tremendous amount of learnings around that. And just as a recall there, you can't do this work without engaging your customers around delivery windows and all that. We've done a great job of getting ahead of that now as we've rolled Descartes out to new markets and actually doing that work before we bring the technology into the space. And it's really enabled a great dialogue with our customers, actually gotten them a lot more confident that we're going to deliver exactly in the window that they need and when we say we're going to deliver. And so that's why we're confident about rolling this thing out now as aggressively as we are. And we'll have half our miles on Descartes by the end of the year here and finish it up next year. So we're excited about it. And the healthcare and hospitality pipelines remain very, very strong. Yes, great point, and that's what gives me the excitement about entering 2025. The fact that the well-documented industry challenges, the devastating weather impacts that impacted so many people in the third and early part of the fourth quarter, and we still delivered our new algorithm just gives me great encouragement and confidence, importantly, that our team is ramping up the right activities. To your point on the GP per case and OpEx per case. As I said, we're in the early innings of this work. I think you can expect that work to continue roughly the way it did this year because our team's focused on it, and each quarter that goes by, and as we're ramping up these initiatives and we continue to deliver, just the momentum continues to build. Our team gets more confidence in these pieces of work and the way we're executing them, and I'm very encouraged going into 2025 in all parts of the P&L, including the top one. Yes, well, thanks for the question. First of all, we did, we're doing in the back half of the year exactly what we told you we would do, which is lean in to share repurchases, given what we believe is a significant undervaluation in our shares. But importantly, what we delivered and bought back during the quarter doesn't impact the next algorithm at all. That $4 billion is between \u201825 and '27, okay. And if we generate above what we said there in terms of capital cash flow, it would just expect us to go roughly with half of what we generate, deploy to share repurchases. If you think about where the stock ought to be as we deliver that algo in 2027, we're still undervalued, significantly undervalued. And you heard me talk about all the confidence in the momentum that we have in the business. We'll lean in. And as we've also said, we'll toggle between M&A and share repurchases depending upon the M&A opportunity. And that pipeline remains strong. But as we said you really can't dictate the timeline of when those things are going to pop out of the pipeline. So what we're doing, we said we're confident in the algorithm we put forward, and we're going to continue to drive that outcome. Dirk, anything to add there? Once we lapse the storms. And we're expecting them to continue to improve. Yes, great question. It's been received very well. I think our salesforce is excited. They understand the linkage between what we modified there. And again, the key pieces of those changes were relatively minor, but I think directionally exactly in line with what we expect to happen in terms of performance. That was to variablize more of their pay to increase them being very, very hungry. And secondly, to lean in more aggressively on our exclusive brands. So I always catch these as tweaks, and we didn't fundamentally change the structure. We just made some tweaks here to align with what we expect to have happen in our growth algorithm going forward. It's having the right outcome. The expected behavior changes are there. Our salesforce is excited, and we're growing it. And good things are going to happen here on the top line going forward. And Andy, as we said before, the [inaudible] is a Pronto penetration, it really opens up a part of the market that we're not able to compete against in our broad line business today that being the smaller delivery, more specialty suppliers. And again, we've got all those great products inside our distribution centers today, but before Pronto, we really didn't have the service model with those more frequent deliveries in those tight urban areas. And so now we've got that, and we were thoughtful about the piloting work that we did on the Pronto, okay, because we wanted to ensure, and that's why I commented this morning, that we weren't cannibalizing our core broadline business in any way, and we've proven that we're not now, and that's why we're excited and ramping up from two to six pilots there. So I couldn't be more excited or pleased with the progress we're making with Pronto. Well, first of all, it's, we had this model for a few years now and until this year, it was exclusively to go after new customers. We did not allow our existing broad line customers to lean in on Pronto. Now we are, and yes, we compete against, when you think about specialty suppliers, think about produce, think about seafood, think about pure meat specialty suppliers. Again, we've got all those products. But if we've got that truck going to the customer and they run out of core item, that's not a specialty product, we're happy to throw it on the Pronto truck. We're going to be there. So it's really going to open up some additional volume growth that incrementally we weren't able to gain with our existing customers. It's 100% economically viable. And again, the customers who bought from specialty suppliers, they're used to paying a premium for that service. And as we've said before, Andy, Pronto is at or above the margin for all that we've got in our broadline business. So I'm not concerned about profitability at all there. Yes, John. Thanks for the question. There's a lot to unpack and let me try to do my best. So yes, back in June, we had a core base assumption of about 2% market growth over time. And again, that wasn't aimed at any quarter or any particular year, but we thought over the three year period of time, that was a reasonable assumption because historically that's about what the market growth has been. And so yes, I'm confident in the 5% to 8% range. I'm confident in our ability to do that, even if the market's a little bit size, we're in that 1% to 2% range and market growth, I'm confident of that. And I point to a couple of things as we've talked about all year. First of all, the elections behind us. The consumers had a lot of inflation over the past several years. Interest rates are starting to come down. I think we're going to see continued return to normal kind of consumer activity as we go into the future. And the other thing I just wrap that with, that underscores my confidence. If you look in 2023, in all four quarters of 2023, we were at or above the targeted range, okay. And we hit first quarter of this year. Don't forget we had a strike that impacted more than 20 of our DCs in the first quarter on top of a pretty significant weather impact in January. By the way, we still gained share in the first quarter. We entered second quarter with foot traffic challenges. The foot traffic got worse. We had storms in the third quarter. Been a lot of noise over the last couple of quarters. I'm encouraged by what we're working on. I'm encouraged by the enthusiasm and our additions to the salesforce. I am 100% confident in our 5 %to 8% range in 2025 to 2027. Thanks, Roschelle. Thank you all for joining us today. Look, this was another quarter that underscores the momentum that our team is delivering, regardless of the macro, regardless of what the weather impacts are. I couldn't be more excited about the momentum we have in the company and our ability to deliver what we say we're going to do over the next three years. Thanks for joining us. Have a great week."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we turn to our second quarter results, I would like to thank everyone who joined our Investor Day in June. It was a great event, and we were excited to share our story, future goals and our ambition to become the undisputed best in our industry, the safest, the fastest growing, the most profitable, leading digital and the best place to work. Importantly, we laid out our financial algorithm for 2025 through 2027, which includes growing sales at a 5% CAGR, increasing adjusted EBITDA at a 10% CAGR, expanding adjusted EBITDA margin by at least 20 basis points per year and growing adjusted diluted EPS 20% annually. We also expect to deploy more than $4 billion of capital over that same period and anticipate approximately half of that will be deployed towards share repurchases. We remain excited about our path ahead. During today's call, I will share several of our accomplishments from the second quarter and update you on key initiatives across each of our 4 strategic pillars. Then Dirk will review our second quarter financial results and our fiscal year 2024 guidance. Turning to Slide 4. In the second quarter, we delivered record EBITDA, driven by a combination of top line growth and margin expansion as our gross profit grew significantly faster than our operating expenses. Our team's success this quarter further emphasizes the strength of our operating model and our ability to control the controllables. This balance of top line growth, gross profit expansion and cost productivity, led to significant adjusted EBITDA and EPS growth, along with a record adjusted EBITDA margin of 5%. Importantly, these results are underpinned by our strong capital structure. We also continue our disciplined approach to capital deployment. As we announced at our Investor Day, our Board authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program in early June. Dirk will provide a status of our repurchases in more detail. We do expect to be more aggressive buying back our shares over the balance of this year. Let's turn to broader industry trends and the health of our markets. Restaurant foot traffic remained pressured during the second quarter and was down approximately 3%. Despite the current headwinds facing our industry, our team captured profitable market share and target customer types, as we focused on executing our playbook. Specifically, our independent restaurant share increased for the 13th consecutive quarter, and our share gains improved sequentially each month throughout the second quarter. Our strategy is exceeding as evidenced by our volume growth and share gains. Our team's work remains guided by our 4 strategic pillars. And I will discuss our progress on each of them over the next few slides. Turning to Slide 6. Our first pillar is culture. Keeping our associates safe is paramount. During the second quarter, our injury and accident rates were 19% better than the prior year and were our best results since 2020. We remain focused on improving our safety performance as we strive to achieve zero injuries. We published our 2023 sustainability report in the second quarter, highlighting progress in our 3 key focus areas: products, people and planet. And none is more important than our people component as we seek to make a positive impact on the lives of our associates. For example, in supply chain, we have our leadership, excellence and accelerated development program, which we refer to as Lead. Through this program, we about leadership fundamentals for our operations leaders. Since its inception, 970 associates have participated in the program. I would encourage you to read our sustainability report on our website to see the tremendous progress we have made on our journey and our exciting initiatives and future goals. Turning to Slide 7 and our second pillar service. We strive to provide the best delivery and service experience to our customers, and we made year-over-year progress during the second quarter on both on-time delivery and in full service levels. We also improved distribution productivity again this quarter. Our new Descartes routing technology is now live in 8 markets. By year-end, we expect to roll out to an additional 18 markets and have approximately 50% of our routed miles on Descartes. This great work, combined with additional benefits from our market-led routing initiative delivered a 3.7% improvement in cases per mile during the quarter. Additionally, turnover reduction, flexible scheduling implementation and process standardization continue to help improve our overall productivity. Finally, as JT highlighted at our Investor Day, U.S. Foods holds a leadership position in digital commerce in the foodservice industry. While that's exciting. I am even more enthusiastic about where we are taking MOXe and VITALS through our continued technology investments and use of artificial intelligence. Driven by our ambition, we will continue to bring additional value and better user experiences to our customers through our digital platform. And to highlight one functionality enhancement, we recently optimized our delivery tracking function, utilizing artificial intelligence within the Where's My Truck feature for MOXe customers to track their truck and delivery time. Over the past few months in our pilot markets, we've improved our delivery window accuracy by 40%. And we've seen a significant reduction in delivery-related customer service calls in those markets as a result of the better customer experience. This solution will be implemented in all markets by the end of the year. Let's now turn to our growth pillar on Slide 8. We remain laser-focused on accelerating profitable growth and gaining market share with our target customer types. Our 5.7% independent case growth was driven by a combination of new accountants and growth from our recent acquisitions. We remain highly confident that we will exceed our 1.5 times market growth goal for restaurants for the full year. Our Pronto small truck delivery service continues to gain traction and is live in 40 markets. Pronto caters to hard to service customers in high-density urban areas with later cutoff times and next-day delivery requirements. Our newly launched Pronto penetration service is a differentiator that fills in nonroutine delivery days for existing independent customers, which further expands our short wallet. Earlier this year, we successfully launched 2 pilot markets, and the early results are positive, with much stronger independent case growth. We have 4 additional markets planned for later this year. And Pronto is now on track to generate nearly $700 million of annualized sales this year. Turning to Slide 9, our profit pillar. Our proven operational playbook, merchandising excellence work and team-based selling approach, increased adjusted gross profit by 8% in the second quarter to $1.7 billion. We also continue to make progress in growing our private label brands, which grew approximately 100 basis points year-over-year to more than 52% penetration with independent customers. Our continued focus on private label penetration represents a pathway to profitable growth for US Foods. These high-quality innovative products enable competitive pricing for our customers while also improving our margins. Great companies are constantly adapting and looking for ways to become more efficient, continuously driving productivity and reinvesting a portion of those savings to fuel future growth. As we continue to identify ways to become more efficient and take steps to streamline our corporate and field interactions, we took additional cost actions this quarter. We now expect to achieve $80 million in expense savings in 2024 and $120 million on an annualized run rate. These changes underscore our commitment to achieving our 3% to 5% annual productivity target while more effectively serving our customers. Finally, as we announced during our Investor Day, given the lack of synergies, we believe CHE'STORE would benefit from focused investment under new ownership. We are still in the process of exploring strategic alternatives and will provide updates as appropriate. Throughout the process, we remain fully committed to supporting the CHE'STORE business, our associates and our customers. Before I hand it over to Dirk, I would like to acknowledge one of our drivers, Jason Buck, who works in our Knoxville distribution center. One of our cultural beliefs that US Foods is deliver excellence and Jason embodies this belief every day. Jason joined US Foods in 2004 and has been named a Driver of the Year twice. He also runs our weekly driver skills course with all new drivers and plays a lead role on our local safety team. Importantly, Jason's efforts contributed to the distribution center exceeding its on-time service metrics during the deployment of our card routing platform. I thank Jason for all he does to deliver excellent service to our customers, and ensure a safe work environment for our Knoxville associates. As we approach Labor Day, I also want to thank all our associates for their hard work, their commitment to our safety culture their relentless focus on providing superior customer service and for making US Foods a great place to work. Let me now turn the call over to Dirk to discuss our second quarter results in more detail and our 2024 guidance.\nDirk Locascio: Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Turning to our results were largely consistent with our expectations with continued top line growth and further margin expansion, leading to record adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. We delivered this record profitability through our balanced approach to drive top and bottom line growth despite the softer operating environment. Starting on Slide 11. Second quarter net sales increased 7.7% to $9.7 billion, driven by total case volume growth of 5.2% and food cost inflation of 2.9%, while mix was a headwind of 40 basis points. We drove case growth faster than the market and captured share gains in the second quarter, including our 13th consecutive quarter of market share gains with independent restaurants. Our independent restaurant volume grew 5.7%, including 250 basis points from acquisitions. Healthcare growth remained strong at 6%, hospitality growth improved to 2.1% as we successfully onboarded new business. Adjusted EBITDA grew 13.2% from the prior year to a quarterly record $489 million from a combination of profitable volume growth, strong gross profit gains and disciplined expense management. In addition to strong EBITDA dollar growth, our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 25 basis points to an all-time high of 5% as adjusted gross profit dollars grew over 200 basis points faster than adjusted OpEx dollars. Finally, adjusted EPS increased 17.7% to $0.93. We continue to grow adjusted EPS at a faster rate than adjusted EBITDA and expect that trend to continue, while deploying more of our strong cash flow to our repurchases. Turning to Slide 12. We once again expanded adjusted gross profit per case faster than adjusted operating expense per case, resulting in further adjusted EBITDA per case improvement. Adjusted gross profit per case grew by $0.22 or nearly 3% over prior year, primarily driven by our cost of goods sold initiatives and disciplined pricing. The COGS initiatives delivered $50 million for the first 6 months. And for the full year, we expect approximately $70 million in savings. We are well on track to achieve over $220 million in COGS savings from 2022 through the end of this year from our strategic vendor management work. Adjusted operating expense per case increased $0.04 or less than 1%, driven primarily by increased labor costs, partially offset by continued distribution productivity improvement from routing efficiency gains, turnover reduction and process standardization, as well as actions to streamline administrative processes and costs. Growing our GP per case, 5.5 times faster than our OpEx per case led to a record adjusted EBITDA per case of $2.27, up $0.16 or 7.6% from the prior year. We continue to drive strong leverage throughout the P&L with a combination of profitable volume growth and continued progress on gross margin and operating expense initiatives. We expect continued adjusted EBITDA per case expansion as we execute our initiatives while also consistently meeting our customers' needs. Moving on to Slide 13. We have generated strong cash flow year-to-date, including $621 million of operating cash flow and $467 million of free cash flow, driven by increased profitability and disciplined working capital management. However, this was lower than the prior year as we had more working capital benefit in the first half of 2023 due to the inventory reduction benefits from the replenishment optimization initiative that Bill Hancock discussed during our Investor Day. Excluding the working capital impacts, operating cash flow was modestly above the prior year. Our durable stream of cash flow enables us to invest in the business and return capital to shareholders. We invested $156 million in cash CapEx for the first 6 months, mainly focused on products to support growth including information technology, property and equipment as well as maintenance of our distribution facilities. On June 1, 2024, the Board authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program. Under this new authorization, we repurchased $21 million in June 2024. In the third quarter to date, through August 7, we have repurchased approximately $61 million. We have approximately $918 million remaining in the authorization. Since the inception of our buyback program in November 2022, we have repurchased 10 million shares for a total cost of $425 million. Rounding out capital deployment. We have completed 3 acquisitions over the past 18 months and will continue to be opportunistic in selectively pursuing accretive tuck-in M&A. We are currently focused on integrating these acquisitions and we'll lean in on more share repurchase for the remainder of 2024. Turning to Slide 14. We remain well within our 2 times to 3 times net leverage target with a strong balance sheet as we ended the quarter at 2.6 times levered, which is a 0.4 turn reduction from the same period last year. This includes paying $220 million for IWC and $41 million for share repurchases in the second quarter, which were both funded through operating cash flow. We're also pleased to report 2 positive developments related to our credit ratings. Our corporate credit rating was upgraded 1 notch by Moody's to BA2 and S&P revised their outlook on US Foods to positive, each reflecting the continued execution of our long-range plan and expectation that the initiatives outlined at our Investor Day will drive further earnings growth and credit metric improvement. Now turning to guidance on Slide 15. Given our strong first half of the year and outlook for the remainder of 2024, we are reiterating our fiscal year 2024 net sales, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS guidance. Moving to modeling assumptions. For 2024, we continue to expect total case growth of 4% to 6%. We are updating our sales inflation assumption to a range of 1% to 2%. Despite the operating environment, we continue to grow top line gain share, expand our margins and deploy our strong free cash flow against our capital allocation priorities. We are well positioned to deliver on our 2024 financial targets and remain committed to our new 3-year long-range plan. With that, I'll now pass it back to Dave for his closing remarks.\nDave Flitman: Thanks, Dirk. We continue to execute our strategy, gain market share and improve profitability. We delivered double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth and record adjusted EBITDA margin of 5%, while gaining share in our highest margin customer types. Our strong business model serving independent restaurants, health care and hospitality, which are among the fastest growing and most profitable customer types in the foodservice industry, combined with the execution of our strategic initiatives, supports our ambition to be the undisputed best in our industry. And we have a long runway of profitable growth in front of us, including delivering our 2025 to 2027 growth algorithm, which includes a 10% adjusted EBITDA growth CAGR. We remain laser-focused on improving the business to generate profitable growth while executing our capital deployment priorities. And with that, Carrie, please open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo.\nEdward Kelly: I was hoping -- could you maybe just elaborate or talk a bit more about what you're seeing from an end demand standpoint, maybe even by customer type. I'm just kind of curious how the quarter evolved? And then specifically what you saw in July? And then as part of the start, how are you feeling about the 2% to 4% organic case volume target for the year? I think you do need maybe a little bit of acceleration in the back half.\nDirk Locascio: Well, I'll take that last part of that question, Ed. First, I think we're confident in that 2% to 4% case growth and reiterated our full guidance for the year, as Dirk just outlined. So we're confident in that. But as you point out, I think the macro is a little softer than we expected coming into the year. But what you've seen us do is control the controllables very well, which is what we always say we're going to do. We can't control the macro, but we can't control our ability to drive growth on the top line, which we continue to do in the second quarter and also into July, to your point, despite what's going on in the macro. And things around the macro will ebb and flow our ability to drive our initiatives and make this thing as strong as it can possibly be, is completely within our control. And so we've seen lower foot traffic, as we pointed out, down 3% in the second quarter. I think the back half of the quarter was a little slower than the first half, and that trend kind of continued into July. Health care remains very strong. You saw a robust growth there. In hospitality, as we said last quarter, we were onboarding new business. You've seen us tick up in our case growth there. We expect that will continue into the third quarter and into the back half. So that's kind of how we see it. And we're not counting on the market helping us in the back half to achieve what we said we were going to achieve, and we'll continue to execute our playbook.\nEdward Kelly: Just as a follow-up, Dave, can I just ask you on any adjustments that you are making to the business in this backdrop? I know you're controlling what you can control, but today, you talked about some cost action that was incremental. Curious on like the selling side, if there's any fine tuning that you make there and a tick a backdrop. Just any additional color there?\nDave Flitman: Yes. I think we modified our TM compensation plan going into the year. We're pleased with the progress we're making there and how that's playing out. As you recall, we variabilize more of that to incent our sellers to drive more aggressive growth and also incented them to grow our private label brands. As you heard, we were up 100 basis points year-over-year with independent restaurants with our brands. I think at the root of that is our continued ability to bring innovation and great products to the marketplace supplemented with those compensation plan changes. And to your point on the expense side, I said since the day I got here, we were going to drive 3% productivity and we've been ramping that up through the course of the last 18 months, and we've really been driving that aggressively in the first half of this year. And I think that fits with what we said we're going to do. It also fits with the operating environment that we're in. So I'd point to those adjustments, and I think you can expect more of the same. And on the sales side, we're continuing to be committed to growing our sales headcount in low to mid-single digits despite what's going on in the macro.\nDirk Locascio: And Ed, what you really continue to see from our results is continued top line growth, especially in our target customer types, continued focus and execution on gross profit expansion and the cost management. So it's really across all 3 of those and that balance is what makes us feel good about the results that we have and expect to continue to generate.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Dave, I just wanted to follow up on your comments about the market share gains. I know you've talked about, I guess, 13 consecutive quarters and I think you actually said your share gains improved each month of the second quarter. Just wondering if you could if you could provide some color behind that data. Just wondering how you measure that. whether you think you're at all vulnerable to maybe slowing independent sales growth? I know your largest peers are more aggressively hiring and compensating their salespeople. I'm just wondering how you think about that independent case growth market share gains going forward with, again, the competition getting a little bit more aggressive? And then I had 1 follow-up.\nDave Flitman: Yes. Well, as we've been stating for a while, the data that we use to judge our market share is the sarkanda formerly NPD data, third-party independent data that looks across the industry. So it's not our data. So when I tell you that we're on gaining share and through the accelerated in the quarter, that's as supported by the sarkanda data. And I keep saying we're going to control what we can control. We can't control the macro. And even though that foot traffic was down sequentially each month in the quarter, you just heard us say that we ramped up our share gains throughout the quarter. I expect that will continue. Our team is laser focused on driving growth. And while penetration may be a challenge when foot traffic is down, our ability to generate new accounts has not inhibited at all by what's going on in the macro. And as you guys heard me say a lot, we still have a relatively small market share position with current restaurants. And I like our team all the time, 3 out of every 4 cases ours. So don't worry about the macro, going on our place and drive that growth. And that's what we continue to do. So regardless of what's going on there, Jeff, we'll be taking to run our place, and I'm confident that those share gains will continue.\nJeffrey Bernstein: And then just you mentioned about the private label being up 100 basis points now. I guess to independent customers now 52%. Do you see increased demand, I don't know whether you're pushing more of that or whether the customers are asking more of that, seemingly, it's lower cost to them, higher margin to us. So I'm wondering how you incentivise that it would seem like that will be a big opportunity with some of your smaller independent competitors not really having a platform like that. So how do you accelerate that type of environment to benefit you and your customers?\nDave Flitman: A big combination of great products, and we pride ourselves on our Scoop process, but more broadly, the way we bring innovation to our product line with our exclusive brands, which we've been doing for the better part of a dozen years now. And so we believe we're the leader in innovation. And what we do is we bring great quality products to market that help our customers be more efficient in their kitchens. And it's a great time for that need given the inflation that's been absorbed in some of the foot traffic challenges as they're looking to have these great products at a bit lower cost position. You couple that with the changes that we made to the TM incentive plan this year to incent them to drive the brand growth more. And I think you're starting to see that play out. And as I've said before, I don't see any near-term ceiling to our ability to penetrate the market with our exclusive brands.\nDirk Locascio: Jeff, the last couple of quarters, you've heard us talk a lot about since vendor supply has stabilized, and we've increased the focus again with our sellers you're not seeing that really come to fruition in the form of growth. And this has been now a couple of quarters where we've seen that growth. Like Dave said, we expect that to continue.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Mark Carden with UBS.\nMark Carden: So to start, just another question on the sales force and essentially controlling the controllables. How trending, just given some of the softening in traffic, does this shift to more variable compensation active a double-edged sort in any sense? Or if not, what have you been able to do to weather the headwinds quite well?\nDave Flitman: Yes. I think we do a great job of onboarding new TMs. In fact, I had the opportunity to talk to our latest class on Tuesday this week, we had an income class of 50. We get asked a lot with what's going on in the marketplace, what we have challenges finding great sales talent. We are not having problems finding great sales talent. That's why I'm confident that we'll continue to hit that low to mid-single-digit headcount growth as we've committed to for the full year. And it's really about how we onboard our sales talent. How we give them a portion of business and this route splitting is very important. We outlined a couple of quarters ago. We take and see these new sellers with some business that they can grow from. And we also have ongoing training throughout their first couple of years here. It's not a won and done. It's not that we put them through an intense training program and throw them on the street and let them go find their way. We continue to nurture them. And as we said before, it really depends on where that sales talent comes from. We hire operators, hire competitive reps. We hire our people from outside the industry with strong sales background. And it really depends on what their experience is, whether they bring a book of business or not in terms of how quickly they ramp up their productivity. But we know exactly who they are with all the various cohorts that come in what those classes look like and to make sure we give them the going support that they need, including some pretty intense product training, which our suppliers are helpful in helping us deliver in the local markets. So we've got a great plan. Retention is not a challenge. And we're continuing to ramp up our salesforce.\nMark Carden: Great. And then turning to hospitality for a second. How are you thinking about hospitality growth in the back half of the year? I know you guys have some new business that's been onboarded in the process of being onboarded. But just when you think about the broader macro, how do you think the balance of those 2 dynamics?\nDirk Locascio: Mark, it's Dirk. I think when you think of the broader macro to your point, it's facing some of the same headwinds that restaurants are facing. However, back to the point of the control of the controllables, we bought the business we want in port and we continue to have a strong pipeline of net new business that we're expecting and planning to onboard. So our expectation is the continued strengthening of the growth there with hospitality. We've got a lot of differentiation in health care and hospitality, and we think that, that growth rate, so we'll be able to accelerate it.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank.\nLauren Silberman: So I wanted to ask about the promotional environment. I think there are some concerns that we're seeing an increase in promotional activity as sort of distributors site for case growth, new customer acquisition. Obviously, you guys are seeing strong market gains in your key segments, are you seeing any increase in promotional activity? And how does that usually play out in more challenging economic backdrops?\nDave Flitman: Yes. I think we have seen increased promotional activity, which is not uncommon at any point. given the various cycles that the different companies have in terms of when their year-end is and all that, but probably a little bit more intense given the macro backdrop. But again, Lauren, I would just point to our results. I don't think that's impacted our ability to drive growth. We have our own promotional activity that we bring to market from time to time. And -- so we're not immune to that, and we know how to navigate the market for those times. But it's out there. I don't see that intensity inhibiting our ability to execute what we need to get done in any way.\nLauren Silberman: And a follow-up and somewhat related gross profit growth per case, obviously, very strong. Can you unpack the drivers? How much of that is company specific versus benefits from inflation? And with the promotional activity kind of increasing, any thoughts on it being a risk or a headwind as you think through the back half of the year?\nDirk Locascio: So almost all of that is company specific from our initiatives. Inflation did tick up, but it's still within that historical level that drives a very, very small gain. But again, we will still take it but a very small gain. Cost of goods, smart pricing, effective logistics management, each of those are things that all contributed to it. I think as we talked about, we $50 million in year of gains from our cost of goods work. So we continue that really continue to believe that's why gross profit is so durable and why we expect to continue to grow gross profit per case and grow it faster than we grow OpEx per case. So we feel good about the durability and the strength of that.\nOperator: Your next question will come from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.\nJohn Heinbockel: Dave, I want to start with, can you address the cadence of rolling out -- you did a little bit, but the rollout of Descartes and [Moxe]. And I know 50% day card by the end of this year, play out in '25. Humos -- where are we going to be in that journey? And does that get us -- as you roll out a lot of this in '25, when you think about that 3% to 5% productivity gains. We'd almost seem like there's going to be a sweet spot here. We are closer to 5-ish for a period of time before settling back down. Is that fair?\nDave Flitman: We will have the card fully rolled out by about this time next year. I would say the 50% at the end of this year, to be late Q2, probably more likely the first part of Q3 next year. And that, combined with the great work that we've done historical routing process led to that 1% improvement per mile. We would expect that to continue as we ramp up the card and we'll continue to find new ways with that new system fully implemented across the company to drive further gains. I'm confident that -- and as in my prepared remarks, MOXe is part of the process standardization work that we've got going on across the company. We will have that broadly rolled out middle of next year to second half of next year, being thoughtful about that. And in each rollout, we're learning for so would make sense in that process standardization. So we're being thoughtful about tweaking that process as we go forward. But you're right to point out -- it's part of this 3% to 5% productivity improvement is not just taking cost out but it's driving this process standardization and doing things more consistently, making sure that we're doing it right the first time and not adding a burden in a system with those inefficiencies that drive cost up. So we're excited about it. We believe we can pour destiny there and this 3% to 5% is fully in view.\nJohn Heinbockel: And maybe as a follow-up. Just philosophically, what is your thought or maybe the Board's thought on buyback timing front-loading, right? I think about front-loading within a year, buying maybe early funding that with the front-loading in front of CHE'STORE -- buy before those proceeds are in or even right as your leverage ratio comes down in the low 2s, taking on some debt if you think these shares are incredibly undervalued. What is the thought on all of that? You like that idea or no?\nDave Flitman: We certainly believe our shares are undervalued. We are excited that the Board that $1 billion twice the size of the authorization back in late 2022. And as you heard Dirk say this morning, and I also supported -- we're leaning in more heavily on share repurchases. That's why we gave a little bit of color on that accelerated ramp-up already in Q3, and you've started to see that. So we believe we're undervalued. We're going to buy our shares back appropriately or ramp that up through the course of time.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets.\nKelly Bania: This is Kelly Bania from BMO. Just wondering if you could just unpack a little bit the drivers of the independent case growth, the contribution you're seeing from new sales reps, penetration versus new account growth and any geographic differences. And I'd also like to tag on to that, just the investment that you're seeing across the industry in terms of sales force headcount, we know obviously what that is with the public competitors and maybe that's accelerating a little bit. But -- what are you seeing across the private competitors on that front? And I appreciate it could widely vary, but what maybe have you seen historically? Are you seeing any difference? Any color there, I think, would be helpful.\nDave Flitman: Sure. So the first part of your question there, Kelly, was around kind of unpacking growth. Overwhelmingly, our growth is coming as it has been for quite some time now from new account generation and customer growth. We expect that to continue, especially in a slower foot traffic environment. And again, we believe that's quickly within our control. As I referenced a little bit earlier, where you first see foot traffic challenges as in penetration. The customers are still buying the same number of lines, but they're buying less cases on those lines as their volume is challenged. And so we've certainly seen that and felt it. But our ability to drive new account generation and hold on to our business to the fullest extent and drive that loss number now, that's where we're squarely focused. Really haven't seen anything play out geographically, where we're having challenges or greater areas of strength. And to your question on the sales force, as I mentioned earlier, the productivity ramp of those new sellers varies greatly dependent upon their background. And we have targeted those headcount additions where we believe, one, there's great market growth and penetration opportunity. And maybe we're a little underrepresented. So any geographic change that we've seen there is really probably more driven by where we've added headcount versus where we haven't. And then last part question here. I think I got them all on the private competitors. Really no change. I don't think we've seen any impact on our ability to attract sellers or growth based on anything that's going on with the private.\nKelly Bania: I was wondering if I could also just maybe follow up. We talked about restaurant traffic down 3%. That sounds consistent with what we've heard from others. But can you just talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in restaurant cohorts or different types of restaurants as well as the pace of new restaurant openings and what you're seeing in the growth there?\nDave Flitman: Yes. I wouldn't say the foot traffic challenges, we see a lot -- or hear a lot about the consumer challenges, particularly at the lower end. I think some of those that have reported this week have spoken to some of the challenges in QSR, fast casual, I think some of the challenges in foot traffic have been pretty broadly spread across most of the cohorts maybe the higher end is holding up a little bit higher or better than others, but even that's been challenged a little bit. So I wouldn't point to any really significant area of strength or more challenged based on what's going on.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Alex Slagle with Jefferies.\nAlex Slagle: Couldn't see the OpEx per case growth really flattening out, and you talked about the indirect spend reduction forecast, which was a pretty big jump, I think, from the last outlook, but I just wanted to dig into that a little more what changed in your views and where that's coming from?\nDirk Locascio: Alex, this is Dirk. So I'm assuming you're talking about the increase of the $80 million of savings. That's a combination of people and non-people-related costs. And it really is not different than what you've heard us talk about the last few quarters, we're continuing to through efficiencies, a combination of use of technology, simplifying the interactions between field and function. And if we're not getting value in some of the functional resources redeploying or in some cases, reducing those. And so it really all fits into this balance that I highlighted earlier on one of the other questions about top line growth, GP expansion and then cost reduction to manage productivity. As far as interactions specifically, we continue to attack this $1 billion-plus spend pool and to reach the $60 million of saving by 2027. We're continuing to see more initiatives come online to generate savings, and we'll give an update more concretely as we move further into here, but good progress continues there.\nAlex Slagle: And a follow-up on the routing, I guess, process improvement. I mean, it seemed like you're doing good work with the existing system in place and means I guess there are additional enhancements coming just in terms of what you're doing with the process just in this initial -- just in the existing systems kind of before you even get to see the separate benefits from the deployment of the new routing technology. Just trying to understand, like, is there more to come here of the benefit of all the process changes and that will come on top of that, we'll have the new system rollout. Just a little more on that.\nJohn Heinbockel: Yes. I think, Alex, the way to think about that is we've been delivering routing improvements here for the better part of the last couple of years. And in large part, until we initiated the card rollout, that was largely driven by what you're pointing out, the process changes and improvements as we've gotten better at that. And now we're overlaying new technology and a new system that we believe is going to take it to the next level. So I'm sure and I'm confident we'll continue to optimize the process as we go through this and we learn more about the new technology -- but I think this technology overlay is really going to be what fuels the future productivity improvements with routing once we get that fully deployed.\nDirk Locascio: I think, Alex, the other thing is on the routing to Dave's point of it being a driver for the last few years, what we've been pleased with is it's not a once and done. It is a standardized process. And you see markets each week and each month to continue to add additional opportunities on that get executed against. And then the piece on the technology on Descartes, as I think a couple of quarters ago, Dave talked about is when you put it in place, there's some improvement. But as we get it in place, and we optimize it more what we expect further to come from that. So a long way of saying, we think there's still plenty of opportunity for further savings, which, in this case, typically results in a better customer experience as well.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Harbour: Dirk, just on your inflation outlook, do you -- you're a little bit above that in 2Q. Do you expect it to therefore, kind of come down a bit in the second half, could you give more color on that? And just I don't know if there are any product mix dynamics that kind of affect that. If you could talk about that.\nDirk Locascio: Sure. So when we think about the inflation, we also consider the impact of mix in there as well. And so that's one thing to consider. We did see, as you've gotten into in the past the second quarter, you see a little more moderation -- proteins were the biggest piece that turned more inflationary in the second quarter, but did haven't seen that continue. So overall, what we're not seeing is we're not seeing any significant levels of inflation across the board. And I think that what we feel good about is whether it ends up at 1 or 2 or a little above results below that is very manageable, very modest is that we'll be able to effectively hedge our way through that.\nBrian Harbour: We've talked a bit about kind of your operating expenses. But was there anything you kind of pull forward, anything that you think was more impactful in the second quarter that drove the pretty good performance in operating expense.\nDirk Locascio: Nothing specific that I would call out. A good portion of it is the different cost actions that we've taken over this past 6 months or so, combined with significant supply chain productivity that we reference on the call today. So we do not -- and I think when Dave talked earlier when we talked about this 3% to 5% productivity, it's not just to be able to say that's how we're operating and how we're holding the teams accountable or focusing on, all while doing it smartly while keeping an eye, we're not damaging or hurting the business. So that continued growth and further margin expansion.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Peter Saleh with BTIG.\nPeter Saleh: And congrats on a nice quarter, guys. I wanted to ask about MOXe if you guys could give us maybe an undate on the adoption of that platform. And if you're still seeing the incremental case count growth or the ticket growth from customers using MOXe, I think previously, it said 1.5 more cases per customer. And then just lastly on that, is MOXe helping to drive any of the private label penetration as you -- as you do more suggestive sell in through the app?\nDave Flitman: And yes, we're very excited about MOXe. As we previously mentioned, we're 100% hold out across our independent restaurants. We've continued to ramp that up in our chain business. It's now in 75% of our national chain business. We expect to ramp that up between now and the end of the year. And to your point, yes, and as we said in Investor Day, on average, customers are buying 10% more. And we have great algorithms within MOXe. One of those is our ability to sell our private label brands and make product recommendations. And so yes, we believe that, coupled with some of the things that I commented on earlier relative to the focus that we have in our brands and the way we incent our salesforce, all of that is working together that will support that growth that we talked about.\nPeter Saleh: And then just, Dirk, I don't know if I missed it, but did you guys provide the indirect cost figure that -- or at least the run rate that you have for 2024 as you ramp up to the $60 million by 2027.\nDirk Locascio: No, I didn't -- I was more color commentary, and we'll give some more specifics as we get further into the year. But we are continuing, as incentives to make progress with real concrete savings and well on our way toward our target.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Andrew Wolf with CL King & Associates.\nAndrew Wolf: On the outperformance in the market, particularly, I want to focus on with the independent restaurants. Are you gaining -- are the sales team gaining any lines per stock or any additional penetration in that? Or is it all really just mainly almost all driven by new customer wins -- net new customer wins?\nDave Flitman: It's overwhelmingly, Andy, new customer wins, but penetration is an important part of our algorithm. And as I said, some of that is being overridden currently with the foot traffic. So kind of hard to get a handle on that exactly, but certainly, we're working hard to drive penetration with our customers.\nAndrew Wolf: And Dirk, I think you said the COGS savings year-to-date are $50 million. and $70 million for the year. So it's like a $20 million back half. Is that just a timing thing on initiatives? Or like what is going on with that increment being a little less than the first half?\nDirk Locascio: It is. It doesn't hit equally. But as you probably remember from our Investor Day, we talked about a $260-plus million for the new long-range plan. So we clearly have a lot of work going on and expect a lot of value to continue to come. And I think that the important thing is even in this environment that we are continuing to grow. We're continuing to expand gross profit and we're continuing to drive productivity, which is not something that a lot of companies are doing right now.\nAndrew Wolf: And just one last thing. You mentioned the delivery window accuracy or on-time deliveries in these test markets for MOXe customers was up, I think you said 40%. Like what behavior is being changed here through the tracking? Is it just the drivers? Like what's going on? Or are the drivers just not wanting to get filled out by the customers? Or is there some internal tracking that's better? Like what is changing to make this -- that's quite a dramatic improvement. So just kind of curious what that is.\nDirk Locascio: Sure. So this hasn't anything to do with the driver of the customer. This is our ability to predict when the route will get to the [Indiscernible] to the customer. And so we've applied some significantly enhanced capabilities using artificial intelligence, machine learning to be able to predict that and that those increased capabilities are allowing us to be more inaccurate in telling the customer when we think that truck will get to their stops. So this is really increase our capability. It's just a good example of using it gets used a lot in a lot of places, but where we're using it for real practical things to improve our results. And there's plenty of those real concrete places that we continue to do work on that will be to the coming quarters.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from Fred Wightman with Wolf Research.\nFred Wightman: I wanted to touch on Pronto. It looks like the expected contribution came up pretty meaningfully versus what you talked about before. So I'm wondering if you could just dig into that and maybe where you're seeing the most opportunity?\nDave Flitman: We're excited about Pronto. As we said at Investor Day, we've just recently started to roll that out with existing independent customers, which is largely a non-cap opportunity because at this point, we've only sought new business with Pronto. And so we've proven the model there. We've now started to roll that out more aggressively for new customers, but importantly, for our existing customers. And I think all of that is at the root of our acceleration on the top line here. So we're excited about it. I don't see any reason why over the midterm, that can't be a $1 billion-plus business for us.\nFred Wightman: And then just thinking about the sales guidance came out a little bit in case changed and the total dollar sales number was unchanged. So I'm wondering maybe what the offset is. Dave, you did talk about a little bit of continued pressure into July. So is the case trajectory maybe towards the lower end of the prior range or how should we think about that?\nDirk Locascio: So foot traffic does play a little bit. The primary is if you look at that small of a change, it's a couple of hundred million dollars in savings. So ultimately, when you think of the range that we have, it doesn't really change the broad outlook that we have for sales for the year.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your final question will come from Jake Bartlett with Truist Securities.\nJake Bartlett: I wanted to ask again about the cadence throughout the quarter. You mentioned your market share gains improving but also restaurant traffic decelerating. So was your case growth, did it -- how did it trend throughout the quarter? Also, when I look at the guidance, the 2% to 4% independent or organic case growth guidance. It doesn't imply for you going to get towards the middle of that acceleration from the levels in the second quarter. So your question is the cadence and then maybe what hopefully you can comment on kind of recent trends and how that should give us confidence or not in acceleration towards the back half of the year.\nDave Flitman: Yes. So as we commented, foot traffic slowed, I would say our case growth generally follow up with what was happening with foot traffic, but we continue to drive growth in the quarter and importantly, drove outsized share gains. Those trends continued into July. And we have a lot of confidence in that case growth guidance. As Dirk highlighted here, and our ability to drive that outcome, both in terms of share gains and the work that we've got going on to generate new business should help us to continue to hit that guidance that we gave you for the full year.\nJake Bartlett: And then just another chunk that we haven't talked much about on the call, at least is all other in terms of case growth. It was negative in the last 2 quarters. What does the pipeline look like there? Or what should we expect from that driver in the back half? And then I have 1 more follow-up.\nDave Flitman: So the all other is, as you'd expect, it's a school, it can be some government retail, et cetera. So we're simpler today and we're thoughtful in the way we pursue that business. So that's not a key area. We'll be opportunistic in how we grow it. The main areas that we expect to drive our overall growth to be -- will be coming from our independent health care and hospitality and again, opportunistic in those.\nJake Bartlett: And then last, just kind of a cleanup question. But M&A guidance, the impact, I think the prior that you talked about was impact on the year, you're running ahead of that and you've made acquisitions since. So what should we expect from the acquisition impact on case growth in '24?\nDirk Locascio: Sure. Our update in the back that we had, we estimate sort of 2% to 3% coming from the M&A overall. And as Dave said earlier, continue to expect overall cap growth to continue at 4% to 6%.\nOperator: That concludes our Q&A session. I'll now turn the conference back over to Mr. Dave Flitman for any opening -- closing remarks.\nDave Flitman: Thank you very much. Thanks for joining the call this morning. We continue to control the outcomes we control. We're confident in our future, and we're also confident in our new long-term algorithm. Thanks a lot. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dirk Locascio",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Turning to our results were largely consistent with our expectations with continued top line growth and further margin expansion, leading to record adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. We delivered this record profitability through our balanced approach to drive top and bottom line growth despite the softer operating environment. Starting on Slide 11. Second quarter net sales increased 7.7% to $9.7 billion, driven by total case volume growth of 5.2% and food cost inflation of 2.9%, while mix was a headwind of 40 basis points. We drove case growth faster than the market and captured share gains in the second quarter, including our 13th consecutive quarter of market share gains with independent restaurants. Our independent restaurant volume grew 5.7%, including 250 basis points from acquisitions. Healthcare growth remained strong at 6%, hospitality growth improved to 2.1% as we successfully onboarded new business. Adjusted EBITDA grew 13.2% from the prior year to a quarterly record $489 million from a combination of profitable volume growth, strong gross profit gains and disciplined expense management. In addition to strong EBITDA dollar growth, our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 25 basis points to an all-time high of 5% as adjusted gross profit dollars grew over 200 basis points faster than adjusted OpEx dollars. Finally, adjusted EPS increased 17.7% to $0.93. We continue to grow adjusted EPS at a faster rate than adjusted EBITDA and expect that trend to continue, while deploying more of our strong cash flow to our repurchases. Turning to Slide 12. We once again expanded adjusted gross profit per case faster than adjusted operating expense per case, resulting in further adjusted EBITDA per case improvement. Adjusted gross profit per case grew by $0.22 or nearly 3% over prior year, primarily driven by our cost of goods sold initiatives and disciplined pricing. The COGS initiatives delivered $50 million for the first 6 months. And for the full year, we expect approximately $70 million in savings. We are well on track to achieve over $220 million in COGS savings from 2022 through the end of this year from our strategic vendor management work. Adjusted operating expense per case increased $0.04 or less than 1%, driven primarily by increased labor costs, partially offset by continued distribution productivity improvement from routing efficiency gains, turnover reduction and process standardization, as well as actions to streamline administrative processes and costs. Growing our GP per case, 5.5 times faster than our OpEx per case led to a record adjusted EBITDA per case of $2.27, up $0.16 or 7.6% from the prior year. We continue to drive strong leverage throughout the P&L with a combination of profitable volume growth and continued progress on gross margin and operating expense initiatives. We expect continued adjusted EBITDA per case expansion as we execute our initiatives while also consistently meeting our customers' needs. Moving on to Slide 13. We have generated strong cash flow year-to-date, including $621 million of operating cash flow and $467 million of free cash flow, driven by increased profitability and disciplined working capital management. However, this was lower than the prior year as we had more working capital benefit in the first half of 2023 due to the inventory reduction benefits from the replenishment optimization initiative that Bill Hancock discussed during our Investor Day. Excluding the working capital impacts, operating cash flow was modestly above the prior year. Our durable stream of cash flow enables us to invest in the business and return capital to shareholders. We invested $156 million in cash CapEx for the first 6 months, mainly focused on products to support growth including information technology, property and equipment as well as maintenance of our distribution facilities. On June 1, 2024, the Board authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program. Under this new authorization, we repurchased $21 million in June 2024. In the third quarter to date, through August 7, we have repurchased approximately $61 million. We have approximately $918 million remaining in the authorization. Since the inception of our buyback program in November 2022, we have repurchased 10 million shares for a total cost of $425 million. Rounding out capital deployment. We have completed 3 acquisitions over the past 18 months and will continue to be opportunistic in selectively pursuing accretive tuck-in M&A. We are currently focused on integrating these acquisitions and we'll lean in on more share repurchase for the remainder of 2024. Turning to Slide 14. We remain well within our 2 times to 3 times net leverage target with a strong balance sheet as we ended the quarter at 2.6 times levered, which is a 0.4 turn reduction from the same period last year. This includes paying $220 million for IWC and $41 million for share repurchases in the second quarter, which were both funded through operating cash flow. We're also pleased to report 2 positive developments related to our credit ratings. Our corporate credit rating was upgraded 1 notch by Moody's to BA2 and S&P revised their outlook on US Foods to positive, each reflecting the continued execution of our long-range plan and expectation that the initiatives outlined at our Investor Day will drive further earnings growth and credit metric improvement. Now turning to guidance on Slide 15. Given our strong first half of the year and outlook for the remainder of 2024, we are reiterating our fiscal year 2024 net sales, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS guidance. Moving to modeling assumptions. For 2024, we continue to expect total case growth of 4% to 6%. We are updating our sales inflation assumption to a range of 1% to 2%. Despite the operating environment, we continue to grow top line gain share, expand our margins and deploy our strong free cash flow against our capital allocation priorities. We are well positioned to deliver on our 2024 financial targets and remain committed to our new 3-year long-range plan. With that, I'll now pass it back to Dave for his closing remarks. Well, I'll take that last part of that question, Ed. First, I think we're confident in that 2% to 4% case growth and reiterated our full guidance for the year, as Dirk just outlined. So we're confident in that. But as you point out, I think the macro is a little softer than we expected coming into the year. But what you've seen us do is control the controllables very well, which is what we always say we're going to do. We can't control the macro, but we can't control our ability to drive growth on the top line, which we continue to do in the second quarter and also into July, to your point, despite what's going on in the macro. And things around the macro will ebb and flow our ability to drive our initiatives and make this thing as strong as it can possibly be, is completely within our control. And so we've seen lower foot traffic, as we pointed out, down 3% in the second quarter. I think the back half of the quarter was a little slower than the first half, and that trend kind of continued into July. Health care remains very strong. You saw a robust growth there. In hospitality, as we said last quarter, we were onboarding new business. You've seen us tick up in our case growth there. We expect that will continue into the third quarter and into the back half. So that's kind of how we see it. And we're not counting on the market helping us in the back half to achieve what we said we were going to achieve, and we'll continue to execute our playbook. And Ed, what you really continue to see from our results is continued top line growth, especially in our target customer types, continued focus and execution on gross profit expansion and the cost management. So it's really across all 3 of those and that balance is what makes us feel good about the results that we have and expect to continue to generate. Jeff, the last couple of quarters, you've heard us talk a lot about since vendor supply has stabilized, and we've increased the focus again with our sellers you're not seeing that really come to fruition in the form of growth. And this has been now a couple of quarters where we've seen that growth. Like Dave said, we expect that to continue. Mark, it's Dirk. I think when you think of the broader macro to your point, it's facing some of the same headwinds that restaurants are facing. However, back to the point of the control of the controllables, we bought the business we want in port and we continue to have a strong pipeline of net new business that we're expecting and planning to onboard. So our expectation is the continued strengthening of the growth there with hospitality. We've got a lot of differentiation in health care and hospitality, and we think that, that growth rate, so we'll be able to accelerate it. So almost all of that is company specific from our initiatives. Inflation did tick up, but it's still within that historical level that drives a very, very small gain. But again, we will still take it but a very small gain. Cost of goods, smart pricing, effective logistics management, each of those are things that all contributed to it. I think as we talked about, we $50 million in year of gains from our cost of goods work. So we continue that really continue to believe that's why gross profit is so durable and why we expect to continue to grow gross profit per case and grow it faster than we grow OpEx per case. So we feel good about the durability and the strength of that. Alex, this is Dirk. So I'm assuming you're talking about the increase of the $80 million of savings. That's a combination of people and non-people-related costs. And it really is not different than what you've heard us talk about the last few quarters, we're continuing to through efficiencies, a combination of use of technology, simplifying the interactions between field and function. And if we're not getting value in some of the functional resources redeploying or in some cases, reducing those. And so it really all fits into this balance that I highlighted earlier on one of the other questions about top line growth, GP expansion and then cost reduction to manage productivity. As far as interactions specifically, we continue to attack this $1 billion-plus spend pool and to reach the $60 million of saving by 2027. We're continuing to see more initiatives come online to generate savings, and we'll give an update more concretely as we move further into here, but good progress continues there. I think, Alex, the other thing is on the routing to Dave's point of it being a driver for the last few years, what we've been pleased with is it's not a once and done. It is a standardized process. And you see markets each week and each month to continue to add additional opportunities on that get executed against. And then the piece on the technology on Descartes, as I think a couple of quarters ago, Dave talked about is when you put it in place, there's some improvement. But as we get it in place, and we optimize it more what we expect further to come from that. So a long way of saying, we think there's still plenty of opportunity for further savings, which, in this case, typically results in a better customer experience as well. Sure. So when we think about the inflation, we also consider the impact of mix in there as well. And so that's one thing to consider. We did see, as you've gotten into in the past the second quarter, you see a little more moderation -- proteins were the biggest piece that turned more inflationary in the second quarter, but did haven't seen that continue.

So that continued growth and further margin expansion. No, I didn't -- I was more color commentary, and we'll give some more specifics as we get further into the year. But we are continuing, as incentives to make progress with real concrete savings and well on our way toward our target. It is. It doesn't hit equally. But as you probably remember from our Investor Day, we talked about a $260-plus million for the new long-range plan. So we clearly have a lot of work going on and expect a lot of value to continue to come. And I think that the important thing is even in this environment that we are continuing to grow. We're continuing to expand gross profit and we're continuing to drive productivity, which is not something that a lot of companies are doing right now. Sure. So this hasn't anything to do with the driver of the customer. This is our ability to predict when the route will get to the [Indiscernible] to the customer.

The primary is if you look at that small of a change, it's a couple of hundred million dollars in savings. So ultimately, when you think of the range that we have, it doesn't really change the broad outlook that we have for sales for the year. Sure. Our update in the back that we had, we estimate sort of 2% to 3% coming from the M&A overall. And as Dave said earlier, continue to expect overall cap growth to continue at 4% to 6%."

            "name": "Dave Flitman",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we turn to our second quarter results, I would like to thank everyone who joined our Investor Day in June. It was a great event, and we were excited to share our story, future goals and our ambition to become the undisputed best in our industry, the safest, the fastest growing, the most profitable, leading digital and the best place to work. Importantly, we laid out our financial algorithm for 2025 through 2027, which includes growing sales at a 5% CAGR, increasing adjusted EBITDA at a 10% CAGR, expanding adjusted EBITDA margin by at least 20 basis points per year and growing adjusted diluted EPS 20% annually. We also expect to deploy more than $4 billion of capital over that same period and anticipate approximately half of that will be deployed towards share repurchases. We remain excited about our path ahead. During today's call, I will share several of our accomplishments from the second quarter and update you on key initiatives across each of our 4 strategic pillars. Then Dirk will review our second quarter financial results and our fiscal year 2024 guidance. Turning to Slide 4. In the second quarter, we delivered record EBITDA, driven by a combination of top line growth and margin expansion as our gross profit grew significantly faster than our operating expenses. Our team's success this quarter further emphasizes the strength of our operating model and our ability to control the controllables. This balance of top line growth, gross profit expansion and cost productivity, led to significant adjusted EBITDA and EPS growth, along with a record adjusted EBITDA margin of 5%. Importantly, these results are underpinned by our strong capital structure. We also continue our disciplined approach to capital deployment. As we announced at our Investor Day, our Board authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program in early June. Dirk will provide a status of our repurchases in more detail. We do expect to be more aggressive buying back our shares over the balance of this year. Let's turn to broader industry trends and the health of our markets. Restaurant foot traffic remained pressured during the second quarter and was down approximately 3%. Despite the current headwinds facing our industry, our team captured profitable market share and target customer types, as we focused on executing our playbook. Specifically, our independent restaurant share increased for the 13th consecutive quarter, and our share gains improved sequentially each month throughout the second quarter. Our strategy is exceeding as evidenced by our volume growth and share gains. Our team's work remains guided by our 4 strategic pillars. And I will discuss our progress on each of them over the next few slides. Turning to Slide 6. Our first pillar is culture. Keeping our associates safe is paramount. During the second quarter, our injury and accident rates were 19% better than the prior year and were our best results since 2020. We remain focused on improving our safety performance as we strive to achieve zero injuries. We published our 2023 sustainability report in the second quarter, highlighting progress in our 3 key focus areas: products, people and planet. And none is more important than our people component as we seek to make a positive impact on the lives of our associates. For example, in supply chain, we have our leadership, excellence and accelerated development program, which we refer to as Lead. Through this program, we about leadership fundamentals for our operations leaders. Since its inception, 970 associates have participated in the program. I would encourage you to read our sustainability report on our website to see the tremendous progress we have made on our journey and our exciting initiatives and future goals. Turning to Slide 7 and our second pillar service. We strive to provide the best delivery and service experience to our customers, and we made year-over-year progress during the second quarter on both on-time delivery and in full service levels. We also improved distribution productivity again this quarter. Our new Descartes routing technology is now live in 8 markets. By year-end, we expect to roll out to an additional 18 markets and have approximately 50% of our routed miles on Descartes. This great work, combined with additional benefits from our market-led routing initiative delivered a 3.7% improvement in cases per mile during the quarter. Additionally, turnover reduction, flexible scheduling implementation and process standardization continue to help improve our overall productivity. Finally, as JT highlighted at our Investor Day, U.S. Foods holds a leadership position in digital commerce in the foodservice industry. While that's exciting. I am even more enthusiastic about where we are taking MOXe and VITALS through our continued technology investments and use of artificial intelligence. Driven by our ambition, we will continue to bring additional value and better user experiences to our customers through our digital platform. And to highlight one functionality enhancement, we recently optimized our delivery tracking function, utilizing artificial intelligence within the Where's My Truck feature for MOXe customers to track their truck and delivery time. Over the past few months in our pilot markets, we've improved our delivery window accuracy by 40%. And we've seen a significant reduction in delivery-related customer service calls in those markets as a result of the better customer experience. This solution will be implemented in all markets by the end of the year. Let's now turn to our growth pillar on Slide 8. We remain laser-focused on accelerating profitable growth and gaining market share with our target customer types. Our 5.7% independent case growth was driven by a combination of new accountants and growth from our recent acquisitions. We remain highly confident that we will exceed our 1.5 times market growth goal for restaurants for the full year. Our Pronto small truck delivery service continues to gain traction and is live in 40 markets. Pronto caters to hard to service customers in high-density urban areas with later cutoff times and next-day delivery requirements. Our newly launched Pronto penetration service is a differentiator that fills in nonroutine delivery days for existing independent customers, which further expands our short wallet. Earlier this year, we successfully launched 2 pilot markets, and the early results are positive, with much stronger independent case growth. We have 4 additional markets planned for later this year. And Pronto is now on track to generate nearly $700 million of annualized sales this year. Turning to Slide 9, our profit pillar. Our proven operational playbook, merchandising excellence work and team-based selling approach, increased adjusted gross profit by 8% in the second quarter to $1.7 billion. We also continue to make progress in growing our private label brands, which grew approximately 100 basis points year-over-year to more than 52% penetration with independent customers. Our continued focus on private label penetration represents a pathway to profitable growth for US Foods. These high-quality innovative products enable competitive pricing for our customers while also improving our margins. Great companies are constantly adapting and looking for ways to become more efficient, continuously driving productivity and reinvesting a portion of those savings to fuel future growth. As we continue to identify ways to become more efficient and take steps to streamline our corporate and field interactions, we took additional cost actions this quarter. We now expect to achieve $80 million in expense savings in 2024 and $120 million on an annualized run rate. These changes underscore our commitment to achieving our 3% to 5% annual productivity target while more effectively serving our customers. Finally, as we announced during our Investor Day, given the lack of synergies, we believe CHE'STORE would benefit from focused investment under new ownership. We are still in the process of exploring strategic alternatives and will provide updates as appropriate. Throughout the process, we remain fully committed to supporting the CHE'STORE business, our associates and our customers. Before I hand it over to Dirk, I would like to acknowledge one of our drivers, Jason Buck, who works in our Knoxville distribution center. One of our cultural beliefs that US Foods is deliver excellence and Jason embodies this belief every day. Jason joined US Foods in 2004 and has been named a Driver of the Year twice. He also runs our weekly driver skills course with all new drivers and plays a lead role on our local safety team. Importantly, Jason's efforts contributed to the distribution center exceeding its on-time service metrics during the deployment of our card routing platform. I thank Jason for all he does to deliver excellent service to our customers, and ensure a safe work environment for our Knoxville associates. As we approach Labor Day, I also want to thank all our associates for their hard work, their commitment to our safety culture their relentless focus on providing superior customer service and for making US Foods a great place to work. Let me now turn the call over to Dirk to discuss our second quarter results in more detail and our 2024 guidance. Thanks, Dirk. We continue to execute our strategy, gain market share and improve profitability. We delivered double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth and record adjusted EBITDA margin of 5%, while gaining share in our highest margin customer types. Our strong business model serving independent restaurants, health care and hospitality, which are among the fastest growing and most profitable customer types in the foodservice industry, combined with the execution of our strategic initiatives, supports our ambition to be the undisputed best in our industry. And we have a long runway of profitable growth in front of us, including delivering our 2025 to 2027 growth algorithm, which includes a 10% adjusted EBITDA growth CAGR. We remain laser-focused on improving the business to generate profitable growth while executing our capital deployment priorities. And with that, Carrie, please open up the line for questions. Yes. I think we modified our TM compensation plan going into the year. We're pleased with the progress we're making there and how that's playing out. As you recall, we variabilize more of that to incent our sellers to drive more aggressive growth and also incented them to grow our private label brands. As you heard, we were up 100 basis points year-over-year with independent restaurants with our brands. I think at the root of that is our continued ability to bring innovation and great products to the marketplace supplemented with those compensation plan changes. And to your point on the expense side, I said since the day I got here, we were going to drive 3% productivity and we've been ramping that up through the course of the last 18 months, and we've really been driving that aggressively in the first half of this year. And I think that fits with what we said we're going to do. It also fits with the operating environment that we're in. So I'd point to those adjustments, and I think you can expect more of the same. And on the sales side, we're continuing to be committed to growing our sales headcount in low to mid-single digits despite what's going on in the macro. Yes. Well, as we've been stating for a while, the data that we use to judge our market share is the sarkanda formerly NPD data, third-party independent data that looks across the industry. So it's not our data. So when I tell you that we're on gaining share and through the accelerated in the quarter, that's as supported by the sarkanda data. And I keep saying we're going to control what we can control. We can't control the macro. And even though that foot traffic was down sequentially each month in the quarter, you just heard us say that we ramped up our share gains throughout the quarter. I expect that will continue. Our team is laser focused on driving growth. And while penetration may be a challenge when foot traffic is down, our ability to generate new accounts has not inhibited at all by what's going on in the macro. And as you guys heard me say a lot, we still have a relatively small market share position with current restaurants. And I like our team all the time, 3 out of every 4 cases ours. So don't worry about the macro, going on our place and drive that growth. And that's what we continue to do. So regardless of what's going on there, Jeff, we'll be taking to run our place, and I'm confident that those share gains will continue. A big combination of great products, and we pride ourselves on our Scoop process, but more broadly, the way we bring innovation to our product line with our exclusive brands, which we've been doing for the better part of a dozen years now. And so we believe we're the leader in innovation. And what we do is we bring great quality products to market that help our customers be more efficient in their kitchens. And it's a great time for that need given the inflation that's been absorbed in some of the foot traffic challenges as they're looking to have these great products at a bit lower cost position. You couple that with the changes that we made to the TM incentive plan this year to incent them to drive the brand growth more. And I think you're starting to see that play out. And as I've said before, I don't see any near-term ceiling to our ability to penetrate the market with our exclusive brands. Yes. I think we do a great job of onboarding new TMs. In fact, I had the opportunity to talk to our latest class on Tuesday this week, we had an income class of 50. We get asked a lot with what's going on in the marketplace, what we have challenges finding great sales talent. We are not having problems finding great sales talent. That's why I'm confident that we'll continue to hit that low to mid-single-digit headcount growth as we've committed to for the full year. And it's really about how we onboard our sales talent. How we give them a portion of business and this route splitting is very important. We outlined a couple of quarters ago. We take and see these new sellers with some business that they can grow from. And we also have ongoing training throughout their first couple of years here. It's not a won and done. It's not that we put them through an intense training program and throw them on the street and let them go find their way. We continue to nurture them. And as we said before, it really depends on where that sales talent comes from. We hire operators, hire competitive reps. We hire our people from outside the industry with strong sales background. And it really depends on what their experience is, whether they bring a book of business or not in terms of how quickly they ramp up their productivity. But we know exactly who they are with all the various cohorts that come in what those classes look like and to make sure we give them the going support that they need, including some pretty intense product training, which our suppliers are helpful in helping us deliver in the local markets. So we've got a great plan. Retention is not a challenge. And we're continuing to ramp up our salesforce. Yes. I think we have seen increased promotional activity, which is not uncommon at any point. given the various cycles that the different companies have in terms of when their year-end is and all that, but probably a little bit more intense given the macro backdrop. But again, Lauren, I would just point to our results. I don't think that's impacted our ability to drive growth. We have our own promotional activity that we bring to market from time to time. And -- so we're not immune to that, and we know how to navigate the market for those times. But it's out there. I don't see that intensity inhibiting our ability to execute what we need to get done in any way. We will have the card fully rolled out by about this time next year. I would say the 50% at the end of this year, to be late Q2, probably more likely the first part of Q3 next year. And that, combined with the great work that we've done historical routing process led to that 1% improvement per mile. We would expect that to continue as we ramp up the card and we'll continue to find new ways with that new system fully implemented across the company to drive further gains. I'm confident that -- and as in my prepared remarks, MOXe is part of the process standardization work that we've got going on across the company. We will have that broadly rolled out middle of next year to second half of next year, being thoughtful about that. And in each rollout, we're learning for so would make sense in that process standardization. So we're being thoughtful about tweaking that process as we go forward. But you're right to point out -- it's part of this 3% to 5% productivity improvement is not just taking cost out but it's driving this process standardization and doing things more consistently, making sure that we're doing it right the first time and not adding a burden in a system with those inefficiencies that drive cost up. So we're excited about it. We believe we can pour destiny there and this 3% to 5% is fully in view. We certainly believe our shares are undervalued. We are excited that the Board that $1 billion twice the size of the authorization back in late 2022. And as you heard Dirk say this morning, and I also supported -- we're leaning in more heavily on share repurchases. That's why we gave a little bit of color on that accelerated ramp-up already in Q3, and you've started to see that. So we believe we're undervalued. We're going to buy our shares back appropriately or ramp that up through the course of time. Sure. So the first part of your question there, Kelly, was around kind of unpacking growth. Overwhelmingly, our growth is coming as it has been for quite some time now from new account generation and customer growth. We expect that to continue, especially in a slower foot traffic environment. And again, we believe that's quickly within our control. As I referenced a little bit earlier, where you first see foot traffic challenges as in penetration. The customers are still buying the same number of lines, but they're buying less cases on those lines as their volume is challenged. And so we've certainly seen that and felt it. But our ability to drive new account generation and hold on to our business to the fullest extent and drive that loss number now, that's where we're squarely focused. Really haven't seen anything play out geographically, where we're having challenges or greater areas of strength. And to your question on the sales force, as I mentioned earlier, the productivity ramp of those new sellers varies greatly dependent upon their background. And we have targeted those headcount additions where we believe, one, there's great market growth and penetration opportunity. And maybe we're a little underrepresented. So any geographic change that we've seen there is really probably more driven by where we've added headcount versus where we haven't. And then last part question here. I think I got them all on the private competitors. Really no change. I don't think we've seen any impact on our ability to attract sellers or growth based on anything that's going on with the private. Yes. I wouldn't say the foot traffic challenges, we see a lot -- or hear a lot about the consumer challenges, particularly at the lower end. I think some of those that have reported this week have spoken to some of the challenges in QSR, fast casual, I think some of the challenges in foot traffic have been pretty broadly spread across most of the cohorts maybe the higher end is holding up a little bit higher or better than others, but even that's been challenged a little bit. So I wouldn't point to any really significant area of strength or more challenged based on what's going on. And yes, we're very excited about MOXe. As we previously mentioned, we're 100% hold out across our independent restaurants. We've continued to ramp that up in our chain business. It's now in 75% of our national chain business. We expect to ramp that up between now and the end of the year. And to your point, yes, and as we said in Investor Day, on average, customers are buying 10% more. And we have great algorithms within MOXe. One of those is our ability to sell our private label brands and make product recommendations. And so yes, we believe that, coupled with some of the things that I commented on earlier relative to the focus that we have in our brands and the way we incent our salesforce, all of that is working together that will support that growth that we talked about. It's overwhelmingly, Andy, new customer wins, but penetration is an important part of our algorithm. And as I said, some of that is being overridden currently with the foot traffic. So kind of hard to get a handle on that exactly, but certainly, we're working hard to drive penetration with our customers. We're excited about Pronto. As we said at Investor Day, we've just recently started to roll that out with existing independent customers, which is largely a non-cap opportunity because at this point, we've only sought new business with Pronto. And so we've proven the model there. We've now started to roll that out more aggressively for new customers, but importantly, for our existing customers. And I think all of that is at the root of our acceleration on the top line here. So we're excited about it. I don't see any reason why over the midterm, that can't be a $1 billion-plus business for us. Yes. So as we commented, foot traffic slowed, I would say our case growth generally follow up with what was happening with foot traffic, but we continue to drive growth in the quarter and importantly, drove outsized share gains. Those trends continued into July. And we have a lot of confidence in that case growth guidance. As Dirk highlighted here, and our ability to drive that outcome, both in terms of share gains and the work that we've got going on to generate new business should help us to continue to hit that guidance that we gave you for the full year. So the all other is, as you'd expect, it's a school, it can be some government retail, et cetera. So we're simpler today and we're thoughtful in the way we pursue that business. So that's not a key area. We'll be opportunistic in how we grow it. The main areas that we expect to drive our overall growth to be -- will be coming from our independent health care and hospitality and again, opportunistic in those. Thank you very much. Thanks for joining the call this morning. We continue to control the outcomes we control. We're confident in our future, and we're also confident in our new long-term algorithm. Thanks a lot. Have a great day."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the US Foods First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.\n I will now turn the conference over to Mike Neese, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mike, you may begin. \nMichael Neese: Thank you, Krista. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the US Foods First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. On today's call, we have Dave Flitman, our CEO; and Dirk Locascio, our CFO. We will take your questions after our prepared remarks conclude. [Operator Instructions] \n Our earnings release issued earlier this morning and today's presentation can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at ir.usfoods.com. During today's call, unless otherwise stated, we're comparing our first quarter 2024 to the same period in our first quarter fiscal year 2023. \n In addition to historical information, certain statements made during today's call are considered forward-looking statements. Please review the risk factors in our Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of the potential factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in those statements. \n During today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. All reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the schedules on our earnings press release as well as in the presentation slides posted on our website. We are not providing reconciliations to forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures. \n Finally, we're excited to host our Investor Day on June 5 at our headquarters in Rosemont. If you're interested in attending, please reach out to us in Investor Relations. \n Thank you. I'd like to turn the call over to Dave. \nDavid Flitman: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. \n Let's turn to today's agenda. I'll start by sharing the progress we've made executing on our strategy and several key achievements from the first quarter, which set us up for a strong year ahead. I will then hand it over to Dirk to review our first quarter financial results and our fiscal 2024 guidance. \n Following a slower start to the year due to adverse weather and labor disruptions, our first quarter earnings came in as expected. The continued execution of our strategy and long-range plan resulted in adjusted EBITDA of $356 million, representing approximately 6% growth. \n As we highlighted in February, adjusted EBITDA was negatively impacted by approximately $20 million from increased cost to serve our customers and volume headwinds from labor disruption and weather-related issues in January. Of the $20 million impact, approximately $15 million was incremental operating expense to support the business during the labor disruption. \n Excluding this negative impact, our underlying adjusted EBITDA growth was approximately 12%, and we remain confident in achieving our full year guidance. This performance demonstrates the strength of our business model, the commitment of our 30,000 hard-working associates and our ability to win in any environment. \n Total case growth was 4.2% for the quarter with share gains continuing in target customer types, and our independent case volume grew 4.6%. In fact, for independent restaurants, our share gains accelerated from the fourth quarter to the first quarter as we grew share for the 12th consecutive quarter. \n In early April, we closed on our previously announced acquisition of IWC Food Service, and we are excited to have them on our team. As a result of deploying capital towards our tuck-in M&A strategy, we did not purchase a significant number of shares in the first quarter. However, we do plan to lean in on share repurchases more aggressively through the balance of this year. \n Despite a slight year-over-year decrease in restaurant foot traffic, broadliners increased their volume within the overall foodservice distribution channel, as measured by Circana, underscoring the resilience of our industry. Our team captured profitable market share with our target customer types and improved profitability as we remain focused on controlling the outcomes that we can control. \n Furthermore, we continue to identify cost savings, including streamlining administrative processes and costs. More specifically, cost actions we have taken to date are expected to generate more than $55 million in expense savings for 2024 and $75 million on an annualized run rate. We are pursuing additional operating expense and cost of goods actions to drive further savings in 2025 and beyond. I have confidence in our ability to drive growth and profitability well into the future. We are controlling what we can control to generate long-term shareholder value. \n Turning to Slide 4. As a reminder, our team's work is guided by 4 strategic pillars, and I will discuss our progress on each of them over the next few slides. \n Moving to Slide 5, our first pillar is culture. Keeping our associates safe is a key part of our culture. And during the first quarter, our injury and accident rates were 30% better than the prior year. And importantly, these results were our best since 2020. Despite our recent success, there is still significant room for improvement to reach our goal of 0 injuries. \n We are excited about our Spring Scoop where we launched 26 new products to help our customers offer high-quality, innovative and labor-saving products on our menus. As part of this Scoop, we introduced Serve You, including 20 new products within a portfolio of more than 3,000 products of delicious, plant-forward, gluten-free and clean labels, such as our Chef's Line Organic Purple Rice and Quinoa Blend. Importantly, since the introduction of our popular Scoop program 12 years ago, nearly 75% of the products that have been launched are still sold today. \n Finally, we are increasing our commitment to 3 strategic community giving areas: hunger relief, culinary education and disaster relief. Our increased investment of $2 million in 2024 is part of our Helping Communities Make It program, which provides nourishment and opportunity to the communities we serve and builds on our 2023 investment of more than $12 million. \n Turning to Slide 6, our second pillar, service. Providing best-in-class delivery and a high-quality service experience to our customers is essential to our growth and our overall success. The investments we are making and operational rigor in modernizing our technology platforms continue to pay off. We exited the first quarter quite pleased with the progress that we made on both on-time delivery and service levels to customers, which continued to show year-over-year and sequential improvement. \n We also recently completed an 18-month initiative in our replenishment organization. This program standardized and improved the processes and technology we use as we strive to deliver best-in-class service levels to our customers. This work resulted in our delivered as ordered Net Promoter Score improving by 7 percentage points while yielding $15 million in annualized operating expense savings and $120 million in working capital reduction. \n We continue to build on the routing efficiency gains that we delivered in 2023, and we remain focused on driving further improvement in on-time deliveries. In fact, our cases per mile were a company record in February and March. Furthermore, our routing initiative delivered a 4% improvement in cases per mile during the quarter compared to the first quarter of 2023 in a 2-year stack improvement of 12%. Our team's focus on this important work is making a difference for our customers and for US Foods. \n Taking this work a step further, we extended our Descartes routing deployment to 4 additional markets during the first quarter, building upon the 2 markets we piloted late last year that are now fully deployed. In the markets where Descartes is live, we are compounding further [ bookings ] in our routing effectiveness. For example, in deployed markets, we are already seeing this technology produce an incremental 2% improvement in cases per mile, which we expect will continue to accelerate. We are confident that we have the right plan in place to successfully implement this technology across the company by mid-2025. \n And we continue to further transform our customer experience through our differentiated MOXe digital solutions platform. MOXe has been fully embedded with our independent restaurant business. As customers move to MOXe, they buy 10% more, are more profitable and stick with us longer. We have migrated over 65% of our national chain business with full deployment anticipated in the second half of 2024. MOXe also has a new Spanish translation feature, further enhancing the user experience. We are excited to share the MOXe road map and growth plans for this digital platform during our upcoming Investor Day.  \n Let's now turn to our growth pillar on Slide 7. We remain focused on accelerating profitable growth and gaining market share with our target customer types. We are on track to achieve our 1.5x market growth goal for restaurants for the full year, driven by faster growth with independents. Our 4.6% independent case growth resulted in an acceleration of share gains from the fourth quarter, again, marking our 12th consecutive quarter of market share gains.  \n Our Pronto small truck delivery service is a true competitive differentiator and continues to gain traction with our customers. Through this platform, we are able to offer our customers significant benefits, including flexibility of delivery, which allows us to compete with local and specialty competitors. At the end of the first quarter, we were live in 36 markets and expect to add 5 additional markets in 2024. Pronto is on track to deliver approximately $600 million of annualized sales this year with plenty of runway ahead. \n We also recently launched what we are calling Pronto Penetration in 2 markets, which, for the first time, extends the Pronto service to existing independent customers who will be able to order on [ non-routed ] days. Once fully implemented, this new offering is expected to further increase our share of wallet with our existing customer base. \n Last quarter, I provided you with an update on our sales compensation plan. As you'll recall, the variable components of our plan are now more meaningful for our sellers. While it's only been 1 quarter, our plan is working as designed. Many of our sellers are exceeding their targets and receiving higher compensation for that profitable growth. \n For example, one of our sellers in South Carolina grew cases 50% faster than the fourth quarter, exceeded his target and earned a 10% compensation increase. And for those who are not growing as fast with our new targets, we believe they will rebound in the quarters ahead. \n Turning to Slide 8, our profit pillar. Adjusted gross profit grew nearly 7% in the first quarter to $1.5 billion. We drove further progress on initiatives such as cost of goods sold by collaborating with additional vendors. In total, we have addressed 60% of our COGS, which has translated into approximately $120 million in savings over the past 12 months. We have initiated the work to address the remaining 40% of our spend this year. \n We are also continuing to make progress on growing our independent restaurant private label brands, which increased 90 basis points year-over-year to over 52%. Increasing private label penetration remains a significant opportunity for US Foods. We believe we can [ add ] customer value through our innovative and high-quality products at a competitive price while also improving our margins. \n Finally, our delivery productivity improved 4% over the prior year, and we continue to improve our overall supply chain productivity through turnover reduction, flexible scheduling and process standardization. The 4% delivery productivity is in line with our goal of 3% to 5% annual gains to offset wage inflation. This productivity improvement is additive to the operating expense reduction I spoke about earlier.  \n Before I hand it over to Dirk, I would like to acknowledge 2 recent winners of our first-ever CEO awards: [ Mark Schuster ], Warehouse Manager; and [ Timothy Gephart ], [ Data ] Warehouse Supervisor at our culinary equipment and supply business in Allentown, Pennsylvania. This distribution center celebrated 11 years of injury-free operations last year. \n During that time, they nearly doubled the cases shipped while improving productivity by approximately 50%. Mark and Tim made safety a top priority for regular training programs and team huddles to ensure that the entire team took personal accountability for safety. Thanks, Mark and Tim, for your outstanding leadership. \n As we approach Memorial Day, I want to thank all of our veterans for their service, including our associates who have served our great country. On this Memorial Day, we pay tribute to those who have served our country and made the ultimate sacrifice. Each day, we have the privilege to enjoy our freedom because of their fearless service. As you spend time with your loved ones on this holiday, please join me in remembering the heroes who courageously gave their lives for our country and for our freedom.  \n Let me now turn the call over to Dirk to discuss our first quarter results and our 2024 guidance. \nDirk Locascio: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Our performance for the first quarter was consistent with our expectations as we executed well despite the challenging start to the year, highlighting our strong financial discipline and staying focused on what we can control. \n Starting on Slide 10. First quarter net sales increased 4.8% to $8.9 billion, driven by total case volume growth of 4.2% and food cost inflation of 1.5%. Mix was a headwind of nearly 90 basis points. Independent restaurant volume increased 4.6% overall and 2.9% organic. \n Health care and hospitality grew 6.4% and 0.9%, respectively. Health care growth remains strong while hospitality growth was less than we expected due to softer same-store sales and a tougher compare versus a strong prior year. We expect hospitality to accelerate through the second quarter and the second half of this year as we onboard new customers.  \n Adjusted EBITDA grew 5.6% from the prior year to $356 million. This was slightly above the high end of our guidance, driven by a combination of profitable volume growth, strong gross profit gains and solid expense management. Adjusted EBITDA margin remained largely unchanged at 4% despite the headwind of incremental costs to serve our customers during the January labor disruption.  \n Absent these costs, plus the volume headwinds from labor and weather, which altogether totaled approximately $20 million, we estimate that our adjusted EBITDA growth rate over the prior year would have been approximately 12% and adjusted EBITDA margin would have increased approximately 20 basis points. \n Turning to Slide 11. We increased adjusted EBITDA per case again this quarter despite incurring higher incremental costs related to the labor disruption. Adjusted gross profit per case growth continued at a strong $0.17 improvement over prior year, driven by our cost of goods sold initiative and disciplined pricing. On an annualized basis, this improvement would result in more than $100 million in incremental gross profit. \n Adjusted operating expense per case increased $0.15 with more than $0.07 related to incremental expenses from the labor disruption. Adjusted EBITDA per case was $1.75, up $0.02 from the prior year. Excluding the incremental costs, adjusted EBITDA per case would have been a $0.09 improvement over prior year. \n We are focused on driving further operating leverage improvement and growing adjusted EBITDA per case by continuing to execute on initiatives that are within our control. We are making steady progress with our cost of goods sold optimization work, improving supply chain productivity and streamlining administrative processes and headcount, as Dave noted, as well as increased indirect spend management savings as more initiatives in this area are deployed. \n Moving on to Slide 12. We continue to generate strong operating cash flow driven by earnings and effective working capital management. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $139 million, which was driven by strong profitability. However, this was lower than prior year as we had more working capital benefit in the first quarter of 2023 from extending payables with certain suppliers. Absent the working capital impact, operating cash flow was modestly above prior year. \n We continue to actively manage working capital and expect to drive further improvements in 2024 from initiatives targeted in inventory and payables. We expect operating cash flow growth over 2023 for the full year. We will continue to invest in the business for growth and remain focused on our capital allocation priorities to maintain net leverage within our target range of 2.5 to 3x, return capital to shareholders via share buybacks and opportunistically pursue accretive tuck-in M&A. \n We repurchased $13 million of shares during the first quarter. Repurchases were muted as we were in the process of acquiring IWC. We're excited to welcome the IWC team to US Foods. As we closed on the acquisition in April, [ it's priced ] of approximately $220 million, which was funded through operating cash flow.  \n Turning to Slide 13. We ended the quarter with net leverage of 2.8x, which is a 0.4x reduction versus the same period last year and consistent with where we ended 2023. In February, we successfully repriced our term loan due 2028 and reduced the interest rate margins by 50 basis points. As a reminder, we do not have any debt maturities until 2026. \n Now turning to guidance on Slide 14. Given our performance for the first quarter and outlook for the balance of the year, we are reaffirming our fiscal year 2024 guidance. We continue to expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.69 billion to $1.74 billion and adjusted diluted EPS between $3 and $3.20. \n The macro remains a little softer than we and many anticipated going into the year. But as you heard from Dave, we continue to outpace the growing broadline distribution channel. Our industry is resilient, and US Foods is well positioned for above-market growth with our differentiation, diverse customer base and customer-focused strategy to drive share gains. \n As a result, we continue to expect our full year case volume growth to be within our guidance range of 4% to 6%. In addition to continued volume growth, we have the right strategies in place and are expanding gross margins through initiatives such as cost of goods management and driving OpEx productivity through improved routing, administrative process streamlining and indirect spend management. \n With that, I'll pass it back to Dave for his closing remarks. \nDavid Flitman: Thanks, Dirk. Looking ahead, we remain intensely focused on executing our strategy, and we'll maintain our disciplined approach to capital deployment to drive long-term shareholder value. \n We see tremendous opportunities ahead as we focus on what we can control and continue to deliver on our commitments regardless of the operating environment. Our future is promising, and I am highly confident in our ability to continue to outpace industry growth over the long term and to leverage that growth effectively to the bottom line. \n Finally, we are excited about our upcoming Investor Day on June 5, where we will share our new long-range plan targets and why we believe we have the right strategy and the best associates in the business to execute that plan. We hope you can join us here at our company headquarters or via the webcast.  \n With that, Krista, please open up the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Alex Slagle with Jefferies. \nAlexander Slagle: I guess a question more on the macro, just high level. I mean in some segments, the management teams of companies we cover ratcheted down their growth expectations because of the softer traffic environment. Just trying to figure out, I mean, has this impacted your internal targets to a certain degree? And maybe you could talk to some of the incremental offsets that you're seeing that allow you to reiterate your outlook? \nDavid Flitman: Yes. So look, I think it's well documented that there have been some foot traffic challenges in the industry. But as I continue to say to you all and I say to our team internally, we have so much opportunity to continue to focus on the things we can control like gaining profitable market share. \n And look, I couldn't be more pleased or proud of our team on the performance in the first quarter. Obviously, the well-documented weather situation was out there. On top of that, we had a labor disruption that lasted for the majority of the month of January. And still, we outperformed the market, accelerated share gains. And so that is what gives me confidence in our ability to continue to outpace the market growth regardless of what's going on in the world around us. \n And then secondly, you heard a lot this morning from both me and Dirk about our continued work around self-help, and there's so much of that going on. And again, with all the distraction we had in January, our team's ability to stay focused and put out the productivity numbers that we talked about here this morning just gives me great confidence that, that momentum will continue. We have a strong pipeline of initiatives, as you heard, and we're continuing to stay focused. \nAlexander Slagle: Congrats on the progress. \nDavid Flitman: Thanks a lot, Alex. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. \nJohn Heinbockel: I want to start with -- there's a lot of noise, right, unusual amount of noise in the first quarter. Where do you think the trend line on independent case growth is? I know it was the organic piece, right? So that was 2.9% impacted by weather and strike. Do you think we're 4% to 5%? And wherever we are, is all of that coming from new account growth, right? So penetration for everybody, right, has kind of stalled out. Is that kind of where we are composition-wise? \nDavid Flitman: Yes, I think in that mid-single-digit range, John, kind of as you framed it is probably the right trajectory. We were relatively flattish in January year-over-year, which I thought was a win for the team given the challenges that we had and then it accelerated from there. As we flipped into the second quarter, it's roughly on par with the way we exited the first quarter. \n And so, yes, the foot traffic is a challenge, but our ability to generate new business is key to our success. Penetration is a challenge just with the foot traffic piece of it, but we also have an opportunity to shore up lost business, which hasn't been a problem for us, but there's always opportunity to do a better job there. So that combination of net new account generation, that difference between new accounts and shoring up the loss is where our team stays focused and, obviously, continue to look for every penetration opportunity we can. \n You heard me talk this morning about the Pronto Penetration opportunity. That's new for us. We're excited about it to take that offering to our existing customer base. And we think that's going to mean good things on the penetration front as we ramp that up across the company. \nDirk Locascio: I think, John, the other thing that shows through in our first quarter results was our 1.4% organic total case growth, which is sort of faster than the industry and others, is really -- I think it highlights the diverse mix of customers that we have. And so it's about our target customer types in that overall smart, profitable growth. \nJohn Heinbockel: And maybe the follow-up, right, the -- I think you maybe sized for the first time the 60% of the product base that you've gone through $120 million of savings. So when you think about the next 40%, and I assume that's not as productive as the first 60%, which may be wrong, and then you'll go back around again, so when you think about on a go-forward basis, in aggregate, is there a lot more than $120 million to go over a multiyear period or no, do you think? \nDavid Flitman: Well, I think you're thinking about it right, the 40% won't likely be as large as the 60% just to size that a little bit for you, John. But there is a lot to do going forward. And to your point, around cycling back, I think there'll be existing -- more momentum than we've had on the existing side. And look, the beauty is, in a month, we're going to lay all this out for you at our Investor Day on June 5 and talk about that contribution and where it comes from over the next 3-year time horizon. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley. \nBrian Harbour: I'm sure we'll talk about this next month, too, but just what's the source of some of the additional kind of cost savings opportunities that you mentioned in your comments, Dave? \nDavid Flitman: Well, 2 I'd point to: one, I commented on and the other one, I didn't. But the work that we've done around replenishment yield is $15 million of expense reduction. That's been an ongoing piece of work. I think there's likely still more to come there as we ramp up technology in that part of the business. And so we're excited about that. The team has worked hard to achieve the numbers that I spoke about. \n But importantly, also, Brian, you've heard me talk over the course of the last year about shifting our focus and our resource back into the field given the responsibility to the P&L owners and unwinding a bit of the centralization that has been done over the company over a number of years. \n And with that move back to the field comes efficiency gains. I'm a firm believer that the folks that own the P&L are going to determine whether they need the headcount, whether it's adding value or not. You've seen some of that initially pop out from the work that we've done here, particularly over the last 6 months, and there's likely more to come on that journey as well. \nBrian Harbour: Okay. Just on the health care and hospitality side, too, how quickly do you expect some of this new business to pick up on the hospitality side? Is health care sort of outsized still? Or do you think a similar pace can sustain? How do those pieces sort of factor into your case growth outlook for the year? \nDavid Flitman: Yes. I think let me take hospitality first. We're a little over-indexed in our hospitality mix around lodging. I think that was challenged a bit with same-store sales and foot traffic. Even in spring break, we didn't see the uplift that you normally see. I think there's probably some more international travel that's happened this spring break versus prior years coming out of COVID and things like that going on.  \n But look, we've got line of sight to a very strong pipeline and not just in health care and hospitality, but also in our independent business, and we're in the process of ramping up that business here in the second quarter. And that's what I point to when I shared the confidence in the earlier question about the momentum continuing here, really good progress, lots of momentum, strong pipeline that we expect to convert in the second quarter and beyond here. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. \nEdward Kelly: Nice quarter in a tough environment. \nDavid Flitman: Thank you. \nEdward Kelly: I wanted to ask you about the spread between gross profit per case and OpEx per case, slightly negative in Q1, which is obviously uncharacteristic for you and there was a strike issue. Maybe [ tease ] out Q1 performance a bit more. And then what I'm really interested in is looking ahead, there's obviously a ton of self-help that you've been talking about, mix benefits, inflation is coming back. Can you just maybe talk about how you see that spread evolving? And what's a realistic target for the remainder of the year? \nDirk Locascio: Ed, this is Dirk. So overall, we do -- I'm not going to give a specific number, but we do expect to continue to have that healthy spread as part of our balanced growth strategy. I think the overall inflation, although it's picked up some, it's still pretty modest at 1.5% for the first quarter. So as you've heard me say a number of times, when it's like that, it's going to be a small contributor, but it's not going to be the key thing you hear us talk about driving the overall growth. \n I expect continued improvement in GP, expect continued productivity to offset a good portion of inflation. And each of those impacts really come from the things that we're doing within our 4 walls on the different activities and initiatives. But we do continue to expect adjusted EBITDA per case to continue to increase. \nEdward Kelly: Maybe just a quick follow-up. I wanted to ask you about M&A real quick. It looks like you had about a 2.8% benefit in the quarter from M&A. IWC comes in, in Q2, so I guess that's going to ramp. But the guidance, I think, includes a 2% benefit from M&A. So maybe could you just talk about how that's layering in? \n And then from a pipeline standpoint, like how are you -- you've done a few deals. So how are you thinking about the outlook from here? I did note that it looks like M&A is kind of below share repo on the priority list on that slide, I think. \nDirk Locascio: Sure. Well, Ed, why don't I start with just the overall M&A. And so yes, IWC will come in, so we'll have a couple of months of overlap, but Renzi will roll off later in the second quarter. So it really will be one on, one off over the period and then Saladino's through most of the rest of the year. \n So I think overall, we expect it to be pretty similar. And I think as Dave talked about with our organic case growth, we're getting past some of the January challenges and some of the things that we talked about in our pipeline, and that's why we feel so good about our -- reiterating our guidance on volume outlook. \nDavid Flitman: Yes. And Ed, on the pipeline, it remains strong. We'll give a little bit more color on that at Investor Day here coming up on June 5. But I will just reinforce a couple of points that I've always said around M&A. First of all, I think it can be an accretive add to the business for the right deals with the right management teams at the right time, but we don't need to do any of them. And so we're not going to force anything, and we're not going to overpay and we haven't in the 3 deals that we've done. \n And to your point around share repurchases, look, we've done 3 deals here in less than 12 months. We've got some integration work ahead of us. You'll likely see us take a breath around M&A here for a little bit and lean in harder to share repurchases as the year progresses, as we said in the script. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jake Bartlett with Truist Securities. \nJake Bartlett: My first is on the channels and the organic growth within them. So you've given overall case growth in independent organic. But how do the acquisitions impact health care, hospitality and chain? And then building on that, chain case growth accelerated pretty meaningfully. If it's not acquisitions, what is driving that pretty strong acceleration? Then I have a follow-up. \nDirk Locascio: So health care and hospitality, the acquisitions had very little impact to either of those from a growth rate perspective. Chains did have a much more significant impact, and that's primarily, as you may remember from our discussions before, around Saladino's which have had a stronger chain base of the business. So we talked about 3.7% overall chain growth, but organic was down around 4%. So very similar to what Black Box indicated for the first quarter, so really not too different from a trend there. \nJake Bartlett: Okay. So you said organic was down 4%, just maybe repeat that? \nDirk Locascio: The [ chain ] is down 4%, which was pretty much right in line where the Black Box data was for the quarter. \nJake Bartlett: Got it. Great. And then my other question was just about the size of your sales force. And I believe you're growing your sales force slower than your 2 largest peers. And so just wondering what your thoughts are on how that might impact your share gains going forward? How much of the share gains do you think has been driven by investments in your sales force? And could that become a headwind as your larger competitors, I believe, are adding to their sales force quicker? \nDavid Flitman: So first of all, I'll take the second part of your question, no, I don't think it will be a headwind at all, Jake. We reiterated last call and I'll say it again, we believe low- to mid-single-digit addition to our sales force on an ongoing basis is the right number. We've got that built into our algorithm and the productivity around that and the time it takes new hires to ramp. \n I think I'd point to a couple of things maybe relative to others. First of all, our digital platform and the efficiency gains that, that enables for our sales force and the focus it allows them to have on the customer in selling our great products and penetrating that business and, importantly, helping our customers solve problems. So I would point to MOXe and the advent of that as a real productivity help for our sales force. \n And the other one is our team-based selling, which we've been at longer than others. And for a very long time, that's part and parcel to how we go to market. And that also affords our territory managers with efficiency gains because of the help and support that they get from the specialists and the restaurant operation consultants on a day-to-day basis in front of the customer. So we feel really good about it. I don't think there will be any headwind at all in our ability to drive growth based on our algorithm. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. \nKelly Bania: Congrats on a good quarter here. \nDavid Flitman: Thank you. \nKelly Bania: Just wanted to ask, you gave some of the figures here on the Pronto initiatives that were interesting. With the numbers that you disclosed here, I'm assuming this is really impacting independents. Is that initiative kind of driving a low- to mid-single-digit lift for independents? Correct my math if I'm wrong there. But can you just talk a little bit more about how that's working, if that's new accounts, increased wallet share and how that impacts the P&L? \nDavid Flitman: Yes. So first of all, we've been ramping up Pronto over the last 18 to 24 months. And so we've progressively gotten increased benefit and felt like it was time to disclose the importance of that business to our total, and that's why we quantified the $600 million we anticipate this year. \n But I tried to make that distinction, and let me be clear, up until now, Kelly, Pronto was only focused on attracting new customers. We had not deployed that to our existing customer base until we were confident in the model and we knew that we had all the bugs worked out in that model. And so now when we go to Pronto Penetration, we are offering that to existing customers on their nonstandard routed days. We think that will enable us to continue to penetrate those accounts, give our customers less reason to go to specialty and other suppliers to get their needs met. \n So we're excited about not only the ability to continue to attract new customers through Pronto, but now importantly, penetrating our existing customers further. So more to come on that, but we're really excited about the model and what it's meant so far and where we can take it. \nKelly Bania: Great. Can I just add one more? Just on the hospitality, if I missed it, I apologize, but can you just help us understand the magnitude of what you expect in terms of new wins coming on over the course of the year? And also just maybe incorporate what the competition looks like for those contracts, the profitability level of those contracts. \nDirk Locascio: Kelly, so overall, we expect hospitality to meaningfully accelerate sort of some in Q2 and then more in the back half of the year. And that a lot of the -- that comes from really visibility to customers that have started to onboard already here in the second quarter and more that we know are coming. And so those numbers will show up as we go over time. \n And it's -- the reason that we keep talking a lot about independents, our core key customers highly profitable, but also health care, hospitality and other, is those are all valuable customers that are attractive, profitable. Our differentiation shows up. And so really, our growth in those 3 target types and then opportunistically in other customer types are key to growth, and we're going to continue to be thoughtful. And like I said, that resulted in stronger than the market's Q1 overall growth rates and stronger than overall from a target customer-type perspective. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. \nJeffrey Bernstein: My first question, Dave, just on the broader restaurant industry, we've talked about how the macro is a little softer than expected at the start of the year. It seems like it's changed more than independents. But you get a chance to look at all segments. I'm just wondering big picture, to what do you attribute the slowdown? There's been lots of talk about outsized restaurant industry menu pricing may be hurting and the lower-end consumer may be feeling incremental pressure. Just based on your 30,000-foot view, what would you attribute the slowdown? And then I had one follow-up. \nDavid Flitman: Yes. This is why I'm not an economist, Jeff, but I'll give you a perspective, for sure. I think it's more around the challenges that the consumer has, given what's happened around inflation over the past few years, and they're thoughtful about how they spend their disposable income. And so I think that's really driving a lot of the foot traffic challenges we've seen. Certainly, our customers have experienced inflation over the same period of time, and those challenges persist. \n I really think at the root of it is a consumer issue. I do think -- and I believe this long-term trend will continue. I think independents will win over chains. And I think the foot traffic is certainly reflecting that, not that independents don't have challenges, just the same, they do, but I just think their model is more in line with the big culinary desires and the experiential dining that the consumer is looking for. So we're bullish on independents over the long term. And whatever short-term bumps in the road there may be, we think they're going to win. \nJeffrey Bernstein: Understood. And then just my follow-up is on the broader industry, just the number of doors in America. I feel like through the pandemic, many people talked about losing roughly 10% of the restaurants or at least having them closed. I'm just wondering, where do you think we stand today relative to that peak pre-COVID? Do you buy into that 10% reduction? And where do you think we are now relative to that? \nDavid Flitman: Yes. I think roughly that number is in line, maybe plus or minus, but there's been a strong rebound, obviously, from the pandemic and it has thereof. But I do still think there's -- while it's increased quite a bit, I still think the count total was still down versus pre-pandemic levels, which obviously keeps things very competitive in the industry and [ customers ] increasingly challenged to attract folks into the restaurants, but probably still down a little bit from pre-pandemic levels. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Carden with UBS. \nMark Carden: To start, I wanted to touch on CHEF'STORE. How is this business performing in the current macro backdrop? Have you guys seen demand pick up much just given some of the pressure on the lower end? \nDavid Flitman: Mark, so we have seen CHEF'STORE return to case growth, which has been encouraging. As you remember, we talked about with some of the ERP and related challenges from last year. I would say, so overall, the fact that if the business is back growing, we are encouraged by that. And our focus is to continue to work through and accelerate that growth over time. And we're continuing to add stores with 5 stores planned for this year, and it does play a niche in the overall market for us, especially that customer base that you're talking about as well as fill-ins. \nMark Carden: Great. That's helpful. And then just on the labor backdrop, are you guys seeing the impact from California just given the shift to the $20 minimum wage for QSR workers? And really, any related wage pressure that might have caused in the state? \nDavid Flitman: No, not really. Most of our associates are paid well above that, so a pretty limited impact from our perspective. I'd say from an overall customer volume, it's pretty early to tell and really talk much about what that may do to overall demand more broadly. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh with BTIG. \nPeter Saleh: Congrats on a good quarter. I did want to ask about the increase in the private label penetration. Can you just talk a little bit about what drove that this quarter? And how much of that you think is attributable to the change in the sales force compensation that you indicated, I guess, earlier this year? \nDavid Flitman: Yes. I think, Peter, it's a combination of factors, the compensation being one that I think will be a meaningful one for us going forward. So I'm very excited to see that increase. But as we said, coming out of the pandemic, the manufacturers were challenged to supply those products for us. \n And it's just really been over the last couple of quarters that we've gotten the confidence of the sales force back to go lean into those products more aggressively than they have over the past few years. And we had a good performance in the fourth quarter. Excited to see us -- our penetration up over 52% in the first quarter. And as I've said before, I don't really see any near-term ceiling for that, and I feel like the momentum will continue to build on our exclusive brands. \nPeter Saleh: And then just on MOXe, you indicated that your customers are buying, I believe, 10% more. But I suspect you have some customers that have been on the platform longer than others. What's the -- is the behavior of customers that have been on it longer, are they buying more? Or is that 10% kind of a good figure to use going forward? \nDavid Flitman: Yes, I think that's roughly a good figure to use going forward. And our goal is to get our customers -- the new customer onto that platform immediately, if not sooner, once we get into the account because of all the things that we've talked about here in terms of benefits both for the customer and for the productivity of our sales force. And so that's why we disclosed that figure. I think that's a solid one to think about going forward. \nOperator: And your next question comes from Andrew Wolf with CL King. \nAndrew Paul Wolf: Just wanted to start with a point of clarification. Dave, I think you said -- or maybe it was Dirk, that cases were flat in January. Just wanted to make sure, was that with reference to independent organic cases or total cases? Just what is the reference point when we think about when to compare the flat January to? \nDavid Flitman: That was specific to independents, that comment. Overall, we did see some stronger case growth just more broadly through the quarter, but that comment was geared to independents. \nAndrew Paul Wolf: So it's more like an organic thing, your typical distribution center not impacted by it. Okay. And was it all weather? Or did any of the labor actions also had an effect on January sales? \nDavid Flitman: Yes. As we said, it was a combination of both. That was kind of the net impact in the month of January where we had the labor disruptions for about 3 weeks of the month overlapping the weather challenges that everyone experienced. \nAndrew Paul Wolf: Okay. Because I thought it was just -- I wasn't sure. Okay. So it was both monetary impact and the sales impact. Okay. Dave, on the new cases per mile metric, is that purely logistical, it sort of falls out from what you're doing in logistics? Or does it -- can it sort of help drive sales and marketing, let's say, to increase customer density in other ways? Or is it purely logistical and the sales and marketing people are going to do their own thing and not be influenced by this getting the logistics cost down? \nDavid Flitman: Yes. The root of it is we're helping ourselves in terms of efficiency of getting the products to the customer. But importantly, there is a very positive customer impact because as we take miles out of our system to get the products from our distribution centers to the customers, we're more likely to be on time and show up when the customer has requested it. So that -- there's a double benefit there. So it very much impacts the customer in a positive way. And so we're excited about continuing that work. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Fred Wightman with Wolfe Research. \nFrederick Wightman: I wanted to come back to the independent case growth numbers. And if we just go back and look at what you guys disclosed for 2Q from last year, you talked about a softer March and April and then some sequential improvement in May and June. So I'm just wondering how we should think about the net impact of some of these headwinds from 1Q. So the weather and the labor that you just touched on rolling off, but then also facing some of those tougher compares on a monthly basis later in the quarter. \nDirk Locascio: I think as you pointed out, Fred, that the weather and the labor are largely behind us. We have a few of the labor impacted markets that haven't fully recovered as far as lost customers, but that's a minority. And those teams are laser-focused on getting that back. \n I would say, overall, I'm not going to specifically comment beyond what Dave did where he talked about April volume being pretty similar to March. Our focus as we get to this normalized environment without the weather, without labor, et cetera, is to get back on pace for the strong independent growth that we've generated and continue to take share. As you heard Dave said, we accelerated our share gains in Q1, and we don't expect to slow down on that versus continuing to charge ahead. \nFrederick Wightman: Great. And then on Pronto, I think you guys made a comment that that's a $600 million top line contribution currently. Is there a way to size the potential market for the Pronto Penetration? Is that bigger, smaller, sort of in line with the core Pronto offering? \nDavid Flitman: It's early days. We'll have more to say about that through the course of time. We're just -- we're really getting started with that, Fred. And so we're excited about it. We think it's got a large potential, but it is very early days there. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Rahul Kro with JPMorgan. \nRahul Krotthapalli: It's on Pronto again. Like you guys did mention the ability to compete against specialty and local. Is that mostly because of the delivery window flexibility? And we also saw that many operators succeed here because of the ethnic meats, produce and whatnot. So are you considering adding more SKUs to the offering or you can compete with the current assortment? \nDavid Flitman: I think we've got great product line that falls on right on top of the line of the specialty suppliers. What this gives us, Rahul, is the ability to actually get that product in a more timely fashion to the customers versus our maybe couple deliveries or standard deliveries per week. \n We can deliver those products every day now with Pronto at whatever frequency the customer needs it. And obviously, delivering it on the smaller trucks gets us into some of the more urban tight areas that are more challenging to take a larger vehicle into. So I think there's good upside there and allows us to compete in a way that we haven't been able to prior to Pronto. \nRahul Krotthapalli: Understood. That's helpful. Is there a sense of how the profit per case is in this -- in these deliveries being very different from what you have? Or is it very comparable on gross profit per case? \nDirk Locascio: It's comparable to overall independent margins. So in this case, there's a -- the customers are willing to pay a slight premium because of the flexibility, which mitigates our slightly increased delivery cost. So it's profitable, it's attractive. And as Dave said, when you pair this up with our larger truck delivery service, it really allows the right service for the right customer. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And with no further questions, I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Dave Flitman for any additional or closing remarks. \nDavid Flitman: Thank you, Krista, and thanks for joining us today. We're excited about the underlying momentum that the business has and certainly the focus of our 30,000 associates on continuing to drive that momentum. We look forward to seeing many of you at our June 5 Investor Day. Have a great week. Thanks a lot. \nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call, and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dirk Locascio",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Our performance for the first quarter was consistent with our expectations as we executed well despite the challenging start to the year, highlighting our strong financial discipline and staying focused on what we can control. \n Starting on Slide 10. First quarter net sales increased 4.8% to $8.9 billion, driven by total case volume growth of 4.2% and food cost inflation of 1.5%. Mix was a headwind of nearly 90 basis points. Independent restaurant volume increased 4.6% overall and 2.9% organic. \n Health care and hospitality grew 6.4% and 0.9%, respectively. Health care growth remains strong while hospitality growth was less than we expected due to softer same-store sales and a tougher compare versus a strong prior year. We expect hospitality to accelerate through the second quarter and the second half of this year as we onboard new customers.  \n Adjusted EBITDA grew 5.6% from the prior year to $356 million. This was slightly above the high end of our guidance, driven by a combination of profitable volume growth, strong gross profit gains and solid expense management. Adjusted EBITDA margin remained largely unchanged at 4% despite the headwind of incremental costs to serve our customers during the January labor disruption.  \n Absent these costs, plus the volume headwinds from labor and weather, which altogether totaled approximately $20 million, we estimate that our adjusted EBITDA growth rate over the prior year would have been approximately 12% and adjusted EBITDA margin would have increased approximately 20 basis points. \n Turning to Slide 11. We increased adjusted EBITDA per case again this quarter despite incurring higher incremental costs related to the labor disruption. Adjusted gross profit per case growth continued at a strong $0.17 improvement over prior year, driven by our cost of goods sold initiative and disciplined pricing. On an annualized basis, this improvement would result in more than $100 million in incremental gross profit. \n Adjusted operating expense per case increased $0.15 with more than $0.07 related to incremental expenses from the labor disruption. Adjusted EBITDA per case was $1.75, up $0.02 from the prior year. Excluding the incremental costs, adjusted EBITDA per case would have been a $0.09 improvement over prior year. \n We are focused on driving further operating leverage improvement and growing adjusted EBITDA per case by continuing to execute on initiatives that are within our control. We are making steady progress with our cost of goods sold optimization work, improving supply chain productivity and streamlining administrative processes and headcount, as Dave noted, as well as increased indirect spend management savings as more initiatives in this area are deployed. \n Moving on to Slide 12. We continue to generate strong operating cash flow driven by earnings and effective working capital management. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $139 million, which was driven by strong profitability. However, this was lower than prior year as we had more working capital benefit in the first quarter of 2023 from extending payables with certain suppliers. Absent the working capital impact, operating cash flow was modestly above prior year. \n We continue to actively manage working capital and expect to drive further improvements in 2024 from initiatives targeted in inventory and payables. We expect operating cash flow growth over 2023 for the full year. We will continue to invest in the business for growth and remain focused on our capital allocation priorities to maintain net leverage within our target range of 2.5 to 3x, return capital to shareholders via share buybacks and opportunistically pursue accretive tuck-in M&A. \n We repurchased $13 million of shares during the first quarter. Repurchases were muted as we were in the process of acquiring IWC. We're excited to welcome the IWC team to US Foods. As we closed on the acquisition in April, [ it's priced ] of approximately $220 million, which was funded through operating cash flow.  \n Turning to Slide 13. We ended the quarter with net leverage of 2.8x, which is a 0.4x reduction versus the same period last year and consistent with where we ended 2023. In February, we successfully repriced our term loan due 2028 and reduced the interest rate margins by 50 basis points. As a reminder, we do not have any debt maturities until 2026. \n Now turning to guidance on Slide 14. Given our performance for the first quarter and outlook for the balance of the year, we are reaffirming our fiscal year 2024 guidance. We continue to expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.69 billion to $1.74 billion and adjusted diluted EPS between $3 and $3.20. \n The macro remains a little softer than we and many anticipated going into the year. But as you heard from Dave, we continue to outpace the growing broadline distribution channel. Our industry is resilient, and US Foods is well positioned for above-market growth with our differentiation, diverse customer base and customer-focused strategy to drive share gains. \n As a result, we continue to expect our full year case volume growth to be within our guidance range of 4% to 6%. In addition to continued volume growth, we have the right strategies in place and are expanding gross margins through initiatives such as cost of goods management and driving OpEx productivity through improved routing, administrative process streamlining and indirect spend management. \n With that, I'll pass it back to Dave for his closing remarks. I think, John, the other thing that shows through in our first quarter results was our 1.4% organic total case growth, which is sort of faster than the industry and others, is really -- I think it highlights the diverse mix of customers that we have. And so it's about our target customer types in that overall smart, profitable growth. Ed, this is Dirk. So overall, we do -- I'm not going to give a specific number, but we do expect to continue to have that healthy spread as part of our balanced growth strategy. I think the overall inflation, although it's picked up some, it's still pretty modest at 1.5% for the first quarter. So as you've heard me say a number of times, when it's like that, it's going to be a small contributor, but it's not going to be the key thing you hear us talk about driving the overall growth. \n I expect continued improvement in GP, expect continued productivity to offset a good portion of inflation. And each of those impacts really come from the things that we're doing within our 4 walls on the different activities and initiatives. But we do continue to expect adjusted EBITDA per case to continue to increase. Sure. Well, Ed, why don't I start with just the overall M&A. And so yes, IWC will come in, so we'll have a couple of months of overlap, but Renzi will roll off later in the second quarter. So it really will be one on, one off over the period and then Saladino's through most of the rest of the year. \n So I think overall, we expect it to be pretty similar. And I think as Dave talked about with our organic case growth, we're getting past some of the January challenges and some of the things that we talked about in our pipeline, and that's why we feel so good about our -- reiterating our guidance on volume outlook. So health care and hospitality, the acquisitions had very little impact to either of those from a growth rate perspective. Chains did have a much more significant impact, and that's primarily, as you may remember from our discussions before, around Saladino's which have had a stronger chain base of the business. So we talked about 3.7% overall chain growth, but organic was down around 4%. So very similar to what Black Box indicated for the first quarter, so really not too different from a trend there. The [ chain ] is down 4%, which was pretty much right in line where the Black Box data was for the quarter. Kelly, so overall, we expect hospitality to meaningfully accelerate sort of some in Q2 and then more in the back half of the year. And that a lot of the -- that comes from really visibility to customers that have started to onboard already here in the second quarter and more that we know are coming. And so those numbers will show up as we go over time. \n And it's -- the reason that we keep talking a lot about independents, our core key customers highly profitable, but also health care, hospitality and other, is those are all valuable customers that are attractive, profitable. Our differentiation shows up. And so really, our growth in those 3 target types and then opportunistically in other customer types are key to growth, and we're going to continue to be thoughtful. And like I said, that resulted in stronger than the market's Q1 overall growth rates and stronger than overall from a target customer-type perspective. I think as you pointed out, Fred, that the weather and the labor are largely behind us. We have a few of the labor impacted markets that haven't fully recovered as far as lost customers, but that's a minority. And those teams are laser-focused on getting that back. \n I would say, overall, I'm not going to specifically comment beyond what Dave did where he talked about April volume being pretty similar to March. Our focus as we get to this normalized environment without the weather, without labor, et cetera, is to get back on pace for the strong independent growth that we've generated and continue to take share. As you heard Dave said, we accelerated our share gains in Q1, and we don't expect to slow down on that versus continuing to charge ahead. It's comparable to overall independent margins. So in this case, there's a -- the customers are willing to pay a slight premium because of the flexibility, which mitigates our slightly increased delivery cost. So it's profitable, it's attractive. And as Dave said, when you pair this up with our larger truck delivery service, it really allows the right service for the right customer."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "David Flitman",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. \n Let's turn to today's agenda. I'll start by sharing the progress we've made executing on our strategy and several key achievements from the first quarter, which set us up for a strong year ahead. I will then hand it over to Dirk to review our first quarter financial results and our fiscal 2024 guidance. \n Following a slower start to the year due to adverse weather and labor disruptions, our first quarter earnings came in as expected. The continued execution of our strategy and long-range plan resulted in adjusted EBITDA of $356 million, representing approximately 6% growth. \n As we highlighted in February, adjusted EBITDA was negatively impacted by approximately $20 million from increased cost to serve our customers and volume headwinds from labor disruption and weather-related issues in January. Of the $20 million impact, approximately $15 million was incremental operating expense to support the business during the labor disruption. \n Excluding this negative impact, our underlying adjusted EBITDA growth was approximately 12%, and we remain confident in achieving our full year guidance. This performance demonstrates the strength of our business model, the commitment of our 30,000 hard-working associates and our ability to win in any environment. \n Total case growth was 4.2% for the quarter with share gains continuing in target customer types, and our independent case volume grew 4.6%. In fact, for independent restaurants, our share gains accelerated from the fourth quarter to the first quarter as we grew share for the 12th consecutive quarter. \n In early April, we closed on our previously announced acquisition of IWC Food Service, and we are excited to have them on our team. As a result of deploying capital towards our tuck-in M&A strategy, we did not purchase a significant number of shares in the first quarter. However, we do plan to lean in on share repurchases more aggressively through the balance of this year. \n Despite a slight year-over-year decrease in restaurant foot traffic, broadliners increased their volume within the overall foodservice distribution channel, as measured by Circana, underscoring the resilience of our industry. Our team captured profitable market share with our target customer types and improved profitability as we remain focused on controlling the outcomes that we can control. \n Furthermore, we continue to identify cost savings, including streamlining administrative processes and costs. More specifically, cost actions we have taken to date are expected to generate more than $55 million in expense savings for 2024 and $75 million on an annualized run rate. We are pursuing additional operating expense and cost of goods actions to drive further savings in 2025 and beyond. I have confidence in our ability to drive growth and profitability well into the future. We are controlling what we can control to generate long-term shareholder value. \n Turning to Slide 4. As a reminder, our team's work is guided by 4 strategic pillars, and I will discuss our progress on each of them over the next few slides. \n Moving to Slide 5, our first pillar is culture. Keeping our associates safe is a key part of our culture. And during the first quarter, our injury and accident rates were 30% better than the prior year. And importantly, these results were our best since 2020. Despite our recent success, there is still significant room for improvement to reach our goal of 0 injuries. \n We are excited about our Spring Scoop where we launched 26 new products to help our customers offer high-quality, innovative and labor-saving products on our menus. As part of this Scoop, we introduced Serve You, including 20 new products within a portfolio of more than 3,000 products of delicious, plant-forward, gluten-free and clean labels, such as our Chef's Line Organic Purple Rice and Quinoa Blend. Importantly, since the introduction of our popular Scoop program 12 years ago, nearly 75% of the products that have been launched are still sold today. \n Finally, we are increasing our commitment to 3 strategic community giving areas: hunger relief, culinary education and disaster relief. Our increased investment of $2 million in 2024 is part of our Helping Communities Make It program, which provides nourishment and opportunity to the communities we serve and builds on our 2023 investment of more than $12 million. \n Turning to Slide 6, our second pillar, service. Providing best-in-class delivery and a high-quality service experience to our customers is essential to our growth and our overall success. The investments we are making and operational rigor in modernizing our technology platforms continue to pay off. We exited the first quarter quite pleased with the progress that we made on both on-time delivery and service levels to customers, which continued to show year-over-year and sequential improvement. \n We also recently completed an 18-month initiative in our replenishment organization. This program standardized and improved the processes and technology we use as we strive to deliver best-in-class service levels to our customers. This work resulted in our delivered as ordered Net Promoter Score improving by 7 percentage points while yielding $15 million in annualized operating expense savings and $120 million in working capital reduction. \n We continue to build on the routing efficiency gains that we delivered in 2023, and we remain focused on driving further improvement in on-time deliveries. In fact, our cases per mile were a company record in February and March. Furthermore, our routing initiative delivered a 4% improvement in cases per mile during the quarter compared to the first quarter of 2023 in a 2-year stack improvement of 12%. Our team's focus on this important work is making a difference for our customers and for US Foods. \n Taking this work a step further, we extended our Descartes routing deployment to 4 additional markets during the first quarter, building upon the 2 markets we piloted late last year that are now fully deployed. In the markets where Descartes is live, we are compounding further [ bookings ] in our routing effectiveness. For example, in deployed markets, we are already seeing this technology produce an incremental 2% improvement in cases per mile, which we expect will continue to accelerate. We are confident that we have the right plan in place to successfully implement this technology across the company by mid-2025. \n And we continue to further transform our customer experience through our differentiated MOXe digital solutions platform. MOXe has been fully embedded with our independent restaurant business. As customers move to MOXe, they buy 10% more, are more profitable and stick with us longer. We have migrated over 65% of our national chain business with full deployment anticipated in the second half of 2024. MOXe also has a new Spanish translation feature, further enhancing the user experience. We are excited to share the MOXe road map and growth plans for this digital platform during our upcoming Investor Day.  \n Let's now turn to our growth pillar on Slide 7. We remain focused on accelerating profitable growth and gaining market share with our target customer types. We are on track to achieve our 1.5x market growth goal for restaurants for the full year, driven by faster growth with independents. Our 4.6% independent case growth resulted in an acceleration of share gains from the fourth quarter, again, marking our 12th consecutive quarter of market share gains.  \n Our Pronto small truck delivery service is a true competitive differentiator and continues to gain traction with our customers. Through this platform, we are able to offer our customers significant benefits, including flexibility of delivery, which allows us to compete with local and specialty competitors. At the end of the first quarter, we were live in 36 markets and expect to add 5 additional markets in 2024. Pronto is on track to deliver approximately $600 million of annualized sales this year with plenty of runway ahead. \n We also recently launched what we are calling Pronto Penetration in 2 markets, which, for the first time, extends the Pronto service to existing independent customers who will be able to order on [ non-routed ] days. Once fully implemented, this new offering is expected to further increase our share of wallet with our existing customer base. \n Last quarter, I provided you with an update on our sales compensation plan. As you'll recall, the variable components of our plan are now more meaningful for our sellers. While it's only been 1 quarter, our plan is working as designed. Many of our sellers are exceeding their targets and receiving higher compensation for that profitable growth. \n For example, one of our sellers in South Carolina grew cases 50% faster than the fourth quarter, exceeded his target and earned a 10% compensation increase. And for those who are not growing as fast with our new targets, we believe they will rebound in the quarters ahead. \n Turning to Slide 8, our profit pillar. Adjusted gross profit grew nearly 7% in the first quarter to $1.5 billion. We drove further progress on initiatives such as cost of goods sold by collaborating with additional vendors. In total, we have addressed 60% of our COGS, which has translated into approximately $120 million in savings over the past 12 months. We have initiated the work to address the remaining 40% of our spend this year. \n We are also continuing to make progress on growing our independent restaurant private label brands, which increased 90 basis points year-over-year to over 52%. Increasing private label penetration remains a significant opportunity for US Foods. We believe we can [ add ] customer value through our innovative and high-quality products at a competitive price while also improving our margins. \n Finally, our delivery productivity improved 4% over the prior year, and we continue to improve our overall supply chain productivity through turnover reduction, flexible scheduling and process standardization. The 4% delivery productivity is in line with our goal of 3% to 5% annual gains to offset wage inflation. This productivity improvement is additive to the operating expense reduction I spoke about earlier.  \n Before I hand it over to Dirk, I would like to acknowledge 2 recent winners of our first-ever CEO awards: [ Mark Schuster ], Warehouse Manager; and [ Timothy Gephart ], [ Data ] Warehouse Supervisor at our culinary equipment and supply business in Allentown, Pennsylvania. This distribution center celebrated 11 years of injury-free operations last year. \n During that time, they nearly doubled the cases shipped while improving productivity by approximately 50%. Mark and Tim made safety a top priority for regular training programs and team huddles to ensure that the entire team took personal accountability for safety. Thanks, Mark and Tim, for your outstanding leadership. \n As we approach Memorial Day, I want to thank all of our veterans for their service, including our associates who have served our great country. On this Memorial Day, we pay tribute to those who have served our country and made the ultimate sacrifice. Each day, we have the privilege to enjoy our freedom because of their fearless service. As you spend time with your loved ones on this holiday, please join me in remembering the heroes who courageously gave their lives for our country and for our freedom.  \n Let me now turn the call over to Dirk to discuss our first quarter results and our 2024 guidance. Thanks, Dirk. Looking ahead, we remain intensely focused on executing our strategy, and we'll maintain our disciplined approach to capital deployment to drive long-term shareholder value. \n We see tremendous opportunities ahead as we focus on what we can control and continue to deliver on our commitments regardless of the operating environment. Our future is promising, and I am highly confident in our ability to continue to outpace industry growth over the long term and to leverage that growth effectively to the bottom line. \n Finally, we are excited about our upcoming Investor Day on June 5, where we will share our new long-range plan targets and why we believe we have the right strategy and the best associates in the business to execute that plan. We hope you can join us here at our company headquarters or via the webcast.  \n With that, Krista, please open up the call for questions. Yes. So look, I think it's well documented that there have been some foot traffic challenges in the industry. But as I continue to say to you all and I say to our team internally, we have so much opportunity to continue to focus on the things we can control like gaining profitable market share. \n And look, I couldn't be more pleased or proud of our team on the performance in the first quarter. Obviously, the well-documented weather situation was out there. On top of that, we had a labor disruption that lasted for the majority of the month of January. And still, we outperformed the market, accelerated share gains. And so that is what gives me confidence in our ability to continue to outpace the market growth regardless of what's going on in the world around us. \n And then secondly, you heard a lot this morning from both me and Dirk about our continued work around self-help, and there's so much of that going on. And again, with all the distraction we had in January, our team's ability to stay focused and put out the productivity numbers that we talked about here this morning just gives me great confidence that, that momentum will continue. We have a strong pipeline of initiatives, as you heard, and we're continuing to stay focused. Thanks a lot, Alex. Yes, I think in that mid-single-digit range, John, kind of as you framed it is probably the right trajectory. We were relatively flattish in January year-over-year, which I thought was a win for the team given the challenges that we had and then it accelerated from there. As we flipped into the second quarter, it's roughly on par with the way we exited the first quarter. \n And so, yes, the foot traffic is a challenge, but our ability to generate new business is key to our success. Penetration is a challenge just with the foot traffic piece of it, but we also have an opportunity to shore up lost business, which hasn't been a problem for us, but there's always opportunity to do a better job there. So that combination of net new account generation, that difference between new accounts and shoring up the loss is where our team stays focused and, obviously, continue to look for every penetration opportunity we can. \n You heard me talk this morning about the Pronto Penetration opportunity. That's new for us. We're excited about it to take that offering to our existing customer base. And we think that's going to mean good things on the penetration front as we ramp that up across the company. Well, I think you're thinking about it right, the 40% won't likely be as large as the 60% just to size that a little bit for you, John. But there is a lot to do going forward. And to your point, around cycling back, I think there'll be existing -- more momentum than we've had on the existing side. And look, the beauty is, in a month, we're going to lay all this out for you at our Investor Day on June 5 and talk about that contribution and where it comes from over the next 3-year time horizon. Well, 2 I'd point to: one, I commented on and the other one, I didn't. But the work that we've done around replenishment yield is $15 million of expense reduction. That's been an ongoing piece of work. I think there's likely still more to come there as we ramp up technology in that part of the business. And so we're excited about that. The team has worked hard to achieve the numbers that I spoke about. \n But importantly, also, Brian, you've heard me talk over the course of the last year about shifting our focus and our resource back into the field given the responsibility to the P&L owners and unwinding a bit of the centralization that has been done over the company over a number of years. \n And with that move back to the field comes efficiency gains. I'm a firm believer that the folks that own the P&L are going to determine whether they need the headcount, whether it's adding value or not. You've seen some of that initially pop out from the work that we've done here, particularly over the last 6 months, and there's likely more to come on that journey as well. Yes. I think let me take hospitality first. We're a little over-indexed in our hospitality mix around lodging. I think that was challenged a bit with same-store sales and foot traffic. Even in spring break, we didn't see the uplift that you normally see. I think there's probably some more international travel that's happened this spring break versus prior years coming out of COVID and things like that going on.  \n But look, we've got line of sight to a very strong pipeline and not just in health care and hospitality, but also in our independent business, and we're in the process of ramping up that business here in the second quarter. And that's what I point to when I shared the confidence in the earlier question about the momentum continuing here, really good progress, lots of momentum, strong pipeline that we expect to convert in the second quarter and beyond here. Thank you. Yes. And Ed, on the pipeline, it remains strong. We'll give a little bit more color on that at Investor Day here coming up on June 5. But I will just reinforce a couple of points that I've always said around M&A. First of all, I think it can be an accretive add to the business for the right deals with the right management teams at the right time, but we don't need to do any of them. And so we're not going to force anything, and we're not going to overpay and we haven't in the 3 deals that we've done. \n And to your point around share repurchases, look, we've done 3 deals here in less than 12 months. We've got some integration work ahead of us. You'll likely see us take a breath around M&A here for a little bit and lean in harder to share repurchases as the year progresses, as we said in the script. So first of all, I'll take the second part of your question, no, I don't think it will be a headwind at all, Jake. We reiterated last call and I'll say it again, we believe low- to mid-single-digit addition to our sales force on an ongoing basis is the right number. We've got that built into our algorithm and the productivity around that and the time it takes new hires to ramp. \n I think I'd point to a couple of things maybe relative to others. First of all, our digital platform and the efficiency gains that, that enables for our sales force and the focus it allows them to have on the customer in selling our great products and penetrating that business and, importantly, helping our customers solve problems. So I would point to MOXe and the advent of that as a real productivity help for our sales force. \n And the other one is our team-based selling, which we've been at longer than others. And for a very long time, that's part and parcel to how we go to market. And that also affords our territory managers with efficiency gains because of the help and support that they get from the specialists and the restaurant operation consultants on a day-to-day basis in front of the customer. So we feel really good about it. I don't think there will be any headwind at all in our ability to drive growth based on our algorithm. Thank you. Yes. So first of all, we've been ramping up Pronto over the last 18 to 24 months. And so we've progressively gotten increased benefit and felt like it was time to disclose the importance of that business to our total, and that's why we quantified the $600 million we anticipate this year. \n But I tried to make that distinction, and let me be clear, up until now, Kelly, Pronto was only focused on attracting new customers. We had not deployed that to our existing customer base until we were confident in the model and we knew that we had all the bugs worked out in that model. And so now when we go to Pronto Penetration, we are offering that to existing customers on their nonstandard routed days. We think that will enable us to continue to penetrate those accounts, give our customers less reason to go to specialty and other suppliers to get their needs met. \n So we're excited about not only the ability to continue to attract new customers through Pronto, but now importantly, penetrating our existing customers further. So more to come on that, but we're really excited about the model and what it's meant so far and where we can take it. Yes. This is why I'm not an economist, Jeff, but I'll give you a perspective, for sure. I think it's more around the challenges that the consumer has, given what's happened around inflation over the past few years, and they're thoughtful about how they spend their disposable income. And so I think that's really driving a lot of the foot traffic challenges we've seen. Certainly, our customers have experienced inflation over the same period of time, and those challenges persist. \n I really think at the root of it is a consumer issue. I do think -- and I believe this long-term trend will continue. I think independents will win over chains. And I think the foot traffic is certainly reflecting that, not that independents don't have challenges, just the same, they do, but I just think their model is more in line with the big culinary desires and the experiential dining that the consumer is looking for. So we're bullish on independents over the long term. And whatever short-term bumps in the road there may be, we think they're going to win. Yes. I think roughly that number is in line, maybe plus or minus, but there's been a strong rebound, obviously, from the pandemic and it has thereof. But I do still think there's -- while it's increased quite a bit, I still think the count total was still down versus pre-pandemic levels, which obviously keeps things very competitive in the industry and [ customers ] increasingly challenged to attract folks into the restaurants, but probably still down a little bit from pre-pandemic levels. Mark, so we have seen CHEF'STORE return to case growth, which has been encouraging. As you remember, we talked about with some of the ERP and related challenges from last year. I would say, so overall, the fact that if the business is back growing, we are encouraged by that. And our focus is to continue to work through and accelerate that growth over time. And we're continuing to add stores with 5 stores planned for this year, and it does play a niche in the overall market for us, especially that customer base that you're talking about as well as fill-ins. No, not really. Most of our associates are paid well above that, so a pretty limited impact from our perspective. I'd say from an overall customer volume, it's pretty early to tell and really talk much about what that may do to overall demand more broadly. Yes. I think, Peter, it's a combination of factors, the compensation being one that I think will be a meaningful one for us going forward. So I'm very excited to see that increase. But as we said, coming out of the pandemic, the manufacturers were challenged to supply those products for us. \n And it's just really been over the last couple of quarters that we've gotten the confidence of the sales force back to go lean into those products more aggressively than they have over the past few years. And we had a good performance in the fourth quarter. Excited to see us -- our penetration up over 52% in the first quarter. And as I've said before, I don't really see any near-term ceiling for that, and I feel like the momentum will continue to build on our exclusive brands. Yes, I think that's roughly a good figure to use going forward. And our goal is to get our customers -- the new customer onto that platform immediately, if not sooner, once we get into the account because of all the things that we've talked about here in terms of benefits both for the customer and for the productivity of our sales force. And so that's why we disclosed that figure. I think that's a solid one to think about going forward. That was specific to independents, that comment. Overall, we did see some stronger case growth just more broadly through the quarter, but that comment was geared to independents. Yes. As we said, it was a combination of both. That was kind of the net impact in the month of January where we had the labor disruptions for about 3 weeks of the month overlapping the weather challenges that everyone experienced. Yes. The root of it is we're helping ourselves in terms of efficiency of getting the products to the customer. But importantly, there is a very positive customer impact because as we take miles out of our system to get the products from our distribution centers to the customers, we're more likely to be on time and show up when the customer has requested it. So that -- there's a double benefit there. So it very much impacts the customer in a positive way. And so we're excited about continuing that work. It's early days. We'll have more to say about that through the course of time. We're just -- we're really getting started with that, Fred. And so we're excited about it. We think it's got a large potential, but it is very early days there. I think we've got great product line that falls on right on top of the line of the specialty suppliers. What this gives us, Rahul, is the ability to actually get that product in a more timely fashion to the customers versus our maybe couple deliveries or standard deliveries per week. \n We can deliver those products every day now with Pronto at whatever frequency the customer needs it. And obviously, delivering it on the smaller trucks gets us into some of the more urban tight areas that are more challenging to take a larger vehicle into. So I think there's good upside there and allows us to compete in a way that we haven't been able to prior to Pronto. Thank you, Krista, and thanks for joining us today. We're excited about the underlying momentum that the business has and certainly the focus of our 30,000 associates on continuing to drive that momentum. We look forward to seeing many of you at our June 5 Investor Day. Have a great week. Thanks a lot."
